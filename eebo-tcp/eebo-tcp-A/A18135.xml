         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In whose commendation I shall not neede to vse any long processe of woordes, for he can so well speak for himself, and answere to the opinion men haue a long time conceiued of him, that whatsoeuer I shoulde write therein, were but labour in waste, and rather a diminishing, then a setting foorth of his woorthinesse, and a great deale better it were to passe it ouer with silence, then to vse briefenesse.

as none, but a noble yonge Gentleman, and trayned vp all his life time in Court, and of worthie qualities, is meete to receiue and enterteine so worthy a Courtier, that like maye felowship and gete estimation with his like, I do dedicate him vnto your good lorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that through your meanes, and vnder your patronage he maye be commune to a greate meany. And this do I not, for that I suppose you stande in neede of any of his instructions, but partly because you may see him confirme with reason the Courtly facions, comely exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, and noble vertues, that vnawares haue from time to time crept in to you, and already with practise and learning taken custome in you: And partly to gete him the more aucthoritie and credite throughe so honorable a Patrone. For no doubt, if you beseene willingly to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, other yonge and Courtly Gentlemen will not shonn hys company: And so both he shall gete him the reputation now here in Englande which he hath had a good while since beyonde the sea, in Italy, Spaine and Fraunce, and I shal thinke my smal trauayle wel imployed and sufficiently recompensed. The honour and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that your noble Auncestours shewed Castilio the maker, whan he was in this realme to be installed knight of the Order for the Duke his Maister, was not so muche as presently both he, and this his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dywoorke shall receiue of you.

Therfore for leesinge time to bestowe that of dutye I ought vpon the memorye of so excellent a Ladye, and of the rest that are no more in lief, prouoked also by the ieopardye of the booke, I haue made him to be imprinted, and setforth in such sort, as the shortnes of time hath serued me. And bicause you had no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queintance, neither with the Dutches, nor with any of the rest that are dead, sauing only with Duke Iulian, and with the Cardinal of S.

And wher I haue enforced my self to setfurth together with the comunication the propreties &amp; condicions of such as are named in it, I confess I haue not only not fully expressed, but not somuch as touched the vertues of the

               </note> I will not let to say, for all Boccaccio was of a fine witt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those times, and in some part writt with great aduisement and diligence: yet did he write much better whan he lett him self be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with witt and his owne naturall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without anie other maner studie or regarde to polish his writinges, then whan with al tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and bent studye he enforced him self to be most fine and eloquent. For his verie fauourers affirme that in his own matters he was far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in iudgement, litle regarding such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as haue gotten him a name, and greatlye esteaminge that is nothing woorth. Had I then folowed that trade of writing which is blamed in him by such as praise him in the rest, I could not haue eschewed the verye same reprooffes that are laied to Boccaccio himself as touching this. And I had deserued somuch the more, for



<pb facs="tcp:22866:9"/>
that his errour was then, in beleauyng he did well, and mine should be nowe, in knowinge I do amisse. Again if I had folowed that trade which is reckened of many to be good, and was litle regarded of him, I should appeere in folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing it to disagree from the iudgement of him whom I folowed: the which thing (in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) were an inconuenience. And beeside yf this respect had not moued me, I could not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe him in the matter, forsomuch as he neuer wrott any thing in treatise like vnto these boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of the Courtier: And in the tunge, I ought not in mine aduise, bicause the force or rule of speach doeth consist more in vse, then in anye thinge els: and it is alwayes a vice to vse woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that are not in commune speach. Therfore it was not meete I should haue vsed many that are in Boccaccio, which in his time were vsed, and now are out of vse emonge the Tuscanes them selues. Neyther would I binde my self to the maner of the Tuscane tunge in vse nowe a dayes, bicause the practising emonge sundrye Nations, hath alwayes bene of force to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from one to an other (in a maner) as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaundise, so also new woordes,<note place="margin">

               </note> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward remaine or decaye, according as they are admitted by custome or refused. And this beside the record of auntient writers, is to be euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seene in Boccaccio, in whom there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie woordes French, Spanish, and prouincial,



<pb facs="tcp:22866:10"/>
and some perhappes not well vnderstood of the Tuscanes in these dayes, that whoso woulde pick them out, should make the booke much the lesser. And bicause (in mine opinion) the kinde of speach of the other noble Cities of Italy, where there resorte men of wisdome, vnderstandinge and eloquence, which practise great matters of gouernment of states, of letters, armes, and diuerse affayres, ought not altogether to be neglected for the woordes whiche in these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are vsed in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune speach: I suppose that they maye be vsed welinough, writing such as haue a grace and comlynesse in the pronunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and communly counted good and of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre signification, though they be not Tuscane, and haue also their origion out of Italy. Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side this in Tuscane they vse many woordes cleane corrupte from the Latin,<note place="margin">

Therfore I thinke I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no errour at all. Yf in writing I haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed any of these, and rather taken the wholl and pure woord of mine owne Countrey, then the corrupt &amp; mangled of an other. Neyther doeth that rule seeme good vnto me, where many say y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vulgar tung, the lesse it is like vnto the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,



<pb facs="tcp:22866:10"/>
the more beawtiful it is: And I can not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue why more authoritie should consist in one custome of speach, then in an other. For if Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane be sufficient to authorise corrupt &amp; mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Latin woordes, and to geue them so greate a grace, that mangled in such sort euerye man may vse them for good (the which no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth) should not Lumbardy or any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey haue the authoritye to allow the very La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin woordes that be pure, sounde, propre and not broken in any part so, but they may be well borne? And assuredly as it may be called a rash presumption to take in hand to forge new wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des, or to set vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde in spite of custome: So is it no lesse, to take in hande against the force of the same custome to bring to naught, and (as it were) to burye aliue such as haue lasted nowe many yeeres, &amp; haue ben defended from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the time with the shield of vse, &amp; haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued their estimation and dignitye, whan in the warres and turmoiles of Italy, alterations were brought vp both of the tunge, buildinges, garmentes and maners. And beeside the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the matter, it seemeth to be (as it were) a certein wickednesse.

And I beleaue it ought not to be imputed vnto me for an errour, that I haue chosen to make my self rather knowen for a Lumbard, in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Lumbard, then for no Tuscan, in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of tomuch Tuscan. Bicause I wil not do as Theophrastus did,<note place="margin">

But bycause in thys point there is sufficyent talke in the first booke, I will make no more a do. And to auoid al contention I confesse to my faultfinders, that I haue no knowleage in this their Tuscan tunge so hard and secrete: and I say that I haue written it in mine owne, and as I speak, &amp; vnto such as speake as I speake: and so I trust I haue offended no man. For I beleaue it is forbed no man that is, to wryte &amp; speake in his owne tunge, neyther is anye man bound to reade or heare that contenteth hym not. Therfore if they will not reade my Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, they shall offende me nothing at all.

thing to teach that can not be learned. To these men I answere, I am content, to err with Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Xenophon, and M. Tullius, leauing apart the disputing of the intelligible world and of the Ideas or imagined fourmes: in which nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as (according to that opinion) the Idea or figure conceyued in imagination of a perfect commune weale, and of a perfect king, and of a perfect Oratour are conteined: So is it also of a perfect Courtier. To the image wherof if my power could not draw nigh in stile, so much the lesse peynes shall Courtiers haue to drawe nigh in effect to the ende and marke that I in writing haue set beefore them. And if with all this they can not compasse that perfection, such as it is, which I haue endeuoured to expresse, he that cummeth nighest shall be the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: As emong many Archers that shute at one marke, where none of them hitteth the pinn, he that is nighest is out of doubt better then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest. Some again say that my meaning was to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion my self, perswading my self that all suche qualities as I appoint to the Courtier are in me. Unto these men I will not cleane deny that I haue attempted all that my mynde is the Courtier shoulde haue knowleage in. And I thinke who so hath not the knowleage of the thinges intreated vpon in this booke, how lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned so euer he be, he can full il write them. But I am not of so sclender a iudgment in knowing

The defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therfore of these accusations &amp; peraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture of many mo, I leaue for this once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the iudgement of the commune opinion: bicause for the most part the multy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, though they haue no perfect knowleage, yet do they feele by the instinct of nature a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein sauour of good and ill, and can geue none other reason for it: One tasteth and taketh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, an other refuseth &amp; is against his stomake.</p>
            <p>Therfore if the booke shall generally please, I wil count him good, and think that he ought to liue: But if he shall displease, I will count him naught, and beleaue that the memorye of him shall soone perish. And if for all this mine accusers will not be satisfied with this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune iudgemente, let them content them selues with the iudgement of time, which at length discouereth the priuie faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of euery thing: And bicause it is father to truth and a iudge without passion, it accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth euermore to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce true sentence of the life or death of writynges.</p>

Againe on the other syde, to vndertake an enterpryse whiche I do not knowe my selfe able to brynge to an end, I iudged it vncomely for him that wayeth due reproofes so much as they oughte to be wayed.

Therfore it is manifestlye to be descerned, that vse hath greater force then reason, to brynge vp neweinuentions emonge vs, and to abolishe the olde, of the whiche who so goeth about to iudge the perfection, is often tymes deceyued.

his putting to flyght sundrye tymes wyth a small numbre, verie greate and puissaunte armyes, and neuer susteined losse in any conflict: So that we may, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause, compare hym to manye famous men of olde time. This man emong his other deedes praisworthy, in the hard &amp; sharpe situation of <hi>Vrbin</hi> buylt a Palaice, to the opinion of many men,<note place="margin">The palaice of Urbin.</note> the fayrest that was to be founde in all <hi>Italy,</hi> and so fornished it with euerye necessary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement belonging therto, that it appeared not a palaice, but a Citye in fourme of a palaice, and that not onelye with ordinarie matters, as Siluer plate, hanginges for chambers of verye riche cloth of golde, of silke and other like, but also for sightlynesse: and to decke it out withall, placed there a wonderous number of auncyent ymages of marble and mettall, verye excellente peinctinges and instrumentes of musycke of all sortes, and nothinge would he haue there but what was moste rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. To this with verye great charges he gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a great number of most excellent and rare bookes, in Greke, Latin and Hebrue, the which all he garnished wyth golde and syluer, esteaming this to be the chieffest ornament of his great palaice. This duke then folowing the course of nature when he was .lxv. yeares of age, as he had liued, so did he end his lief with glorye.

So that the opinyon of men was, that of all duke <hi>Friderickes</hi> notable dedes there was none greater then that he begat suche a son.

<pb facs="tcp:22866:15"/>
that before duke <hi>Guidubaldo</hi> was .xx. yeares of age, he fell sicke of the gout, the which encreasinge vppon him wyth most bitter paynes, in a short tyme so nummed hym of all hys members,<note place="margin">Troubled with the goute.</note> that he coulde neyther stande on foote nor moue hymselfe. And in this maner was one of the beste fauoured and towardlyest personages in the world defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and marred in his greene age. And beside, not satisfyed with thys, fortune was so contrarye to him in all his pourposes, that verye sildome he brought to passe any thynge to hys minde. And for all he had in him moste wise counsayle, and an inuincible courage, yet it seemed that whatsoeuer he tooke in hande bothe in feates of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and in euerye other thynge small or greate,<note place="margin">His ill lucke.</note> it came alwayes to yll successe.

But wyth a boulde stomake despising her stormes, lyued wyth great dignytye and estimation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge all men: in sickenesse, as one that was sounde, and in aduersitye, as one that was most fortunate. So that for all he was thus diseased in his bodye, he serued in time of warre wyth moste honourable enterteinmente vnder the most famous kinges of <hi>Naples,</hi>

And beside this, the greatnesse of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage so quickened hym, that where he was not in case with hys personne to practise the feates of Chiualrye, as he had done longe before, yet dyd he take verye great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte to behoulde them in other men, and with his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des sometyme correctinge, and otherwhyle praysinge euerye man accordynge to hys desertes, he declared euy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlye howe greate a iudgement he hadde in those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And vpon this at Tylt, at Tourneye, in rydynge, in playinge at all sortes of weapon, also in inuenting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyces, in pastymes, in musicke, fynallye in all exercises meete for noble Gentilmen, euerye manne stryued to showe hymselfe suche a one, as myght deserue to bee iudged woorthye of so noble an assemblye. Therfore were all the houres of the daye deuyded into honourable and pleasaunt exercyses, aswell of the bodye as of the mynde. But because the Duke vsed continuallye, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his infirmytye, soone after supper to go to his rest, euerye man ordinarelye,<note place="margin">Elizabeth gonzaga dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse of Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin.</note> at that houre drewe where the Dutchesse was, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Gonzaga.</hi> Where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so continuallye was the Lady <hi>Emilia Pia,</hi> who for that she was endowed with so liuelye a wytt and iudgement as you knowe, seemed the maistresse and ringe leader of all the companye,<note place="margin">L.

There was then to be hearde pleasaunte communication and merye conceytes, and in euery mannes countenaunce a manne myght per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue peyncted a louynge iocoundenesse.

Neither was there anye that thought it not the greatest pleasure he coulde haue in the worlde, to please her, and the greatest griefe to offende her. For this respecte were there most honest condicions coupled with wonderous greate libertye, and deuises of pastimes and laughinge matters tempred in her sight, besyde most wyttye iestes, with so comelye and graue a maiesty, that the verye sober moode and greatnesse that dyd knyt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the actes, woordes and gestures of the Dutchesse in iesting and laughynge, made them also that had neuer seene her in their lief before, to count her a verye greate Ladye. And all that came in her presence hauyng this respect fyred in their breast, it seemed she had made them to her becke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that euery man enforced himself to folowe this trade, takynge (as it were) a rule and enample of faire condicions at the presence of so greate and so vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Lady.

in the tender breast of a woman, in companye wyth syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler beawtye, there can dwell wysdome, and stoutenes of courage, and all other vertues that in graue men them selues are most seldome. But leauynge this apart, I say that the maner of all the Gentilmen in the house was immedyatelye after supper to assemble together where the dutchesse was. Where emonge other recreations, musicke and dauncynge, whiche they vsed contynuallye, sometyme they propounded feate questions, otherwhyle they inuented certayne wytty sportes and pastimes, at the deuyse sometyme of one sometyme of an other, in the whych vnder sundrye couertes, often tymes the standers bye opened subtylly theyr imaginations vnto whom they thought beste. At other tymes there arrose other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of diuers matters, or els iestinges with prompt inuentions. Manye tymes they fell into pourposes, as we nowe a dayes terme them, where in thys kynde of talke &amp; debating of matters,<note place="margin">Noble perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages in the Court of Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin.</note> there was wonderous great pleasure on all sydes: Because (as I haue sayde) the house was replenyshed wyth most noble wyttes. Emonge whych (as you knowe) were moste famous the Lord <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian, Fregoso,</hi> Sir <hi>Friderick</hi> his brother the <hi>L. Iulian de Medicis, M. Peter Bembo, the L.

Beesyde these there were manye that for all ordinarilye they dwelled not there, yet spent they most of their tyme there, as, <hi>M. Bernard Bibiena, Vnico Aretino, Iohnchristopher Romano, Peter Mount, Therpander, M.

After pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the ii. had with his owne presence by the ayde of the Frenchmen brought <hi>Bolonia</hi> to the obedyence of the Apostolyke Sea again, in the yeare MDvi. in hys re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tourn

So that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the Pope, all the Cardinalles and other Courtyers thought themselues throughly satisfied.

And that shall be to haue euery man, as nigh as he can, propounde a deuyse not yet hearde of, then shall we chuse out such a one as shall be thought meete to be taken in hande in this companye. And after she had thus spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, she tourned her vnto the <hi>L. Gaspar Pallauicin,</hi> willynge him to propounde his: who immediatlye made answere:



<pb facs="tcp:22866:18"/>
But first (madam) you must beeginne to propound yours. Then saide the <hi>L. Emilia</hi>: I haue alreadye done. But your grace must commaunde hym (Madam) to be obedient. Then the Dutchesse laughynge to thintent (quoth she) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man shal obey you, I make you my deputy, and giue vnto you all mine aucthority. It is surely a great matter, aunswered the <hi>L.

Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pars deuise.</note> and will speake of that I am nowe charged withall, and thus I beginne. Mine oppinion is, that oure mindes, as in other thinges, so also in louynge are diuerse in iudgemente, and therefore it chaunceth often tymes, that the thynge whyche is most acceptable vnto one, is most abhorred of an other. Yet for all that they alwayes agree in that euerye man counteth most deere the wight beloued. So that many times the ouermuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in louers doth so deceiue their iudgemente, that they weene the person whom they loue, to be so garnished wyth all excellent vertues and wythout faulte, that he hath no peere in the worlde But bycause the nature of man doth not admytte suche full perfectyons, and there is no mann that hath not some defaulte or want in hym, it can not be sayde that suche as these be are not decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that the louer doeth not become blynde as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge the beloued. I would therefore oure pastyme should be thys nyghte to haue euerye manne open what vertues he would principally the persone he loueth should be indowed with all. And seeyng it is so necessarilye that we all haue some spotte, what vyce he woulde also haue in hym: to see who can fynde out most prayse woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye and manlye vertues, and most tollerable vyces, that shoulde be least hurtefull bothe to hym that loueth, and to the wyghte beloued.

to kyndle in my breast, I haue by and by enforced my self with all dyligence to quenche it, not for anye hatred that I haue conceyued agaynst women (as these Ladyes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) but for myne owne health. On the other side, I haue knowen some other cleane contrarye to these sorowfull, whiche do not onelye auaunce and content theymselues with the cherefull lookes, louinge woordes, and sweete countenances of their ladies, but also sauce their sorowes with sweetenesse, so that they count the debates, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and the disdeignes of them, most sweete.

Therefore would I oure pastyme were this nyght to haue euerye manne shew, where there muste be a dysdeygne againste hym in the person beloued, what the cause should be that should make the persone conceiue thys disdeygne.

they are the more &amp; the lesse bitter according to the cause wherof they arrise.

And me thought that the greatest sorowe I felt was to suffer wythout deseruyng, and to sustayne this affliction, not for any offence of mine, but for the small loue that was in her. At other times I saw her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deignefull for some ouersight of mine, and knew that her anger proceaded of myne offence, and at that instante I iudged the former ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For where there are two in a noble mans house which at the first haue geuen no proofe of themselues with woorkes good or bad,<note place="margin">Noblenes of birthe in esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macion with all men.</note> assoone as it is knowen that the one is a gentleman borne, and the other not, the vnnoble shall be muche lesse estemed with euerye manne, then the gentleman,<note place="margin">The imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuinges of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde with expectacion.</note> and he muste with much tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and long time imprint in mennes heades a good op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of himselfe, whiche the other shal geat in a moment, and onely for that he is a gentleman: and howe waightye these imprintinges are euery man may easily iudge. For, to speake of our selues: we haue seen menne come to thys house, whiche for all they were fooles and dulwitted, yet had they a report through all Italye of great Courtyers, &amp; though at length they were discouered and knowen, yet manye daies did thei beguyle vs, and mainteyned in oure myndes that oppinion of themselues, whiche at the fyrste they found there imprinted, although they wrought accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to their small skil.

You see then of what importance this first imprinting is, and howe he ought to endeuoure himself to get it good in princes, if he entende to be set by, and to purchase him the name of a good Courtyer.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions, in doing the dedes in euerie time and place: for it is not for him to feint at any time in this behalfe without a wonderous reproche.<note place="margin">That he take no foile.</note> And euen as in women honestye once stained dothe neuer retourne againe to the former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: So the fame of a gentleman that carieth weapon, yf it once take a foile in any litle point through dastardlines or any other reproche, doeth euermore continue shameful in the worlde and full of ignoraunce. Therefore the more excellent our Courtyer shalbe in this arte, the more shall he bee worthy praise: albeit I iudge not necessarye in hym so perfect a knowledge of thynges and other qualities y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is requisite in a capitaine. But because this is ouerlarge a scope of matters, wee wyll holde oure selues contented (as wee haue sayde) with the vprightnesse of a well mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning minde, &amp; with an inuincible courage, and that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies shew himself such a one: for many times me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage are sooner knowen in small matters then in greate.

I agree well that he, whiche in praising himselfe falleth not into errour, nor purchaseth himself lothsomenes or hatred of the hearers, is moste discrete: and beside the praises whiche he geueth himselfe, deserueth the same of other men also, because it is a very harde matter.

And therfore in speache, whiche as soone as the sonne is pronounced vanisheth a way, peraduenture somthinges are more to be borne withall, then in writinge.

But because a great argument that a man vnderstandeth a thinge, is the vnderstanding that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In <hi>Salust,</hi> in <hi>Cesar,</hi> in <hi>Varro,</hi> &amp; in other good writers, there are founde some termes applyed otherwise then <hi>Cicero</hi> applyeth them, and both the one and the other doeth welinough.

And though peincting be a diuerse matter from caruing, yet do they both arise of one self fountayne (namelye) of a good patterne.<note place="margin">Auntient y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</note> And euen as the ymages are diuine and excellent,<note place="margin">Caruing.</note> so it is to be thought peinctinges were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and so much the more, for that they conteine in them a greater workemanshipp. Then the <hi>L Emilia</hi> tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her vnto <hi>Iohnchristopher Romano</hi> that sat ther emong the rest, how thinke you (quoth she) to this iudgement, will you graunt that peincting conteineth in it a greater workmanship, then caruing? <hi>Iohnchristopher</hi> answered: In my mynde caruing is of more trauaile, of more art, and of a more dignitye then peincting. Then said the Count. Bicause ymages are more durable, perhappes a man may say that they are of a more dignity. For sith they are made for a memory, they better satisfy the effect why the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But beside memory, both peinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and caruing are made also to set out a thing, and in this point hath peincting a great deale the vpper hande, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which though it be not so longe lastyng (to terme it so) as caruing is, yet doth it for al that endure a long tyme, and for the while it lasteth, is much more sightly.

Upon this it commeth that vnto a louer it is most acceptable sometime to behoulde a window though it be shutte, because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles it may be hys chaunce to see his maistresse there: in like maner to see a rynge, a letter, a gardein or anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place or what euer other thynge he supposeth hathe bene a wittinge testimoniall of his pleasures. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, often times a faire trymmed and well decked chamber is abhorred of him that hath bene kept prysoner in it, or abidde therin any other sorow. And in my dayes I haue knowen some that will neuer drinke of a cup like vnto that wherin in their sickenesse they had taken a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicin.

The verye same cause (I beleaue) moueth old men to praise the times past and discommend the present. Therfore as they talke of other thynges, so do they also of Courtes, affirminge suche as haue bene in their memory to be much more excellent and farre better furnished with notable men, then we see them to be that are now a dayes.

I beleaue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore passions and dyseases are geuen to menne of nature, not principallye to make them subiect to them, for it wer not mete that she, whiche is the mother of all goodnesse, shoulde by her owne purposed aduise giue vs so manye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles, but since nature doth make healthe, pleasure and other goodnesse, consequentlye after these, were ioyned diseases, sorowes and other euilles. Therfore since ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were graunted to the worlde for a fauoure and gifte of nature, by and by were vices by that lincked contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty necessarily accompanied with them: so that the one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing or wanting, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other must in like maner encrease or want. Therfore when our olde men praise the Courtes of times past because there were not in them so vitious men, as some that are in oures, they doe not knowe that there were not also in them so vertuous men,<note place="margin">Better wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes now then in fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therfore where nature now bringeth forth muche better wyttes then she didde tho, euen as they that bee geuen to goodnesse doe muche better then didde those of theyr tyme, so also they that be geuen to yll doe muche woorse. Therefore it is not to bee saide, that suche as

And that the wittes of those tymes were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally much inferiour to these now a dayes, a man may iudge by all that hath proceaded from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, letters, peync<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges, statures, buildinges and al other thinges. Again these olde men discommende many thynges in vs, which of themselues are neyther good nor badde, onelye because they did them not: and say it is no good sight to see yonge men on horsebacke aboute the stretes and especially vpon Mules, nor to weare furres, nor syde garmentes in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Thinges nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor badd.</note> norto weare a cappe before a man be at the least xviii. yeares of age, and such other matters, wherin truly they be much deceyued.

Therefore it is meete eche man knowe himselfe and his own disposicion, and applye himselfe thereto, and consider what thynges are mete for him to folow, and what are not. Before ye go anye farther, saide here <hi>M.

For in that maner of theirs, although they laugh and ieste at suche as be malapert, yet do they sett muche by them that seeme to them to haue any prowesse or modesty in them. <hi>Calmeta</hi> answered:<note place="margin">Spaniardes</note> marke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

You ought, answered <hi>Syr Fridericke,</hi> to obey your Lorde in all thinges that tende to his profitt and honour, not in suche matters that tende to his losse and shame.

then any other, and though not throughly blacke, yet som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what darke, and this I meane for his ordinary apparaile.

Yet whiche of vs is there, that seeing a gentleman go with a garment vpon his backe quartred with sundry coulours, or with so many points tyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and al about with lases and fringes set ouerthwart, will not cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him a very disard or a commune iestar? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disard, quoth <hi>M. Peter Bembo,</hi> nor iestar woulde a man count him, that had liued any while in <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> for there they go all so. Why then, aunswered the Dutchesse smy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, if they go all so, it ought not to bee obiected to them for a vice, this kinde of attier being as comely and proper to them, as it is to the <hi>Venetians</hi> to weare their longe wyde sleeues, and to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> their hoodes. I speake no more of <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> quoth <hi>Syr Fridericke,</hi> then of other places, for in euery nation ye shall finde bothe foolishe and wyse. But to speake that I thinke is most requisite as touching apparaile, I will haue the Courtier in all his garmentes handsome and clenlye, and take a certain delite in modest <hi>Precisenesse,</hi> but not for all that after a womanish or lyghte maner, neither more in one point, then in an other, as we see many so curious about their hear,<note place="margin">Delites of men.</note> that they forget all the rest.

And so it commeth to passe, that those fewe thinges whiche they haue clenly in them, appeere borow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ware, and all the rest, whiche is most fonde, is knowne to be their owne. But this trade wil I haue our Courtier to flee by my counsel, with an addition also, that he ought to determine with himselfe what he will appeere to be, and in suche sorte as he desireth to bee esteamed so to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraile himselfe, and make his garmentes helpe him to be counted suche a one, euen of them that heare hym not speake, nor see him doe anye maner thyng.

And contrariwise he that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaunt with the good, wyse, and dyscreete, he is recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned suche a one. For it seemeth by nature, that euerye thing doeth willingly felowshippe with his lyke. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beleaue that a man oughte to haue a respect in the first beeginning of these frendshippes, for of two neere friendes, who euer knoweth the one, by and by he ymagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the other to bee of the same condition. Then aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>M.

               </hi> but rather it happeneth dailye, I wote not by what destinye,



<pb facs="tcp:22866:71"/>
that two friendes whiche manye yeeres haue lyued toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with most hartie loue, yet at the ende beguile one an other, in one maner or other, either for malice, or enuye, or for lightnesse, or some other yll cause: and eche one impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the faulte to his felow, of that which perhappes both the one and the other deserueth. Therfore because it hath happened to me more then once to bee deceiued of hym whom I loued beste, and of whom I hoped I was beloued aboue anye other person, I haue thought with my selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone otherwhile to bee well done, neuer to put a mannes trust in any person in the worlde, nor to geue himselfe so for a prey to friend how deere and louing so euer he wer, that without stoppe a manne shoulde make him partaker of all his thoughtes, as he woulde his owne selfe: because there are in our mindes so many dennes and corners, that it is vnpossible for the witt of manne to knowe the dissy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations that lye lurking in them. I beleaue therefore that it is well done to loue and awaie with one more then another, according to the desertes and honesty: but not for all that so to assure a mannes selfe, with this sweete bait of frendship, that afterwarde it shoulde be to late for vs to repente. Then <hi>Syr Fridericke,</hi> Truely (quoth he) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> whiche (in mine opinion) ministreth vnto vs all the goodnes conteined in our life: and therefore wyll I in no case consente to you, that it is reasonable; but rather I can finde in my heart to conclude, and that with moste e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident reasons, that without this perfect friendship, men wer much more vnluckie, then all other liuyng creatures. And albeit some wicked and prophane taste of this holye name of friendship, yet is it not for all that to be so rooted oute of mennes mindes; and for the trespasse of the yll, to depriue the good of so great a felicitie. And I beleaue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely for my parte, there is here emong vs moe then one couple of friends, whose loue is indissoluble and without

any guile at all, &amp; to endure vntill death, with agreement of will, no lesse then those menne of olde time, whom you mentioned right nowe. And so is it alwaies, whan beside the inclination that commeth from aboue, a man chouseth him a friende lyke vnto himselfe in conditions. And I meane the whole to consist emong the good and vertuous menne, because the friendship of the wicked,<note place="margin">Frend shippe of two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> is no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe. I allowe well that this knott, which is so streicte, knitt or binde no mo then two, elles were it in a hasarde: for (as you know) three instrumentes of musike are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier brought to agree together then two. I woulde haue our Courtier therefore to finde him oute an especiall and hartie friende, if it were possible, of that sort we haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. Then according to their desertes and honesty, loue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> honour, and obserue all other menne, and alwaies do hys beste to felowshippe himselfe with menne of estimation that are noble and knowen to bee good, more then with the vnnoble and of small reputation, so he be also beloued and honoured of them.

that women are so voide of reason, though somtime they applie themselues to loue more, through the iudgemente of others then their owne, for great men and many wyse men, doe often times the like.

I say not that they do well to beeguile their husbandes: but I say that some of the deceites whiche <hi>Boccaccio</hi> recy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of women, are pretie and wittie inough, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye those you haue spoken of your selfe. But in mine opinion the prancke that <hi>Richarde Minutoli</hi> wrought, doeth passe the boundes, and is muche more bitterer then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice</hi> wrought. For <hi>Richarde Minutoli</hi> tooke muche moore from <hi>Philippellos</hi> wief, then did <hi>Beatrice</hi> from <hi>Egano</hi> her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande: bicause <hi>Richarde</hi> with that priuie pollicie enforced her, and made her to do of herself that she wolde not haue done: And <hi>Beatrice</hi> deceyued her husbande to do of herself that she lusted. Then saide the <hi>L. Gaspar</hi>: for no other cause can a manne excuse <hi>Beatrice</hi> but for loue, whiche ought to be alowed aswell in men as in women. Then answered <hi>M.

And this do I beleaue is the true and sounde pleasure, and the ende wherto the entent of a noble courage is bent. And for my part trulye (were I in loue) I wold like it better to know assuridlye that she whom I loued and serued loued me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with hert, and had bent her minde towarde me, without receiuing any other contentation, then to enioye

               </note> And knowe for a sooth, that gyftes also diminishe muche the pleasures of loue, bicause a man maie stand in doubt whether he be beloued or no, but that the woman maketh a countenance to loue him, to fare the better by him: therfore ye see that the loue of Ladies and great women is esteamed, bicause it appeereth that it can arrise of none other cause, but of perfect and true loue, neyther is it to be thoughte that a great Ladye wyll at anye tyme showe to beare good will to her inferiour, onlesse she loue him in verye deede. The answered the <hi>L Gaspar:</hi> I denie not that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the peynes and daungers of louers ought not prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to haue their ende dyrected to the victorye rather of the minde then of the bodye of the woman beloued. But I saye that these deceytes whiche you in men terme <hi>Tradimentes,</hi> and in women <hi>Meerie prankes,</hi> are a verie good meane to come to this ende, bicause alwayes he that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth the bodie of women, is also maister of the mind. And if you beethinke you well, <hi>Philippellos</hi> wief after her great lamentatyon for the deceyt wrought her by <hi>Richard,</hi> knowinge howe muche more sauourye the kysses of a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were then her husbandes, tournynge her rigour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tender affection towarde <hi>Richarde,</hi> from that daye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde loued hym moste deerlye. You maye perceiue nowe that his continuall hauntinge, hys presentes, and



<pb facs="tcp:22866:105"/>
hys so manye other tokens, whyche had bine so longe a proof of hys good will toward her, were not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe that, that hys beeyinge with her a smalle while did. Nowe see this <hi>Meerie Prancke</hi> or <hi>Tradiment</hi> (howe euer you will terme it) was a good waye to wynn the fortresse of that minde. Then <hi>M. Bernarde,</hi> you (quoth he) make a surmise, which is most false, for in case women should alwayes giue their minde to him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> possesseth their body, there should be none found that wold not loue their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes more then anye person in the worlde beesyde, where it is seene not to be so. But <hi>Iohn Boccaccio</hi> was (as you be) with out cause an ennemye to women. The <hi>L. Gaspar</hi> answered: I am no ennemye of theirs, but (to confesse the troth) fewe menne of woorthynesse there be that generally set any store by women, although otherwhile, to serue their tourne withall, they make wise to the contrarye. Then answered <hi>M. Bernarde</hi>: You doe not onelye iniurye to women, but to all menne also that reuerence them: Notwithstandinge (as I haue saide) I will not swarue from my first pourpose of <hi>Meerie Pranc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,</hi> and vndertake suche an enterprise so harde, as is the defence of women against you, that are a valiant Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyon. Therfore I will ende this my communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whyche perhappes hath byne lenger then needed, but oute of parauenture not so pleasaunt as you looked for. And syns I see the Ladyes so quyet and beare these iniuries at youre handes so pacyentlye as they doe, I wyll hensefurth beleaue that some parte of that which the <hi>L.

Now shall we see whether we passe to be yll spoken of or no. Thus partlye for laughinge, and partlye for the risinge of euerye one from his seate, yt seemed the sleepe that now beegane to enter into the eyes and heade of some of them departed, but the <hi>L. Gaspar</hi> said: See I pray you where thei haue not reason on their side, they will preuaile by plaine force, &amp; so end the communication, geuinge vs leaue to depart w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> stripes. Then answered y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>L. Emilia</hi>: No (ꝙ she) it shall not be so: for whan you perceyued <hi>M. Bernarde</hi> was weerie of his longe talke, you beegan to speake so muche yll of women, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge you shoulde finde none to gainsaye you. But we will sett into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field a fresher knight that shall fight with you, bicause your offence shall not be so long vnpunished. So tourninge her to the <hi>L. Iulian</hi> that hitherto had said lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, she said vnto him: You are counted the protectour of the honour of women, therfore it is nowe hyghe time to showe that you come not by this name for nothinge, and in case ye haue not bine woorthelye recompensed at anye time for this profession hitherto, nowe muste you thinke that in puttinge to flight so bitter an ennemy, you shall binde all women to you muche more, and so muche, that where they shall do nothinge elles but rewarde you, yet shall the bondage still remaine freshe, and neuer cease to be recompensed. Then answered the <hi>L. Iulian</hi>: Me thinke (madam) you show great honour to your ennemy, and verie litle to youre defender: for vndoubtedlye the <hi>L. Gaspar</hi> hath said nothing against women, but it hath bine fullye answered by <hi>M. Bernarde.</hi> And I beleaue euerye one of vs knoweth, that it is meete the Courtier beare ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great reuerence to warde women, and a discreete and courtiouse person ought neuer to touch their honestie nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in boord, nor in good earnest. Therfore to dispute of this so open a trueth, were (in maner) to put a doubt in manifest matters. I thinke wel that the <hi>L. Octauian</hi> passed his boundes somwhat in sayinge that <hi>VVomen are most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect creatures and not apt to woorke anye vertuous deede, and of



<pb facs="tcp:22866:106"/>
litle or no woorthinesse in respect of men.</hi> And bicause manie times credit is geuen to men of great authority, although they speake not the full truth, and also whan they speake in boorde, the <hi>L. Gaspar</hi> hath suffered himselfe to be lead by the <hi>L. Octauians</hi> woordes to saye that <hi>Men of wisdome sett no store by them,</hi> which is most false. For I haue knowen few men of woorthinesse at anye time that doe not loue and obserue women,<note place="margin">Men of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines obserue women.</note> the vertue and consequentlye the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse of whom I deeme not a iott inferiour to mens. Yet if we should come to this contention, the cause of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were lyke to quaile greatlie, bicause these Lordes haue shaped a Courtier that is so excellent and of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie diuine qualities, that whoso hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnderstanding to consider him to be such a one as he is, will imagin that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> desertes of women can not attaine to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> point. But in case y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> matter should be equally deuided, we haue first neede of so witty &amp; eloquent a person as is Count <hi>Lewis</hi> &amp; <hi>Sir Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke,</hi> to shape a gentilwoman of the Palaice with all perfections due to a woman, as they haue shaped the Courtier with the perfections beelonging to a man. And then if he that defended their cause were anie thinge wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and eloquent, I beleaue (bicause the truth will be a helpe to him) he may plainlye showe that women are as full of vertues as men be. The Ladye <hi>Emilia</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Nay, a great deale more, and that it is so you may see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vertue is the female, and vice is the male. The <hi>L. Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par</hi> then laughed, and tourning him to <hi>M. Nicholas Phrisio,</hi> what is your iudgement <hi>Phrisio</hi> (quoth he) <hi>Phrisio</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: I am sorie for the <hi>L. Iulian</hi> that he is so seduced with the promises and flatteringe woordes of the <hi>L. Emilia</hi> to renn into an errour to speake the thinge whiche for hys sake I am ashamed of. The <hi>L.

               <hi>L. Gaspar</hi> after he is conuicted, confesse his owne errour and yours to, and demaunde that pardon whiche we will not graunt him. Then spake the Dutchesse:



<pb facs="tcp:22866:107"/>
Bicause it is very late, I will we defar the wholl vntill to morow, the more for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I thinke it well done we folow the <hi>L. Iulians</hi> counsell, that beefore we come to this disputaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we maye haue a gentilwoman of the Palaice so faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in all perfections, as these Lordes haue facioned the perfect Courtier. Madam quoth the <hi>L. Emilia</hi> then, I pray God it fall not to oure lott to giue this enterprice to anye confederate with the <hi>L. Gaspar,</hi> least he facion vs for a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilwoman of the Court, one that can do nought elles but looke to the kitchin and spinn. Then saide <hi>Phrisio</hi>: In deede that is an office fitt for herr. Then the Dutchesse, I haue a good hope in the <hi>L. Iulian</hi> (quoth she) who will (for the good witt and iudgement I knowe he is of) imagyn the greatest perfection that maye be wished in a woman, and in like maner expresse it well in woordes, and so shal we haue somewhat to confounde the <hi>L. Gaspars</hi> false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations withall. Madam, answered the <hi>L. Iulian,</hi> I wote not whether youre diuise be good or no to committ into my handes an enterprise of so greate weight, for (to tell you the troth) I thinke not my selfe able inoughe. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther am I like the Count and <hi>Sir Fridericke,</hi> whiche with their eloquence haue shaped suche a Courtier as neuer was, nor I beleaue euer shalbe. Yet if your pleasure be so that I shall take this bourden vpon me, let it be at the least with those condicions that the other haue had before me: namely, that euerie man, where he shall thinke good, maye replye against me, and this shall I recken not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuartinge but aide, and perhappes in correctynge mine erroures we shall finde the perfection of a gentilwoman of the Palaice which we seeke for. I trust, answered the Dutchesse, your talke shall be such, that litle may be saide against you. Therfore settle your minde to thynke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon onlie this and facion vs suche a Gentilwoman that these our aduersaries maye be ashamed to say, that she is not equall with the Courtier in vertue: of whom it shall be well done <hi>Sir Friderick</hi> speake no more, for he hath but

so well sett him furth, especiallye sins we must compare a woman to him.

The <hi>L. Iulian</hi> answered sodeinlye: The seelie poore creatures wish not to be a man to make them more perfect, but to haue libertye, and to be ridd of the rule that



<pb facs="tcp:22866:116"/>
men haue of their owne authoritie chalenged ouer them. And the similitude which you giue of the <hi>Mattier</hi> &amp; <hi>Fourme,</hi> is not alike in euerye point: bicause the woman is not made so perfect by the man, as is the <hi>Mattier</hi> by the <hi>Fourme</hi> for the <hi>Mattier</hi> receiueth his beeinge of the <hi>Fourme,</hi> and can not stande without it: yea the more <hi>Mattier Fourmes</hi> haue, the more imperfection they haue withall, &amp; seuered from it, are most perfect: but the woman receiueth not her bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge of the man, yea as she is made perfect by the man, so doeth she also make him perfect: wherby both the one and the other come together to beegete children: the whyche thinge they can not do any of them by them selues. The cause then of the continuall loue of the woman towarde the first that she hath bine with, and of the hatred of the man towarde the first woman, I will not affirme to be that youre Philosopher alleageth in his <hi>Problemes,</hi> but I impute it to the surenesse and stablenesse of the woman, and waueringe of the man, and that not without natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reason: for sins the male is naturallye hott, by that qualitie he taketh lightnesse, stirring and vnstedfastnes, and contrariwise the woman throughe colde, quietnesse, steadie waightinesse, and more earnest imprintinges.

there was no great difference in their degree, she and the yonge man coueted that so great a loue might haue a luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kye ende, and be man and wief together.

And this was not by the vnluckye mayden otherwise gainstoode, then with most bitter teares.

And in this while she folowed on still in her set pourpose of continencye, and perceiuinge she could not honestly haue him, whom she worshipped in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, she chose not to haue him at all, and continued in her wont not to accept messages, tokens nor yet his lookes.

And in case these Lordes will not haue her as she is, let them leaue her to me. Here whan all was whilt, <hi>Sir Fridericke</hi> saide: My <hi>L.

And this it is, that I longe to knowe howe she shoulde beehaue herselfe in a point that (to my see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge) is moste necessarye. For albeit the excellent qualityes whiche you haue geuen her conteine in them discretion, knowleage, iudgemente, sleight, sobermoode, and so manye other vertues, wherebye of reason she ought to haue the vnderstandynge to entertein euerye manne and in all kinde of pourpose, yet thinke I not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandynge aboue any other thing that it is requisite for her to knowe what beelongeth to communication of loue.<note place="margin">To tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of loue.</note> For euen as euerye honest Gentilmanne for an instrument to obteine the good will of women, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyseth those noble exercises, precise facions and good maners whyche we haue named, euen so to this pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose applyeth he also hys woordes, and not onlye whan he is stirred thereto by some passion, but often times also to do honour to the woman he talketh withall, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge to him that to declare to loue her is a witnes that



<pb facs="tcp:22866:138"/>
she is woorthie of it, and that her beawtie and woorthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is suche, that it enforceth euerie manne to serue her. Therfore woulde I knowe, howe this woman in suche a case shoulde beehaue herselfe vprightlye, and howe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere him that loueth her in deed, and how him that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth false semblant: and whether she ought to dissemble the vnderstandinge of it, or be answerable, or shonn the matter, and howe to handle herselfe. Then said the <hi>L. Iulian</hi>: It were first needefull to teach her to knowe them that make semblant to loue, and them that loue in deede: Afterward for beeinge answerable in loue or no, I bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaue she ought not to be guided by any other mans will, but by her owne self. <hi>Sir Fridericke</hi> saide: Teach you her then what are the moste certein and surest tokens to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne false loue from true, and what triall she shal thinke sufficient to content herselfe withall, to be out of doubt of the loue shewed her. The <hi>L. Iulian</hi> answered smiling: That wote not I, bicause men be nowadayes so craftye, that they make infinite false semblantes, and sometime weepe, whan they haue in deede a greater lust to laughe. Therefore they shoulde be sent to the constant Ile vnder the Arch of faithfull louers. But least this woman of mine (which is my charge and no mans elles, bicause she is my creature) should renn into those erroures whiche I haue seene manye other renn into, I would saye that she should not be light of credence that she is beloued: nor be like vnto some, that not onlie make not wise they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande him not that communeth with them of loue, be it neuer so farr of, but also at the first woorde accept all the prayses that be giuen them: or elles denie them after such a sort, that it is rather an alluringe for them to loue them they commune withall, then a withdrawinge of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Therfore the maner of enterteinment in reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of loue that I will haue my woman of the Palaice to vse, shall be alwaies to shonn beeleauinge that whoso talketh of loue, loueth her anye whitt the more. And in



<pb facs="tcp:22866:138"/>
case the Gentilman be (as manye suche there are abrode) malapert, and hath smalle respect to her in his talke, she shall shape him such an answere, that he shall plainly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande she is not pleased withall. Again, if he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure and vseth sober facions and woordes of loue couert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, in suche honest maner, as I beeleaue the Courtier whom these Lordes haue facioned will doe, the woman shall make wise not to vnderstand him, and shal draw his woordes to another sense, seekinge alwaies sobrely with the discretion and wisdome that is alreadye said becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth her, to stray from that pourpose. But in case the communication be such that she can not feigne not to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande it, she shall take the wholl (as it were) for a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie diuise, and make wise that she knoweth it is spoken to her rather to honour her withall, then that it is so in deede, debasinge her desertes and acknowleginge at the Gentilmans courtesie the prayses which he geueth her: &amp; in this sort she shall be counted discreete, and shall be on the surer hande for beeinge deceiued. Thus me seemeth the Gentilwoman of the Palaice ought to behaue herself in communication of loue. Then <hi>Sir Friderick,</hi> You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate this matter, my <hi>L. Iulian</hi> (quoth he) as though it were requisite, that all suche as speake with women of loue, shoulde tell lyes, and seeke to deceiue them, the whiche in case it were so, I woulde say your lessons were good. But if this gentilman that enterteineth, loueth in very deede, and feeleth the passion that so tourmenteth mens hertes sometime, consider you not in what peine, in what cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and death ye put him in, whan at no time you will that the woman shall beeleaue him in any thinge he saith about this pourpose? Shall othes, teares, and so many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tokens then, haue no force at all? Take heede (my <hi>L. Iulian</hi>) least a manne may thinke that beeside the naturall crueltye whiche manie of these women haue in them, you teach them get more. The <hi>L. Iulian</hi> answered: I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, not of him that loueth, but of him that enterteineth



<pb facs="tcp:22866:139"/>
with communication of loue, wherein one of the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest pointes is, that woordes be neuer to seeke: and true louers as they haue a burninge hart, so haue they a colde tunge, with broken talke and sodeine silence. Therfore (may happ) it were no false principle to saye: <hi>He that loueth much, speaketh litle.</hi> Howbeit in this I beleaue there can be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no certein rule, by reason of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuersity of mens ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And I wote not what I should say, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman be good &amp; heedfull, and alwaies beare in mynde, that men may with a great deale lesse daunger declare themselues to loue, then women. The <hi>L. Gaspar</hi> said laughinge: Why (my <hi>L.

               </gap>heefly the homage and reuerence, wherwithal louers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and (in a maner) woorship the vertue of the women beloued. In this, answered the <hi>L.

For wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this loue can not ende in matrimonye, the woman muste needes haue alwaies the remorse and pricking that is had of vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therfore will not I that my woman of the Palaice with dishonest beehauiours should appeere as though she wold offre herselfe vnto whoso wyll haue her, and allure what she can the eyes and affection of who so beehouldeth her: but with her desertes and vertuous condicions, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miablenesse and grace driue into the mind of whoso seeth her the verye loue that is due vnto euery thinge woorthy to be beloued: and the respect that alwaies taketh awaye hope from whoso mindeth anye dishonest matter.

After the L. Iulian had thus spoken he helde his peace, whan the <hi>L. Gaspar</hi> laughinge, now (quoth he) you can not complaine that the <hi>L.

And if perdee there be any suche to be found, I say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she deserueth well to be esteamed equall with the Courtier. The <hi>L.

Yet in these her last properties as touching loue, me seemeth not withstanding that he hath made her somwhat ouer crabbed, &amp; especially where he will haue her in woordes, gestures and countenance to take cleane away all hope from the louer, &amp; settle him as nigh as she can in despaire. For (as all menne know) the desires of man stretch not to suche kinde of matters, whereof there is no hope to be had. And althoughe at times some wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men there haue bine, that perhappes bearing themselues loftie of their beawtie and woorthinesse: the first woorde they haue said to them that communed with them of loue hath bine, that they should neuer looke to come bye anye thinge of them that liked them: yet in countenance, and daliance together they haue afterward bine more fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to them, so that with their gentle deedes they haue tempred in part their proude woordes. But if this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man both in woordes, deedes and beehauiours take hope quite awaye, I beeleaue our Courtier, if he be wise, will neuer loue her, and so shall she haue this imperfection, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she shall be without a louer.

to well of themselues: and I my selfe can be a good wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, bicause loue was neuer taught me, but by the diuine beawty and most diuine maners of a Lady, so that it was not in my will not to woorshippe her: and therfore needed I therin no art nor teacher at all. And I beleaue that the like happeneth to as manie as loue truly. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Courtier hath more neede to be taught to make him beloued then to loue.

But bicause these seruices of loue are not otherwhile well knowen, I beleaue that beeside louinge and seruinge, it is necessary also to make some other showe of this loue, so manifest, that the woman may not dissemble to know that she is beloued: yet with such modesty, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere that he beareth her litle reuerence. And therfore you (Madam) that haue beegone to declare howe the soule of the louer ought to be an obedient handmayden to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, teach vs withall, I besech you, this secrete matter, which me thinke is most needefull.

Therfore (in my minde) the way which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Courtier ought to take, to make his loue knowen to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman me thinke should be to declare them in signes and tokens more then in woordes. For assuredlye there is otherwhile a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter affection of loue perceyued in a sigh, in a respect, in a feare, then in a thousande woordes. Afterwarde, to make the eyes the trustye messangers, that maye carye the ambassades of the hart: bicause they oftentimes declare with a more force what passion there is inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, then can the tunge, or letters, or messages, so that they not onlye disclose the thaughtes, but also manye ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes kendle loue in the hert of the person beloued. For those liuely spirites that issue out at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eyes, bicause they are engendred nigh the hart, entring in like case into the eyes that they are leueled at, like a shaft to the pricke, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallye perce to the hart, as to their restynge place and there are at truste with those other spirites: and with the moste subtill and fine nature of bloode whyche they

Wherfore by litle and litle comminge and goinge the waye through the eyes to the hart, and bringinge backe with them the tunder and strikinge yron of beawtie &amp; grace, these mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sangers kendle with the puffinge of desire the fire that so burneth,<note place="margin">

Therfore it may full well be said, that <hi>The eyes are a guide in loue,</hi> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallye if they haue a good grace &amp; sweetenesse in them, blacke, of a cleere and sightlye blackenesse, or elles gray, meery and laughinge, and so comely and percinge in bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houldinge, as some, in which a man thinketh verilie that the wayes that giue an issue to the spirites are so deepe, that by them he maye see as farr as the hart. The eyes therefore lye lurkinge like souldiers in warre lyinge in wayte in bushment, and if the fourme of all the bodye be welfauoured and of good proportion, it draweth vnto it and allureth whoso beehouldeth it a farr of, vntil he come nigh: and assoone as he is at hande, the eyes shoote, and like sorcerers, beewitch, and especiallie whan by a right line they sende their glisteringe beames into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eies of the wight beloued at the time whan they do the like, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the spirites meete together, and in that sweete en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the one taketh the others nature and qualitye: as it is seene in a sore eye, that beehoulding steadily a sound one, giueth him his disease. Therfore me thinke oure Courtier may in this wise open a great percel of the loue to his woman. Truth it is that in case the eyes be not gouerned with art, they discouer manie times the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous desires more vnto whom a man woulde least: for through them (in a maner) visibly shinefurth those bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge passions, whiche the louer mindinge to disclose on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to the wight beloued, openeth them manie times also

Then spake <hi>Sir Fride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>: to reason thus in peecemeale of these rules of secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, were a takinge of an infinit matter in hand: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would I y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we spake somwhat rather how the louer shoulde keepe and maintein his Ladies good wil, which me thinke is muche more necessary. The <hi>L.

Therfore it were a hard matter to giue any certein rule, bicause whoso is not discrete, infinit wayes committeth ouersightes, whiche otherwhile seeme matters of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and yet offende they much the womans minde. And this happeneth more then to others, to suche as be mastred with passion: as some that whenso euer they haue opportunitie to speake with the woman they loue, lament and beewaile so bitterlye, and couett manye ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes thinges so vnpossible, that through this vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse

And with these facions manye ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, they do not onlye offende the woman, but also they are the cause that she bendeth herselfe to loue him. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the feare that a louer declareth to haue otherwhile least his Ladye forsake him for the other, beetokeneth that he acknowleageth himself inferiour in desertes and prowesse to the other, and with this opinion the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is moued to loue him. And perceyuinge that to put him out of fauour he reporteth all of him, although it be true, yet she beleaueth it not, and notwythstandinge loueth him the more. Then saide the <hi>L.

And therefore it is to be hoped y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prosperous fortune will still encrease these so vertuous doinges, that the happines of the house and of the State shall not only not diminish, but rather dailye encrease: And therof we see alreadye manye euident tokens, emonge whiche (I r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was thought therefore (as the L, Gaspar Pallauicin was wont to reherse) that the next daye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reasoninges conteined in the laste booke, the L. Octauian was not muche seene: for manye deemed that he had gotten himself out of comapnye to thinke well vpon that he had to saye withoute trouble. Therfore whan the companye was assembled at the accustomed houre where the Dutchesse was, they made the L, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauian to be diligentlye sought for, whiche in a good while appered not, so that manye of the Gentilmen and Damselles of the Court fell to daunsynge and to minde other pastymes, supposynge for that night they shoulde haue no more talke of the Courtier. And nowe were they all settled about one thinge or an other, whan the L. Octauian came in (almost) no more looked for: and beehouldinge the L. Cesar Gonzaga and the L. Gaspar daunsinge, after he had made his reuerence to the Dutchesse, he saide smilinge: I had well hoped we shoulde haue hearde the <hi>L.

with one, I imagin he is agreede with all. And I am glad that the controuersie, or (to terme it better) the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soninge of the Courtier is thus ended. Not ended, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you, answered the Dutchesse, for I am not suche an ennemye to men, as you be to women, and therfore I wil not haue the Courtier bereued from his due honour and the fournimentes whiche you youre selfe promised him yester night. And whan she had thus spoken, she commaunded them all after that daunse was ended to place themselues after the wonted maner, the which was done. And as they stoode all wyth heedfull expectation, the <hi>L. Octauian</hi> said: Madam, sins for that I wished manye other good qualities in the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, it foloweth by promise that I muste entreate vppon them, I am well willinge to vttre my minde: not with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that I can speake all that may be said in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but only so much as shall suffice to roote that oute of your mind, which yester night was obiected to me: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I spake it more to withdrawe the prayses from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentilwoman of the Palaice, in doinge you falselye to beleaue that other excellent qualities might be added to the Courtier, and with that pollicie prefarre him beefore her, then for that it is so in deede. Therfore to frame my selfe also to the houre, which is later then it was wont to be whan we beegane our reasoninges at other times, I will be breef. Thus continuinge in the talke that these Lordes haue ministred, whiche I full and wholye alowe and confirme, I say, that of thinges which we call good,<note place="margin">Thinges good.</note> some there be that simply and of themselues are alwaies good, as temperance, valiant courage, helth, &amp; al vertues that bring quietnesse to mens mindes. Other be good for diuerse respectes &amp; for the ende they be applied vnto, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes, liberality, riches &amp; other like. I thinke therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Courtier (if he be of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Count <hi>Lewis</hi> &amp; <hi>Sir Fride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> haue described him) maye in deede be a good thinge &amp; woorthie praise, but for all that not simplye, nor of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but for respect of the ende wherto he may be applied.

For doubtlesse if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Courtier with his noblenesse of birth, comlie beehauiour, pleasantnesse and practise in so many exercises, should bringe furth no other frute, but to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che a one for himself, I woulde not thinke to come by this perfect trade of Courtiership, that a man shoulde of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son beestowe so much studye and peynes about it, as who so will compase it must do. But I woulde say rather that manie of the qualities appointed him, as daunsing, sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge and sportinge, were lightnesse and vanitie, and in a a man of estimation rather to be dispraised then commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: bicause those precise facions, the settinge furth ones selfe, meerie talke and such other matters belonginge to enterteinment of women and loue (althoughe perhappes manie other be of a contrary opinion) do many times no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge elles but womannish the mindes, corrupt youth, and bring them to a most wanton trade of liuinge:<note place="margin">Dastardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon afterwarde ensue these effectes, that the name of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> is brought into sclaunder, and few there be that haue the courage, I will not saye to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And without perauenture there be infinite other thinges, that if a man beestow his labour and studie about them, woulde bring furth muche more profit both in peace and warr, then this trade of Courtiershipp of it self alone. But in case the Courtiers doinges be directed to the good ende they ought to be and whiche I meane: me thinke then they should not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye not be hurtfull or vaine,<note place="margin">The ende of a Courtier.</note> but most profitable &amp; deserue infinit praise. The ende therfore of a perfect Courtier (wherof hitherto nothinge hath bine spoken) I beleaue is to purchase him, by the meane of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> qualities whiche these Lordes haue giuen him, in such wise the good will and fauour of the Prince he is in seruice withall, that he may breake his minde to him, and alwaies enfourme hym francklye of the trueth of euerie matter meete for him to vnderstande, without feare or perill to displease him. And whan <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therfore in mine opinion, as musike, sportes, pastimes, and other pleasaunt facions,<note place="margin">The floure of courtlines</note> are (as a man woulde saye) the floure of Courtlines, euen so is the traininge and the helping forward of the Prince to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and the fearinge him from yuell, the frute of it.<note place="margin">The frute of it.</note> And bicause the praise of weldoinge consisteth cheeflye in two pointes, wherof the one is,<note place="margin">Well doinge.</note> in chousinge out an ende that our pourpose is directed vnto, that is good in deede: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the knowleage to find out apt and meete meanes to bringe it to the appointed good ende: sure it is that the mind of him which thinketh to worke so, that his Prince shall not be deceiued, nor lead with flaterers, railers and lyers, but shall knowe both the good and the bad &amp; beare loue to the one &amp; hatred to the other, is directed to a verye good ende.

Maruaile ye not then (my <hi>L.

Likewise Iustice an vndefiled virgin, friend to sobermode and good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">Iustice.</note> queene of all other vertues, bicause she teacheth to do that, which a man ought to do, and to shon that a man ought to shonn, and therfore is she most perfect, bicause through her the woorkes of the other vertues are brought to passe, and she is a helpe to him that hath her both for him selfe and for others: without the which (as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlye said) <hi>Iupiter</hi> him selfe coulde not well gouern hys kingdome.<note place="margin">Stoutnesse of courage.</note> Stoutnesse of courage doeth also folowe after these, and maketh them all the greater, but she can not stand alone, bicause whoso hath not other vertues can not be of a stoute courage.

Which alone were sufficient to make men happie, and to bring once again into the worlde the golden age, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is written to haue bine whan <hi>Saturnus</hi> reigned in the olde time.<note place="margin">The reigne of a good Prince.</note> Here whan the L.

The <hi>L. Octauian</hi> answered: I woulde alwayes prefarr the reigne of a good Prince, bicause it is a gouernment more agreeable to nature, and (if it be lawfull to compare small matters with infinit) more like vnto Goddes, whiche one, and alone go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth the vniuersall.

Beeside this it seemeth meete that people shoulde aswell be gouerned by one Prince, as manye other liuinge creatures be, whom nature teacheth this obedience, as a moste soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign matter.

a Prince beefore, whom they folowe and obey. And bees (as it were) with discourse of reason and with such reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence honour their kinge, as the most obedientest people in the world can do. And therfore all this is a verie great argument that the so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eraigntie of a Prince is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to nature, then a Commune weales. Then <hi>M. Peter Bembo,</hi> and me thinke (quoth he) that sins God hath giuen vs libertie for a soueraigne gifte,<note place="margin">Libertye.</note> it is not reason that it should be taken from vs: nor that one man should be partner of it more then an other, which happeneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rule of princis, who for the most part keepe their people in most streict bondage. But in Commune wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les well in order this libertie is well kept. Beeside that, both in iudgementes and in aduisementes it happeneth oftner that the opinion of one alone is false, then the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of many, bicause troublous affection either through anger, or throughe spite, or through lust, sooner entreth into the mind of one alone then into the multitudes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>he (in a maner) like a greate quantitie of water, is lesse subiect to corruption, then a smalle deale. I saye again that the example of the beastes and foules doth not make to pourpose, for both Deere and Cranes and the rest doe not alwaies sett one and the selfe formost for them to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe and obey, but they still chaunge and varie, giuinge this prefarment somtime to one, otherwhile to an other, and in this maner it beecommeth rather the fourme of a Commune weale, then of a kingdome, and this maye be called a true and equall libertie, whan they that somtime commaunde, obey again an other while. The example likewise of the bees (me thinke) is not alike, bicause that kinge of theirs is not of their owne kinde: And therefore he that will giue vnto men a w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rthie head in deede, must be faine to finde him of an other kinde, and of a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature then mans, if menne (of reason) shoulde obey him, as flockes and heardes of cattell that obey, not a beast their like, but a sheppharde and a hardman, which



<pb facs="tcp:22866:161"/>
is a man and of a more woorthie kinde, then theirs. For these respectes, I thynke (my <hi>L. Octauian</hi>) the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of a Commune weale is more to be coueted, then of a kinge. Then the <hi>L. Octauian,</hi> against your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>M. Peter</hi> (quoth he) I will alleage but one reason: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is, that of wayes to rule people well, there be onlye three kindes. The one a kingdome: The other,<note place="margin">Three kindes of wayes to rule.</note> the rule of good men, whiche they of olde tyme called <hi>Optimates,</hi> The third, the gouernance of the people. And the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressinge (to terme it so) and contrarie vice that euery one of these is chaunged into beeinge apayred and corrupted, is whan the kingdome beecommeth a <hi>Tyrannie</hi>: and whan the gouernance of good men is chaunged into the handes of a few great men and not good: and whan the rule of the people is at the disposition of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munaltye, whiche making a meddlie of the ordres, suffreth the gouernance of the wholl at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil of the multitude. Of these three yll gouernmentes (it is sure) the <hi>Tyrannie</hi> is the woorst of al, as it may be proued by many reasons. It foloweth then, that of the three good, the kingdome is the best, bicause it is contrarye to the woorste, for (as you knowe) the effectes of contrarie causes, they be also contrarye emong them selues. Nowe as touchinge it, that you haue spoken of lybertye, I answere, that true liberty ought not to be saide to liue as a manne will, but to lyue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to good lawes. And to obey, is no lesse na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, profitable and necessarye, then to commaunde. And some thinges are borne and so appointed and ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by nature to commaunde, as some other to obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance. Truth it is, that there be two kyndes of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe rule, the one Lordlye and forsyble,<note place="margin">Two kindes of wayes to beare swinge.</note> as maisters o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer slaues, and in this doeth the soule commaunde the bodye. The other more milde and tractable, as good Princis by waye of the lawes ouer their Subiectes, and in this reason commaundeth greedie desire. And ech of these two wayes is proifitable: bicause the bodye is



<pb facs="tcp:22866:162"/>
created of nature apte to obey the soule, and so is desire, reason. There be also manye menne whose doinges be applied onlye about the vse of the body: and such as these be are so farr wide from the vertuous, as the soule from the bodye, and yet bicause they be reasonable creatures, they be so much partners of reason, as they doe no more but know it, for they possesse it not, ne yet haue they the vse of it. These therefore be naturallye bondemen, and better it is for them and more profitable to obeye, then to beare swey. Then saide the <hi>L. Gaspar</hi>: In what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wise be they then to be commaunded that be discreete and vertuous and not by nature bonde?<note place="margin">How good men be to be ruled.</note> The <hi>L. Octauian</hi> answered: With that tractable commaundment king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and ciuill. And to such it is well done otherwhile to committe the bearinge of suche offices as be meete for them, that they maye likewise beare swey and rule ouer others of lesse witt then they be, yet so that the principal gouernement maye full and wholye depende vppon the cheef Prince. And bicause you haue said, that it is an easier matter to corrupt the minde of one, then of a great sort, I saye, that it is also an easier matter to finde one good and wise,<note place="margin">A kinge.</note> then a great sorte. Both good and wise ought a man to suppose a kinge maye be, of a noble pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For God deliteth in and is the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour not of those Princis that will folowe and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit him in showinge great poure, and make themselues to be woorshipped of menne, but of such as beeside poure, whereby they are mightye, endeuour themselues to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him also in goodnesse and wisdome, wherby they maye haue a will and a knowleage to doe well and to be his ministers, distributinge for the beehouf of manne the benifittes and giftes that they receiue of him. Therfore euen as in the firmamente the sonne and the moone and the other sterres show to the world (as it were) in a glasse a certeine likenesse of God:<note place="margin">A good Prince an Image of God.</note> So vppon the earth a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che more liker image of God are those good Princis that loue and woorshippe him, and showe vnto the people the cleere light of his iustice, accompanied with a shadowe of the heauenlye reason and vnderstandinge: And suche as these be doeth God make partners of his true dealing, rightuousnesse, iustice and goodnesse, and of those other happy benifittes which I can not name, that disclose vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worlde a much more euident proof of the Godhead, then doeth the light of the sonne, or the continuall tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of the firmamente with the sundrye course of the sterres.

Therfore ought the prince not only to be good, but also to make others good, like the Carpenters square, that is not only straight &amp; iust it self, but also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth straight &amp; iust whatsoeuer it is occupied about.

Wherefore to a Courtier or instructer of a Prince (howe euer ye lust to terme him) that tendeth to the good ende, which we haue spoken of, it is not to be said but that all the good qualities which these Lordes haue giuen him do beelonge, though he were neuer so graue a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher or holie in his maners: bicause they striue not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst goodnesse, discreation, knoweleage and will, in all age, and in all time and place.

it hath bine said the other night) <hi>Loue framet h not with olde men,</hi> and the trickes that in yonge men be galauntnesse, courtesie and precisenesse so acceptable to women, in them are meere folies and fondnesse to be laughed at, and purchase him that vseth them hatred of women and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of others. Therfore in case this your <hi>Aristotel</hi> an old Courtier were a louer, and practised the feates that yong louers do (as some that we haue sene in our daies) I feare me, he woulde forgete to teach his Prince: and parauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture boyes would mocke him behinde his backe, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would haue none other delite in him but to make him a iesting stocke. Then said the <hi>L.

Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, quoth the <hi>L.

Wherupon he required to be taught the cause of this sweetenesse. Therfore in case oure Courtier (thoughe he be olde) were kendled with those loues that be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And beeing wise, as we set case he is, he shoulde not be deceiued in thinkinge to be meete for him what so euer were meete for yong men, but in louinge shoulde perhappes loue after a sorte, that might not onlye not bringe him in sclaunder but to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che praise and great happinesse, without any lothsomnes at all, the which verie sildome or (in maner) neuer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to yonge men: &amp; so should he neyther lay aside the teachinge of his Prince, nor yet commit any thinge that

But in case after they drawe in yeeres once they reserue still in their colde hart the fire of appetites, and brynge stoute rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in subiection to feeble sense, it can not bee said how much they are to be blamed: for lyke men without sense they deserue with an euerlastinge shame to be put in the numbre of vnreasonable liuing creatures, bicause the thoughtes and wayes of sensuall loue be farr vnsittinge for ripe age.

more of this loue and of the waye to enioy beautye aright, and at the last, Me thinke (quoth he) I haue showed plainly inough, that Olde men may loue more happelye then yonge, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was my drift, therfore it belongeth not me to entre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye farther. Count <hi>Lewes</hi> answered: You haue better declared the vnluckinesse of yonge men, then the happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of olde menn, whom you haue not as yet taught, what waye they must folow in this loue of theirs: onelye you haue saide, that they must suffre them selues to bee guided by reason, and the opinion of many is, that it is vnpossible for loue to stand with reason. Bembo notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing saught to make an ende of reasoning, but the Dutchesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired him to say on, and he beegane thus afreshe: Too vnluckie were the nature of man, if oure soule (in the whiche this so feruent couetinge may lightlie arrise) should be driuen to nourish it with that onelye,<note place="margin">Sense.</note> whiche is commune to her with beastes, and coulde not tourn it to the other noble parte,<note place="margin">Reason.</note> whiche is propre to her. Therfore sins it is so your pleasure: I wil not refuse to reason vpon this noble mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And bicause I know my self vnworthy to talke of the most holye misteries of loue, I beseche him to leade my thought and my tunge so, that I may show this excelent Courtier how to loue contrarye to the wonted maner of the commune ignorant sort. And euen as from my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode I haue dedicated all my wholl lief vnto him, so also now that my wordes may be answerable to the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and to the prayse of him: I say therfore, that sins the nature of man in youthfull age is so much inclined to sense, it may be graunted the Courtier, while he is yong, to loue sensuallye. But in case afterwarde also in hys ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per yeres, he chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se to be set on fire with this coueting of loue, he ought to be good &amp; circumspect, &amp; heedful that he beeguyle not him self, to be lead willfullye into the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednesse, that in yonge men deserueth more to be pitied then blamed: and contrarywise in olde men, more to be blamed then pitied. Therfore whan an amiable

But in case it continue or encrease, then must the Courtier determine (when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth he is taken) to shonn throughlye all filthinesse of commune loue, and so entre into the holye way of loue with the guide of reason, and first consider that the body, where that beawtye shyneth, is not the fountaine frome whens beauty springeth, but rather bicause beautie is bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilesse and (as we haue said) an heauenlie shyning beame, she loseth much of her honoure whan she is coopled with that vile subiect and full of corruption,<note place="margin">Beawtye seuered fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Afterward let him obey, please, and honoure with all reuerence his woman, and recken her more deere to him then his owne lief, and prefarr all her commodites and pleasures beefore his owne, and loue no lesse in her the beauty of the mind, then of the bodye: Therfore let him haue a care not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her to renn into any errour, but with lessons and good exhortations seeke alwaies to frame her to modestie, to temperance, to true honestye, and so to woorke that there maye neuer take place in her other then pure thoughtes and farr wide from all filthinesse of vices.

Peter Bembo</hi> laughed and said: You must not <hi>(M. Morello)</hi> passe your boundes. I may tell you, it is not a small token that a woman loueth, whan she giueth vnto her louer her beawtye, which is so precious a matter: and by the wayes that be a passage to the soule (that is to say, the sight and the hearinge) sendeth the lookes of her eyes, the image of her countenance, and the voice of her woordes, that perce into the louers hart, and giue a witnes of her loue. <hi>M. Morello</hi> said: Lookes and woordes may be, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes are, false witnesses. Therfore whoso hath not a better pledge of loue (in my iudgement) he is in an yll assurance. And surelye I looked still that you would haue made this woman of yours somewhat more cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyous and free towarde the Courtier, then my <hi>L. Iulian</hi> hath made his: but (me seemeth) ye be both of the propretie of those iudges, that (to appeere wise) giue se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence against their owne. <hi>Bembo</hi> said: I am well pleased to haue this woman muche more courteyous towarde my Courtier not yonge, then the <hi>L. Iulians</hi> is to the yong: and that with good reason, bicause mine coueteth but honest matters, and therfore may the woman graunt him them all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame. But my <hi>L, Iulians</hi> woman that is not so assured of the modestye of the yonge man, ought to grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him the honest matters onlye, and denye him the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest. Therefore more happye is mine, that hath graunted him whatsoeuer he requireth, then the other, that hath parte graunted and parte denyed. And bicause you may moreouer the better vnderstande, that reasonable loue is more happye then sensuall, I saye vnto you, that self same thinges in sensuall ought to be denyed otherwhile, and in reasonable, graunted: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the one, they be honest, and in the other disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest.

            <head>A letter that the Author vvritt to the Lady Victoria Columna Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of Pescara, vvhom he mentioneth in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle before his booke.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MOST HONORABLE AND MY VERIE good Lady. I am much behouldinge to M. Thomas Tuke,</hi> bicause he was the occasion that your Ladishipp hath vouchsafed to write vnto me: which is most accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to me, and not without cause, consideringe I haue written so manye letters and coulde neuer receiue anye answere from you again, albeit they conteined sundrye matters. Truth it is indeede, that vnmeete it were your L. shoulde write vnto me, onlesse therewithall you vsed my seruice and commaunded me in what I am able to do for you. As touchinge <hi>M, Tuke,</hi> I will do as much for him, as shall lie in me to doe, both for your L. sake that may commaunde me, and for the brotherlye loue that I beare him. Where <hi>M. Gutteriz</hi> hath wrytten vnto you that I complayned of you, I wonder nothinge at it, for (to saye the troth) I vttred my greef a good while sins in a letter that I wrott vnto you your self, as I passed the mountaignes of <hi>Fraunce</hi> to come into <hi>Spaine.</hi> And he that toulde me the matter that caused it, was my L. Marquesse of <hi>Vasto,</hi> who showed me a letter of yours, in the which you your self confessed the stelth of the Courtyer. The whyche thynge I as then tooke in great good part, doubtynge nothynge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut that it shoulde remayne in youre handes, and be well kept vntyll I my self shoulde come to demaunde it of you.



<pb facs="tcp:22866:190"/>
At the last I was enfourmed by a Gentilman <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> who continueth still here in <hi>Spaine,</hi> that there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein Fragmentes of the poore Courtier in <hi>Naples,</hi> and he sawe them in the handes of sundrye men, and he that scattered it thus abrode reported that he had it of you. It was some greef to me, as a father that seeth hys chylde so yll handled: yet afterward yeeldyng to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I knewe he deserued not to haue anye more store made of him, but (like an vntymelye birth) to be left in the hygh waye for the benifit of nature. And so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly was I determined to do, consideringe yf there were any thinge in the Booke not yll, men woulde haue the woorse opinion of it, whan they shoulde see it so out of order. And no diligence shoulde preuaile any more to poolish it and to sett it furth, sins it had lost the thyng, which perhappes at the first was onlye it, that made it esteamed: that is to weete, the noueltye of the matter. And knowinge your saiynge to be true, that the cause of my complaint was verye triflynge, I resolued wyth my selfe, to leaue at the least my complaininge, though I coulde not my sorowynge. And that whyche I brake wyth <hi>M. Gutteriz</hi> (in case it be well wayed) was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. In conclusion others, more bent of a zeale then I was, haue enforced me to write hym ouer again, as the shortnesse of tyme hath serued me, and to sende hym to <hi>Venice</hi> to be put in print, and so haue I done. But if your L. shoulde suspect that the good will whiche I beare you were any deale feinted for this, your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shoulde deceyue you, whiche (I beleaue) it did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in all youre lief beefore: but rather I recken my selfe more bounde to you, bicause the necessity that droue me to make hast so spedilie to imprint it, hath saued me a great peece of labour, where I was once mynded to haue added manye other matters, which coulde be but of small moment as the rest are. And thus shall the reader haue the lesse labour and the Author lesse blame.

Therefore it is nowe past time eyther for you or me to repent or correct. And thus I take my leaue of you.</p>
