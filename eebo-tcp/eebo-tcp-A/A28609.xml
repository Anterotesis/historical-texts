            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The ſecond of theſe will be accompted for in the whole Series of the following Diſcourſe; but by naming the firſt, I know I have laid in a great prejudice againſt my ſelf, who does acknowledge the Mediocrity of my State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſomuch that Silence might have ſuited my ſtation, rather than Speech, eſpecially in Print, if the ſight of the Danger of the King and Kingdom were in, had not made a violent impreſſion upon me, as the Peril of <hi>Croeſus</hi> did upon his Dumb Son; for when ſuch Capital Miſeries are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who can be ſilent?</p>
            <p>They that impute Meanneſs and Inferiority to my charge, are like to have <hi>Confitentem reum;</hi> but the conſideration I reſerve my ſelf upon, is this, That God oft-times makes uſe of weak Inſtruments, having Truth on their ſide, to bring about great Deſigns, that ſo all the glory may be aſcribed to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Notable Mutations in the Government of this World have evened upon ſeemingly light and inconſiderable occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. I ſhall inſtance in that which was the talk of all <hi>Europe</hi> in its ſeaſon; And that was the action of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in reſigning up his Empire and all his other Dominions, and living af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a private and retired life. He had been a Prince of great Wars, and (generally) of proſperous Succeſſes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had the Pope himſelf, and the King of <hi>France</hi> both Priſoners, and extending his Victorious Banners to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt needs be ſome Signal and Remarkable thing you'l ſay, which occaſion'd ſo eminent a Change in ſuch a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103303:5"/>
Mighty Monarch; I'le tell you one great Reaſon thereof which the Hiſtorian relates: An Old Soldier of his came to him, deſiring a Diſcharge from his Military Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Emperour demanding his reaſon, received this anſwer, <hi>That there ought to be ſome reſpite between the work of a mans Life, and the buſineſs of his Death.</hi> Which Speech, tho ſeemingly light and obvious, yet wrought ſo great an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon his Mind, that he ſoon after followed the Old Soldiers example. Far be it from me to equalize Caſes; 'Tis ſufficient, if I can but adumbrate the rude Lineaments of a Similitude; for alas, what am I? And if it be lawful for me to uſe the names of others, what is Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Mowbray,</hi> but comparitively mean, and by ſome perſons ſlighted, affronted and diſcourag'd Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the hinge of ſo great Diſcoveries ſhould turn upon us. It is ſufficiently known, That the Deſign of the Papiſts hath been the iſſue of the Council of many years, managed by the skilfulleſt and deepeſt Heads of that Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now that all theſe productions ſo long a hatching, ſhould be cruſhed on a ſudden by, as it were, obſcure and unthought of Perſons, I will not ſay it honours the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, beeauſe I my ſelf am concerned amongſt them, but of this I am ſure it mightily exalts the name of God, who by men, otherwiſe deſpiſed, is pleaſed to do his own work. I will not diſpute whether Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> went over to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts upon any conviction of Judgment (that being a point proper for his own Determination) but for my deſertion of Proteſtancy, it is in part accounted for in my following <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations.</hi> I confeſs, to my ſhame, that worldly intereſts did concur too much thereof, as the conveniency of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward livelyhood and beneficial employment; and my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the reformed Religion was partly upon the guilty cognizance I had of this Black deſign, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſts vowed approbation thereof; Being ſo reduced to the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church, I hope God will ſo aſſiſt me with his Grace, that I ſhall be no ſcandal thereunto, but that I ſhall improve the ſtrict and holy principle thereof, even to the exemplifying of them in my own heart and life, ſo that I ſhall no more be deceived by the lying ſuggeſtions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Prieſts. For it is no ſmall encouragement to the diſſoluteneſs which is amongſt the Papiſts, The eaſineſs of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103303:5"/>
thoſe confeſſions which they undergo. And <hi>Sands</hi> in his <hi>Europae Speculum</hi> page the <hi>11th.</hi> will afford ample ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who hath theſe remarkable words; <hi>I have known</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>very devout perſons, who by their own report excuſe their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in matters criminal, having wittingly perjured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Judgment, only preſuming upon this preſent and eaſie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of Confeſſion, and others of more then ordinary note amongst them, who when the time of their Confeſſion was at hand, would then venture on thoſe actions, which before they trembled at, as preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to ſurfeit by reaſon of the Neigbourhood of a Phyſitian.</hi> And as for penances I have known (ſayes the ſame Author) <hi>page</hi> the <hi>12th.</hi> That penance for horrible and often Blaſphemy, beſides much other Lewdneſs, hath been no other then the bare ſaying their Beads thrice over, a matter of ſome hours muttering and which in <hi>Italy</hi> they diſpatch as they are going in the ſtreets, or diſpatch buſineſs at home, making no other of it then two Lips, and one Fingers work. And if <hi>Sandys</hi> be excepted againſt as a partial Author becauſe of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, let us hear what their own Caſuiſts ſay, <hi>Layman</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, That a Confeſſor is obliged to abſolve his penitent, tho he refuſe to perform the pennance enjoyned him; the reaſon he gives is, becauſe no man is bound to ſatisfie for his Sins in this life. Inſomuch that it is grown a queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them mentioned by <hi>Eſcobar;</hi> Whether it be not lawful for a Confeſſor to leave it wholly to the will of the Penitent. Add hereunto the doctrines of Pardons and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies, and then judge whether a large door for licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs and prophanity be not opened to the Profeſſors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>Theſe Doctrines of the Papiſts are ſo corrupt, that ſome of their own do condemn them; and to this purpoſe read what the <hi>Sorbon Doctors</hi> ſay againſt the Jeſuits. <hi>Moral Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Jeſuits,</hi> page 143, 144. <hi>When Biſhops and Prieſts were not without difficulty induced to proceed to the Reconciliation of Penitents to God, for fear of binding themſelves in thoſe Sins whereof they pretended to looſe others, whom, it may be, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Judge had not abſolved; Sinners, tho reconciled, continued in fear and humiliation, having their ſins ever before them; and after the practiſing of all ſorts of good Works, and ſubmiſsion to the rigour of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, they were ſtill afraid they had not ſatisfied the Justice of God. But now as if the most hainous</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103303:6"/>
               <hi>Crimes were as inconſiderable as the highest faults, and as eaſily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned as the ſmallest miſcarriages; as if the maladies of the Soul were not difficult to cure, and as if God had for the future for ever remitted the ſeverity of his Judgments againſt Sinners, from the time they followed the Advice of the Jeſuits; The most diſsolute Wretches are no ſooner abſolved by theſe Complacent Directors, but their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are in peace for all their ſins past, tho they are reſolved to commit them again.</hi> With much more to the ſame purpoſe. Judge then, whether the Flood-gate of Impiety be not opened by theſe Licentious Tenents. But to return.</p>
            <p>The manner how I came to be inſtrumental in theſe Matters, deſerves a Serious Conſideration, and adds much to the Wonder; for being born of Honeſt Parentage at <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine,</hi> I was by them bound an Apprentice in the City of <hi>London,</hi> where if I had ſerved out my full Time with my Maſter, I had not had the opportunity of knowing and conſequently of diſcovering what I now do; but after ſome Years Service, upon ſome private diſcontents, I left my Maſter, and liſted my ſelf a Soldier in His Majeſties Army, in which Military Employment if I had alſo perſiſted, I had been abridged of theſe matters: I muſt therefore look upon it as the Providence of God, who made both the Lives of an Apprentice and of a Soldier uneaſie to me, that ſo I might be carried into that Family, where the things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in my ſubſequent <hi>Informations,</hi> were managed and tranſacted; and without my reſidence therein, as one of their Religion and Family, I could never expect to know; for the Papiſts are very Sly to communicate any thing but to their own Confidents, and that too, under the ſtricteſt Bonds and Oaths of Secreſie.</p>
            <p>And indeed they keep their Proſelytes in great awe and ſubjection by thoſe Sacramental Obligations; I my ſelf am a great proof thereof, who had many ſuch Tyes impoſed upon me not to diſcover the Treaſon in which I was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: And if it were diſcovered by others, ſtill to deny it. And I muſt confeſs, (if I had perſevered in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I ſhould hardly have got over the Obligations I had layn under thereby: But by the Proteſtant Doctrine I am better informed, <hi>viz.</hi> That Oaths binding either to do or conceal unlawful things, the ſin lyes in taking, not in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103303:6"/>Being then by Gods Providence redeemed from thoſe inſnaring bonds, I am free to diſcover what I know.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, my Condition did confine me to my Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Countrey, and therefore I was not privy to the Conſults of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> until the Heads of thoſe Conſultations were communicated to us in the Countrey; which I muſt needs acknowledg was very ſpeedily done. For the Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> have an incredible celerity in conveying their Intelligence, not only to the ſeveral Parts of this Land, but even to <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, and all the World over; which is an old Complaint commenced againſt the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> by them of the Order of Seculars.</p>
            <p>I have heard it affirmed by ſome underſtanding men, That the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> are the greateſt Intelligencers in the World; for being both of them Cloſe and Compact Societies, united by the Oppoſitions generally made againſt them, their Communications are much Circumſcribed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their own Bodies, there being a conſtant Intercourſe, of Intelligence maintained betwixt all the parts (even as in the natural Body the ſpirits are diffuſed through the whole <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum</hi>) that ſo ſpeedy Remedies may be applyed to any appearing evil, in the very bud; and opportunities of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage may be taken by them at the firſt hop.</p>
            <p>And therein certainly their care and pains (if they were employed about lawful deſigns) do not deſerve reproof. Rather the too much Supineneſs and unactivity amongſt Proteſtants is to be taxed, as giving great advantage to the Adverſary to grow upon them: 'Twere well if this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience were remedied, and that our Zeal and Labour for the propagation of the Truth did exceed theirs, (as it ought to do) for the Diſſeminating of their Errors, <hi>Eas eſt et ab hoste doceri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> amongſt the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are the moſt Zealous for the propagation of their Religion in their old <hi>Mumpſimus</hi> way, and have the greateſt abilities and opportunities to intermix themſelves in Temporal affairs, to the Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of States and Kingdoms, and therefore they are look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon by this Nation as deſtructive to its Intereſt, their true religious intent being to murther all Heretical Kings (as they term them) which will not ſubmit to the Pope's obedience.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Informant</hi> deſires him to <hi>forbear</hi> to perſwade him thereunto, for he would not have any hand in <hi>Blood,</hi> neither would he do <hi>ſo wicked a deed.</hi> Then the ſaid Sr. <hi>Thomas</hi> deſired him <hi>of all loves</hi> to keep <hi>ſecret</hi> what he had ſaid which the <hi>Deponent</hi> promiſed, and ſo they parted, but though he promiſed ſecrecy both to the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Ruſhton,</hi> he thought it a <hi>ſin</hi> to <hi>conceal</hi> ſo wicked a thing; That ſoon after the ſaid 30th of <hi>May,</hi> he went to Mr. <hi>Normanton Miniſter of Water-Fryſton,</hi> who ſent him to Mr. <hi>Tyndall a Justice of Peace,</hi> and he ſent him to <hi>Willian Lowther</hi> Eſq; another <hi>Juſtice,</hi> (who acquainted <hi>Juſtice White</hi> with the <hi>Informants</hi> buſineſs) and upon diſcourſe thereof with the ſaid <hi>Justices,</hi> he this <hi>Informant</hi> did deſire he might come up to the <hi>Council</hi> to <hi>inform</hi> them of it; which the ſaid <hi>Justices</hi> thought was the beſt way; and <hi>Justice Tyndall</hi> wrote a Letter, and ſent it by him, to his <hi>Brother Tyndall,</hi> in <hi>London</hi> to carry him this <hi>Deponent,</hi> to ſome of the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> but this <hi>Informant</hi> ſaies, he had the misfortune to <hi>loſe</hi> his Letter at <hi>Ware,</hi> which being found and opened, was ſent after him to Mr. <hi>Tyndal</hi> at <hi>London.</hi>

            <p>And this <hi>Informant</hi> does very well remember, that in the ſaid Liſt, there was the particular names of <hi>Thomas Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> of <hi>Fenham,</hi> Eſq; Sir <hi>Marmaduke Conſtable</hi> of <hi>Everingham,</hi> and his Son, whoſe Prieſts name was <hi>Bankes,</hi> and is the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Prieſt for <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Iles</hi> of <hi>Ferry Friſton, Robert Stanfield</hi> of <hi>New-Hall,</hi> near <hi>Pontefract,</hi> who was ſaid to be deſigned to have fired <hi>Pontefract:</hi> There was alſo named in the Liſt Mr. <hi>Richard Townley</hi> of <hi>Townley,</hi> who keeps a Prieſt, whoſe name is reported to be <hi>John Sturdy,</hi> and as he is informed is now with him, <hi>Chriſtopher Medcalf,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Medcalf</hi> of <hi>Ottrington,</hi> Gentlemen, <hi>John Peircy</hi> of <hi>Stubbs,</hi> Gent. whom this <hi>Informant</hi> hath heard to be very much ingaged in the <hi>Plot,</hi> Doctor <hi>Peter Vavaſer,</hi> Eſquire <hi>Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> with ſeveral others whoſe names this <hi>Informant</hi> doth not at preſent remember: There was alſo their ſeveral Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions mentioned in the ſaid Liſt, which was given by them for the carrying on of the ſaid <hi>Deſign,</hi> but becauſe this <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi> did not take a Coppy of it, he cannot give a further account of the ſums particularly mentioned in the ſaid Liſt, further than he hath before declared.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Informant</hi> ſays, That a little after the Diſcovery of the Plot, the above mentioned <hi>Robert Stanfield,</hi> being with this <hi>Informant</hi> at a place called <hi>Wheldale,</hi> or <hi>Healdwood,</hi> he told him, this <hi>Informant,</hi> that there was a great Watch kept at <hi>Pontefract,</hi> and particularly towards his Houſe, and that the Mayor of <hi>Pontefract</hi> had a ſuſpition of him (as he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed)
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103303:15"/>
that he was to Fire <hi>Pontefract;</hi> and he alſo added that he was miſtaken, for he was not to have Fired <hi>Pontefract,</hi> unleſs the King had been <hi>Killed,</hi> and then he was to have had five hundred men in readineſs to have murdered all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants that they could meet with.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Informant</hi> alſo ſays, That at the ſame time he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a Letter to him, this <hi>Informant,</hi> which was directed to one <hi>William Hardwick,</hi> a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt, then at Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoignes</hi> Houſe, and he deſired him, this <hi>Informant,</hi> to bring him to his Houſe that night, but to be careful of him for fear he ſhould be Diſcovered; and that they had a great many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but he hoped ere long it would be otherwiſe: and he further added, that he very much relyed upon him, this <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi> becauſe that <hi>William Hardwick</hi> had told him that he was a very Honeſt and a Good Catholick, one fit to be truſted.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Informant</hi> did not convey the ſaid <hi>William Hardwick</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Robert Stanfields</hi> Houſe, but ſent his brother <hi>Thomas Baker,</hi> who conveyed him to <hi>Newhall</hi> in the night time, where he left him.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Informant</hi> further ſaith, That the aboveſaid <hi>Richard Iles,</hi> did tell him (having before ſhewed him, this <hi>Informant,</hi> his <hi>Altar</hi> with a Tabernacle upon it, and other Furniture belonging to a Roman Prieſt when he celebrates Maſs) That there would never be no good in the Nation until the Roman Catholick Religion were the chief in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>Informant</hi> further ſaith, That after the Diſcovery of the ſaid Plot, he did hear the before mentioned <hi>Richard York</hi> ſay, that he was very ſorry that the King was not killed, for then they needed not to have feared going from home, or have been tied within the bounds of five miles.</p>
            <p>He, this <hi>Informant,</hi> further ſaith, That he heard ſeveral Papiſts ſay, That Doctor <hi>Peter Vavaſer</hi> was gone to <hi>London</hi> with an intent to get an Order from His Majeſty and Privy Council to go beyond Sea, for fear he ſhould be diſcovered to be concerned in the Plot. He further ſaith, That Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:103303:15"/>
               <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> with others in his company, did ſeveral times mention the name of Eſquire <hi>Doleman,</hi> living in <hi>Peaſeholme Green</hi> in <hi>York,</hi> as a partner with them in their <hi>Deſigns,</hi> his Chriſtian name he doth not remember, but hath in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by the particular order of Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoigne, Thomas Gaſcoigne</hi> Eſq; and Lady <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> been deſired to recommend them kindly unto Mr. <hi>Doleman</hi> and Eſquire <hi>Doleman,</hi> which Letters were directed to <hi>William Hornecaſtle,</hi> ſervant to old Mr. <hi>Doleman,</hi> and hath likewiſe received ſeveral recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations back again to Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoigne</hi> and <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi> and Lady <hi>Tempeſt</hi> before mentioned.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Informant</hi> doth alſo remember, that in the year 1678. there hath been held at the Houſe of Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoigne,</hi> ſeveral Conſultations by the afore-mentioned perſons, for the carrying on the Plot, eſpecially a little before the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of it, they had a great Conſultation by thoſe whoſe names are mentioned before. For after this <hi>Informant</hi> was out of Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his ſervice, he did uſe the Houſe as much as when he was his ſervant, and thereby had opportunity to know it. This <hi>Informant</hi> does alſo remember, that he did hear Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoigne</hi> ſay unto the Lady <hi>Tempeſt</hi> in the year 1678. about the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> that he had ordered one hundred and fifty pounds to be ſent unto <hi>Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banke,</hi> to put the poor Catholiques in Arms, he hoping that ſhortly the Blow would be given; which money was to be ordered by Father <hi>Cornwallis</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Laſhalls,</hi> which money this <hi>Informant</hi> did hear Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoigne</hi> ſay afterwards that he had ſent it. And he did hear a Letter read, ſent by <hi>Cornwallis,</hi> wherein he did deſire Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoigne</hi>'s ſpeedy ſupply for the carrying on ſo great a <hi>Deſign,</hi> for that that ſum of one hundred and fifty pounds was too little; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoigne</hi> ſent immediately thirty pound more.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Informant</hi> further ſaith, That <hi>Francis Calvert</hi> and his Wife told him that there was a <hi>Deſign</hi> in hand, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of the Roman Catholick Religion, and then he hoped the Prieſts (meaning the Roman Catholick Prieſts) might go publickly, and then he ſaid he hoped to be Lord Mayor of <hi>York,</hi> and ſhe ſaid ſhe hoped to be Lady Mayoreſs
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103303:16"/>
of <hi>York,</hi> and they both made a ſcoffing at the Parſon of the Town, who was then going in that part of the ſtreet over againſt their Houſe, for then both of them ſaid that he was but a pitiful Preacher, and no more fit to preach a Sermon than they were fit to ſay Maſs, and that the Town did not love him becauſe he was a little inclined to favour the Presbyterian Faction. They further ſaid that they hoped ere long that he would be glad to hide his head in a corner, and Mrs. <hi>Calvert</hi> took up a knife lying upon the ſhop-board, and ſaid ſhe wiſhed it in the heart of all thoſe that would not be of her perſuaſion. And ſhe further ſaid, ſhe could freely kill the Parſon to do God good ſervice. The ſaid <hi>Francis Calvert</hi> told this <hi>Informant</hi> that he did of purpoſe procure himſelf to be made <hi>Sheriff</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> that he might the better underſtand how to rule if he were made Mayor. All which words were ſpoken to this <hi>Informant</hi> by them, another alſo being preſent, whom this <hi>Informant</hi> thinks was Mr. <hi>Calverts</hi> Daughter, and it is about a year ago, as this <hi>Informant</hi> remembers, ſince he heard the words ſpoken.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Informant</hi> ſays alſo, that there are ſeveral <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks who do keep Ale-Houſes, and under that pretence do Lodge Prieſts in their Houſes, and therefore this <hi>Informant</hi> leaves it to your Lordſhips Judgment, whether it be not fitting to put forth a Proclamation for all <hi>Popiſh</hi> Ale-Houſes to be put down.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Informant</hi> ſays, He knows by information where there does two or three <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts at certain times come, whoſe names are Mr. <hi>Winter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gerald</hi> or <hi>Gerard,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jennings,</hi> who this <hi>Informant</hi> does know very well to be Prieſts.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Informant</hi> does alſo further declare, That what he ſpeaks here is nothing but the real Truth, neither hath he Malice againſt any man, nor does he expect, think, or hope for any reward; but ſhall reckon himſelf very well rewarded if he can but ſerve his King and Country, and ſatisfie the World that the ſnares of Death were prepared for them.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Informant</hi> doth further confeſs, That he hath uſed his utmoſt endeavour to ſtifle the Plot, and to perſuade the world there was no Plot at all, which was contrary to his knowledg, and does humbly beg His Majeſties Gratious Pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:103303:16"/>This Informant ſays that <hi>William Banckes</hi> a School-maſter, living in <hi>High-Holborn,</hi> came to the Lodging of this Informant upon the ſixth of <hi>January;</hi> and being in a Room with him privately, he the ſaid <hi>William Banckes</hi> did ask him, this Informant, if <hi>Mary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks</hi> and <hi>Thomas Thwing,</hi> now Priſoners in <hi>Newgate,</hi> were to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Seſſions; to whom this Informant replyed, that he did not believe that they would be tryed untill the next Seſſions after this. Then the ſaid <hi>William Banckes</hi> ſaid, he was very glad to hear that good news, that he had been inquiring for him two or three times; and taking him, this Informant, by his Right Hand, and looking about him with an intent (as he himſelf confeſſed) that no body was near to over-hear our diſcourſe, then told this Informant that he had a very great ſecret to communicate unto him, but that he, this Informant, ſhould ſolemnly promiſe him that he would not diſcover it; to which this Informant replyed (not ſuſpecting any thing) that he would keep ſecret what ever he told him, this Informant think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he would diſcover ſome Prieſt, or other perſon that could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Informants Evidence: whereupon the ſaid <hi>William Banckes,</hi> told him, this Informant, that if he would not appear and give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt <hi>Mary Preſſickes,</hi> and the others in Cuſtody, that he would help him, this Informant, to a Friend that would give him a conſiderable ſum of money, and that it were better for him, this Informant, to take a ſum of Money, than to take lives, and that he was deſired by his Friend to ſpeak to this Informant about it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that he would ingage that it ſhould not be diſcovered, that he this Informant did take Money. But if this Informant would not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcond himſelf, but appear againſt the Priſoners, that then he would leſſen his Evidence againſt them; but not to ſpeak his full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them, and to do them all the favour that this Informant poſſibly could; but he could wiſh he, this Informant, would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; and that he would ingage him that he ſhould be well reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his pains; and that he was ſure, that if he, this Informant, would not appear and give in his Evidence againſt the Priſoners, no other Perſons would. Theſe words were ſpoken by the ſaid <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Banckes</hi> ſeveral times to him this Informant; to all which this Informant replyed, that he did intreat him to meet him, this Informant, next <hi>Thurſday</hi> again; and that then he would diſcourſe with him about it, but that he would not divulge to any the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between them.</p>
            <p>This Informant further ſays: That the ſaid <hi>William Banckes</hi> did promiſe him this Informant to meet him again on next <hi>Thurſday,</hi> to diſcourſe with him about it.</p>
            <p>This Informant further ſays, that he told the ſaid <hi>William Banckes,</hi> that he could hartily Wiſh to have had <hi>William Ruſhton</hi> (a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt) in Cuſtody; which ſaid <hi>William Banckes</hi> anſwered again, that he believed and durſt ingage this Informant, that I might have the ſaid <hi>Ruſhton,</hi> if this Informant would be but favourable to the reſt: and that he would inquire of his Friend, and bring him an anſwer on <hi>Thurſday</hi> next.</p>
