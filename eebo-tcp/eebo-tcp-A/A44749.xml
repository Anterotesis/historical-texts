            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But ther is none who hath written yet of <hi>Great Britain</hi> in relation to this Point; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tis the principal scope of this VVork, wherin ther is an Endevour to make Her bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understood; and to prove by Relevant and lively Resons, (without offence to any) That the Monark of <hi>Great Britain</hi> if He go not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> at least He ought not to come <hi>behind</hi> any King whatsoever.</p>

            <p>THe Ingredients and Matter wherof this New kind of <hi>Historical</hi> Peece is composd, may be said to be all of <hi>Crown</hi>-Gold, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject therof being <hi>Kings:</hi> Whence it is worth the observing, that <hi>History</hi> is a Lady of that <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence,</hi> that she hath <hi>Kings</hi> to her Subjects.</p>
            <p>We well know what a ticklish and tremendous Task it is to treat of <hi>Kings,</hi> who have power of Life and Death; Ther must be as much <hi>Caution</hi> as <hi>Care</hi> usd therin; It is as <hi>perilous</hi> as it is <hi>painful:</hi> It is as walking upon the Ridg of a high House, or dancing upon a Rope, where unless one be well counterpoizd, he is in danger to break his Neck; Especially a task of this high nature, that treats of <hi>Regal Precedence.</hi> And we find that they who write too peremptorily thereof, have done it with more <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> then <hi>satisfaction.</hi> And indeed ther was never any binding Determination made therof, but where Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have bin made, the Princes upon new occasions have excepted or protested against them: Therfore the Author here doth not presume to determine the Question positively and definitively <hi>en dernier ressort;</hi> for</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:59014:4"/>Therfore he refers it to the Discerning Reader, who is left free, and evry way unsubornd to pass his Iudgment accordingly, in mesuring evry King by the merit of his own <hi>Resons,</hi> which are here fairly and faithfully exhibited; and those of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> exactly drawn out of their own Authors, having not omitted any that hath any weight.</p>
            <p>Now, tis found among Historians, that Contestations about Precedence of Session and Superiority, with other Formalities, Complements, Visits and Ceremonies, have bin very fatal to <hi>Christendom;</hi> And tis observd also that the various Dignities in the Church hath multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: The great Clash twixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> (twixt St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Andrew</hi>) was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy cause of the Defection and total Separation of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church from the <hi>Latin:</hi> The hot Dispute for Precedence twixt the Emperour <hi>Frederiki</hi> and Pope <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian 4.</hi> did put all the Christian world on fire: The great Oecumenical Council at <hi>Lyons,</hi> which concernd so much the interest of <hi>Christendom,</hi> broke up about Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilios for Precedencie: The great Contest twixt <hi>Patriarks</hi> and <hi>Cardinals</hi> bred a great deal of confusion; but at last the <hi>Patriarks</hi> had the better, for they of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Hierusalem, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> precede the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> though they be calld the <hi>Princes</hi> of the Church, and have the Prerogative not to be tryed without 72 Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, I mean the <hi>Bishop-Cardinals;</hi> 44 Witnesses the <hi>Cardinal-Priests,</hi> and 30 the <hi>Deacon-Cardinal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the 24 Causes, (and it proved the greatest) that the <hi>English</hi> lost <hi>France,</hi> was a Clash that happend at St. <hi>Omers</hi> twixt the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> about Punctilios of Complement and Precedency. That hopeful Trety of Peace at <hi>Bullen</hi> twixt Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Brother-in-law <hi>Phil. 2.</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> after a long lingring War by Sea and Land, broke off for question of <hi>Precedence,</hi> or rather for the peevishness of the <hi>Spanish</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59014:4"/>
Ambassadors, who had no other Argument that had any probability of reson, but that the <hi>Catholik</hi> King was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasd in Territories; wheras the <hi>Civilians</hi> say, that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervenient and Accessory Dominions, with accumulation of Titles, have no force twixt Princes all the while they continue still in <hi>eodem gradu dignitatis.</hi> Nor could they give any answer at all to the Arguments the English <hi>Ambassadors</hi> producd, wherof one was, that of <hi>Volater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus,</hi> who doth plainly relate how the Pope did adjudge the Prerogative of Precedence to <hi>Hen. 7.</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> as it will appeer more at large in the following Discours.</p>
            <p>Now, ther have bin divers means found by prudent Mediators from time to time for accommoding and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement of differences in point of <hi>Precedence;</hi> somtimes by <hi>dilatorious</hi> ways; somtimes by <hi>Alternatif</hi> Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, yet <hi>Jure Partium integre reservato;</hi> As the great clash twixt <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Buckingham</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was composd that they shold precede <hi>alternatim</hi> evry three yeers; so the hot contest twixt the <hi>Ursini</hi> and the <hi>Colonnas,</hi> two of the antientst Families in <hi>Rome,</hi> was reconcild, that the <hi>elder</hi> of the two who were living, shold precede, which makes the younger never come to the Popes Chappel, where they take place next Kings Ambassadors. The difference <hi>Inter Scherensem, &amp; Wolfeggianam Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliam</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> was reconcild, that the one shold carry the <hi>Pomum Aureum,</hi> the Golden Apple of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire going in, the other at going out. Among <hi>Artificers,</hi> and Men of Trade, the <hi>Civilians</hi> say, that each one is to precede according to the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Stuff</hi> wheron they work. Moreover, when Publik <hi>Instruments</hi> are made, <hi>that Kingdom</hi> in whose Right tis made hath the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, so somtimes <hi>Scotland</hi> is namd before <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> General Precedences do differ according to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of some Nations; as among the <hi>Turks,</hi> to go on the <hi>left</hi> hand is more honorable <hi>sedendo &amp; incedendo</hi> in

sitting and going then on the <hi>right;</hi> and the reson is good, because he may seaze upon his Companions Sword at ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. In <hi>Spain</hi> the Pages and Laquays go before, and the Lords follow; And in some cases tis so in <hi>France,</hi> as in going over a Bridg, a Plank or a River, the Man goes before the Master, according to the old Proverb,</p>

            <p>Concerning <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> ther is a way that they shall never clash, which is, to make them <hi>Parallels, viz.</hi> that the Ambassadors of those Kings who stand in competition for Precedence, do never <hi>meet</hi> (unless it be in visiting one another) And the Mathematician tells us, That <hi>Parallelae etiamsi ducantur in infinitum nunquam concurrent,</hi> Parallels although they be drawn <hi>in infinitum,</hi> they will never meet; and if <hi>Ambassadors</hi> never meet, they will never jussle or jarr.</p>

            <p>TOuching the Matter and Method in framing this Work, it is by dividing it into four <hi>Compartments, viz.</hi> into four <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> The first three treat of the Precedence of <hi>Kings;</hi> The fourth of <hi>Ambassadors.</hi> Evry one of the Sections is <hi>subdivided</hi> into ten heads or Paragraphs, containing still new matter.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>The first Section consists of the Resons of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <list>
                  <item>First, That He had to his Predecessors as ancient Kings as <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and as famous; among others <hi>Mulmutius Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallo,</hi> who raignd here many hundred yeers before the <hi>Romans</hi> came in, and he was so great a Legislator, that his Laws are calld <hi>Leges Mulmuntinae,</hi> and stand upon record to this day. Moreover, his Majesty now Regnant is the hundred thirty ninth King of <hi>Britain,</hi> and the hundred and ninth of <hi>Scotland;</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as neither <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>France</hi> can shew a Catalog of half the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> had to his Predecessor the first <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> King that ever was upon earth, <hi>viz.</hi> King <hi>Lucius,</hi> according to the concurrent Opinion of all Antiquaries, for St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Cornhil</hi> was built by him, as a Record yet extant shews; and this was many hundred yeers before <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> had any <hi>Christian</hi> King, which made <hi>England</hi> to be entitled in all dispatches from <hi>Rome, Primogenita Ecclesiae,</hi> the first-born Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Church. Now, it is a Canon among the Civilians, <hi>Summa Ratio quae ducitur à Religione;</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> hath also a Principle, <hi>Qui primò Christianismum professi sunt Praecedant,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>3. The King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath a <hi>Merum &amp; immixum Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi> he hath as absolut Possession and Authority, and more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent then <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> take Spiritual and Temporal together.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59014:6"/>4. The King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> for Eminence of Royal Dignity, for State and Titles, hath as fair Flowers, He hath as rich Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els in his Crowns as any other; He hath as Noble Arms, the Cross, and the <hi>Lyon</hi> who is <hi>King</hi> of Animals.</item>
                  <item>5. The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> had to his Predecessor the first Christian Emperour <hi>Constantin,</hi> and the first Christian Worthy <hi>Arthur</hi> the first Founder of Martial <hi>Knighthood,</hi> whom ther is <hi>Truth</hi> enough to make <hi>Famous</hi> without that which is thought <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britains</hi> Predecessors were the first who freed themselfs from the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke long before <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain;</hi> and this is one of the greatest Arguments that those <hi>Kings</hi> do produce for a Precedence one of another.</item>
                  <item>7. The <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> had <hi>Precedence</hi> adjudgd Them both of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> in General <hi>Councils,</hi> as also by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Popes, as it will appeer in the following Discours.</item>
                  <item>8. The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is <hi>Souverain</hi> of as Noble an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Knighthood</hi> as any in <hi>Christendome,</hi> wherof eight <hi>Emperours,</hi> and well neer eight times as many <hi>Kings</hi> have bin, and is more ancient then the Royal Orders of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>9. The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath had as Martial and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Progenitors as any of the other two, who performd great Acts both far and neer; and touching Exploits in the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> had little share in them.</item>
                  <item>10. The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath as free-born and strong sturdy Peeple of four several Nations to make Soldiers of, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain:</hi> He hath the best Mariners, the stoutest Men of War, the Noblest Haven, for so <hi>Milford</hi> is accounted by all Geographers: He hath the Inaccessiblest Coasts, with the greatest Command and Power at Sea both Defensive and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of any <hi>King</hi> whatsoever.</item>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Emperour,</hi> ther never was any question or controversie of their Precedencies, and consequently of their <hi>Representatives</hi> in all Transactions and Signatures, at all Oecumenical Councils, with other Public Meetings, being allowed to the <hi>One</hi> (by those who are devoted to him by way of <hi>Filiation</hi>) as he is held The Vica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of Christ, The Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, The Holy Father, who hath the command of the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Sword which strikes deep, having Dominion over the <hi>Noblest</hi> part of Man which is the <hi>Soul;</hi> Insomuch that some have magnified <hi>Him</hi> so far, and fallen to such an excess of speech, as to say, That He antecels all Temporal Princes as much as the <hi>Soul</hi> excels the <hi>Body.</hi> Nor do they onely allow him Priority of place, but out of high Ideas of Holiness, both <hi>Emperour</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> esteem it a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to hold the Bason and Towel when he washeth his hands; nay, to hold his Stirrop and Bridle, yea to kiss his Feet: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Poet, who gives this Character of Him:</p>
            <q>Ense potens Gemino, Cujus vestigia adorat <hi>Caesar,</hi> &amp; aurato vestiti murice <hi>Reges.</hi>
            </q>
            <q>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59014:9"/>He who commands the Two-edg'd Sword, whose Feet <hi>Caesar,</hi> and crowned <hi>Kings</hi> with Kisses greet.</q>
            <p>Insomuch that when at the great Ceremony of his Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Cardinal-Bishop of <hi>Ostia,</hi> the Papal Mitre is put on his head, the chief Deacon says aloud, <hi>Accipe Tiaram tribus orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum coronis, &amp; scias Te esse Patrem Regum, &amp; Rectorem orbis,</hi> &amp;c. Receive the Mitre adorned with three Crowns; and know, that thou art the Father of Kings, and Rector of the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence is derived the Precedence that all other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have; as at the Election of the Emperour, the three <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical</hi> Electors, <hi>viz.</hi> the Archbishops of <hi>Mentz, Colen,</hi> and <hi>Triers,</hi> take place of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and all the rest. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, out of a special Veneration of the Church, when the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Oath is read and administred unto them to be just in their choice, the Archbishops put their hands onely upon their <hi>Breasts,</hi> whereas all the Secular Electors hold their hands upon the <hi>Book</hi> all the while. Adde hereunto, that the <hi>Cardinals</hi> being Princes of the Church, deduce such a Pre-eminence from the <hi>Pope,</hi> that they take Precedence of all Ambassadours whose Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are devoted to the Roman See.

               <head>Of the Emperour.</head>
               <p>WE come now to wait on the Emperour, who retains still the Title of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Semper Augustus:</hi> He also is stil'd <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Divus;</hi> and his Edicts are call'd <hi>Sancita Divalia,</hi> God-like Decrees. For many Descents the Empire continued in the Race of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> until <hi>Domitius Nero</hi>'s time; then the Name of <hi>Caesar</hi> grew to be <hi>Accidental,</hi> and given by way of <hi>Adoption</hi> to the Heir apparent of the Empire, whereas before he was call'd <hi>Princeps Iuventutis:</hi> and when the <hi>Western</hi> Empire came to be reviv'd in <hi>Charlemain,</hi> the next to succeed was term'd <hi>King of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but now he is created King of the Romanes; which Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> was the first who rais'd <hi>Rome</hi> to an Empire, though it cost him dear: for the Foundation thereof was cimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59014:9"/>
with his own blood, being assassinated in the Senat by his nearest Confidents in compassing that great work: whereby 'tis observable what an extraordinary kinde of Fate did betide that City: for as the first Foundation thereof was sprinkled with <hi>Blood</hi> when <hi>Romulus</hi> caus'd his Brother <hi>Rhemus</hi> to be put to death, when the first Walls thereof were erecting; so the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire was afterwards first raised by <hi>Caesar's Blood.</hi> And the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Empire she enjoys since, may also be said to have been raised by the <hi>Blood</hi> of Christian Martyrs, among whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty of the first <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> were of the number.</p>
               <p>Now, if one should compare the present Roman Empire with the <hi>Old</hi> when it was at the highest flourish, the Parallel would bear no more proportion then a <hi>Wren</hi> (who yet is call'd in Latine <hi>Regulus,</hi> a little <hi>King</hi>) doth hold with an <hi>Eagle:</hi> for the Roman Monarchy when she was at the greatest pitch of Sublimity and Altitude of Puissance and Glory, may be said to have no Horizon, no Termination (as the Author hath it else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) while she sate upon her seven Hills, she may be said to have overlooked the World. The City of <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>then</hi> fifty Miles in circuit; five hundred thousand Free Citizens were computed to sleep within her Walls, by that famous Cense which <hi>Vopiscus</hi> speaks of. The Roman Eagle fixed his Talents upon the banks of <hi>Euphrates</hi> Eastward; on the <hi>Nile,</hi> and the Mountains of the Moon, <hi>South;</hi> on the <hi>Danube</hi> and <hi>Rhin</hi> North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and <hi>West,</hi> as far as the British and German Ocean. Her annual Revenues were computed at 150 Millions, whereof the Salary of her Legionary Soldiers amounted yearly to above 20 Millions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that high-soaring Eagle, who with full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summ'd Wing flew so far, and may be said to have the <hi>Sun</hi> himself for her Companion, now with a few broken and tatter'd flaggy Plumes flies onely twixt <hi>Danube</hi> and the <hi>Rhin;</hi> and were she not <hi>impd</hi> with <hi>Austrian</hi> Fethers, she wold be as bald as a new-pluck'd Capon.</p>
               <p>Yet for all this Fatal <hi>Stoop,</hi> had the Emperour at present all <hi>Germany</hi> entirely subject to himself, as he <hi>precedes</hi> in <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> so he might haply compare in <hi>Power</hi> with any one <hi>Christian</hi> Prince: for <hi>Almaine</hi> or <hi>Teutony</hi> is a Continent of such a vast Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion, that it might give the Law to any one single Kingdome in <hi>Europe</hi> were it subject to one Head. But the Emperour <hi>in statu quo nunc,</hi> may be said to be but <hi>Titulary</hi> Emperour of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi> for of those <hi>Ten Circles</hi> where into it is divided, <hi>viz. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi> High and Low, <hi>Franconia, Bavaria, Saxonia, Westphalia,</hi> the Lower Circle of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the two <hi>Palatinats,</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> he hath no absolute Authority but onely in <hi>Austria,</hi> which is his Patrimonial Inheritance. The Government of the rest, though it be <hi>principally</hi> in the Emperour, 'tis <hi>diffusedly</hi> in the Dier or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59014:10"/>
Parlement, but <hi>contractedly</hi> and actually in the seven Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who have a kinde of <hi>Ius Regale</hi> in them, as power of Life and Death, Coyning of Moneys, Levying of Men, and settling what Religion they please; it being a Rule and Prerogative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, That <hi>Quilibet Imperii Status tantum possit in suo Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torio, quantum Imperator in toto Imperio:</hi> Every State of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire hath as much power in his own Territory, as the Emperour hath in the whole Empire. Yet they cannot make any League or Confederacy with any other Prince, but with this Reservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That it be not prejudicial to the common Peace of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>Now we finde that there were many fatal Causes which concurred to bring the Roman Empire to so low an ebb: The first was the Translation of the Imperial Court from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Bizantium</hi> or <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whereby the Eagle grew to be a Monster with two heads, the one looking <hi>Eastward,</hi> the other <hi>West:</hi> yet he of the <hi>East</hi> stil'd himself still for about 400 years The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, governing the West by Deputies; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time, a world of tough <hi>Northern</hi> Nations broke into <hi>Italy</hi> to draw nearer the <hi>Sun;</hi> and <hi>there</hi> as well as in other places, took firm footing, until <hi>Charlemain</hi> chac'd them away, who first stil'd himself <hi>Emperour of the West</hi> by an Agreement made with <hi>Nicephorus</hi> at <hi>Constantinople:</hi> which <hi>Western</hi> Empire also received soon after a fatal Blow by the Partition that his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> the Debonnaire made to finde Portions for his three Sons; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire came to be coop'd up at last with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>German</hi> Pale: and since that time it stands upon Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Records, how from the Raign of <hi>Rodolph</hi> the first, above 200 Princes, States, and Imperial Cities, have dismembred and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancipated themselfs from the Empire; some by working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Emperours Necessities, and furnishing him with <hi>Tresure</hi> to support his Wars; and for their <hi>Moneys</hi> they had <hi>Immunities</hi> granted them equivalent to a Releasement from Subjection. Moreover, as the Popes Temporal Dominions most of them were <hi>Plumes</hi> taken from the Roman <hi>Eagle,</hi> so the change of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by the <hi>Lutherans</hi> did much weaken him, for many since revolted quite from him without paying any thing. the last were the <hi>Lituanians,</hi> the <hi>Swisses,</hi> and <hi>Geneva;</hi> the first fell from <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who summoning them to their Obedience, and threatning else to reduce them by Arms, they returned this jeering Answer, That they believed <hi>his Horse wold tire before he could reach the Skirts of Lituania.</hi> And the <hi>Swisse</hi> falling from their <hi>Spiritual</hi> Obedience to the Pope, fell also from their <hi>Temporal</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to the Emperour, and to have any thing to do with the Chamber of <hi>Spire.</hi>

               <p>Nevertheless, though in point of <hi>Power</hi> and Territories the <hi>Emperour</hi> be grown so weak and naked in comparison of what he was, yet in point of <hi>Precedence</hi> and Dignity he bears up still the same, being accounted the prime Potentat, and Prince para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of <hi>Christendome.</hi> And well may all <hi>Christian</hi> Kings esteem him so, in regard that their Territories may be said to be but Branches of the great Roman <hi>Tree,</hi> which falling off, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king new Roots, they began to taper up, and grow to be Regal <hi>Trees</hi> of themselfs. <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as she was the <hi>last</hi> that was reduced under the Roman Yoak, so she was the <hi>first</hi> who shook it off, and enfranchiz'd her self: which is no mean honour and advantage to her <hi>King</hi> in point of Precedence, as will appeer more at large in the ensuing Discourse.</p>
               <p>Nor is the <hi>Emperour</hi> and his Ministers thus esteem'd among <hi>Christian</hi> Kings onely, but also by the <hi>Turk,</hi> who stiles him still the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, and next himself the greatest Monarch; reputing his Ambassadours accordingly, by allowing them to have Palaces in <hi>Constantinople</hi> the same side the <hi>Seraglio</hi> is on; and they go always <hi>concomitant</hi> with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it removes. They have the Precedence given them of the Ambassadors both of the <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Tartar,</hi> notwithstanding that the first holds himself the greatest Potentat upon Earth, having a custome duely observed, that after Dinner an Officer winds a Trumpet at his Court-gate towards the four parts of the world, to give notice to all other Princes that he hath Dined al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and so <hi>they</hi> may go now all to Dinner. And concerning the <hi>Persian,</hi> the example of the Lo. <hi>David Ungnadius</hi> shall serve, who being Ambassador in the Turks Court for the Emperour, and coming for Audience to the <hi>Duana,</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassador had come before, and got the Chair; but <hi>Ungnadius</hi> offering to go away, the Gran Visier caus'd an upper Chair to be put for him.

               <p>All this is but <hi>Collateral</hi> to the main Designe of the intended Discourse, which aims chiefly at <hi>Kings,</hi> whereunto we now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten; but we will first give a few Hints or <hi>Prolegomenas</hi> of the Original of <hi>Kingly</hi> Government.</p>

               <head>Of Royalty, or Kingly Government.</head>
               <p>THere is a Saying in <hi>France, Pape par voix, Empereur par Force, Roy par Nature:</hi> Pope by Choice, Emperour by Might, King by Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> Successive, and Hereditary Kings who ought to have the Precedence of <hi>Elective.</hi> Whence may be inferred, That <hi>Kingly</hi> Government is most agreeable to Nature. Now 'tis a tru and elegant Principle, That <hi>Naturam sequi est Deo obsequi;</hi> To follow Nature is to obey God.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Character or Title of <hi>King,</hi> it is of a more ancient date then that of <hi>Emperour.</hi> For they who grope at Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment before the <hi>Floud,</hi> speak of <hi>Kings</hi> in <hi>Chaldee</hi> and <hi>Egypt. Rome</hi> began with <hi>Kings,</hi> and it may be said, that it was more the <hi>Peeples Wantonness</hi> then <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s which put them down. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Name of <hi>Emperour</hi> was given to that person who was Commander in chief of the Army or Praetorian Bands, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionary Soldiers: it was not a Title of that Sublimity and Transcendence as it proved afterward. Among the Greek Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors the Names of Monarchs, Kings and Emperours are taken promiscuously: But all Writers that pretend to Policy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that <hi>Kingly</hi> Government of all other as it is the most ancient, (and may be said to begin with <hi>Adam</hi>) so it hath most conformity with that of Heaven, whence the best patterns for all Humane Actions are to be fetch'd, and 'tis no presumption to do it. Moreover, of all kinde of Ruling Powers, <hi>Royalty</hi> is the prime; for in <hi>it,</hi> as the Civilians say, there is <hi>formalis, &amp; completa gubernandi ratio,</hi> the most formal, and compleat Essence of Government. <hi>Royalty</hi> also hath the easiest, the fewest, and certainst Principles, (if any <hi>certain</hi> can be found) for there is no Knowledge so subject to confusion and incertitudes, as the Art for Man to govern Men; It could never yet be brought to a <hi>Science,</hi> which consists of general and tru Apodictical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations. The Reason may be, the various Inclinations, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prichio's, and Humours of Peeple, proceeding from the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Climes, and Coelestial Influences; as also, from that World of Contingencies which attend Human Negotiations; likewise from the diffring Positions of Earth, for those Laws and kinds of Government which may be proper for the <hi>Continent,</hi> will not fit an <hi>Insulary</hi> Peeple; nor those Laws of a <hi>Maritime</hi> Country can sute with meer <hi>Inland,</hi> or Mediterranean Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: Therefore, that <hi>Gran Senior</hi> of all Knowledge, the <hi>Stagirite,</hi> whereas he useth to be constant to himself while he gives Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes for other <hi>Sciences,</hi> when in his <hi>Politiques</hi> he comes to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Government, and beats his Brain how to prescribe certain Rules conducing thereunto, He is not found onely at a loss, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59014:11"/>
wavering to himself, but he wraps his Scholars here and there in Clouds of Ambiguities. Nor can we blame him and others to rove up and down in that manner upon this subject, it being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the compass of Human Brain to enact such Laws may fit all times, prevent all accidents, and quadrat with the Genius of all Nations. Some Peeple are so fiery-mouth'd that they must be rid with a <hi>Bit, Curb,</hi> and <hi>Martingale;</hi> but a snaf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Yet it may be said, that there is one certain and Universal Rule for Government, and to keep a Peeple in a constant and exact Obedience; and that Rule is, For the Soveraign Prince to have always a standing and visible actual Power in motion, as well to conserve as to <hi>curb</hi> a Peeple in case of any Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And 'tis consentaneous to good Reason, that the Subject shold contribut for this general Protection, according to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Defend me, and spend me;</hi> that so evry one may rest under his own Roofs, and sit at his own Fires in quietness and safety.

               <p>IT is observed by most Annalists who write of Countries and Nations, that the <hi>Britains</hi> who were the <hi>Aborigenes,</hi> the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Inhabitants, and may be said to be <hi>Connatural</hi> with this Iland it self, were by a special instinct much devoted to the contemplation of heavenly things: For the ancient <hi>Druydes</hi> that were the first <hi>Divines</hi> or Professors of Religion, (who in lieu of Monasteries or Colleges, were used to retire themselfs to Woods and solitary places to speculat the Works of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) were renowned far and near beyond the Seas; and the Emperour <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> writes, that the <hi>Gaules</hi> (now <hi>French</hi>) were wont to come over to be instructed by the <hi>British Druydes,</hi> who, as he saith elsewhere, and is seconded by <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> (which spent part of his life here) had more pregnant capacities then the <hi>Gaules.</hi> Now, in those times ther were divers Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Kings here, whereas they scarce make mention of any in <hi>Gallia.</hi> To avoid prolixity, we will instance onely in <hi>Boadicia</hi> that admired Virago, and <hi>Cataractus,</hi> who having maintain'd for many years this Kingdom from the <hi>Romanes</hi> more by the Bodies of Men, and pure Natural Valour, then by <hi>Arms,</hi> was at last carried Prisoner to <hi>Rome,</hi> where being not a whit daunted, he reproach'd the <hi>Romanes,</hi> (yet with a kind of complement) That he wondred how <hi>they</hi> having such stately Palaces at <hi>Rome,</hi> wold take such long hazardous Journeys to dwell in homely Houses of Clay, as those of <hi>Britain</hi> were in those days. Before the <hi>Romans</hi> raigned here, there had been very many Kings of this Iland, for <hi>Cassibelan</hi> whom <hi>Caesar</hi> speaks of, was the sixty third British
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59014:13"/>
King thereof; when it pleased the <hi>Father of Light</hi> to display the early Beams of Christianity in this Iland, which was very betimes: for, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the 15th says in his Letter to his late Majesty at that time in <hi>Spain,</hi> (which he was to receive in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon civility as the <hi>Pope</hi> is also a Temporal <hi>Prince) No sooner did the Roman Eagle fly over hither, but the Standard of the Cross was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arborated and set up:</hi> I say, that <hi>then,</hi> which may be said to be in the nonage of the Church, <hi>Lucius Surius,</hi> call'd in <hi>British, Llei vab Coel Lucius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Coel,</hi> (who was King before him) sent to <hi>Eleutherius</hi> for his Laws to govern the Church by, who returned him this answer: <hi>Vicarius Dei estis in Regno vestro, Gentes vestri Regni pulli vestri sunt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Habetis penes vos legem, &amp; Fidem Christi; Habetis utram<expan>

You are Gods Vicar in your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, your Peeple are your Chickins; you have the Law, and Faith of Christ; you have both the Testaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This King <hi>Lucius</hi> afterwards having frequent symptomes and fits of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Devotion, forsook all earthly Pomp and Plesure, and went on Pilgrimage to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he employed the remnant of his life in the Theory of holy things, and to study the Art of <hi>Mortification,</hi> as Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> with all Authors both Old and New, do affirm.</p>
               <p>Now, this was a long tract of time before ther was any <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> King in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or indeed any where else. 'Tis true, that St. <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle was in <hi>Spain,</hi> but as the Story says, there were but nine persons that were converted; but in <hi>Great Britain</hi> it may be said, that as the Sun when he begins to appear and culminat in the East, doth as it were in a moment enlighten the whole Hemisphere; so the Rays of the <hi>Son of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes</hi> did with marvellous celerity and success (leaping over as it were many other Countries) illuminat this <hi>Western</hi> Iland first, insomuch that when <hi>Austin</hi> (whom many call <hi>The Apostle of the Saxons</hi> or English) arrived here some Ages after, ther were <hi>then</hi> in <hi>Bangor</hi> and elsewhere above 2000 Monks.

               <p>And as it is the consentient Opinion of all Antiquaries, That the first <hi>Christian</hi> King who ever raign'd in <hi>Europe</hi> was of this Ile, so the first <hi>Christian</hi> Emperour (<hi>Constantin</hi> the Great) came from her Bowels, being Son to <hi>Helena</hi> that renowned <hi>British</hi> Lady, who bears one of the first places in the Catalogue of Saints, and is called <hi>Elen luyddiog</hi> (the Warlike <hi>Helen</hi>) in <hi>Welc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> to this day.</p>
               <p>These Premises being well weigh'd, this Conclusion may be deduc'd, That the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> may well claim <hi>de Iure</hi> the title of <hi>The first Son of the Church.</hi> Therefore, under favor, it may be justly question'd why the next King <hi>Eastward</hi> shold as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it; for <hi>Clouis</hi> the first Christian King in <hi>France</hi> was neer upon 400 years after King <hi>Lucius,</hi> as all Historians do assert.</p>
               <p>Moreover, tis well known that besides the title of <hi>Defendor of the Faith,</hi> (whereof we will speak hereafter) the title of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissimus</hi> was sent to <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. with much solemnity by Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the second, accompanied with a Cap of Maintenance, and a Sword; which title was confirmed by Authority of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council: which great transaction was solemnly publish'd in the Cathedral Church of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and seconded with Justs and Tournements; yet this was but the renewing of an old <hi>Title,</hi> for among the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings some were call'd so, and ther are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords yet extant that King <hi>Oswald</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the third were stil'd so.</p>
               <p>We will conclude this Paragraph with this Observation, That <hi>Great Britain</hi> was the first Country in <hi>Europe</hi> who shook off the Roman Yoak, and rais'd some of the former old British Blood to be Kings again for many Descents, insomuch that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans here made but an <hi>Interregnum:</hi> And this was before any absolut King was elsewhere in <hi>Europe</hi> upon the declinings of the Empire, specially in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> who continued but Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Provinces</hi> many years after. We will now to the second Paragraph.</p>

               <head>Of the Independent, Absolut and Unhomageable Possessions and Authority, both Ecclesiastical and Temporal, of the King of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FRom the precedent Paragraph it appears, That <hi>Albion</hi> or <hi>Great Britain</hi> was a Royal Ile from the beginning, since
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59014:14"/>
there was any coalition or aggregations of mankind within her to govern. For in the body of the British Laws made by <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutius Dunwallo,</hi> which are yet to be read in fair <hi>British</hi>-Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts, ther are these words, <hi>Un Goron arbennig y sydd y ynis Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian;</hi> One Monarchical Crown is held in the Ile of <hi>Britain:</hi> Just according to the ancient Greek Poet:</p>
               <q>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </q>
               <q>Many Lords are not good, let there be but One.</q>
               <p>Now from that time to this, the King of <hi>Britain</hi> had and hath as Souveraign and incontroulable a sway as any. 'Tis true that he admits others sometimes to share with him in <hi>Counsel,</hi> but not in <hi>Power:</hi> by a kind of Influence he <hi>gives</hi> Light and <hi>Command</hi> to others, but he himself <hi>receives</hi> none from any.</p>
               <p>In the Neighbouring Monarchies it cannot be said so, and particularly in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> where it may be said ther is <hi>Regnum in regno,</hi> ther is another Power <hi>à Legatus de latere,</hi> that in a <hi>Court of Plea</hi> sways ore the <hi>Ecclesiastiques</hi> who make a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the Peeple. Touching the latter, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is <hi>Feodary</hi> either to the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> or to <hi>France,</hi> for all the Countries he hath: The Kingdomes of <hi>Navarre</hi> and <hi>Granada</hi> were made Feodary to the Pope under <hi>Iulius</hi> the second: <hi>Aragon</hi> to <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, as also <hi>Sardinia in formula fiduciae. Sicilia</hi> is relevant from the Church, as also both the <hi>Indies</hi> and the <hi>Canary</hi> Ilands. For the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Calabria</hi> he sends a Mule, with a Purse-full of Gold, as a Heriot to <hi>Rome</hi> evry year, (for fear of an Excommunication the next day) at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit whereof the Pope says, <hi>Sufficiat pro hac vice.</hi> He holds the Dukedome of <hi>Milan</hi> from the Empire, and most of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> whereof he is a double <hi>Peer,</hi> as he is Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and Earl of <hi>Flanders.</hi> Now 'tis que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable among the Civilians, whether a Feodary or Homager may be call'd an Absolut Prince, specially when <hi>Appeals</hi> may be made from him to another Court, as the Spanish Clergy may from the King to <hi>Rome</hi> in divers cases.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> are free from <hi>Subordinations</hi> of that kind, as the Fundamental Laws of the Land, and all the ancient Learned Judges do evidence. 'Tis a Principle in the English Laws, (which is confirm'd by <hi>Baldus,</hi> and other great Forren Jurists) That <hi>Rex neminem habet in Dominiis suis nec Superiorem nec Parem:</hi> The King in his own Dominions hath neither Superior nor Equal, (He may be said to be both <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey.</hi>) There is another, <hi>Omnes sub Illo, Ille sub nullo;</hi> All under <hi>Him,</hi> He under none. Another yet, <hi>Satis habet Rex ad poenam quod Deum expectet Ultorem:</hi> 'Tis enough for the King
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59014:14"/>
that God is to be his Judge; which is expressed in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stic:</p>

               <p>Ther are divers others that are conducing hereunto; As, The King must not be put to do any thing <hi>per aspertè,</hi> but of his free plesure: <hi>The King never dies,</hi> but the Heir apparent is King <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choative</hi> as soon as the former dies; and the <hi>Coronation</hi> is but a meer Ceremony not Essential: for divers Kings, as <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. and others, had <hi>Alleageance</hi> sworn unto them before they were <hi>Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> There are more Maximes yet, <hi>That the King can do no wrong,</hi> but his Ministers may, through whose mouths he pronounceth sentence. Moreover, <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi,</hi> Ther's no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial or Prescription against the King. It is High Treson not only to <hi>contrive,</hi> but to <hi>imagine</hi> ill against the King. By the Kings Prerogative <hi>Life it self may be leased,</hi> &amp;c. But that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse twixt King <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Legat <hi>Pandolpho,</hi> when they say he transferred the Crown to the Pope, is much insisted upon: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto tis thus answered:</p>
               <p>That ther are four great things whereof the <hi>Records</hi> cannot be found: The first is <hi>that</hi> wherin the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> gave <hi>Rome</hi> to the Pope; The second is <hi>that</hi> wherin <hi>Venice</hi> hath the Dominion of the Adriatic or Illyrian Gulph; The third is the <hi>Salique Law;</hi> The fourth is that Instrument wherby King <hi>Iohn</hi> pass'd over his Crown, and made the Pope Lord Paramount of <hi>England.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> who was so far devoted to <hi>Rome</hi> that he is canoniz'd for one of her Martyrs, denieth absolutly that King <hi>Iohn</hi> either did or could make <hi>England Feudetary</hi> to the Pope, because without the consent of his Barons an Act so much prejudicial to his Royal Successors was not valid; and that the <hi>Peter-pence</hi> which they hold to be a <hi>Tribut</hi> relating to the foresaid Act, was but a meer <hi>Alms</hi> which was given by King <hi>Ina</hi> 500 years before. Moreover, put case ther had been such an Act, yet it stands upon good record that <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third did give a Release in these words; <hi>Per Praeceptum Domini Papae</hi> 7 <hi>Iulii Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magium relaxatur omninò.</hi> The <hi>Rome-scot</hi> also was but <hi>Regis larga benignitas,</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> bountiful kindness.</p>
               <p>Adde hereunto, that when the Pontificial Power was here at the highest pitch, no <hi>Legat de latere</hi> was allowed, but the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (his Subject) who by his Dignity is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Legat de latere,</hi> He is <hi>Legatus natus</hi> (as he of <hi>Toledo</hi> is in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Primat of <hi>Armagh</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi>) and in point of Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, at the Council of <hi>Clermont</hi> anno 1096. a Prerogative was given him for ever to sit at all general Councils at the Popes right foot; Pope <hi>Urban</hi> at that time declaring in these terms,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59014:15"/>
                  <hi>Includamus hun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> in Orbe nostro tanquam alterius Orbis Pontificem Maximum,</hi> Let us include him in our world as Pope of another world. 'Tis true, ther have been other <hi>Legats de latere</hi> upon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary occasions admitted, but it was with the <hi>Kings</hi> leave, and with this <hi>Proviso,</hi> That he hath no Authority to hold Plea in the Realm prejudicial to the Laws thereof, or derogatory to the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it appears that no <hi>Extern</hi> power hath any thing to do in <hi>Great Britain;</hi> and as the <hi>Pope,</hi> so the <hi>Peeple</hi> neither, whether consider'd <hi>Diffusively, Collectively, Representatively,</hi> or <hi>Vertually,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any thing of the <hi>Souverain Power;</hi> ther is no power either <hi>Co-ordinat, Co-equal, Corrival,</hi> or <hi>Collateral</hi> with it. The <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have had always by the known Laws of the Land a pure underived Power, not depending upon <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Peeple,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Prince</hi> whatsoever: They are <hi>Kings by the Grace of God,</hi> which implies no earthly Dependency. It stands upon good record, how <hi>King Ina</hi> in the <hi>Preamble</hi> to his Laws (for he was a great <hi>Legislator</hi>) begins, <hi>I Ina, by the Grace of God King,</hi> &amp;c. and this was above a thousand years ago, about two hundred years before <hi>Charlemain,</hi> in whose time that stile of <hi>Dei Gratia</hi> came first in use in the <hi>Empire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as on <hi>Land</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath such a Latitude and Independence of <hi>Supreme Power,</hi> so by <hi>Sea</hi> he hath the like; which is such, that (without disparagement, much less any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi> to any) I may avouch no other <hi>Prince</hi> hath the like. The greatest claim of Sea-Dominion that <hi>France</hi> makes, is to the Coasts of <hi>Armorica,</hi> or little <hi>Britany,</hi> and a few Leagues in the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> The <hi>Spanish</hi> Laws are for the community, and free use of the Sea, challenging no Dominion at all. Ther are divers States in <hi>Italy</hi> that claim a particular command and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in some Seas; as the Duke of <hi>Tuscany</hi> challengeth a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> Sea; the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> of the <hi>Ligustique; Venice</hi> claims a right to the <hi>Adriatic</hi> as (symbolically) to a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, for she marries him upon <hi>Ascention</hi>-day evry yeer, the Duke going in procession with great solemnity in the <hi>Buantoro</hi> to that purpose, and throwing a Ring into the water; and She hath power to do in that part of the Sea which she calls her <hi>Gulph,</hi> as much as she can do in <hi>Venice</hi> it self in point of laying Impositions and Gabels, and to cause what Mercantile ships she please to unlade their Cargazons at the City of <hi>Venice</hi> it self. God and Nature hath much favoured the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> with the command of a Neck of Sea, I mean the <hi>Sound,</hi> for it is the strongest Sinew of his Crown by the Tolls he receaves of those who pass and repass into the <hi>Baltik.</hi> He commands also <hi>at large</hi> the <hi>Norwegian</hi> or <hi>Hyperborean</hi> Sea. But among all, if we observe his <hi>Title,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> hath a greater Maritime command
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59014:15"/>
then all these, which Title runs thus: <hi>Dom Manuel por Graca de Deos Rey,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Senhor de Guinee, &amp; da Conquista, Navigacaon, &amp; Comercio d' Etiopia, Arabia, Persia, &amp; da India à Todos,</hi> &amp;c. Don Emanuel by the Grace of God King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lord of Guiney, and of the Conquest, Navigation, and Commerce of Ethiopia, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia, Persia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the Princes who have most command of Sea, but they command only the <hi>Strands</hi> and <hi>Ports,</hi> or Maritime Tract. They cannot be said to command the <hi>Sea it self,</hi> as the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> doth, for he commands no less then four Seas, which are circumfluent about his Territories; and the Law says, <hi>The Sea is of the Ligeance of the King</hi> as any other thing: He is <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> as well as Lord of them: He takes both the <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Defence</hi> of them; also he scowres and secures them from Pyrats and Praedatory Rovers: He makes all ships, whether Merchants or Men of War, Forreners or Subjects, to dash their Colours, and strike their Topsayls not onely to his Castles, but to any of his ships Royal as they pass and repass. Which mark of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Republic of <hi>Venice</hi> hath not, though she also hath her Gallies always in cours to scowre and secure the <hi>Gulph</hi> from Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries and Robbers, which is one of the chief <hi>Regalia</hi>'s St. <hi>Mark</hi> hath, though the Sea she thus commands be scarce 30 Leagues in extent, for it is but fourscore Italian Miles.</p>
               <p>Nor doth the King of <hi>Great Britains</hi> Dominion terminat in his own Seas, but as most Civilians hold, it extends as far as the shoares of his Transmarin Neighbours, and as far North as the Artic Circle: which <hi>Grotius</hi> did once acknowledg, and publish to the world (though another Caprichio came into his head af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards) in the Panegyrike he sent King <hi>Iames</hi> at his Inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when he says,</p>

               </head>
               <p>TO proceed in this Paragraph, we must make <hi>Retrosvects</hi> a far off: we will begin with <hi>Brennus</hi> that bold <hi>Britain,</hi> who in the Government of Consuls took and sack'd <hi>Rome,</hi> (364 yeers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ) and did notable feats afterwards in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia:</hi> insomuch that the Welch in honour of that <hi>Heroe</hi> their Country-man, call a King from his Name <hi>Brenin</hi> to this day. <hi>Cataracus</hi> overthrew a mighty Army of the Romanes, and <hi>Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicia</hi> slew 70 thousand of them in one Battel, as their own sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries declare. King <hi>Arthur</hi> is rank'd among the Nine Worthies, for he discomfited the <hi>Saxons</hi> in twelve several Battails, and ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the first Order of <hi>Knighthood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was one <hi>English King,</hi> and three <hi>Kings Sons</hi> went to the Wars of the Holy Land. What Exploits did <hi>Richard coeur de Lion</hi> perform there, so much to the envy of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who therfore returnd before him! He conquerd the Iland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where Marrying <hi>Berengaria,</hi> he transferrd the Kingdome to <hi>Guy Lusignan,</hi> who had right to the Crown of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which in exchange he resignd to King <hi>Richard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>French</hi> are they whom the <hi>English</hi> did so often rout, subdue and subjugat with the Grey-goose Wing, wherwith they did so often penetrat the very heart of <hi>France</hi> in so many glorious Victories that can be hardly paralleld, take all circumstances. We will instance in some of the most famous, and begin with that of <hi>Cressy</hi> the first great Battel.</p>

He takes with him his <hi>Son</hi> the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and Duke of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> being but 15 years of Age, (calld afterwards the <hi>Black Prince</hi>) to train him up in feats of Arms. Landing in <hi>Normandy</hi> he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries all the <hi>Country</hi> before him as far as <hi>Poissy,</hi> within ten miles of <hi>Paris,</hi> and after divers <hi>Skirmiges</hi> a Battail was appointed. King <hi>Edward</hi> had incamp'd neer a Village calld <hi>Cressy,</hi> where he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59014:20"/>
his Army to three Battalions; the first was led by the <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> the second by the Earls of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> in the third was the <hi>King</hi> himself. The Battail thus orderd, being mounted upon a White Hobby, he rides from Rank to Rank, encouraging evry man to the performance of his duty, and to have a regard to the Honor of his King and Country. The French <hi>Kings</hi> Army was at least twice the number, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of above 60000 Combatants, with all the flower of the French Chivalry, whereof the chief were the Duke of <hi>Alanson</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> Brother, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> with other great Princes. The Vangard was led by the <hi>Kings</hi> Brother, the Reer by the Earl of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the main Battail by the <hi>King</hi> himself. The <hi>French King</hi> was so fierce in assurance of Victory, that he wold scarce admit of any counsel. The old <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Boheme</hi> advis'd that the Army shold receive some refreshment before, and that the Infantry of <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wais,</hi> whereof ther were 15000 Crossbows, shold make the first Front, and the Cavalry to follow: which being agreed on, the Duke of <hi>Alanson</hi> did stomack that the <hi>Genowais</hi> shold have the honor of the first Rank; so in a kind of fury he caus'd them to change place: which bred such a discontent, that they were more incensd against their <hi>Leader</hi> then against the <hi>Enemy;</hi> but in the interim ther fell such a showre of Rain that wetted their <hi>Bowstrings,</hi> which they had not the wit to cover all the while, (as the English did) that for the limmerness therof when they came to action they grew useless. At the ceasing of the showre the Sun did shine full in the face of the <hi>French,</hi> therby dazzling their eyes, but on the back of the <hi>English. King Edward</hi> being got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Windmil all the while, whence as from a Sentinel he might explore and behold the face of the Enemy, and discovering the disturbance that was made because the <hi>Genowais</hi> were put to change their place, instantly gave order to charge that part, which made the discontented <hi>Genoway</hi> to recoyl. <hi>Alenson</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this, rides on in a rage, crying out, <hi>Sa, sa; on, on; let's make way ore the Bellies of these</hi> Genowais, <hi>for they do but hinder us.</hi> So riding through them, he came up to the <hi>English</hi> Battail, where the young Prince was. The fight grew hot, and doubtful, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that the Commanders sent to the <hi>King</hi> to come up with more power: The <hi>King</hi> asking the Messengers, <hi>Whether his Son was hurt or slain,</hi> and being answerd <hi>No,</hi> he replies, <hi>Then tell them who sent you, that so long as my Son is alive they send no more to me, for my Will is that he have the honor of the day.</hi> So the Fight on both sides growing very furious, the French <hi>King</hi> having his Horse kill'd under him, withdrew; which being known by the <hi>English,</hi> it added so to their courage that they soon after won the Field. This was the first considerable Battail the English had of the

French, which was so sanguinary, that ther were none made <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,</hi> but all put to the Sword, and the number of the slain <hi>French</hi> surmounted the whole Army of the English; for the number of the slain were about 30000. the chief whereof was <hi>Alenson</hi> the Kings Brother, the Dukes of <hi>Bourbon</hi> and <hi>Lorain,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the <hi>Dauphin de Viennois,</hi> Son to <hi>Imbert,</hi> who after gave <hi>Dauphine</hi> to the King of <hi>France,</hi> provided his <hi>First Son</hi> shold still be calld the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> which hath continued ever since.

                  <p>The <hi>Black Prince</hi> being taperd up now to a good growth, was sent by advice of Parlement to <hi>Gascony;</hi> whence the Truce being expird, he oreran and ravagd all the Country as far as <hi>Tourayne. Iohn</hi> the French King raiseth a potent Army, more numerous then that at <hi>Cressy;</hi> and going to find out the <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> found him about <hi>Poitiers,</hi> having not much above 10000 effect if men in his Army, wheras the <hi>French</hi> had six times as many: whereupon being advisd to make for <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> he was preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>French</hi> Army on all sides; so a Battail being intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, two Cardinals came from the <hi>Pope</hi> to mediat a Peace, but the <hi>French</hi> King wold hearken to none, unless that he wold as a Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd Man send him four Hostages, and give up himself and his Army to discretion. The <hi>Prince</hi> answerd, That he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to restore what places he had taken of <hi>His</hi> in good War, but without prejudice to his <hi>Honor,</hi> wherof he was accountable to the King his Father, <hi>&amp;c. Iohn</hi> not hearkning to this, but being resolvd to fight, the <hi>Prince</hi> also resolvd to part with his Life up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as high a rate as he could being reducd to this streight, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he providently makes use of the Position of ground; and finding that the main Army of the <hi>French</hi> consisted in <hi>Horse,</hi> he entrenchd among the Vineyards; where when the <hi>French</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry entred, being wrapd and encomberd among the Vines, the <hi>English</hi> Archers did so ply and gall them, that, being therby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderd and put to rout, the whole Army was soon totally defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But, it seems this <hi>Battail</hi> was not so fierce as that of <hi>Cressy,</hi> where no quarter was given: for in <hi>this,</hi> Prisoners were made, among whom was King <hi>Iohn</hi> himself, whom the Prince brought to <hi>England;</hi> and, as the <hi>French</hi> Historians themselfs confess, he was so civil to him all the while, that he knew not whether he

was a <hi>Free King</hi> or a <hi>Captif.</hi> Besides <hi>Lords,</hi> ther were slain 2000 of the <hi>French</hi> Nobless, as <hi>Froissard</hi> hath it, in this Battail; and, as at <hi>Cressy,</hi> more <hi>French</hi> slain then the whole <hi>English</hi> Army was in number.

                     <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, that Man of men and mirror of Princes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the Crown, he did cast his Eyes presently towards <hi>France</hi> for claiming of his Title. In order wherunto, he alterd in his Arms the bearing of <hi>Semy de Luces,</hi> and quarters the three full <hi>Flower de Luces</hi> as the King of <hi>France</hi> himself did bear them. He sends the Duke of <hi>Exceter,</hi> with the <hi>Archbishop of Dublin,</hi> and sundry other Noblemen, in a magnificent <hi>Ambassy,</hi> attended by 500 Horse, to <hi>Paris,</hi> to demand the Crown: but receiving no satisfactory answer, but rather a kind of jeer, the <hi>Dauphin</hi> send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a Sack full of Racket-court-Balls to pass away his time; He replyed, That for evry one of those Balls, he had so many fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery Bullets to shoot at the proudest Turrets in <hi>France,</hi> as he shold shortly find. And he was as good as his word: for he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got over, and encountring the French <hi>Army</hi> at <hi>Agencourt,</hi> he gave it an utter overthrow, and took more prisoners then his own Army had Soldiers; which was upon a Sunday-morning about Ten of the Clock: whereof having sent notice to <hi>England</hi> before, and that extraordinary Masses shold be sung then in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he stood upon the <hi>defensive</hi> part till that hour; but then making a Speech of encouragement to his Army, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strains, telling how <hi>all England was praying for them at that time,</hi> he carried away a compleat Victory; he himself leading the main Battail with the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> his Brother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But besides the foresaid <hi>Piety,</hi> ther was <hi>Policy</hi> also usd; for the King, to prevent the fury of the <hi>French</hi> Cavalry, appointed divers Stakes studded with Iron at both ends of six foot long, to be pitch'd behind the Archers, and ordred that Pioners shold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to remove them as they shold be directed: which invention conduc'd much to the success of the Action. The King himself charg'd the Duke of <hi>Alenson,</hi> and beat him off his Horse, who therupon was slain; so ther was a compleat and glorious Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obtain'd.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the Battail of <hi>Spurs,</hi> so calld because the French-men trusted more to their <hi>Spurs</hi> in fleeing away, then to their <hi>Swords</hi> and <hi>Lances.</hi> It was before <hi>Terwin</hi> in <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Raign, when <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour servd under his Banner, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceavd pay. Ther came 8000 <hi>French</hi> Horse to relieve the place, and a hot Dispute happend; but they were all routed, and put
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59014:21"/>
shamefully to flight, so the Town was taken by the <hi>English.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ther were a world of other Warlike Encounters and Skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges twixt the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> whereof the stories are full; and tis observd, that the <hi>English</hi> at most were but half in number to the <hi>French</hi> in all Engagements; insomuch that by pure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wess and point of the Sword they possessd two parts in three of that great Kingdome. We read that when the <hi>English</hi> were at the height of their power in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> came then to keep his Court at <hi>Avignon;</hi> and ther was a common saying among the Peeple, which since is grown to be a kind of <hi>Proverb, Ores le Pape est devenu Francois, &amp; Iesus Christ est devenu Anglois;</hi> The Pope is turnd French-man, and Jesus Christ is become an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-man: which was spoken in regard we had such prodigious Successes.</p>
                  <p>Before I part with <hi>France</hi> at present, tis very fit (the main subject of this Work being of <hi>Precedence</hi>) to speak something of the <hi>Black Prince</hi> while he was Governor of <hi>Aquitane,</hi> where he performd such notable Exploits; and among other, of that fa mous Charter of <hi>Precedence</hi> which was given to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Don Pedro</hi> King of <hi>Castile,</hi> who being detruded out of the Throne by <hi>Henry</hi> his younger Brother, fled for succour to the <hi>Black Prince</hi> in <hi>Gascognie,</hi> who had at that time two other Kings in his Court, <hi>viz. Ricaredo</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and Don <hi>Iayme</hi> King of <hi>Mallorca.</hi> Which Charter being yet upon Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Record, and not specified in the story of either Nations, may very well deserve to be inserted here; and it runs thus.</p>

the Work, and restord <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to his Kingdom: therfore he passd it as a Monument of eternal Gratitude unto him.</p>
                  <p>But before the Prince uudertook the business, ther was also a Bond from the <hi>King</hi> to pay so much money for defraying the Princes Army; and in consideration also of this undertaking, it was legally agreed that the Prince shold have the Castle of <hi>Vermeo, de la Quet, Bilbo, Biscay,</hi> and the Castle of <hi>Ordials, A tenir perpetuellement à li &amp; ses Heirs &amp; Successeurs, &amp; pour doner là où luy plerrà,</hi> to be held perpetually by Him and his Heirs and Successors, and to give to whom he pleasd.

                  <p>We will begin with that famous Battail twixt King <hi>Athelstan</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> when they had a great Army of <hi>Danes</hi> joynd with them, and being twice in number more then the English, yet King <hi>Athelstan</hi> obtaind a signal Victory both by Prowess and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; for the two Armies being ready to joyn, the English made semblance to flee away, leaving their Bagage behind; which as the <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Dane</hi> were a sharing, the English did suddenly wheele about by the advantage of a Woody Hill, and finding them in disarray, and laden with Booty, they rushd upon them with such a Resolution, that above 40 thousand of them, and, as <hi>Buchanan</hi> their chief Chronologer hath it, the flower of their Nobility, perishd there at that time.</p>
                  <p>The first Fire-ball of War which was thrown twixt both the Nations since the Norman Invasion, was in <hi>William Rufus</hi> his Raign, when the <hi>Scot</hi> having made divers Incursions into the <hi>English</hi> Borders, <hi>Moubray</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was sent against them, who incountring their King <hi>Malcolm</hi> with his eldest Son in the Field, they were both slain, and the whole Army overthrown.</p>
                  <p>In King <hi>Stephens</hi> days, <hi>Thurston</hi> then Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> was sent with an Army against the <hi>Scot,</hi> who meeting the <hi>King</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59014:23"/>
in the head of his Forces, utterly routed him, with the death of above 10000 of his Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the second employd only the Knights of <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> as, <hi>Humphry-vile, Scuttvil,</hi> and <hi>Vescy,</hi> to make head against the <hi>Scot,</hi> which they did with such Valour and Success, that they took the <hi>King</hi> in the Field; and as a Trophy of their good Service and Victory, they presented him Prisoner to the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> whence he carried him along to attend him in his French VVars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Scots King</hi> attended <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Lion-hearted</hi> at his second Coronation when he returned from the Holy Land, and carried the <hi>Sword</hi> before him bare-headed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edward</hi> the first, calld in story, and as his Tomb in <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> tells us, <hi>Scotorum Malleus,</hi> the Hammer of the <hi>Scots,</hi> summond King <hi>Baliol</hi> to <hi>Newcastle</hi> to swear Fealty unto him: but fleeing afterwards to the <hi>French King,</hi> at his return King <hi>Edward</hi> sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons him again to <hi>Berwick,</hi> where he re-submitted himself with all his Nobles in open Parlement, which King <hi>Edward</hi> held there; and for Caution brought <hi>Baliol</hi> along with him, leaving the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> Warden of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Then started up a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Blade, one <hi>Wallis,</hi> who notwithstanding that King <hi>Baliol</hi> was Prisoner in <hi>England,</hi> gatherd such a strength, that causd <hi>King Edward</hi> to go again in person, and at <hi>Fonkirk</hi> Battail killd out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right 200 of their <hi>Nobles</hi> and Gentry, with about forty thousand Common soldiers. Then he summons a Parlement at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where all the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobles swore Fealty to him; and then he carried away thence their Great Charter, calld the <hi>Ragman-Roll,</hi> the <hi>Black-Cross,</hi> and the <hi>Stone,</hi> wherein they believe the Fate of <hi>Scotland</hi> is fixd. Then ther was a third Provocation offer'd, for <hi>le Bruce</hi> was crownd <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherupon the Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi> was sent against him, who utterly defeated him at <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston:</hi> yet all was not quiet, but <hi>King Edward</hi> was forcd to make a <hi>fourth</hi> expedition thither in person, when he constraind <hi>le Bruce</hi> to flee away to <hi>Norway,</hi> where he blew on his Nayls while <hi>King Edward</hi> liv'd. But <hi>Bruce</hi> being come back, and <hi>Usurping</hi> during <hi>Edward</hi> the seconds time, (who we read was so infirm and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunat a <hi>King</hi>) his Father <hi>Edward</hi> the third restord <hi>Baliol</hi> by force of Arms, and made him swear Fealty to <hi>England</hi> again. But some yeers after King <hi>Edward</hi> being deeply engagd in the French Wars, <hi>David</hi> the next Scots King rush'd into <hi>England</hi> with about sixty thousand men, being confederat with the French King to divert the War there. But Queen <hi>Philippa,</hi> with the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>York,</hi> and the Lords and Knights of the North, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd this huge Army, and utterly defeated it, one <hi>Copland</hi> taking the <hi>Scots King</hi> Prisoner, whom he he reservd for a present to give <hi>King Edward</hi> when he came from <hi>France,</hi> and to keep company
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59014:24"/>
with <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>French King,</hi> who also was taken Prisoner by the <hi>Black Prince:</hi> And there were but six weeks difference of time twixt both Victories.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Richard</hi> the seconds Raign, the <hi>French King</hi> sent his High Admiral, with a thousand choice men at Arms, in a Fleet of 60 Sayl of Ships, with Arms for 12000 men more into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Therupon an English Army being raisd, it struck into <hi>Scotland</hi> like a Whirlwind, and piercing the very heart of the Country, advancd as far as <hi>Dundee,</hi> and returnd Victorious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth took <hi>Iames</hi> the first Prisoner, and carried him over to attend him in his French VVars.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. time, the <hi>Scots</hi> King (although his Brother-in-Law) taking his advantage when he was in <hi>France,</hi> battring the Walls of <hi>Bullen,</hi> with the flower of the English Nobility, raisd the greatest Army that <hi>Scotland</hi> could make for invading <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> therupon King <hi>Harry</hi> sent a Commission to the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> to raise Forces accordingly. The two Armies met at <hi>Flodden</hi>-field, where the <hi>Scots</hi> King and the Archbishop of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> his Brother were slain, with twelve Earls, 14 Barons, and 12000 more. Not long after <hi>Solmosse</hi> Battail was fought, where eight Scots Earls were taken Prisoners, with 200 Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and others: insomuch that as the story saith, ther was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an English soldier but had his couple of Scots Prisoners.</p>
                  <p>Four and thirty yeers after, the same day both of the month and the week, (as the Historians observe) <hi>Musselborough</hi>-Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail was fought; which because it was the last, and one of the most signal and sanguinary great Battails from the Conquest that was fought twixt the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi> I will here particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize, but with as much brevity as may be.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> was General of the English, the Earl of <hi>Warwik</hi> his Lieutenant, the Lord-Admiral <hi>Clinton</hi> had 60 ships of War, which were to hold cours with the Land-forces; the whole Army consisted but of about 13000 Foot, 1200 men at Arms, 2500 Light-horse, 16 Peeces of Ordinance, evry Peece having a Gard of Pioners who came to about 1400. From <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> they entred <hi>Scotland,</hi> and marchd as far as <hi>Musselburgh</hi> far within the Country; they seizd upon three small Castles as they passd, and with infinit pains overcame the Natural and <hi>Artificial</hi> Difficulties of the Ways. They understood that the Scots Army far exceeded them in number, and ther came Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creuts dayly unto it: For the Fire-cross was carried about by the Heralds through all parts, (which is two Firebrands upon the point of a Spear) that all above sixteen, and under sixty yeers shold repair to the General Rendevous: insomuch that the <hi>Scots</hi> Historians themselfs do mention that ther were above thirty
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59014:24"/>
thousand in the whole Army, which was twice the number of the English. The Battail was fought with much resolution and cagerness on both sides; yet notwithstanding that the <hi>Scot</hi> was at his own home, and that the English were tir'd by a long diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult march, they obtaind an absolute Conquest: ther were slain of the <hi>Scots</hi> about 14000 out-right upon the place, wherof ther were 3000 Kirk-men, as Fryars and Monks, <hi>Huntley</hi> with other great Lords were taken Prisoners, 30 Peeces of Ordinance were taken and shippd for <hi>England,</hi> with 30000 <hi>Iacks,</hi> as the Record says; and the English plunderd the Country five days march further, and did what they wold.</p>
                  <p>We will conclude with the late Battail at <hi>Dunbar</hi> still fresh in memory, where ther were not much more then 8000 <hi>English,</hi> and the <hi>Scot</hi> had them at a great advantage, yet the English making a <hi>Vertu</hi> of <hi>Necessity,</hi> utterly overcame an Army of about 24000 Scots; an Army that had been long a moulding, and consisted of many of their Nobility and Gentry: they lost both Bag and Bagage, Artillery and Arms: ther were above 3000 slain, 10000 taken Prisoners, whereof ther were 260 Officers, 15000 Arms, and 30 Peeces of Ordinance, and neer upon 200 of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours were brought to hang in <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall for Trophies.</p>
                  <q>Out of what hath been said, this Inference may be made:</q>
                  <p>That in all those Traverses and Encounters of War that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had with <hi>Scotland,</hi> which were neer upon an hundred since the Conquest, take small and great together, the <hi>English</hi> did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways foyl the <hi>Scot,</hi> except in <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. time, as shall be said hereafter. In some <hi>Battails</hi> we may find how they <hi>carried</hi> away more <hi>Captives</hi> then they were common soldiers themselfs, driving them as it were like sheep before them: And observable it is, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Battails were fought in <hi>Scotland</hi> it self, after that the English had been tir'd and dispirited by long marches, over uncouth and strange places, being ignorant both of the Advenues and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of them.</p>
                  <p>Tru it is, that in <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. Raign they won two or three Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wherof that at <hi>Bannocks</hi>-Battail was the greatest, where <hi>Gilbert de Clare</hi> Earl of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and about 40 Barons, with 700 Knights and English Gentlemen, were killd.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Raign they got also a small Victory, when Sir <hi>Ralph Evers</hi> was slain. In the time of the <hi>Long</hi> Fatal Parlement they did likewise many Insolencies, and rush'd far into <hi>England:</hi> but those <hi>Invasions</hi> may be rather termd <hi>Invitations</hi> by some spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unworthy-degenerated <hi>English-men,</hi> who had contrivd their coming in long before; whose memories will stink in the Nostrils of all Posterity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:59014:25"/>But the English have taken <hi>four</hi> of their Kings <hi>Captives,</hi> killd <hi>two</hi> other in the field, carried away their Crown, with the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Ensignes of Royalty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor were such high Exploits performed by the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> on <hi>Land</hi> only, but by <hi>Sea</hi> they have been as glorious. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians say how King <hi>Edgar</hi> had a Navy of three thousand six hundred ships, and bottoms of all sorts, which he divided to three Fleets that usd to coast about, and scowre the Seas as far as <hi>Norway</hi> evry year, and he in person would go often <hi>Admiral</hi> himself, and be all the Summer abroad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> the French King not long before the Battail of <hi>Cressy,</hi> to hinder <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds return into <hi>France,</hi> got a mighty Navy in Equippage of 200 sayl of ships, besides Gallies in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of <hi>Sluce;</hi> wherof King <hi>Edward</hi> being advertised, prepared such another Fleet, and encounters the French with such resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and success, having the Wind and the Sun for him, that he utterly defeated the whole Navy, slew about thirty thousand men, and so returned with mighty triumphs, and the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> the second of <hi>Spain,</hi> having (as he conceavd) endured divers Affron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This Prodigious Fleet stood the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in 10 Millions first and last, from the time that she set sayl out of <hi>Lisbonne,</hi> as tis found in their Annals: she lookd like a Forest at Sea as she steerd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.

Bowels by intestine seditions, she wold prove invincible, and ther wold be no power above the English. The Air is health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, mighty Riches; the Soyl is plentiful, and abounding with Minerals; the Pasture luxurious and delicat, whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that the English Wool is incomparable.</q>

               <p>This new noble Author when he comes to deliver his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> doth not speak half so much of either, nor of any Country els; for he treats of all the Kingdomes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and of other besides.</p>
               <p>Now, it is taken <hi>pro concesso,</hi> tis a truth granted by all, that ther is no King hath more choice of lusty and stout Bodies to make soldiers of, then the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; ther is the <hi>English, Welch, Scots</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> Nations that keep still entire their innated spirits, and stoutness uncowd: And this may be imputed to the Policy and Moderation of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to the equal distribution of the VVealth and Plenty of the Country. For the Yeoman and Franklin goes well clad, hath wholsome Nutriment; and as a return of his Labor from the grateful Earth, hath wherwith to provide for his children that they may not encrease the number of Beggers. It is not so in some Countries, which made one say, (though ther may be some excess in the expression) That <hi>the Yeomen and Freeholders of</hi> Kent <hi>are able to buy half the Peasants of</hi> France.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59014:26"/>
Corn, that thou mayst be calld the Favorit of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus.</hi> Thy Groves are without savage rapacious Beasts, and thy Heaths without any poysonous Serpents.

               </p>
               <p>From this temperatness of Clime and Fertility, may proceed the Well-favouredness, the Procerity, as also the Health and Longaevity of the Inhabitants; in regard Nature doth not finish her cours in the bodies of Males and Females so soon here as she doth in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> For tis observd by all strangers, that an <hi>English</hi> woman looks as fresh and beutiful at forty, as a <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spanish</hi> at five and twenty; it being very ordinary for them to continue still teeming and prolifical when they are past fifty years. And for the <hi>Men,</hi> it wold be Registred for a Miracle in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>France</hi> to finde ten men of a thousand years, (one with another) as were found in <hi>Hereford</hi> about 60 years since, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two miles compass of the town, who were so vigorous, strong and spriteful, that they danced the Morice-dance in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place for many hours, with a Maid-Mariam of a hundred and three, and a Tabourer of a hundred and five years old.</p>
               <p>From the Fertility and Generousness of the Earth, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed also the extraordinary Courage and Hardiness of the Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which hath been so well known and felt in other Countries beyond the Seas, as the Examples in the former Paragraph do prove at so many signal and difficult famous Battails, where the English Army was never half so numerous in any they got, no not somtimes the third or fourth part in number to the Enemy; and such an esteem they had in <hi>France,</hi> that (as their own stories relate) when the Duke of <hi>Britany</hi> or <hi>Armorica</hi> was to encounter the <hi>French</hi> Army in a Battail, he thought it a Policy to clothe a whole Brigade of his Soldiers after the English mode, to make them appeer the more formidable to the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor doth that Primitive innate Courage languish a whit, or decline in them, (as some think the <hi>World</hi> doth) as we find it hath done in other Nations, as the <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> with others, but it continueth still at the same height; as it appeerd in the year Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight by Sea, as was said before, and in several Exploits in the Low-Country Wars, as <hi>Newport,</hi> the Retreat before <hi>Gaunt, &amp;c.</hi> by Land. Likewise by fresher Examples in the late Civil Wars twixt King and Parlement, and since, wherin the Power, Strength and Wealth of <hi>England</hi> was never more discovered: For the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59014:27"/>
late <hi>usurper</hi> (having such a Command over the Peeples purse, and never wanting money) made <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> strive who shold be his Confederat, as also the <hi>Hollander,</hi> the <hi>Swed,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: I say, in those times the ancient stoutness of the English appeerd in many Traverses of War; as at <hi>Dunbar</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by Sea against the <hi>Hollander,</hi> who were <hi>beaten</hi> and batterd into a Peace. What a hazardous peece of service was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med when we invaded <hi>Barbary</hi> at <hi>Tunis?</hi> but especially that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperat Exploit <hi>Blague</hi> did at the <hi>Canaries?</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that the Brigade of <hi>English</hi> before <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> commanded by a little bold <hi>Britain,</hi> though not the fifth part of the Army, did contribut most to the late taking of that strong <hi>Praedatory</hi> Town. And the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> acknowledgd, that in this years great Defeat 1663. he gave Don <hi>Iohn of Austria</hi> neer <hi>Ebora,</hi> that Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade of <hi>English</hi> who servd there, though not much considerable in number, did perform the toughest part of the service, and first shewd them the way of using the Rests of the Musquet to knock down the Enemy; which made the French-men cry out, <hi>Faisons comme les Anglois,</hi> Let's do as the English.</p>

                  <hi>The Sixth Paragraph.</hi> Touching the Ancient and Long-lind Extraction, Decendency, and Bloud-Royal of the Kings of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THe Races of Kings may be said to be like great Rivers, that stream out into divers large Channels and Arms, which become great Rivers of themselfs afterward: Or like huge Trees which use to stretch their Branches beyond the Ocean, where being inoculated and graffd, they make divers other Royal Trees to sprout out of them in Forren Soyls. Ther were divers Royal <hi>Ingraftings</hi> of this kind that <hi>Great Britain</hi> had with the chiefest Potentats, and some of them <hi>Imperial:</hi> The first was before the <hi>English</hi> took footing here, between the Emperour <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Helene,</hi> a Britain born, and Mother to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, the first <hi>Christian</hi> Emperour: for this <hi>Iland</hi> was held in such high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem by the Roman Emperours, (when they had almost all the world besides) that divers of them kept their Courts here; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom <hi>Severus,</hi> and <hi>Constantius</hi> died at <hi>York:</hi> which City may deservedly vaunt of two things, <hi>viz.</hi> that two Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours were <hi>buried,</hi> and a third <hi>born</hi> in her, <hi>viz. Constantin</hi> the Great.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Saxons</hi> came, this Iland also continued in such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, that <hi>Ethelwolph</hi> Son to King <hi>Egbert, Anno</hi> 830. married the Lady <hi>Iudith,</hi> calld the <hi>Fair</hi> for her extraordinary Bewty, and Daughter to the Emperour <hi>Charles le Chauue,</hi> Granchilde to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59014:27"/>
                  <hi>Charlemain.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> the Great married the Sister of King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> whose friendship was so much sought by all his Neighbouring Kings, that they wooed for it by rich Presents: which made the King of <hi>France</hi> send him the sword of <hi>Constantin</hi> the Great, in the Hilt wherof ther was one of the Nails that fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Christ to the Cross: He sent him also the Spear of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</hi> The King of <hi>Norway</hi> sent him a curious Ship, with a Gilt Stem, Purple Sayls, and the Deck garnishd all with Gold. The Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> his Brother-in-law sent him a Vessel of precious stones artificially made, wherein were Landskips with Vines, Corn and Reapers so much to the Life, that they seemd to move, and act, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ther have been eight <hi>Nuptial</hi> Conjunctions twixt <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> (besides the <hi>Scots</hi> alliance with that Country.) The first was about the yeer 900. twixt <hi>Charles</hi> the first of <hi>France,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Ogine</hi> Daughter to <hi>Edward</hi> Son to King <hi>Alfred,</hi> that admired Saxon King, who is so famous in story for divers signal things: for He cleerd the whole Kingdome of the <hi>Danes,</hi> who had so much infested and harassd it. He Founded the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>Oxford, Anno</hi> 895. He was the first who divided <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into Shires, Hundreds, and Weapontakes. He divided the Natural Day also into three parts; eight hours for Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and matters concerning his Health, as sleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eight hours for Meditation and exercise of Piety; and eight hours in Council, and the publick Affairs of his Kingdome. He Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>-Abby, <hi>Winchester</hi>-Church, and <hi>Eldinsey</hi>-Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
               <p>The second Marriage with <hi>France</hi> was twixt <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter to <hi>Lewis</hi> the seventh of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third was between <hi>Edward</hi> the first, (that great <hi>Hero</hi> of his time) and the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Philip</hi> the Hardy of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth twixt <hi>Edward</hi> the second and the Lady <hi>Isabel,</hi> eldest Daughter to <hi>Philip le Bell</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> Mother to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third of <hi>England,</hi> who by right of her claimd and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried afterwards the Crown of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth was twixt King <hi>Richard</hi> the second, and the Lady <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth of <hi>France:</hi> but she was but his second Wife, for his first was the Lady <hi>Anne,</hi> Daughter to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth.</p>
               <p>The sixth was between <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth of <hi>England,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Katharine,</hi> another Daughter to <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The seventh was twixt <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth of <hi>France,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> second Daughter to King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59014:28"/>The eighth and last <hi>Inoculation</hi> twixt the <hi>Rose</hi> and the <hi>Flower de Luce,</hi> was that of <hi>Charles</hi> the first of <hi>England,</hi> with the Lady <hi>Henrietta Maria</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> youngest Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the great of <hi>France.</hi> In which Matches <hi>England</hi> hath had <hi>six</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>France two</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the fourth Match twixt <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. and <hi>Isabel</hi> eldest Daughter to <hi>Philip le Bell, Edward</hi> the third of <hi>England</hi> being her eldest son, was Heir to the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and demanding his Right therunto, he was answered, <hi>La Couronne de France n'est pas lièe à la quenouille,</hi> That the Crown of <hi>France</hi> was not tied to a Distaff: wherunto he replyed, <hi>That he would then tie it to his Sword;</hi> and he was as good as his word. But <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth some fourscore years after tied it faster, for he reducd <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth to such terms, that after his death he shold immediately possess the Crown and Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> and that in the interim the <hi>Dauphin</hi> his son (afterwards <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh) shold be disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited; That in the interim King <hi>Henry</hi> shold be <hi>Regent</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> (in regard the present King was sometimes crazd in his Intellectuals;) That he shold take to Wife the Lady <hi>Isabel,</hi> Daughter to the said <hi>Charles:</hi> All which Capitulations not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>King,</hi> but the chiefest Peers and Nobility of <hi>France</hi> did consent unto, and ratifie by solemn Oath, obliging themselfs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to uphold and assist <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> with his lawful Heirs and Successors, against <hi>Charles</hi> the Dauphin whom his Father had legally disinherited.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth dying in <hi>France,</hi> (a Death much too soon and immature for so brave a man) his son <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. was proclaimd King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Paris:</hi> In which pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Proclamation, tis very observable how <hi>England</hi> had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence; and therupon the chiefest of the Officers of the Crown and Nobles swore Fealty and Alleageance unto him; divers of which Nobles grew afterwards Apostats, and joynd with the <hi>Dauphin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Against <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds Right the <hi>Salique</hi> Law was alledgd, which they wold force and pin upon a Text of Scripture, <hi>Lilia ne<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> nent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Lilies neither spin,</hi> &amp;c. But though King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> had cut the Labels of that Law with a victorious sword, yet it was not quite cancelld: Nor indeed could it be possibly done, for it was but a kind of Chymera, a meer imaginary Law; and one of the Authentiqust French Historians <hi>Du Haillan</hi> hath no better opinion of it. They who are the greatest Champions of that Law, acknowledg that it was at first a particular Topical Law made at <hi>Salem,</hi> a place upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but they have stretchd it since to all <hi>France:</hi> As if the Law of <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> which is peculiar to <hi>Kent</hi> and other distinct places, shold be made to extend it self, and be in force all <hi>England</hi> over. But some ther
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59014:28"/>
are that will not allow any <hi>Essence</hi> at all to the <hi>Salique</hi> Law, no not to be a Local restraining Law to the foresaid place neer the <hi>Rhine;</hi> Therfore the same answer may be fit to be given un to the Assertors of It, as was given by the <hi>Venetians</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> when ther happening a clash between them touching the Sea about <hi>Ancona,</hi> which they alledgd belongd to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gulf wherof they had the Dominion, And the <hi>Pope</hi> demanding what warrant they had for it, twas answered, by a kinde of <hi>Sarcasine, If your Holines please to produce the Instrument wherby the Emperour Constantine the Great passd over the City of Rome to your predecessors, upon the back of that Grant your Holines will find</hi> Saint Marks Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>to the Souverainty of the Adriatique Gulph:</hi> whence an Intimation was made, that neither of the Charters had ever any being; which may be justly applied to the <hi>Salique</hi> Law. And besides that, <hi>du Haillan,</hi> though a <hi>French-man,</hi> in the first Volume of his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, confutes that Law. It is confirmd also that ther never was any such Law in <hi>France</hi> by the testimony of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who when <hi>Philippe le long</hi> was created <hi>King,</hi> he openly cryed out against his Creation, alledging that the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> belonged then to <hi>Iane</hi> daughter unto <hi>Hutin</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> formerly: but to stop his mouth, <hi>Philip</hi> was forcd to make a Gift unto him of the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Burgundy</hi> in dower with his eldest daughter.</p>
               <p>But touching the Title of <hi>Henry the Fifth,</hi> which was confirmed by Solemne Agreement, and Sacramental Oaths, the French found out another Evasion. For it was avouchd, That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France</hi> goeth not by Descent or Inheritance, but by <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi> which is grounded not upon a Law but upon Custom; by vertu wherof the next of the Bloud Royal, be He of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest degree that may be to the kindred, succeedeth, not as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heir, but as a <hi>Successor</hi> by Custom, not newly invented, but of long continuance, even from the time of <hi>Pharamond.</hi> But this new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devised Objection is refuted also by the foresaid <hi>Du Haillan</hi> one of the prime French Historiographers, and a French-man born, who reckons up a long Catalog of French Kings which did not succeed one another, but were chosen one after another.</p>
               <p>Another Objection was also suggested, that <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth, who made the foresaid Contract with <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> was no better then a <hi>Lunatique,</hi> though he had somtimes <hi>Lucida Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valla.</hi> Wherunto it is answerd, that at the time when that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement passd He had a lucid interval, and was in his right wits and memory: Besides, the chiefest Nobility of the Realm were parties in ir, and did not only consent, but obligd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs by Oath to the performance of it.</p>
               <p>Ther was a third Objection which kept a higher noise, <hi>viz.</hi> That the King of <hi>France</hi> cannot alienate the Demeanes, Rights, Titles, and Interests of the Crown, without the consent and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59014:29"/>
suffrage of the Assembly of <hi>Three Estates,</hi> which was not had <hi>then,</hi> because a great part of the Peers, Nobles, and others were then absent. Whereunto tis answerd, That in claims which go by plurality of voices, it is not always necessary that all shold be present, if the greater and better part of them be there, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if after Citation the rest absent themselfs: For although the point that concerneth All, shold be approvd by All; yet, as Civilians hold, when some or all may approve or disallow the things which concern Them, and They will not be present to shew their consent or dislike, their Absence shall not prejudice the stipulation of the Contract. And in this great business twixt two Kings, those who were away were Traytors to <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth, for they were in arms against him, by taking part with the <hi>Dauphin</hi> who was in Rebellion against his Father at that time; Therfore their absence could not in any respect prejudice the validity of so solemn a Contract wherupon depended Peace or War.</p>
               <p>The fourth Objection carried more of pusillanimity with it, then strength of proof, <hi>viz.</hi> That when the foresaid Contract was made, the <hi>English</hi> had almost over-run all <hi>France,</hi> and that the King was coopd up in a corner of the country; Therfore whatsoever He did being done by fear, duresse and compulsion, was of no better force then a Covenant extorted by violence, or made in prison by a private man, which when he is at liberty he is not bound by Law to perform if it tend to his damage. To this tis answerd, That the case is far different twixt Souve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Princes and privat men, for between the one ther fall out but Processes and Suits in law if they disagree, or not perform what is a greed upon; But between Princes, bloud and Wars, fire and Sword, death and destruction somtimes of whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and millions of human soules do Ensue: Therfore when a King by the propitiousness of Heven, and his own prowess, by the hazard of his life, loss of his peeple, with infinit pains and expence of Tresure, hath gaind a Victory by the justness of his Cause and Divine decree, or redu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d his Enemy to a streight, All the Civilians concur in one unanimous opinion that he may make the best advantage he can of his good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, and reduce his Enemy to what terms he please; And the Articles which shall then be capitulated, consented and sworn unto, are to be exactly performd; otherwise there wold be no end of any War. Now, rhe French Chroniclers themselfs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that <hi>Henry</hi> the 5. might at that conjuncture of time and fortune, have destroyed the whole Realm of <hi>France,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the King prisoner, or driven him quite out: But he was so far from doing so, that he sufferd him to enjoy the Kingdom while he livd, and by taking his daughter to wife made her Issue
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59014:29"/>
therby capable not only of the <hi>French,</hi> but also of the <hi>English</hi> Crown, with all the Dominions thereunto annexed. Whence some Authors observ that the <hi>English</hi> have bin usd in all Treaties and Stipulations to be over-reasonable, merciful, plain and downright; But the <hi>French</hi> crafty, double minded, inhumane, high and subdolous upon all advantages: Insomuch that tis a question which was sharper, the English <hi>blade,</hi> or the French <hi>brain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will conclude this digressive discours with another argument of the French, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth could not legally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherit his eldest son, being Hei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> apparent to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> To this may be answerd, that neither <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth was rightful King, nor consequently his son heir apparent: for since <hi>Edward</hi> the third of <hi>England,</hi> all the French Kings were but <hi>Usurpers;</hi> they were Kings <hi>de facto,</hi> not <hi>de jure.</hi> Moreover ther are many Examples how the eldest sons of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have bin disinherited: We read that <hi>Robert</hi> made his second son <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> by disinheriting <hi>Robert</hi> his <hi>eldest,</hi> who for compensation was made Duke of <hi>Burgundy. Lewis le Gros,</hi> with the consent of all the Peers and Estats of <hi>France,</hi> made also <hi>Lewis</hi> his second son King, and gave <hi>Robert</hi> his eldest the Earldom of <hi>Dreux. Dagobert</hi> made <hi>Clouis</hi> his second son King of <hi>France,</hi> by putting by <hi>Sigisbert</hi> his eldest son.</p>
               <p>I have bin somwhat long in discours of this great Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on twixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> because the chief aim of this Work being at <hi>Precedence,</hi> the discerning Reader may regulat his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment accordingly.</p>
               <p>We will now go on to conclude this Paragraph, the main scope wherof being Antiquity, and continuance of Royal Bloud.</p>
               <p>The Genealogical Tree of the Kings of this Iland, as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, hath had various Stems: the first were <hi>Britains</hi> (now calld <hi>Welsh</hi>) who may contend for Antiquity, and may be said to be coetaneous with the Iland it self, yea before it was an <hi>Iland;</hi> for ther want not some who hold that it was at first a <hi>continent,</hi> or a peninsula tied to <hi>Gallia</hi> by an <hi>Isthmos</hi> or neck of land stretching from <hi>Dover</hi> to <hi>Bullen:</hi> for the Rocks on both coasts being of a colour and shape, look as if they were slented one out of the other. Before the <hi>Romans</hi> took footing here, which was neer upon 200 yeers before they could do it peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, the <hi>Britains</hi> did still so bear up against them; wheras <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> or <hi>France</hi> was fully conquerd in less then 10 yeers: I say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Roman Eagle fixd his talons here, ther had bin 65 Kings of the <hi>British</hi> Bloud: But then that Race being interrupted by the <hi>Romans</hi> for above 400 yeers, the Iland being freed of

                  <hi>Spain</hi> cannot say so much: for the furthest Line that Her Kings can draw, is not much above 500 yeers ago, from the Counts of <hi>Castile;</hi> nor was ther ever any <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Castile</hi> till the yeer 1017.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59014:31"/>
Air can afford: which (with the Divine benediction) must be imputed to the temper of the Clime; And besides, ther be gentle breezes that are conveyd from the circumfluent Seas, which refresh all kinde of animals both Brute and Rational. The clouds there may be truly said to drop fatness, dissolving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to silver wholsom showers to soften and fertilize her <hi>Glebes:</hi> In <hi>December</hi> and <hi>Ianuary</hi> there is commonly <hi>Frost</hi> enough to <hi>knit</hi> and corroborate the joynts of the earth: In <hi>February</hi> ther is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Snow</hi> enough to fill the Dikes, and like a gentle white rugg to cover her plowd fields, and keep the bed of the earth warm from the inclemency of the circumambient cold air. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servd that ther is not such a multitude of Volatils any where: And touching her Seas, ther are not any wher so great variety of Fish swimming in such huge shoals like mountains, and taking their turns and seasons about the Iland once every yeer: Her fresh rivers are also full of them. Her Forests and Woods have not such ravenous beasts as other Countries use to have: yet ther are store of savage beasts for Recreation, as the Stagg, the Hind, the Hart, the Hare, the Otter, the Fox and Badger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The bowels of the earth are no where so pregnant of Metals, Stone, and Fuel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Sun, which scorcheth other Countries, may be said but to warm the English soyl with his gentle rays. The Air is nothing so foggie and dull as in many other Regions, but cleerd and attenuated ever and anon with refreshing blasts. Nor is the body of the earth so subject to shaking Agues and Earth quakes, to trepidation and quakings, as other places are, which are full of sulphurous bituminous concavities. Touching store and superfluity of Corn, with all sorts of Grain, <hi>Britain</hi> in the times of the <hi>Romans</hi> was calld, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> says, the Barn and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of the Western world.

benefit which other Nations make of her Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Insomuch that <hi>Guicciardine,</hi> an Author well to pass, relates that after the Articles of the <hi>Intercursus magnus</hi> were made with <hi>Flanders</hi> or the Netherlands, the Annual Trade amounted unto above twelve Millions Sterling, whereof the one half was in Woollen Manufactures, wherby the 17 Provinces did wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully improve in Negotiation and Wealth: Insomuch that the ground of the Order of the <hi>Golden Fleece</hi> established by the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> related to the <hi>English Wool,</hi> which proved so infinitely beneficial unto them.</p>
               <p>From this marvelous exuberance and superfluity of substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Staple-commodities proceed the luxe, the plenty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseness of the Inhabitants: for ther is no wher such frequent Invitations and Feasts in Town and Country; which made one say, That among others, <hi>England</hi> hath an Inchanting kind of quality, to make Forreners forget their own Countries, when they have once tasted of the sweetness therof. The Franklins, Yeomen or Freeholders live like Gentlemen, The Gentlemen and Esquires live like Noble-men, The Noble-men like Princes. The Lord Maior and Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> have Tables most days of the week fit to entertain Kings.</p>
               <p>Now, touching the <hi>Royal Court,</hi> which may be calld the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the whole Country, Ther is no King whatsoever lives in that height of magnificence and plenty.

Beer</hi> 1700 Tun, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was for the first cours: Now for the second cours innumerable sorts of Fowl and Fish according to the season, which was exactly observd. This made <hi>Bodin</hi> the great Critique to confess, that considering all things, ther was not a more magnificent and plentiful Court upon earth. Now the riches and fatness of a Country shold be principally seen in the Kings house; and indeed the greatest glory of <hi>England</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peers there, as all observing Forreners confess: and nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducd more to the continuance, increase and support of his power and honour, and which drew more awe and reverence from all peeple; all which are so requisit and essential to the prosperity of King and Peeple, as they cannot be wanting, but are and shold be perpetual attendants of the Soverain Prince. Now,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59014:32"/>
this cannot be without the concurrence and service of the Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Now, from all times the <hi>English</hi> were observd to be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious, and make it their chief care to provide the best things for the Kings Court; according to that ancient, and no less elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent speech of a great Lawyer: <hi>Domus Regis vigilia defendit omnium; Otium Illius labor omnium; Deliciae Illius industria omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; Vacatio Illius occupatio omnium; Salus Illius periculum omnium; Honor Illius periculum omnium.</hi> The Kings House shold be the watchfulness of All; His recreations shold be the labor of All; His plesures shold be the inventions of All; His safety shold be the danger of All; His honor the object of All.</p>
               <p>Now, the greatest cause of the honour and plenty of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Court in <hi>England,</hi> were the Preemption, Pourvoyances and Compositions he had from evry County, which were so mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, That they who have cryed them down, thinking it to be a great advantage and ease unto them, will find in time that they were no wiser then the Ass in the Fable (as a very judicious Gentleman observes) who thought to make his burden of Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the lighter by lying down with them in the water: For those Compositions, considering the smalness of them, and how many went to bear the burden, were scarce any weight at all, as will appeer by those Shires I shall produce for instances.</p>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s, that she swallows up the Trade of all the three Kingdoms; yet for all these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, she with the out-parts did contribut in Grocery ware for the service of the Kings House but about 2000 <hi>l. per annum.</hi> Nor did the Kings Brewers in <hi>London,</hi> and four miles compass about, pay but one half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>peny in every Bushel of Mault; which is now remitted: And what an inconsiderable small ease it is to so many Brewers, let any man judge.</p>
               <p>Out of the Premises touching <hi>Compositions</hi> for Pourvoyances, this inference may be drawn, what a care and love our provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and prudent Progenitors bore to the honor of their King, his Court, and Houshould; And under favor I may say that these Royal Pourvoyances, and his tenures <hi>in Capite,</hi> were two of the fairest <hi>flowers</hi> in the English Crown, in lieu wherof it may be sayd ther is set in an ear of <hi>barly,</hi> with a Chimney-<hi>Wallflower;</hi> ther is <hi>froth</hi> and <hi>fume</hi> given in exchange, which doth so much sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the luster of it: for, as I intimated before, the state and plenty of the Court was accounted the greatest glory of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> as Forren Authors of most Nations do acknowledg in their public Writings.</p>
               <p>Now, wheras some do affirm that the yeerly benefit of the <hi>Excise</hi> doth make a full compensation for the Court of Wards, and <hi>tenures in Capite,</hi> out of which ther was also computed fifty thousand pounds yeerly towards the Diet at Court, It is too well known that the said <hi>Excise</hi> doth not make the King any Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent satisfaction for his <hi>Tenures</hi> alone (if well managd) much less for his Pourvoyances, Preemptions and Carriages: For ther was an exact account made by his Majesties special com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, of the last yeers expence, that ther were Seventy three thousand six hundred and seven pounds fourteen shillings and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59014:33"/>
seven pence spent more in the Court-diet, and provision of the Stables, then were in the time of Pourvoyance, besides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary charge of Carriages for his Removes, and Navy Royal.</p>
               <p>Now, in expending those provisions that were servd into the Court by way of Pourvoyance and Composition, ther was the greatest care and Oeconomical good husbandry usd that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly could be: for when ther were more Beefs and Muttons with other provisions servd in then the Court wanted, The faithful Officers of the Green-cloth caused them to be <hi>Sould,</hi> and with the moneys arising thence they were commonly usd to buy Napery, and other Houshold-things for the service of the Kings House, as also in paying the arrears of som of his Servants wages with the surplusages.</p>
               <p>But now that we dance after the French Fiddle so fast, as we always did so for the <hi>back,</hi> and now begin to follow him also in things relating to the <hi>Belly,</hi> by Board-wages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I wish the time may not come that we do not follow him too farr; As that one cannot put a grain of Salt in his pot unless he buy it of the King, wherby, in making <hi>Salt</hi> his own Commodity, the French King raiseth by the meer <hi>Gabel</hi> which ariseth thence above 20 millions of Livres evry yeer, which is two millions Sterling; which sum is twice more then the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath from all Incoms whatsoever, as Crown-lands, Customes and Imposts, Excise and Chimney-money, with other perquisits and casualities: And as the French thus cannot put a grain of <hi>Salt</hi> in his pot, so the <hi>Spaniard</hi> cannot put a corn of <hi>Peper</hi> into his <hi>Olla</hi> unless he hath it from the King; Nor can he buy a pair of <hi>Cards</hi> or <hi>Dice</hi> to pass away the time withal, unless he hath them of the King; Nay, he cannot buy half a sheet of <hi>Paper</hi> to write either Bond or Bill, Acquittance or Receit, or other legal Instrument, but he must buy all of the King; Which adds millions to his yeerly Revenues: yet the peeple of <hi>Spain</hi> are cryed up for a free pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>But touching the Imposition of <hi>Excise</hi> (which is given the King for his Royal Tenures, and House-keeping) I well remember the time, that Excise was held such an abominable word, that my Lord <hi>Carleton</hi> but only for naming it once in the Parlement-House, (yet to no ill meaning at all) was violently cryed to the <hi>Bar;</hi> and, though a person of that eminence, as being then a Privie Counsellor, and principal Secretary of State, he hardly escapd being committed to the Tower. The <hi>Excise</hi> was then calld the <hi>Dutch Devil,</hi> because it came first from <hi>Holland,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fine words, as <hi>plunder, storming,</hi> &amp;c. which were all made free Denizons of <hi>England</hi> by that so longd-for <hi>Long Parlement.</hi> And observable it is, that the first imposing and use of <hi>Excise</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59014:34"/>
was to enable Rebels to make War against their King and Country.</p>
               <p>Having thus briefly run over the <hi>Sumptuary</hi> part of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Court, we will now proceed to the Servants and Officers, to the Attendance and State thereof, which comes not behind any other Court whatsoever: And this might be the ground of that ancient Proverb in <hi>England,</hi> and nowhere els, <hi>There is no Fishing to the Sea, nor Service to the Kings.</hi> The Court is the randevous of Vertu, of <hi>Cadets,</hi> and persons well qualified: It is the Scale by which they rise, the King being the fountain of Honour, as well as of Bounty. But before we come to speak of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers at Court, and of their Diet and <hi>Bouche,</hi> which by a pitiful corruption is vulgarly calld <hi>budg,</hi> wheras it is <hi>bouche</hi> a mouth; therfore it is a French phrase, <hi>Il a bouche à la Cour,</hi> He hath a mouth at Court, <hi>viz.</hi> he hath a Diet: I say, before we come to speak of the Dishes and Diet at Court, let the Reader take this small Advertisement in the way, that evry <hi>Dish</hi> at Court was computed to cost the King <hi>viis &amp; modis</hi> at the years end 100 <hi>l.</hi> a dish: But now since the Preemption and Pourvoyance is taken away, evry dish doth stand in four times as much, at least.</p>

               <p>Touching the Presidential Court in the <hi>North,</hi> where ther was usd to be also a Lord President, four of the Learned Counsel, a Secretary and other Officers, the King saves nere upon <hi>2000l. per an.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like sum or therabouts is savd by the Court of <hi>Wards,</hi> though the <hi>loss</hi> which the Crown of <hi>England</hi> hath receavd therby in point of honour by <hi>Tenures</hi> in <hi>Capite,</hi> and Royal Pourvoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be invaluable; which makes our next Forren Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in a kinde of jeer (and the best of their wit lies in jeering) to say, that all the Noblemen and Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> since Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure <hi>in Capite</hi> was taken away, are become little better then <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiers,</hi> then Yeomen that hold in <hi>Soccage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former Catalog of Court-Officers was delivered to King <hi>Iames</hi> at his first coming in, And ther may be some alterations since. Now ther is a mighty number of other Officers belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Crown: as <hi>Auditors, Receavors, Surveyors, Escheators, Customers; Governors</hi> and <hi>Constables</hi> of Castles, Keepers of <hi>Forts, Points</hi> and <hi>Bulwarks; Rangers</hi> of <hi>Forests; Keepers</hi> of <hi>Chaces, Parks</hi> and <hi>Woods, &amp;c.</hi> which wold make a Volume of it self, and is not so proper to the designe of this subject, which aims prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally at the Menial and <hi>domestick</hi> servants attending at Court, though we have bin transported as we went along to other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
               <p>Out of the premises this result may be drawn, that besides the unparallelld plenty, fatness and hospitality of the English Court in point of provision, and <hi>munition de Bouche,</hi> as the Frenchman calls it, Ther is no Court in Christendom servd with more pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual attendance and state; wheras if you cross ore the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> and take a view of the next transmarin <hi>Court,</hi> one shall see common Laquays, Scullions, and greasie Galopins bring meat to the very rayls of the Kings Table: And touching the <hi>Spanish</hi> Court, tis so pitifully thin at dinner and supper-time, that one wold think he were in some Monastery of Capuchins: But go
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59014:43"/>
to either of their Kitchins, one <hi>may break his neck as soon as break his Fast.</hi> While I was writing <hi>this,</hi> a plesant Repartie came into my memory that happend twixt that worthy and warlike British Knight Sir <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> (who being <hi>General</hi> of an English Army in <hi>France, Henry</hi> the Great confessd to be a better Soldier then himself) Sir <hi>Roger</hi> being at an Ordinary in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where among others ther was a Spanish <hi>Alferez</hi> who began to speak much of the dainty <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Salades</hi> of his Country, Sir <hi>Roger</hi> let him go on a good while, and at last answered blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 'Tis tru Sir we have not such Lemons, Orenges, and Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats which you have in <hi>Spain,</hi> but we have in <hi>England</hi> good Chines of Beef, and Sirloyns of Veal, <hi>&amp;c. We have the meat, and you have but sauce for our meat.</hi> I will close up this Paragraph with this humble Advertisement; That it highly concerns the common interest of the English Nation to introduce again, and revive the most ancient and legal usage of his Majesties just rights of Preemption, and <hi>Pourvoyance</hi> or compositions for them; Otherwise it is impossible for him to keep a Court any thing sutable to a King of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>

               <p>THe greatest Antiquaries and Linguists that treat of Tongs, and of their Originals, do affirm that ther are eleven <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Tongs throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> which are 1. the <hi>Greek,</hi> 2. the <hi>Latin,</hi> 3. the <hi>High-Dutch, Teutonick</hi> or German, 4. the <hi>Slavonian,</hi> which hath two Characters, both a <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Dalmatian</hi> chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, which come neer the shape of the <hi>Latin;</hi> Then ther is 5. the <hi>British</hi> or <hi>Welsh</hi> Toung; 6. <hi>Irish;</hi> 7. The <hi>Bascuence</hi> or <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabrian,</hi> which is the reliques of the old <hi>Spanish,</hi> or <hi>Iberian</hi> toung; 8. the <hi>Albanian,</hi> of a peeple who inhabit about the mountains of <hi>Epirus;</hi> 9. the <hi>Hungarian,</hi> which came into <hi>Europe</hi> out of <hi>Asia</hi> with the <hi>Huns;</hi> 10.

Is that of the <hi>Cosacks,</hi> and <hi>Tartars.</hi> Of all these the <hi>Slavonian</hi> is of largest extent; for it is observed that three and twenty several Nations speak it.</p>

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59014:43"/>
Languages or Speeches derivd from other Toungs: The purest <hi>French,</hi> which is spoken at Court, and upon the river of <hi>Loire,</hi> is but a dialect of the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Toung; so is the <hi>Walloon,</hi> the <hi>Provensal,</hi> the <hi>Gascoon,</hi> the <hi>Limosin,</hi> and others: That of <hi>Bearn</hi> is but a Dialect of the <hi>Bascuence</hi> and <hi>Gascon;</hi> That of <hi>Britany</hi> or <hi>Armorica</hi> is but a dialect of the ancient <hi>British</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued so wonderfully in <hi>Wales</hi> after so many revolutions and changes of diffring Nations to this day.</p>
               <p>Indeed the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath an old Maternal Toung under his Dominions, which is the <hi>Cantabrian</hi> or <hi>Bascuence;</hi> all the rest are but several Idiomes or Dialects derived from the <hi>Latin,</hi> and inlayd with a multitude of <hi>Morisco</hi> words.

               </p>
               <p>But the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath two pure ancient <hi>Mother</hi>-Toungs within his Dominions; which is the <hi>British,</hi> or old <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raecan</hi> Toung; And the <hi>Irish</hi> or <hi>Hibernian</hi> Toung, which are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent of themselfs, and have no derivation or affinity at all with any other Toung. Ther are six Dialects also spoken in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; The <hi>English,</hi> which is a dialect of the <hi>Saxon</hi> or high-<hi>Dutch;</hi> Ther is the <hi>Scotish,</hi> which is a sub-dialect of the <hi>English;</hi> Ther is the <hi>Mankmen,</hi> or they of the Ile of <hi>Man,</hi> which is also a sub-dialect of the <hi>Welsh.</hi> Ther is the <hi>Highlander</hi> or <hi>Redshank,</hi> which is a dialect of the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Irish;</hi> Ther is the <hi>Cornish,</hi> which is a dialect of the <hi>Welsh;</hi> And the Language of <hi>Iersey</hi> and <hi>Gernsey</hi> (the only remains that are left us of <hi>Normandy</hi>) which is a dialect of the <hi>French.</hi> Now, It cannot be soberly denied but that it is an addition of Honour to the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to have more Mother-Toungs (reservd yet in his Dominions, and as it were unconquerd) then his two Neighbour-Kings.</p>
               <p>Touching variety of Palaces, and change of Royal Mansions, he may compare, if not out-go any of the other Kings: For within half a days journey of <hi>London</hi> he hath eight several Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and divers elswhere; wheras the French King hath but the <hi>Louvre, Fountainbleau, Bois de Vincennes, St. Germain de Laye,</hi> and <hi>Madrid,</hi> a small ruinous pile of stones which <hi>Francis</hi> the first causd to be erected in commemoration of his captivity so many yeers in <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> in a small Brick House, wherinto ther was a low little dore built by the command of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, of purpose to make the King stoop when he entred; which he observing, because he should not bow his head, went in backward, putting in his bum first.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath but his <hi>Palace,</hi> and <hi>La Casa de buen retiro</hi> in <hi>Madrid;</hi> he hath <hi>Aranjuez</hi> with the <hi>Pardo</hi> between <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> and the <hi>Escurial;</hi> where he hath a Royal House, yet it is but a Cantle of a Monastery, tis but the handle of a Gridiron,

which that great structure resembles, in memory of the Martyr St <hi>Laurence; Philip</hi> the second having bin forced, for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of avenues to batter down a <hi>Convent</hi> dedicated to that Saint a little before the battail of St <hi>Quinten,</hi> where he provd Victorious against the French; and to perform a Vow he then made, he built the Monastery of Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> at the <hi>Escurial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, touching all the foresaid Palaces in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain, Winsore</hi>-Castle may compare with any for Magnitude, Majesty and State; As Sir <hi>Thomas Roe,</hi> who had bin Ambassador at the great <hi>Mogors</hi> Court, at the Seraglio of the <hi>Gran Senior,</hi> at the <hi>German Emperours,</hi> at the <hi>French, Polonian, Danish</hi> and <hi>Swedish</hi> Courts; I say, Sir <hi>Thomae Roe</hi> did confidently and knowingly affirm, that <hi>Winsor</hi>-Castle may not only compare, but have the <hi>precedence</hi> of all the rest, in point of Grandeur, Majesty, Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Stateliness.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath Lodges, and other places of plesure without number; In regard of so many <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now, a <hi>Forest</hi> is a Franchise of so Princely a tenure, that according to the Laws of <hi>England</hi> none but the King himself can have a <hi>Forest;</hi> if he chance to pass one over to a subject, tis no more <hi>Forest,</hi> but a <hi>Frank Chase.</hi> A Forest hath peculiar Laws of her own to take cognizance of, and punish all Trespasses: A <hi>Forest</hi> hath her Court of Attachments, or <hi>Swainmote</hi>-Court where matters are as legally pleadable as at <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall.

                  <hi>The Ninth Paragraph.</hi> Touching the Prudential Laws and Constitutions of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> relating to Prince and Peeple: As also, The Eminence and Variety of Honours which the King can confer, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>VVHat the Arteries, Nerfs and Cartilages are to the Body <hi>Natural,</hi> the same are <hi>Laws</hi> to the <hi>Political;</hi> they are the <hi>Ligaments</hi> of a Kingdom, which connect and tie all sorts of peeple, though of so many different humors, in one Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and under one Souverain head.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Common</hi> Law of <hi>England,</hi> though in some things it differs from the <hi>Civil,</hi> by which most parts of <hi>Europe</hi> are governd, yet it hath the rationability and justness, the general notions and aym of the <hi>Civil</hi> Law, which is to preserve evry one in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of his own, and the Souverain Prince in honour, power and Safety. The main quarrel against it, is, that it wants <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> and that it is not reducible to any, or capable to be dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted into such a <hi>Pandect</hi> as the Civil Law is. Wherunto it may be answered, That the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> hath for its grounds 1. <hi>Custome,</hi> 2. <hi>Iudicial Records,</hi> And 3. <hi>Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement</hi> or <hi>Statuts.</hi> The two later being declarations of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or <hi>Customary</hi> Law of the Land, are methodizd and digested to order, as the book of Statuts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whence the Sheriffs, the Justices of peace, and Constables, with other Officers, may learn their duties, and how to execut their places, and any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject els may know how to keep himself within the bounds of his obedience. But the Common Law of the Land consisting of Cases, Precedents and Judgments, as also of Immemorial and Uninterrupted <hi>Municipal</hi> Customs, which being no <hi>Written</hi> Things, Therfore it is no wonder that the professors therof have not bin so curious, to attempt hitherto the <hi>Methodizing</hi> of that Art which consists most of Custom and Usage; yet fair Essays are made daily for better retaining the same in memory, by putting <hi>particular Cases</hi> under <hi>general Rules,</hi> wherof ther are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Volums frequently publishd of late yeers.</p>
               <p>Now, the Laws of <hi>England</hi> look two ways, either upon the <hi>Souverain Prince,</hi> or upon the peeple: Touching the later, ther is no Law upon earth so careful and tender of a mans life (or livelihood) be he the meanest subject under the Crown, as the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> is: For wheras in other Countries a single Judge and Witness may take away ones life (or estate) wherof the one may be <hi>subornd,</hi> the other <hi>corrupted;</hi> tis not so in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59014:45"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> but besides Witnesses and Judges, ther be two sorts of <hi>Iuries,</hi> one the Grand Inquest, which consists of twenty four Gentlemen, or able Freeholders, to consider by a previous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation of all Bills of Inditement to be preferd to the Judicial Court, which upon strict examination they either approve, and transfer to the Court by writing upon the Bill, <hi>Billa vera;</hi> or they disallow it by writing <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> Such causes as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, if they concern <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> are further referrd to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iury</hi> to consider of, because the case is of such importance; but others of lighter moment, are upon their allowance fined by the Bench without more ado, Except the party traverse the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement, or chalenge it for insufficiencie, or remove the Cause to a higher Court by a <hi>Certiorari,</hi> in which two former cases it is referrd to another Jury, and in the later transmitted to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and presently upon the allowance of this Bill by the Grand Inquest, the party is said to be Indited; but such as they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow are deliverd to the Bench, by whom they are forthwith cancelld or torn. The Indited party being to stand afterwards at the Bar, and desiring to be tryed by <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Country,</hi> ther is a Petty Jury empannelld of Twelve, who bear the publick repute of honest men; and the Law of <hi>England</hi> is so indulgent of life, that the prisoner may <hi>challenge</hi> or except against any to such a number; and withal a Butcher, who is inurd to bloud and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is incapable by the Law to be a Jury-man for life. So the said Jury, after a strict and painful examination of the Fact, with all the least circumstances therof, deliver their Verdict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their consciences, wherby the Judg doth acquit or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the party according to the quality of the offence: nor can any <hi>pecuniary</hi> Mulct satisfie for the life of any, as it is in other Countries. And as the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> is thus so tender of humane <hi>life,</hi> so it is as cautious, indulgent and careful of the <hi>livelihood</hi> and propriety of the meanest subject in the Land, which in case of controversie is done also by Jury, and put home to the Consciences of twelve indifferent good men, and not left only to the breast and opinion of any one Judge, be he never so learned, and incorrupt. The English Law like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise favors Widows and Orphans, and the poor have Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel appointed them <hi>gratis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It appeers out of the premisses what a great regard the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Lex Terrae,</hi> hath to the lifes and properties of the <hi>peeple</hi> in point of Justice. Now in point of Reverence and Loyalty to the Souverain Prince (which is more pertinent to this disourse) ther is no Law hath higher regards likewise that way, nor also to his honour and dignity, to his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and safety, to his Royal Prerogatives and glory, which Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives intrinsecally stick, and are inherent in the Crown,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59014:46"/>
yet are <hi>they,</hi> and the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the Subject determined, and bound by the Law. The Laws of <hi>England</hi> make the <hi>King</hi> their <hi>Protector;</hi> and reason good, for they are his own <hi>Productions,</hi> tis he that puts life into them; They bear such reverence to his person, that in his <hi>Presence</hi> none can be seizd, or violently layd hands on, or arrested, his very <hi>presence</hi> being a <hi>Protection</hi> for the time: He who giveth but a blow to any in his Court, the Law adjudgeth him to loose his Right hand. The Law sayth that the King hath his Title to the Imperial Crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and to his Kingly Office and power, not as a <hi>fiduciary</hi> thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from the peeple, but by inherent <hi>birthright,</hi> and inalienable heritage immediatly from God, from Nature, and from the fundamental Constitutions of the Land: He hath not only <hi>Ius paternum,</hi> a paternal power over his subjects, but <hi>Ius despoticum &amp; herile:</hi> he hath <hi>dominion</hi> over them, which Dominion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volvd upon him <hi>gratiâ Dei,</hi> by Divine dispensation and favour. Ther is no Alleageance or Fealty due to any other power but to the King. The Law is so careful of the sacred person of the King, that it reacheth unto the very <hi>thoughts,</hi> and restrains them from machination of any evil against him: For the Law says it is Treson to <hi>Imagine</hi> mischief against the King, much more to attempt, act and execute it.</p>
               <p>The Common Law of <hi>England</hi> makes the King the Supreme and independent Governour, And all other persons derive their power and authority from him, either by his Royal Writ, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or Commission. The Law presupposeth that he sits not only at the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> but in other Courts of Judicature; for the Writs go, <hi>Teste meipso:</hi> And because the Law sayth that the King must govern in <hi>Mercie</hi> and Justice, the sole power of <hi>Pardoning</hi> is in Him.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the power of <hi>Coinage</hi> is only in the King, with the enhancing or decrying the price of money: He is the sole Gran Master of the <hi>Mint;</hi> wheras in <hi>France</hi> others partake with the King in this high <hi>Prerogative:</hi> Nor doth any Kings <hi>Face</hi> shine in purer Metal; for it shines onely in pure Gold and Silver, and that of the finest Standard, Mixture and Allay of any in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi> wheras I have seen and felt the face of the <hi>French</hi> King in Copper and Brass, with other mixt mongrel stuff; As also of the King of <hi>Spain's,</hi> though he terms himself the Monark of Gold and Silver Mines; yet the common currant Coyn twixt Merchant and Mechanick is <hi>Copper,</hi> wherin the <hi>Hollander</hi> by his cunning hath done him a world of mischief from time to time, by counterfaiting that Copper Coyn, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

that one time, when all the <hi>Vellon</hi> or Copper Coin was calld in, and a scrutiny made how much had bin coynd, ther were many millions more found to be brought in, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faited, then had bin stampd in the Kings Mint.</p>
               <p>By the Common Law of the Land, the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath three Royal Ensignes which cannot belong to any other: He hath the <hi>Crown,</hi> the <hi>Scepter,</hi> and the (<hi>Polemical) Sword,</hi> (as I have mentiond in another Treatise, and is proper to <hi>touch</hi> here.) By the first, He <hi>reigns;</hi> by the second he <hi>makes Laws;</hi> by the third, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sword,</hi> He <hi>protects</hi> them. Concerning the <hi>Crown,</hi> or Royal Diadem, the Laws of <hi>England</hi> assert, that it descends upon his head by a right Hereditary line, though through d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ancient Royal Races, wherof some were <hi>Conquerors.</hi> The <hi>Crown</hi> is <hi>His,</hi> as much as any mans <hi>Cap's</hi> his own; And ther is no Crown stuck with fairer Flowers, I mean <hi>Royal Prerogatives,</hi> wherof divers were spoken of before.</p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>Scepter,</hi> it may be calld an Individual Copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or a Royal Appendix to the Crown: It doth capacitate the King to Enact Laws: for before his <hi>Assent,</hi> all the Results and Determinations of Parlement are but <hi>Bills;</hi> they may be said to be but abortive things, and meer Embryos; nay, they have no life at all in them, till the King by his breath infuseth vigour and animation into them; and the ancient Custom was for the King to touch them with the <hi>Scepter,</hi> then they are <hi>Laws,</hi> and have a virtue in them to impose an universal obligation upon all sorts of peeple. Now, it is an undeniable Principle of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> That nothing can be generally binding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kings Royal Assent, nor doth the Law take notice of any thing without it: This makes Them to be calld afterwards the <hi>Kings Laws;</hi> and the Judges are said to deliver the <hi>Kings Iudgments:</hi> nay, he himself is always Lord Chief Justice of <hi>England,</hi> which Title is not assumable by any Subject. Now, before an English Law is made, ther is mature and mighty long <hi>deliberation</hi> goes before: for first the business is agitated and canvasd many days in the House of Commons (which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents all the peeple of <hi>England</hi>) till it comes to the ripeness of a Bill: The Bill being drawn, is read thrice in the House; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving passd the brunt of all Exception, tis engrossd and transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Lords; and there also tis read <hi>thrice,</hi> and debated with much deliberation: Then by concurrence of both Houses tis presented to the King, who consults with his Learned Counsel whether ther be any thing therin derogatory to his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: if not, He gives his Royal Assent, and then tis created a <hi>Law,</hi> and generally binding. Touching the power of the <hi>Sword,</hi> it is more proper to treat of it in the next Paragraph.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the <hi>Lex Terrae,</hi> the Common Law of <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:59014:47"/>
makes the King the <hi>Fountain of Honour;</hi> nay, without any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement or offence be it spoken, He can confer Honor upon other Kings, and Souverain Princes, as he is Souverain of the Order of <hi>Saint George,</hi> wherof ther have bin eight <hi>Emperors;</hi> five Kings of the <hi>French,</hi> four of <hi>Spain,</hi> seven of <hi>Portugal,</hi> two of the <hi>Scots,</hi> four of <hi>Denmark,</hi> three of <hi>Naples,</hi> one of <hi>Poland,</hi> and another of <hi>Sweden;</hi> two Dukes of <hi>Urbine,</hi> one of <hi>Millain,</hi> one of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> one of <hi>Savoy,</hi> one of <hi>Calabria,</hi> one of <hi>Holland,</hi> one of <hi>Gueldres;</hi> four Princes of <hi>Orenge,</hi> seven <hi>Counts Palatin</hi> of the <hi>Rhin;</hi> two Dukes of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> two of <hi>Holstain,</hi> one of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi> and one Duke of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> with divers other Forren Princes.</p>
               <p>Now, among all Orders purely Military, ther is not any now remaining in the Christian world, either more ancient or hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then the Noble Order of <hi>Saint George,</hi> wherof the <hi>Garter</hi> is a Symbole; therfore are they calld <hi>Equites periscelidis,</hi> Knights of the most Noble Order of the <hi>Garter;</hi> which <hi>Order</hi> was first instituted by that Victorious King <hi>Edward the third,</hi> (who was offerd to be Emperour) <hi>Anno</hi> 1350. which was threescore yeers wanting one before the Institution of the <hi>French</hi> Order of <hi>S. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> by <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh; and 229 yeers before the Order of <hi>St. Esprit</hi> by <hi>Henry the third;</hi> and full fourscore yeers before the erection of the Order of the <hi>Golden Fleece</hi> by <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy:</hi> It is also 209 more ancient then the Order of the Knights of the <hi>Elephant,</hi> which was devisd by the Kings of <hi>Denmark;</hi> and much more then that of <hi>Amaranta</hi> excogitated by <hi>Sweden,</hi> &amp;c. Now observable it is, that among all these Orders, <hi>l'ordre del toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son d'or,</hi> the Order of the Golden Fleece related to the English <hi>Wools</hi> which were transported to <hi>Flanders</hi> by our Merchants, wherby all the Provinces adjoyning did so infinitly enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs: And this Order of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> as it is one of the highest Esteem, so it hath most affinity with our Order of St. <hi>George</hi> in point of Regulation, as also that ther are so few of it. For our Order is accounted far the Nobler, because it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly kept it self to the same number of Knights, <hi>viz.</hi> 26. since the primitive Institution; wheras the <hi>French Orders</hi> have multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied so fast in number of Knights, that one said the Order of the <hi>French Knighthoods are now become Collers for every Ass to wear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as this high Order of <hi>St. George</hi> hath the <hi>precedence</hi> of all other now worn by any King, in point of Antiquity; so the ground and designe of it was very Noble: For when the first <hi>Idea</hi> of erecting a new Order of Knighthood entred into the head of the foresaid Heroick King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, his thoughts reflected upon King <hi>Arthur,</hi> who indeed was the first founder of <hi>Knighthood</hi> not only among <hi>Christians,</hi> but of any other Nation
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59014:47"/>
upon earth, As also the first King who gave Royal Arms, His Coat being <hi>Azure, nine Crowns Or, marshalld</hi> 3. 3. 2. and 1. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings gave Arms; And <hi>Edward</hi> the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors Coat was <hi>Azure, a Cross patence between four Martelets Or.</hi> And as King <hi>Arthurs Round Table,</hi> which is yet to be seen at <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> had seats for twenty six Knights; so it seems King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> proportiond his number. Now, the occasion of it was, That he having resolvd upon a War with <hi>France</hi> for attaining that Crown, which was due unto him by his Mothers side, He conceavd it advantageous to invite and engage to his party such as were of a Martial spirit, And to that end erected a round Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at <hi>Windsore,</hi> in imitation of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> where they were entertaind with Tilts and Tournements, magnificent Feasts, and other Princely ways to unite and encourage them. <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> who was in possession of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to countermine him by erecting also the like <hi>Table</hi> in his Court, and so drew many gallant and adventurous spirits that way, and some out of <hi>England;</hi> so that King <hi>Edward</hi> not finding this designe answerable to his mind, he fell on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, such as might prove more adherent and binding unto Him; to which end he establishd this high Order of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry consisting of <hi>twenty six</hi> persons of eminent note, wherof <hi>He Himself</hi> and his Successors Kings of <hi>England</hi> were to be perpetual <hi>Souverains:</hi> All of them were to be men of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick parts, and such as shold be obligd by Oath and Honour to adhere unto Him upon all occasions; which might be the probablest cause that he made the <hi>Garter</hi> for a Badg therof to be fastned about the left leg with a Buckle of Gold to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally worn; therfore are They stild <hi>Equites Periscelidis,</hi> (as was touchd before) which hath its Etymologie from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>udes that those Knights shold be bound in one League and Confederation of love and affection severally one unto another, and all of them in joynt service to the <hi>Souverain.</hi> Some ther are who are of opinion, that the <hi>Garter</hi> was given because that in a <hi>Battle</hi> where King <hi>Edward</hi> provd Victorious, he had given the word <hi>Garter</hi> for a Signal: Others in a derogatory way wold ground it upon the Countess of <hi>Salisburies</hi> Garter falling off from her in a dance, and so taken up by the King: But the Black Book in <hi>Winsore</hi> (which deserves most faith in this point) gives the <hi>first</hi> Reason for it. Among other Laws that were enacted in the Chapter when this Order was first raysd, one was, That evry Knight by solemn Oath upon the Evangelists was sworn <hi>to defend the Honor and Quarrels, the Rights and Lordship of the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vrain,</hi> &amp;c. Such a Sacramental Oath the Knights of the <hi>Bath</hi> also take, which is, <hi>To love their Sovrain above all earthly cretures,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59014:48"/>
                  <hi>and for his right and dignity to live and die,</hi> &amp;c. Therfore, I have often stood astonishd at the largeness of the consciences of some <hi>Knights</hi> of both these <hi>Orders,</hi> who besides other astringing Oaths, as those of <hi>Allegeance, Supremacy,</hi> &amp;c. could dispense with them All in the late <hi>Rebellion</hi> so far, as not only not to adhere to their Sovrain Liege-Lord and King, when his life was sought for by small and great Shots, with other instruments of open hostility and slaughter, but to appeer for, to serve and stick unto the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary party</hi> all the while: Truly under favor, I wold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>be-loth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change souls with them. We will put a period to this Discours of the ancient Noble Order of <hi>St. George</hi> with a signal observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Bodin's: Decretum fuit in Collegio Equitum Periscelidis in Anglia ponere stemmata Regis Francorum ante caetera omnia post Principem Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis:</hi> It was decreed in the College of the Knights of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>England,</hi> to put the Stems of the King of the <hi>French</hi> before all other except the <hi>Prince</hi> of the Order. And the reason I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive was, that <hi>Philip</hi> the second whiles King of <hi>England</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly put before. But <hi>Bodin</hi> was herin deceavd, for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Arms (wherof ther have bin eight of the <hi>Order</hi>) go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and have the precedence.</p>
               <p>Out of the premises may be deducd this <hi>cleer</hi> Conclusion, as a Meridian Truth, that the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> in all things ayms at the Honour and glory, the power and authority, the Safeness and incolumity of the <hi>Sovrain</hi> Prince, more then the Laws of any Country: And wheras we had some touches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how the <hi>Common Law,</hi> which is peculiar only to <hi>England,</hi> hath the <hi>rationability</hi> of the <hi>Civil</hi> Law, though not so digested to <hi>Method,</hi> in regard it consists most of <hi>Custom, Cases</hi> and <hi>presidents;</hi> we will conclude this Paragraph with some principles wherin they both agree; As, <hi>Actori incumbit onus probandi,</hi> The proof lies on the Accuser: <hi>Nemo oportet esse sapientior legibus,</hi> No man ought to think himself wiser then the Laws: <hi>Ubi lex non distinguit, ibi non est distinguendum;</hi> We must not distinguish where the Law doth not: <hi>Accessorium non ducit, sed sequitur suum principale,</hi> The Accessory doth not lead but follow the principal: <hi>Volenti non fit injuria,</hi> No wrong can be done to him who is willing: <hi>Agentes &amp; Consentientes pari poena plectun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> Actor and consenter are to be punished alike: <hi>Apices Iuris non sunt Iura,</hi> The punctilios of the Law is no Law: <hi>Nemo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test esse Iudex in propria causa,</hi> No man can be Judge in his own cause: <hi>Caveat Emptor,</hi> Let the Buyer beware: <hi>Contraria alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans non est audiendus,</hi> Who alledgeth contraries is not to be heard: <hi>Cujus est dare ejus est disponere,</hi> The Giver may dispose of his gift as he pleaseth: <hi>Quilibet in Arte sua est credendus,</hi> Evry one is to be believed in his own Art: <hi>Potestas derivativa non potest esse major primitiva,</hi> A Commissioner cannot have

               <p>By these few Principles, with multitudes more, it appeers that the <hi>Common Law</hi> hath much affinity with the <hi>Civil;</hi> wherof ther are as learned <hi>Professors</hi> in <hi>England</hi> as any where els.</p>
               <p>Whence it may be inferrd, that the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is supplied with more helps for the administration of Justice then any Nation in the world besides. For in regard that <hi>England</hi> is an Iland having such a great Trade at Sea, and so great dealing with divers other Nations; Having also besides Land-matters both <hi>Temporal, Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Maritime,</hi> which are not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the <hi>Common Law,</hi> He allows of the <hi>Civil Law</hi> answerable

to the quality of the Case, which hath bin practised in <hi>England</hi> beyond the memory of man, or the reach of any Record. And though ther happen oft some Emulations and high Contests be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these two Professions, yet such hath bin the prudence of the <hi>Souvrain Prince</hi> to keep them both in as equal a Balance as could be, and not to suffer the one to insult or encroach upon the other, but to have the same freedom of study and practice to the universal good of Forreners, as well as of his own Subjects.</p>

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> The power of the County. So that in time of peace <hi>England</hi> alone hath an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty thousand Soldiers enrolld, besides those in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> And in time of War, the late bloudy Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion (bleeding yet in the purses and estates of many thousand poor Cavaliers) hath sufficiently tryed the strength (and wealth) of <hi>England:</hi> For ther was a computation made at one time of those that were in actual Arms for <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parlement,</hi> and they came to neer upon two hundred thousand fighting men under Commission, wherof ther were about fifty thousand <hi>Horse</hi> and <hi>Dragoons:</hi> And I do not remember to have read that in the time of the famous <hi>Ligue</hi> in <hi>France</hi> ther were so many, take in <hi>strangers</hi> and all.</p>
               <p>Hence we see that the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> may be said to have a constant standing Army in time of peace, of which he hath the sole disposing: For the <hi>Sword</hi> is his as much as the <hi>Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter</hi> and the <hi>Crown,</hi> which are inalienable from his power, and incommunicable to any other but by his Royal Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And indeed tis the <hi>Sword</hi> that makes all Kings powerful; The <hi>Crown</hi> and the <hi>Scepter</hi> are but impotent, and poor unweildy things; they are but naked Indefensible badges without it. Ther's none so filly as to think ther's meant hereby an ordinary single sword, such as evry one carrieth by his side; Or some Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary thing, or <hi>Chymera</hi> of a sword; No, tis the publik <hi>Polemical Sword</hi> of the whole Nation; It may be calld an Aggregative or compound Sword, made up of all the Ammunition, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, Pikes, Muskets, Helmets, Headpeeces, with all kind of armes small and great; It reacheth to all the Military strengths both by Land and Sea, to all tenable places, as Castles, Forts, Bulwarks, within and about the whole Iland: The Kings of <hi>England</hi> have had the sole power of this <hi>Sword,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> gives it them by vertue of their Royal Signory from all times: The very Law doth gird it to their sides; They employ it for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling all Forren force, For vindicating all Forren wrongs and affronts, For suppressing all intestine Tumults and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, And to protect and secure the weal of the whole Body politick. The peeple of <hi>England</hi> (represented in Parlement)
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59014:50"/>
were never capable to manage this Sword, the Fundamental Constitutions of the Country flatly denieth it them; This Sword is fit only to hang at the Kings side, as the Great Seal hangs at his girdle, being as it were the key of the whole Kingdom: and it is recorded of the Emperour <hi>Charlemain,</hi> that he carried his <hi>Great Seal</hi> always embossd upon the pommel of his <hi>Sword;</hi> which signified that he was ready to make good and maintain what he had <hi>Seald.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, to let the <hi>Peeple</hi> have the <hi>Sword,</hi> is to put it into a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hand: And one of the pregnantst Forren examples to prove this, is that notorious Popular insurrection in <hi>France</hi> calld <hi>La Iaquerie de Beauvoisin,</hi> when the Peasans and Mechanicks had a designe to wrest it out of the Kings hand, for to depress all the Peers and <hi>Noblesse</hi> of the Kingdom: and the Rebellion had grown to such a strength, that it was like to take effect, had not the Prelats and Churchmen stuck close to the King and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: but afterwards, poor hare-braind things, they desired the King upon bended knee to take the <hi>Sword</hi> again.</p>
               <p>The Civilians, (who in all points are not so great frends to Royalty as the <hi>Common Law</hi> is) assert, That ther are six <hi>Praeroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> which belong to a <hi>Souvrain Prince:</hi> 1. <hi>Armamenta Army:</hi> 2. <hi>Potestas Iudicatoria,</hi> power of Judicature: 3. <hi>Potestas vitae &amp; necis,</hi> power of life and death: 4. <hi>Bona adespota,</hi> masterless goods: 5. <hi>Census,</hi> the numbring of the people: 6. <hi>Monetarum valor,</hi> the raising or abating the value of the publick Coyn. Among these <hi>Regalias</hi> we finde that <hi>Arming,</hi> which in effect is nothing els but the Kings <hi>Sword,</hi> is one, and as I said before, tis as proper and peculiar to his Person, and to be soly on his <hi>side,</hi> as the Crown on his <hi>Head,</hi> or the Scepter in his hand, and of greater importance then either: For by those <hi>two</hi> he draws only a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary love, and an opinion from his Subjects; but by the <hi>Sword</hi> (as threed thorow a Needles eye) he draws a Reverential Fear and aw. Now, these two mixd with the other, are the best In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of Government. With the <hi>Sword</hi> he confers Honors, as dubbing of Knights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From this Sword all the chiefest Magistrates have their authority; The Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Lords Mayors of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>York</hi> have their Swords by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation from Him; and when he entreth any place Corporat, the first thing which is presented unto him is the <hi>Sword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor doth the point of this <hi>Sword</hi> pass thorow the diameter, and reach only to evry corner of his own Dominions, but it extends beyond the Seas, as well to preserve his Subjects from oppression, and denial of Justice, as to vindicat publike wrongs and affronts, to make good the Interests of his Crown, as also to assist his Confederats and friends. And this publick <hi>Sword</hi> is so insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from him, that by the Law of the Land he cannot ungird
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59014:50"/>
himself of it, or transfer it to any other; for that were to desert the <hi>protection</hi> of his peeple, which is point blank against his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-Oath, and Office. Therfore the very <hi>Proposition</hi> it self, that the Long Parlement made to his late Majesty to have the <hi>Militia</hi> passd over unto them, was no less then <hi>High Treason:</hi> for nothing could be more derogatory to his Kingly Honor, which they had protested so solemnly to maintain by their so many publick Instruments and Oaths.</p>
               <p>We proceed now from the <hi>Rural</hi> Power, or Country-cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to his <hi>Oppidan</hi> Strength; And first of his Court at <hi>Westminster,</hi> where ther are 200 goodly tall men of his Gard; Then he hath a <hi>Band</hi> of Pensioners, who are Gentlemen of quality and wealth. Moreover, he hath 3000 Foot, and 1000 Horse, for his Life-Gard, besides divers Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in sundry Towns.</p>
               <p>And now we make our entrance into the City of <hi>London,</hi> that huge Magazin of Men and Might; A City that may well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with any in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> not only for <hi>Power,</hi> but for any thing els, and in some particulars may haply go beyond them, and deserve a <hi>Precedence,</hi> as shall be shewd. Nor doth this <hi>Power</hi> extend only to her own Self-protection, but it may be made use of for any part of the Kingdome upon any Civil Insurrection, or otherwise, as it shall please the <hi>Sovrain Prince</hi> (and no other whatsoever) to employ it.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>London</hi> is like a fair Quiver of keen strong Arrows for the King to draw forth upon all occasions, for his own and his peeples preservation: For besides twelve thousand choice gallant Citizens in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> with the Hamlets of the Tower, who are enrolld, and always ready, and have their Arms fixd for Honor and Defence, ther may be, as appears by divers Censes and Computations which have bin made, about two hundred thousand choice able men raisd for service if neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity requires, and the City will scarce sensibly miss them; nor are Seamen, Mariners and Water-men meant to be of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> I may well avouch, have not any such Town or City: That which is most capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with <hi>London</hi> is <hi>Paris,</hi> for which she hath many advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for she is a <hi>Cité, Ville</hi> and <hi>Université,</hi> she is a City, a Town and an <hi>University,</hi> as also the chiefest Residence of the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
               <p>But lets go a little to particulars, and first to the <hi>Populousness</hi> of both Cities. They say that the Parishes of St. <hi>Eustace</hi> and St. <hi>Innocent</hi> which lie about the centre of <hi>Paris,</hi> have above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Communicants in them alone; and that by the last Cense which was made, ther were neer upon a million of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59014:51"/>
humane Souls in City and Suburbs, wherof the sixth part are made up of <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Church-men,</hi> which the King cannot make use of upon Military occasions: But look a little forward it will appeer that <hi>London</hi> hath above a Million of souls.</p>
               <p>For largeness and magnitude tis tru, that <hi>Paris</hi> hath the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of an Orbicular Figure, which is most capacious of any: But by the judgment of those Mathematicians who have taken a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vay of both Cities, if <hi>London</hi> were cast into a <hi>Circle</hi> she wold be altogether as big as <hi>Paris.</hi> Touching publick Buildings, tis tru, that the <hi>Louvre</hi> is a vast Fabrick, and the like is not found in <hi>London;</hi> but tis the only Court the <hi>French</hi> King hath in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wheras in <hi>London</hi> ther are four Royal Seats, with two Parks annex'd to them. I hope the <hi>Bastille</hi> will not offer to compare with the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> nor the River of <hi>Seine</hi> with the <hi>Thames;</hi> much less I believe will <hi>Paris</hi> offer to make any comparison with <hi>London</hi> in point of Traffick, and Societies of Noble adventuring Merchants, who trade on both sides of the earth as far as the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes;</hi> And divers <hi>Kings</hi> have been of their <hi>Corporations.</hi> Nor will the <hi>Provost</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> I think offer to compare with the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> being the prime Man in <hi>England</hi> upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease of the King until another be proclaimed. The City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> hath divers other advantages not only of <hi>Paris,</hi> but of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther City of <hi>Europe</hi> take them all together; which for a more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical proceeding we will particularize as they are found in my <hi>Londinopolis;</hi> which being so proper to this Paragraph, I thought fit to insert here, and being well considered, it will be found that <hi>London</hi> need not vail to any City under the Sun.</p>

               <p>Tis confessd that many of these conveniences may be found in other Cities, which taken singly may exceed <hi>London</hi> in <hi>some;</hi> but take them all together she may vie with the best of them, and run no great hazard.</p>
               <p>Concerning the first advantage, which is convenience of si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, and salubrity of Air, the wisdome of the old <hi>Britains</hi> our Ancestors is to be much commended for the election of the place in point of the benignity of the Hevens, with the temperature and influences therof, wherin <hi>London</hi> is as happy as any other City under the Skies. Some hold that that City is best situated which resembleth a Camels back, who hath by nature protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancies and bunches; so a City shold be seated upon small Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks or rising Grounds: It is just the posture of <hi>London,</hi> for she is built upon the sides, flanks, and tops of divers small Hillocks lying neer the banks of a great Navigable River, being incompassd about with delightful green Medows and Fields on all sides: She is at so fitting a distance from the Sea, that no Forren Invasion can surprize her but she must have notice ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The quality of her soyle is Gravel and Sand, which is held to be the wholsomst for habitation, and conduceth much to the goodness of the Air, though it useth to be barren: but that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness is remedied by Art and Composts, insomuch that round about the City, within the distance of a mile or two, one may behold two or three thousand milchd Cows a grazing evry day of the week, besides number of other Beasts.</p>
               <p>Touching the second advantage, which is a strict and constant cours of Government, ther's no place goes beyond Her, or indeed can equal Her, take night and day together. And wheras in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> one dare not pass the <hi>Pont-Neuf,</hi> with any place els, after Ten a clock at night without danger, one may pass through <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>-streets as safely as in the day time; ther being Constables and their Watch up and down to secure Passengers: yet they must give good account of their being abroad so late, ther being strict Laws against <hi>Noctivagation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59014:52"/>Touching the Magnificence, Gravity, and State of the chief Magistrate, neither the <hi>Pretor</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Prefect</hi> of <hi>Milan;</hi> neither the <hi>Procurators</hi> of <hi>St. Mark</hi> in <hi>Venice,</hi> or their Podesta's in other Cities; neither the Provost of <hi>Paris,</hi> or the <hi>Mark</hi>-grave of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> or any other Oppidan Magistrate goes beyond the Lord-Mayor and Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> if one go to the variety of their Robes, somtimes Scarlet richly surrd, somtimes Purple, somtimes Violet and Puke. What gallant Shows are therby Water and Land the day that the new Lord-Mayor is sworn! What a huge Feast and Banquet is provided for him!</p>
               <p>Touching the Regulation of all sorts of Trade, and Laws for the improvement therof, the City of <hi>London</hi> hath not her fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>Touching variety of Artisans, <hi>London</hi> abounds with all sorts. Tis tru, that mingling with Forreners hath much advantagd her herin: But those strangers themselfs confess that the <hi>English</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got an Invention, use to <hi>improve</hi> it and bring it to a greater perfection.</p>
               <p>Touching Corporations, Halls, Fraternities, Guilds, and Societies, <hi>London</hi> hath not any Superiour; witness the twelve great Companies, out of which one is elected yeerly to be Lord <hi>Mayor,</hi> with threescore several Companies of Citizens besides. And touching all sorts of Opificers, and variety of industrious ways to improve all kinde of Manufactures, and therby gain an honest livelyhood and proportion of Riches, <hi>London</hi> may be calld (as <hi>Luca</hi> is in <hi>Italy</hi>) a <hi>Hive of Bees,</hi> or a Hill of Ants, which have always been accounted the Emblemes of Industry and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>Touching abundance, and plenty of all kind of Provisions, as Flesh, Fish, Fowl, Fruits, Fuel, variety of Drinks and Wines, with any other Commodity that may conduce to Plesure and Delight as well as to supply Necessity, <hi>London</hi> may glory to be as well servd as any City under Heven. A knowing <hi>Spaniard</hi> said, that he thought <hi>Eastcheap</hi>-shambles alone vended more Flesh then is spent one week with another in all the Court of <hi>Spain. Gascon</hi> Wines drink better in <hi>London</hi> then at <hi>Bourdeaux: Canary</hi> Wines better then at <hi>Lancerote: Rhenish</hi> Wines better then at <hi>Backrag.</hi> Nor doth <hi>London</hi> abound with all things for the <hi>Belly</hi> alone, but also for the <hi>Back,</hi> either to keep it warm, or make it gay. What varieties of Woollen Stuffs are found in evry Shop! What rich Broad-Clothes! some being wrought to that height of perfection, that some have been made of Ten pounds a Yard in price. But our unlucky <hi>English-Schismatiques</hi> pretending to flee for persecution of conscience, have set up their Looms, and shewd the <hi>Hollanders</hi> the way, to the great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59014:52"/>Concerning <hi>wholsome sweet Springs,</hi> and cleer <hi>Waters, London</hi> may be said to have as good Blood running through her Veins as any other, by those Aqueducts, Conduits, and conveyances of fresh Waters round about to serve for all Uses. What an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culean work was that of Sir <hi>Hugh Middletons</hi> to bring the River of <hi>Ware</hi> threescore miles by Compasses to run through her streets, and refresh her houses, as also to preserve them from fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring! for which ther are divers ingenious useful Engines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Universality of Trade,</hi> ther is no City upon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the earth goes beyond Her; For ther are no Seas that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the two and thirty winds blow upon from the Artik to the Antartik Pole, from the Orient to the setting Sun, but <hi>London</hi> by her Navigations findes them out, and makes rich returns by way of Barter or Emption.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>solid and useful Wares</hi> that she hath of her own, what a substantial Commodity, and of what high esteem all the world over is her Cloth, her Kersies, and divers kinds of Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures? Adde herunto her <hi>Lead</hi> and <hi>Tin,</hi> which she trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutes to Forren <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Healthful Corporal Recreations, and harmless Pastimes, <hi>London</hi> may go in the Van to any place that ever I saw: Go and walk in her Fields, you shall see some shooting at long Marks, some at short; some bowling upon cheerful pleasant Greens, some upon Bares and Alleys; some wrastling, some throwing the Bar, some the Stone; some Jumping, some Running; some with their Dogs in Duck-ponds, some at a Bear-baiting, some at the Bull; some Riding upon Naggs, some in Coaches to take the fresh Air; some at Stool-ball, others at Kittle-pins; with variety of other.</p>
               <p>For a stately Cathedral <hi>Temple,</hi> and general <hi>Dome</hi> of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the time was, and I hope will be yet within a few years, that <hi>London</hi> did not yeild to any City in this particular; Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church being esteemd by all Nations to be one of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentst &amp; visiblest <hi>Temples,</hi> one of the most glorious piles of stones that ever was reard, taking all the Dimensions together, with the conspicuous site thereof, being about the centre of the City, and upon a rising Ground. She hath also this singular property to be founded upon <hi>Faith,</hi> by having a large Parish-Church of that name supporting her, and directly under her Chancel.</p>
               <p>Touching a rare huge <hi>Bridge,</hi> and Navigable <hi>River, London</hi> is not inferiour to any other City whatsoever. Concerning the first, what a rich Rent hath it to preserve it self yearly! what a vast Magazin of Corn is ther always in the Bridge-house against a Dearth! (as well as in many other places.) What a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Officers look to the reparations therof, and are hansomly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59014:53"/>
maintaind therby! Touching the second, <hi>viz.</hi> The River of <hi>Thames,</hi> she hath not her <hi>peer,</hi> if regard be had to the length and straightness of her cours running from West to East, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out so many Meanders as other Rivers have; Her convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Sea to prevent all Surprisals; The Amoenity of the Soyle on both Banks; The wholsomness of her water, which makes the best Beer in the world, being so much transported by other Nations, and sold as dear as Wine; The diversity of her Fish, the fatness of her Mudd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For number of Humane Souls in City and Suburbs, <hi>London</hi> is nothing inferior to <hi>Paris,</hi> whose last Cense, as is said before, came to about a Million: But in the year 1636. command be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent to the Lord Mayor to make a scrutiny what number of strangers were in the City, he took occasion therby to make a general Cense; And ther were of Men, Women and Children neer upon seven hundred thousand that livd within the Bars of his Jurisdiction. And this being 27 years ago, tis thought that <hi>London</hi> hath since more by the third part in all probable conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. Now for <hi>Westminster,</hi> the <hi>Strand, Bedford Berry,</hi> St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins-lane, Long-acre, Drury-lane,</hi> St. <hi>Giles</hi> of the Field, <hi>High Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> with divers other thick-peepled places which are so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, and make one entire peece with <hi>London</hi> it self, I say take all these Buildings together, the forenamed number of Seven hundred thousand may well be thought to be double so many. Touching the shape of <hi>London,</hi> I find nothing to assimilat it unto more properly then to a <hi>Lawrel Leaf</hi> that is far more <hi>long</hi> then tis <hi>broad,</hi> which may be a cause she doth not appeer so populous as <hi>Paris,</hi> her passengers not encountring so often as they wold if she were of a round Figure. Touching her <hi>length,</hi> take all Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings that are adjoyning one to another from the utmost point of <hi>Westminster</hi> to the utmost point beyond the <hi>Tower,</hi> she may be well thought to be five Miles <hi>long,</hi> about half so much in <hi>latitude,</hi> and in <hi>Circuit</hi> about twelve Italian miles.</p>
               <p>To conclude, touching the Defensive and Offensive <hi>Power</hi> of the City of <hi>London</hi> in point of Arms of all sorts, of Artillery, Ammunition, Arsenals, and Docks on both sides the River, Her Traind Citizens and expert Firelocks, neither <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> hath her equal.</p>
               <p>It is recorded that in King <hi>Stephens</hi> Raign the City of <hi>London</hi> raisd 60000 Foot, and 20000 Horse: how many more were she able to do <hi>now</hi> in case of necessity? For to compare her <hi>in statu quo nunc</hi> to what she was <hi>then,</hi> were to compare a Giant to a Dwarf in point of proportion and strength. The <hi>Record</hi> hath it also that <hi>Anno</hi> 1293. <hi>London</hi> was able to put out a Fleet of 95 Ships to scowre and secure the Seas from Depredations and Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which she was often usd to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:59014:53"/>Such an <hi>Imperial Chamber,</hi> such, such a potent and well appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted City hath the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> always at his command: And if some of the Roman Emperours about Fifteen hundred years ago in their Diplomata's or Edicts stild her <hi>Augusta,</hi> (which was always a name of Magnificence and State) how much more may she deserve that name in the condition she now is arrivd unto!</p>
               <p>Thus have we discoursd, though in weak imperfect Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the Power and Military Might of the King of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> not including all this while his two Kingdoms of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which being cast into the Balance may make his Power so much more.</p>
               <p>Touching his <hi>Maritime</hi> Power, tis spoken of in another Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph going before; wherunto we will add, that the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath such a <hi>Haven</hi> that neither <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or indeed any part of the world can parallel, which is <hi>Milford Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> wherof the most famous ancient Authors, not only <hi>Latin</hi> but <hi>Greek,</hi> make most honourable mention, calling it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the thousand foorded Haven. One other passage we will adde, which is but fresh, that besides the reducing of the <hi>Hollander,</hi> the very last year a few of the King of <hi>Great Britains</hi> Frigats did beat those desperat Pyrats of <hi>Barbary</hi> into a Peace, wheras neither <hi>France</hi> or the <hi>Dutch</hi> could do it: And this year those few <hi>English</hi> that are in <hi>Tanger</hi> did also force <hi>Guyland</hi> the great <hi>Morocco</hi> Rebel to Articles of Peace.</p>
               <p>As I was writing this, me thought I had whisperd in my ear, that the <hi>French King</hi> hath one kind of <hi>Power</hi> that transcends any of the King of <hi>Great Britains,</hi> which is, that he may impose what <hi>Taxes</hi> he please upon the peeple by his <hi>Edicts</hi> alone. Tis tru he can, and he may thank the <hi>English</hi> for that power; for when they had coopd him up in a corner of <hi>France,</hi> (in <hi>Berry</hi>) the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious English</hi> being Masters of the rest, That <hi>Power</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was in the Assembly of the <hi>three Estates</hi> of laying <hi>Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> was invested in the <hi>King</hi> himself <hi>pro tempore</hi> during the Wars because the three Estates could not assemble: But this Power makes him a King of <hi>Slaves</hi> rather then of <hi>Free Subjects;</hi> and if they may be calld Subjects, they are Subjects of an <hi>Asinin</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which cannot have any tru manly courage in them, or a competency of wealth to bear it up; which is the cause that though <hi>France</hi> be a rich and self-sufficient Country, yet some think ther are more <hi>Beggers</hi> in Her then in all <hi>Christendome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. Now, it is a Principle in the Civil Law, That <hi>Dominum habere nobiliorem confert ad dignitatem Vassalorum, &amp; nobiliorum habere populum confert ad nobilitatem Principis;</hi> To have the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Lord conduceth to the dignity of the Vassal, and to have
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59014:54"/>
the nobler Peeple conduceth to the dignity of the Prince. By this Axiome the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is the more Noble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is Lord of a free-born wealthy peeple, and not of <hi>Slaves</hi> and Beggers. Yet it cannot be denied but that it is one of the greatest advantages of power and repute for a King to be <hi>Rich,</hi> (provided he come not to be so by grinding the faces of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.) The Republik of <hi>Venice</hi> and the Seat of <hi>Genoa</hi> carry that high esteem in the world, because the one hath the Tresury of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> and the other the Bank of St. <hi>George.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> is stild the <hi>Grand Duke</hi> more then other Dukes who have larger <hi>Territories,</hi> because he hath always a rich Tresury.</p>
               <p>Therfore I will draw towards a conclusion of this Paragraph with this most humble <hi>Intimation</hi> to the great Council of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> now <hi>Prorogued,</hi> that at their <hi>Re-access</hi> they wold please to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider; that wheras the fame of being <hi>Rich,</hi> and to have the Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of his Crown well ballasted, conduceth so much to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute</hi> of a King, and so by Reflexions upon the whole Nation, As also to make Him <hi>redoubtable</hi> both abroad and at home; And wheras the contrary <hi>fame</hi> exposeth him to contempt, Insultings and Pasquils, (as some frisking <hi>French</hi> Wits have bin lately too busie and bold that way) and likewise our Neighbour <hi>Hans</hi> who daily offers us such insolencies: which makes me think of an <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, which though <hi>homely,</hi> yet it comes <hi>home</hi> to this purpose, <hi>Cavagliero (ò Principe) senza quatrini, è come un muro sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za croce da tutti scompisciato;</hi> A Cavalier (or Prince) without money, is like a Wall without a <hi>Cross</hi> for evry one to draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Therfore I am bold to reiterat the foresaid humble <hi>Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> (I will not presume to say <hi>Advice,</hi> though it may be well calld so) to the Honorable House of Commons when They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assemble, That in their great Wisedoms they wold have a sense of the present condition in this particular of <hi>their King</hi> so mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously restord unto Us by a pure Act of the <hi>Omnipotent:</hi> And that wheras the Two Neighbouring <hi>Kings</hi> have of late yeers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hancd their Revenues and Incomes far higher then they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, They wold be pleasd to think it not only agreeable to the Rules of tru <hi>Policie,</hi> but most necessary for the <hi>Honor</hi> and safety of the whole Nation, to make the Monarck of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to correspond and bear up in a hansome proportion this way with either of Them, as He doth in all other things besides.</p>

                                 <q>We have read through the Writing which your illustrious and magnificent Persons sent us yesterday; and touching those heads which appertain to the power of your substituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the vigor of the Seal, we have resolvd not to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut further, confiding in the sincerity of the most serene the Lord Archduke, and acquiescing in the integrity of your il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious and magnificent Persons, which doth promise us a good faith in the business we are to agitat with the greatest candor and humanity that may be. And touching the Clause we demonstrated before, we desire it may be inserted as soon and as conveniently it may be, as your illustrious and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Persons have promised.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>

                                 <q>And wheras your illustrious and magnificent Persons assert, that it is unusuall and new what we proposd concerning the Prerogative and dignity of Precedence due always to the most serene Queen our Mistress, we cannot dissemble, but we much wonder that that shold seem new and unusal to men of your condition, learning and judgment, which is so well known, and most celebrous to all the world. For it is a most explored truth, That the Region of <hi>Spain</hi> distributed to divers Kingdoms, when it was devolvd to the hands of King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Isabella,</hi> wherunto the Kingdome of <hi>Granada</hi> was adjoyned, and the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> a Contention did arise more speciously then solid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rightly grounded, touching the dignity of Precedence with the King of <hi>England</hi> at that time, when <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth, who was a Spaniard born, held the Papacy, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the time of <hi>Iulius</hi> the second: and <hi>Volaterranus</hi> a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al good Author, and an <hi>Italian</hi> Historiographer, being not engagd to <hi>England</hi> for any privat benefit, and one that was well capable to know how matters passd, and were transacted, doth relate that betwixt the Ambassadors of <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Ambassador of <hi>Spain,</hi> a contention did arise about Precedence of session in the Church, and <hi>Iulius</hi> adjudgd the most honourable place to the English; which Right and Prerogative the Kings of <hi>England</hi> possessd until the time of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, who in regard of <hi>Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> Majesty, had the supreme place among all Princes. But he could not transmit that privilege to his posterity, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of other Princes: Therfore after his decease, that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of Precedence returnd to those terms whence it had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly digressd. Since therfore the Kings of <hi>England</hi> always held priority of place and session of those several Kings before their Kingdomes were reducd to one, a question being movd therabouts, they have retaind their Right by the Popes sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and never yeilded it upon occasion. Therfore without controversie we think that Right to appertain still to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> notwithstanding that the Territories and Dominions of the Kingdome of <hi>Spain</hi> be propagated and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified, which in the right estimation of things prevails not, or ought to prevail twixt Christian Princes touching this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; For then other Kings and Princes would assume a right of Precedence above others, to whom now they grant it, ever and anon, if their Dominions increase.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>Moreover, touching this present controversie about Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ther is another thing which doth not unworthily offer it self to be examined by your Judgements, which is, That one of Us which the most serene Queen our Mistress hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen her Ambassador to conclude this Treaty of Peace, is one
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59014:56"/>

               <p>The Spanish Ambassadors made an answer herunto, which we reserve for the third <hi>Section,</hi> wherin the Arguments of <hi>Spain</hi> for Precedence are set down, wherof one of the strongest he urgeth is the Multiplication and encrease of Dominions, which according to <hi>Besoldus</hi> and <hi>Cassaneus,</hi> with other great Civilian Jurists, is no Argument at all, in regard it doth not hold among ordinary Nobility. As for example: He of <hi>Arundel</hi> is first <hi>Earl</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> He of <hi>Angus</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> And He of <hi>Kildare</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the Laws of Heraldry and Hereditary Right: Put case that some other of their fellow Earls in either Kingdome shold grow richer, and have more Mannors, Possessions and Lordships, yet they will not offer to take place or precedence; so the Argument may hold <hi>A minori ad majus:</hi> For if it be so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Noble-men, much more shold this Rule have validity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Souvrain Princes.</p>
               <p>I will go on with a passage that happend in <hi>Paris</hi> a little above twenty years since. <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> residing at <hi>Paris</hi> in quality of Ambassador for the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> attempted to make his Coaches go before those of the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> pretending a right of Precedence, because the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> whom he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, was King of the ancient <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals, &amp;c.</hi> which was, under favor, but a feeble Argument, For ther were Kings

of <hi>Great Britain</hi> thousands of years before the <hi>Goths</hi> or <hi>Vandals</hi> were scarce known to the Christian world; nor do any stories make mention of them until a little after the <hi>declinings</hi> of the Roman Empire, about the year 350 from the Incarnation, nor came they to be <hi>Christians</hi> till a long time after; And it is the Position of <hi>Grotius</hi> himself in his Book <hi>de Iure Belli, Inter Reges qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Moreover, the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> entitles himself <hi>King of the Goths and Vandals</hi> as well. But my Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> carried himself so like himself, that our <hi>Swedish</hi> Ambassador was put behind with a <hi>Disgrace</hi> somewhat answerable to his <hi>Presumption,</hi> and to the explosion of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators.</p>

               <head>Of the first Argument, <hi>A Nobilitate Regni,</hi> from the Nobleness of the Kingdome.</head>
               <p>THer is a speech drawing neer to the nature of a <hi>Proverb, Great Britain</hi> for an <hi>Iland, France</hi> for a <hi>Kingdome, Milan</hi> for a <hi>Duchy,</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> for a <hi>County</hi> or Earldome, are preferrable before all other; They are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in their kind: this shews the supereminence of the Kingdome of <hi>France.</hi> Ther is also a signal saying of the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the first, who being in some <hi>Critical</hi> Discourses with his Lords about the Dominions of <hi>Europe,</hi> broke out into this high Encomium of <hi>France, That if it could stand with the Order of Nature and the Plesure of the</hi> Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>that any mortal Man were capable to be a</hi> God <hi>of the Elementary world, and that I were He, I would so make my last Will and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the disposing of my Estate, That my eldest Son shold be</hi> God <hi>after me, but my second shold be King of</hi> France. This saying or excess of speech must be interpreted with a sane sense, for the Emperour meant nothing els hereby but to intimate his opinion touching that potent and noble Kingdom: which Kingdom hath continued an Heredetary successive <hi>Monarchy</hi> neer upon twelve hundred yeers by <hi>three</hi> Races of Kings, wherof <hi>Lewis</hi> the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth now regnant is the sixty fifth Monark.</p>
               <p>Now, whosoever will behold that noble Kingdome, will finde that no other stands so commodious and strong by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of <hi>Nature</hi> her self. It is situated in the centre of <hi>Europe,</hi> having <hi>Westward</hi> the Island of <hi>Great Britain; Eastward, Italy</hi> and <hi>Swisserland,</hi> with other Regions; it hath <hi>Southward</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Spain;</hi> and <hi>Northward</hi> the great Continent of <hi>Germany</hi> high and low: And it is notably fenced against all these by a special Providence; Against the <hi>First,</hi> it hath a huge Salt Ditch, the <hi>Sea</hi> it self; against the <hi>Second</hi> it hath the stupendious <hi>Alpian</hi> Hills; against the <hi>Third</hi> it hath the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains cast up as Trenches by Nature her self for the defence of <hi>France;</hi> against the <hi>Fourth</hi> she hath strong fortified Towns, Castles and Rivers: The <hi>Ocean</hi> on the one side, and the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> on the other do wash her Skirts, and mightily invite <hi>Trade.</hi> And that which adds also much to the advantage of her situation, is, that she lieth accessible and open to all Mankind for Commerce and Negotiation by Sea and Land. Moreover, being seated so
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59014:59"/>
in the midst, she is fittest to be <hi>Arbitratrix,</hi> and to give <hi>Law</hi> to the rest of <hi>Christendome,</hi> as being properly seated to divide or unite, to admit or hinder the Forces of <hi>Europe.</hi> She stands also in an advantagious posture to <hi>reach</hi> her hand to her Frends in point of Auxiliary Assistance, or <hi>heave</hi> her hand against the Enemy. She hath divers Provinces, the <hi>Governors</hi> wherof are equal to <hi>Viceroys:</hi> And for her <hi>Nobles,</hi> they are without number; for she can horse about 50000 Gentlemen for the Wars. Adde herunto that she hath a mighty advantage to be of a <hi>round</hi> Orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular shape, which makes all parts lie neerer for the assisting each other in case of necessity.</p>
               <p>Ther is one other quality that makes for the Nobleness of <hi>France,</hi> which is, though he be <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Tartar, Moore</hi> or <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> or of any Nation, if he be in quality of a <hi>Captif</hi> or <hi>Slave,</hi> as soon as he treads upon <hi>French</hi> ground he is <hi>eo instante</hi> frank and <hi>free,</hi> and as it were manumitted of the tie of slavery: for as <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> hath it, it is a Principle in <hi>France, Servi peregrini ut primum Galliae fines penetraverint liberi sunto;</hi> Let stranger-slaves as soon as they come within the borders of <hi>France</hi> be <hi>free.</hi> Among other, let this example serve: A Merchant came to <hi>Tholouse</hi> and brought with him a <hi>Slave</hi> whom he had bought in <hi>Spain;</hi> The <hi>Slave</hi> being told of the Laws and Privileges of <hi>France,</hi> came and told his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Sir, I have had relation to you hitherto as a <hi>Slave</hi> and <hi>Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> but now by the Laws of this Noble Country I am a <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> yet I am contented to serve you still, but as a Free Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. The like happend at the Siege of <hi>Mets,</hi> where a <hi>Slave</hi> had played the Fugitive, and ran away with his Master <hi>Don Luysd' Avila</hi>'s horse; <hi>Don Luys</hi> sent a Trumpeter to the Duke of <hi>Guyse</hi> for his Man and his Horse; The Duke understanding that his Horse was sold, causd the Money to be sent the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but for the <hi>Man</hi> he sent him word, That he was upon <hi>French</hi> ground, therfore was <hi>Free</hi> by the custome of the Country.</p>
               <p>In fine, <hi>France</hi> is so Noble a Region, that as the <hi>Sun</hi> shines among the Stars in the <hi>Firmament,</hi> so <hi>France</hi> shines among the rest of <hi>Kingdomes.</hi>

               <head>The second Argument, <hi>A Nobilitate Regionis,</hi> from the Nobleness of the Country.</head>
               <p>VVE proceed now from the Nobleness of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> to the Fertility and Riches of the <hi>Country</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> as also to the temperature and healthfulness of the Clime or <hi>Climes</hi> thereof; for <hi>France</hi> participats of the nature of divers Climes: <hi>Normandy,</hi> specially <hi>la Basse Normandy,</hi> partakes of the Clime of her next Transmarin Neighbour <hi>Great Britain: Picardy</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:59014:60"/>
and <hi>Champagne</hi> of that of <hi>Germany; Provence</hi> and the Countries towards the <hi>Alps,</hi> partakes of the Climat of <hi>Italy; Aquitania</hi> and <hi>Languedoc</hi> being walld Southward by the Pyrenean Hills, have much of the Climat of <hi>Spain;</hi> And the <hi>Ile</hi> of <hi>France</hi> wherin <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> is built, and the Country therabouts, hath a particular Clime of its own. These varieties of Climes make the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try the more fruitful for universality of Wealth and Plenty. Nor is <hi>France</hi> onely a fat Country and full of marrow, but she hath as much Delightfulness as Fecundity, as much real Plesure as outward Bewty: Ther is no Soyl under the Sun where ther is more <hi>Agriculture</hi> for <hi>Bread,</hi> which is the staff of Mans Life; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that she may be calld the <hi>Granary of Ceres,</hi> and she may be calld as well one of <hi>Bacchus</hi> his chief <hi>Cellars,</hi> for a world of <hi>Vineyards</hi> wherwith the Country is coverd, with innumerable sorts of fruits; insomuch that the character which <hi>Salvianus</hi> gives of <hi>Aquitania</hi> may extend to the whole Country, when he elegantly saith, <hi>Illic omnis admodum Regio aut intertexta est Vine is, aut florulenta pratis, aut irrigata fontibus, aut interfusa fluminibus, aut distincta culturis, aut consita pomis, aut amoenata lucis, aut cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita messibus, ut verè possessores Illius Terrae non tam soli istius portio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem quàm Paradisi imaginem possidere videantur:</hi> There evry place is either interwoven with Vines, or flowrd with Medows, or set with Orchards, or meerd by Corn-fields, or peepled with Trees and Woods, or refreshd with Fountains, or enchanell'd with Rivers, or periwiggd with all sorts of Grain; Insomuch that the Inhabitants may be said to possess a part of Paradise ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a portion of the common earth.</p>
               <p>Now, among all these, the four Staple Commodities of <hi>France</hi> may be said to be <hi>Corn, Wine, Hemp</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> which <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi> calls the four <hi>Loadstones</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> For as the <hi>Loadstone</hi> (wherof the <hi>Blew Ethiopian</hi> is the best) hath an attractive Virtue to draw unto them Iron and Steel in a mysterious manner, so the foresaid four Commodities have a Magnetical Virtue to draw into <hi>France</hi> the Gold and Silver of all Nations. Concerning the <hi>French Corn,</hi> it is reputed the best of all other; <hi>Pliny,</hi> one of Natures principal <hi>Secretaries,</hi> hath left upon record that the Gallic Corn is <hi>nitidissimi grani, &amp; plus panis reddere quàm far aliud,</hi> It is of a neat grain, and yeelds more bread then other wheat. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> and others might starve were they not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staind by French Corn, yet she vents but her superfluities, and transmutes them to <hi>Indian Gold:</hi> for such is the scarcity of <hi>Spain,</hi> that having not bread enough of her own for the hundredth Child she produceth, whosoever brings thither a Carga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon of Corn, may make his return for it in Gold or Silver, and carry it openly in the palm of his hand without fear of sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:59014:60"/>Touching the French Wines, it may be said they need no Bush: what vast proportions are carried away by all the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west Nations? <hi>Bodin</hi> speaks of one Merchant in <hi>Cambray</hi> which bought at one Vintage 33000 Barrels; and tis worth the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation what a world of variety of Wines grow up and down, for one can scarce go twenty miles but ther is still a differing sort of Grape: In some places in <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Champagne</hi> ther are Wine-vessels as big as some houses in height, not inferior to those vast Vessels of <hi>Heidelberg, Tubinga,</hi> and <hi>Groninghen,</hi> (as the ingenious <hi>Lansius</hi> hath it.)</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax,</hi> the third Staple Commodity of <hi>France,</hi> what mighty rich <hi>Procedes</hi> come thereof! For though it be a despicable Vegetal in sight, and unsavory in the handling, yet it is of such virtue that it can remove <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars, <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> the East and West <hi>Indies</hi> into <hi>England;</hi> a Vegetal that can controul <hi>Eolus,</hi> and overmaster <hi>Neptune</hi> himself, I mean the impetuous Whirlwinds of the one, and the tumbling Waves of the other. Now, where doth this most useful Commodity grow more plentiful then in <hi>France?</hi> Nor doth she hereby fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish her Neighbors far and neer only with Sayls for their ships, but with shirts for their backs, sheets for their beds, and napery for their tables.</p>
               <p>Touching the last great <hi>Staple Commodity</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> which is <hi>Salt;</hi> tis so savoury in the Kings Coffers, that he draws twenty Millions of Livres evry year from the <hi>Gabel</hi> of it: besides that incredible proportion which is spent in <hi>France</hi> it self, what Millions of Mesures are laden out for other Countries! <hi>Spain</hi> also hath this Commodity to a superfluity, but her <hi>Salt</hi> is more corroding and acrimonious then the <hi>French;</hi> Therfore when the <hi>Emperour Charles</hi> the fifth (as <hi>Lansius</hi> relates) had put out a Placart prohibiting that no <hi>French Salt</hi> shold be brought into the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the Country was like to mutiny for that <hi>tart</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, because the <hi>Spanish Salt</hi> which was permitted only to be imported, was not so sweet and vigorous as the <hi>French;</hi> spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as that of <hi>Rochel,</hi> wherwith if Flesh be salted, and a Ship victualld with it to the furthest part of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> it will eat as sweet at the return of the Ship as it did at first, as tis found by the frequent experience of our Navigators.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Air and Clime of <hi>France,</hi> it is the most cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and temperat of any other under the Canopy of Heven, which makes the inhabitants therof so spritful and debonnaire: Tis rare to find a French-Woman <hi>melancholy,</hi> which was the ground of the Proverb, To make a compleat Wife, let her be <hi>English</hi> to the Neck; From the Navil to the Knee <hi>Dutch;</hi> From the Knee downward <hi>Spanish;</hi> But from the Neck to the Navil <hi>French,</hi> which relates to the <hi>Heart,</hi> and to the <hi>merry</hi> disposition
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59014:61"/>
therof. Nor are the French-women spriteful and merry most of any, but they are also wise and judicious: for <hi>Cassanaeus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in his <hi>Catalogo Gloriae Mundi,</hi> that in the famous old League which was struck twixt <hi>Hannibal</hi> and the <hi>Gaules,</hi> it was capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated that if any <hi>Gaule</hi> was wrongd by a <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> a <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> Magistrat shold be his Judge; but if any <hi>Carthaginian</hi> shold be wrong'd by a <hi>Gaule, Gallic Women</hi> shold be Judges therof.</p>

               <head>The third Argument, <hi>A Nobilitate Regiminis,</hi> from the Nobleness of Goverment.</head>
               <p>THe form of Goverment in the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Civil,</hi> partly <hi>Polemical;</hi> It is a mixt Goverment between Peace and War, composd of <hi>Military</hi> Discipline as well as of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> Justice, in regard that <hi>France</hi> having so many open Frontires and powerful Neighbours by Land, they cannot as other Countries joyn <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> together.</p>
               <p>Touching their Martial Goverment tis very exact, ther are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Regiments of Horse and Foot in perpetual pay, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolld, and always ready for any occasion of Service. Moreover, in all the Provinces and places of strength, ther are Governors and Garisons dispersd up and down, which is very advantagious for the preferment of the <hi>Gentry.</hi> Now, the Governors are so cautiously disposd of by the King, that not any of them hath means to betray or deliver up a Province into the Enemies hands, the commands therof being so divided: For though the <hi>Governor</hi> commands the Country in general, and commonly the chief Town, yet ther is a <hi>Lieutenant</hi> that holds also by Patent immediatly from the King, and not from the Governor, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these two ther are some emulations and umbrages ever and anon. Then most part of their Towns, Castles and Fortresses have particular Governors not subordinat to the Governor of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59014:61"/>
the Province, but deriving their power expresly from the King; so that in many places the <hi>Town</hi> hath one Governor, and the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> another; Indeed the Country of <hi>Provence</hi> only was usd to have a Privilege, that Her Governor held it without a Lieutenant.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Noblesse</hi> or Gentry in <hi>France</hi> are the sole body which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipat in some fort with the Prerogatives of the Crown; for from it they receave Privileges above other men, and a kind of limited Regality upon their Tenants, besides real Supplies to their Estates by divers Employments, Pensions, and exemption from Tallies upon their own Demeans and Lands as long as they manure them by their own servants: but what Lands they let out to Tenants is presently Talliable, which causeth propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable abatements in the Rent; and in compensation for this, They onely owe the King the service of the <hi>Ban</hi> and <hi>Arriereban,</hi> which is to serve him or his General three months within the Land at their own cost. Now as in time of War the <hi>Noblesse</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo most part of the danger, so is their power then more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory above the rest of their fellow-subjects; wheras in time of Peace the King is ready to countenance inferiour persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and is contented to see them wast one another by contention in Law, or otherwise, for fear they grow too rich, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a principle of State in <hi>France,</hi> That as the <hi>Noblesse</hi> use to do him the best service, so, <hi>They</hi> only misapplyed can do him most harm. Now, the ancient French Gentry was much diminished in the Croisades, or Wars of the Holy Land, because that to enable them for the service, divers of them did hipotheque or morgage their Fiefs and Lands to the Church, which are not redeemd to this day: Insomuch that it is thought by sundry Computations which have bin made, that the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church possesseth the third part of the fattest <hi>Fiefs</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> Now, upon the foresaid diminution, the French Gentry have been repaird and made up since from time to time of Advocats, Financiers, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, wherof a great many by the Kings favor are daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled.</p>
               <p>Such a gallant Goverment <hi>France</hi> hath for the common Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumity and publik defence of the Country, and for the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Gentry who are more numerous there then in any Kingdome els; wherby the tru Rules of Policy are observd that shold be in a Monarchy, which are For the <hi>King</hi> to command, The <hi>Nobles</hi> to <hi>execut,</hi> and The <hi>Peeple</hi> to <hi>obey;</hi> and indeed the Peeple shold know nothing els but how to obey.</p>
               <p>Now, one of the prime Principles in <hi>France</hi> is to keep the common Peeple under a perfect subjection, so that they may not be able to do any hurt. And if they are kept poor hereby, let them thank themselfs; for if they were pamperd with wealth, They wold be ever and anon kicking at Goverment: for we
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59014:62"/>
know ther is not a more instable hair-braind Monster in the world then the Common Peeple, as <hi>England</hi> of late yeers hath had such woful experience.</p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Civil</hi> Goverment of <hi>France,</hi> and administration of Justice, it is of that high esteem that divers Forren Princes have referrd their Causes to be determind to the Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement in <hi>Paris,</hi> as a Consistory of high Reason and Integrity. It stands upon record how the Emperour <hi>Frederik</hi> the second re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrd the controversies betwixt him and Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth touching the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> to the decision of this Court, <hi>En dernier ressort,</hi> to pass a Definitif unappealable Judgement. The Count <hi>Namurs</hi> in a Difference twixt him and <hi>Charles de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois,</hi> did cast himself upon the verdict of this Court: <hi>Philip</hi> Prince of <hi>Tarentum</hi> overcame the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> in this Court touching the Expences he was at in recovering the <hi>Greek Empire:</hi> The Dukes of <hi>Lorain</hi> have in divers things stood to the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Justice of this Court: They of <hi>Cambray</hi> when they were a Free Peeple have, been willing to be tryed by this Court: The Confederacy also of the Kingdome of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> was confirmd by this Court. Now, the reason why this Court gains such a high Repute, is, That none are admitted to sit in that Tribunal but persons of known Integrity, Erudition and Gallantry; which made <hi>Henry</hi> the second, as <hi>Lansius</hi> hath it, when by the importunity of a great Princess he had recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one to sit there, and being a person but of shallow parts, and so rejected, the King said merrily, <hi>Ie pensois que parmy tant de Ginets un As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e pourroit bien passer;</hi> I thought that among so many Ginets one Ass might have passd well enough.</p>
               <p>Besides <hi>this</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> ther are divers other Courts of <hi>Parlement</hi> (and <hi>Praesidial Seats</hi>) dispersd up and down the Country in such a convenient distance, that the Client may not be put to make long Journies for Justice, and that the Poor be not oppressd by the Rich for want of means to make such long Journies wherby they suffer the suit to fall, as many use to do in <hi>England</hi> in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest places from <hi>London</hi> for want of such Courts.</p>
               <p>I will conclude also this third Argument with some choice Verses of <hi>Ludovicus Bologninus</hi> a celebrated <hi>Civilian:</hi>

               <head>The fourth Argument, <hi>A Religione, &amp; Nobilitate Ecclesiae,</hi> from Religion, and Nobleness of the Church.</head>
               <p>SOme Authors affirm, that when our <hi>Saviour</hi> sufferd upon the Cross, He lookd towards <hi>France;</hi> whence they infer, that it was a blessed Omen that <hi>Christian</hi> Religion shold florish most in that Kingdome. Moreover, it is a rare, and indeed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallelld thing, that ther was in <hi>France</hi> before the passion of our <hi>Saviour</hi> a Church, <hi>viz. Ecclesia Carnotensis,</hi> as it remains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good record, which was dedicated <hi>Virgini Pariturae,</hi> to the Virgin that shold bear; as we read ther was in <hi>Greece</hi> an Altar erected <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>To the unknown God.</hi> This made the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who had felt the pulse of that peeple more then any other, to give this <hi>Encomium</hi> of them in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, <hi>Natura est omnium Gallorum admodum dedita Religioni,</hi> Tis the nature of all the Gauls to be much addicted to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>As in the dark times of <hi>Paganism</hi> they were observd to be so devout, so since the glorious Light of Christianity did shine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Flower de Luces,</hi> the French Nation hath bin found to be transported with an extraordinary zeal to Religion. And this Heavenly Light began to shine and shoot its Rays betimes: for we read that <hi>Iraeneus</hi> one of the first Primitive Fathers was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Lions,</hi> and he was Disciple to <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> and <hi>Polycarpus</hi> was Disciple to St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist, by whom he was sent from <hi>Asia</hi> among the <hi>Gaules</hi> for the plantation and propagation of Christian Faith, as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> relates. St. <hi>Hilarius</hi> who was another Father of the Primitive Church, was also Bishop of the <hi>Picts</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where he composd his excellent Works which are partly <hi>Expository,</hi> partly <hi>Controversial,</hi> though ther occur often some African barbarous Latin words in them, as <hi>disfrocite</hi> for degenerate, <hi>Zabulus</hi> for diabolus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a multitude of Hevenly Martyrs hath <hi>France</hi> had! for in all the ten Persecutions ther were some of them signd still their <hi>Faith</hi> with their bloud. In the Emperour <hi>Valerians</hi> time ther were famons <hi>French</hi> Martyrs, as <hi>Florentius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vienna, Pontius Cassius Victorinus, Liminius, Anatolianus,</hi> with others whom <hi>Gregory Turonensis</hi> mentions, and whose names are enrolld in the Catalog of Saints to all posterity. And this was a little before the unluckly <hi>Novatian</hi> Heresie crept into <hi>France,</hi> and infected di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Countries.</p>
               <p>Nay, to go higher up, and to the very source of Christianity, ther are some Authors who avouch that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was in <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:59014:63"/>
and that the chief Church in <hi>Vienna</hi> was built by him, as this ancient Verse there engraven shews:</p>
               <q>Paulus praeco Crucis tibi dat primordia Lucis.</q>
               <p>Ther be other Authors who affirm that St. <hi>Peter</hi> also was in <hi>France;</hi> And that ther landed at one time in <hi>Marseilles Lazarus, Mary Magdalen, Martha</hi> and <hi>Marcella,</hi> as it is recorded in a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of the English History in the <hi>Vatican</hi> wherof <hi>Baronius</hi> makes mention; And about that time <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> that Noble Decurion, passd through <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Britain</hi> with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Marcella,</hi> who was <hi>she</hi> that is mentiond in the Gospel, who being divinely inspird, cryed out with a loud voice when <hi>Christ</hi> was preaching, <hi>Happy is the womb that brought Thee forth, and the paps that gave Thee suck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spencaeus</hi> also makes mention that St. <hi>Luke</hi> was in <hi>France;</hi> As also <hi>Savinianus</hi> one of the 72 Disciples, and <hi>Martialis</hi> another of them, who some do affirm to be He who sold the five Barly Loaves and the two Fishes wherwith our Saviour fed five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</p>
               <p>And if the Holy Reliques of blessed Saints may adde to the Nobleness of a Country, the Churches of <hi>France</hi> are full of them; <hi>Reperies in Francia</hi> (as <hi>Cassanaeus</hi> relates) <hi>omnes Christi Exuvias, quippe praeputium, Inconsutilem togam, Spineum diadema, Crucem, Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vos, Spongiam, Lanciae cuspidem, &amp; cum qua sepultus est sindonem.</hi> You will find in <hi>France</hi> all the <hi>Exuvias</hi> or Spoiles of Christ, his <hi>praeputium,</hi> his seamless coat, his Cross, the Nayls, the Sponge, the point of the Spear, and the Winding-sheet wherin he was buried. <hi>Cassanaeus</hi> goes further, and says, that in <hi>Burgundy</hi> the body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> is buried, as also <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> ashes are kept in a noble Chest, and likewise those of <hi>Martha, Martialis,</hi> and of the three <hi>Maries.</hi> Adde herunto the most precious head of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and the <hi>finger</hi> wherwith he pointed at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculat Lamb of God. The eleven thousand Virgins are yet kept in <hi>France;</hi> And likewise the reliques of St. <hi>Denis, Martin, Cosma, Damianus, Sebastian,</hi> with other Christian Hero's are to be found in <hi>France;</hi> As <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Edmundus,</hi> whose bodies, bones and flesh are to be seen to this day, and are frequently visited by Pilgrims. Ther are also to be seen the three <hi>Twins,</hi> St. <hi>Geneveva,</hi> St. <hi>German,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> with sundry others. I must not omit the Body of St. <hi>Quintinus</hi> a great Martyr, who hath a Town of his name to this day, which formerly was calld <hi>Samarobrina</hi> from the River <hi>Samoria;</hi> which Martyr after many persecutions and punishments under <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximinianus</hi> was at last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed; his body and head were thrown into the River <hi>Samoria,</hi> where it lay many years, until a Roman Matron calld <hi>Eusebia</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:59014:63"/>
being warnd by an Angel came to search for the body, which being found, it immediatly cur'd her sore eyes; and so she put the body and head under ground, wheron since a mighty San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary was erected bearing his name, and calld St. <hi>Quintin:</hi> 300 years after, in the raign of King <hi>Dagobert,</hi> his body was taken out of the earth and put in a gold Chest, where it remains to this day, and wherunto a great confluence of Pilgrims do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently resort by reason of the great miracles that he hath wrought in point of health to many thousands; all which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars <hi>Cassanaeus</hi> relates.</p>
               <p>Touching the Nobleness of the <hi>French</hi> Fabriques erected and consecrated for the worship and service of God Almighty, as <hi>Basilicas,</hi> Temples, Churches, Sanctuaries, and other <hi>Domes</hi> of Devotion, the whole earth hath not fairer or more magnificent; as also Priories, Abbeys, Convents, Monasteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What a glorious and indeed admired structure is the great <hi>Carthusian</hi> Monastery in <hi>Provence!</hi> It may be calld a little <hi>Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> of it self, and hath Revenues able to bear up the port of a Souvrain Prince.</p>
               <p>Now ther is no Church upon the surface of the Terrestrial Globe that is comparable to the <hi>French</hi> in Revenues and Riches; for the last computation which was made, the Revenues of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Clergie amounted to above three hundred and twenty millions of <hi>Livres;</hi> a stupendous sum! And indeed <hi>They</hi> need have so much; for besides such a world of Abbots, Priors, Monks, Priests, and other Ecclesiastical Dignitaries, ther are in <hi>France</hi> 15 <hi>Archbishops,</hi> and 150 <hi>Suffragan</hi> Bishops; and such is the honor which is born there to the <hi>Mitre,</hi> that they are all <hi>Privy-Counsellors</hi> by their Dignity, and by the Laws of <hi>France,</hi> though few do come to the said Council unless they have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of the Kings plesure by particular Letter.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="argument">
               <head>The fifth Argument, <hi>A Nobilitate Subditorem,</hi> from the Nobleness of Subjects.</head>
               <p>IN the third Argument going before, ther were some touches of the French <hi>Noblesse</hi> and Gentry, how numerous they are, and the many ways of Preferment the King hath for <hi>Cadets</hi> or younger Brothers, wheras the <hi>elder</hi> use to have great Estates of their own; For indeed some of them have mighty Fortunes by Patrimonial Inheritance. The last Duke of <hi>Guyse</hi> kept a House like a Souvrain Prince; he had above two hundred Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen waited on him as menial servants, and having Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stik dependency, unto whom he gave such a liberal allowance and long Leases out of his estate, that they might live like Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59014:64"/>
which made one tell the Duke that he had turnd all his <hi>Estate</hi> to <hi>Obligations;</hi> meaning that he had obligd so many unto him by his munificence and bounty.</p>
               <p>Yet ther are three sorts of Subjects that live but poorly in <hi>France,</hi> which are the <hi>Roturier,</hi> the <hi>Vigneron,</hi> and the <hi>Peasan.</hi> But they who dwell in Towns, and have any Profession or Trade, live well enough: But the main wealth of the Country is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentry or Noblesse, who live plentifully and well.</p>
               <p>Among divers others, ther is one singular quality in the <hi>French</hi> Gentry, that they are extraordinarily affected to their King, and they are pleasd in nothing more then to have access, and see him. Ther is a world of examples how close they have stuck to him in the Wars when his person was in hazard, and rescued him though danger and death were inevitable in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For Horsmanship and Chivalry they surpass all other; and indeed ther is none that becomes a Horse so well, and hath a more comely seat on his back then a French-man.</p>
               <p>Adde herunto that the French Noblesse are naturally <hi>Valiant,</hi> quick and hardy, not onely in the Wars, and publick Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but in privat Feuds, ther being more Duels fought there then in all <hi>Christendome</hi> besides. Nor is ther any Nation more covetous of <hi>Honor,</hi> or more careful and tender to conserve it when they have it.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this Argument in brief with the opinion of a famous Poet, who sings thus of them:</p>

               <p>Besides the Real <hi>Demeans</hi> of the Crown, the King hath to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Greatness, 2. <hi>La Taille;</hi> 3. <hi>Le Taillon;</hi> 4. <hi>Les Aydes;</hi> 5. <hi>Les Equivalents;</hi> 6. <hi>Les Equipollents;</hi> 7. <hi>Les Crues, ou Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations;</hi> 8. <hi>L'Octroy, ou Benevolence;</hi> 9. <hi>La Gabelle;</hi> 10. <hi>Les Imposts;</hi> 11.

The <hi>Tenths</hi> besides. All these Impositions are as old as <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, who, wheras before most of them were laid and levied upon extraordinary occasions, he found a way to make them perpetual. And if those fourteen <hi>Strings</hi> touchd before will not serve his turn, he hath power to make more for his <hi>Bow</hi> when he pleaseth; and herein the King of <hi>France</hi> hath the advantage of his two Neighbouring Kings: This is that indeed which makes him so potent; Hereby he can lade an Asse with Gold when he will to break in through any Wall though otherwise never so inexpugnable. It is a <hi>full</hi> Purse that makes a King both feard at home, and formidable abroad; wheras the contrary makes him but a kind of Scar-crow King, as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> tells us in his Proverb, <hi>Don sin dinero no es Don, si no Donayre.</hi>

               <head>The seventh Argument, <hi>A Potentiâ Regni,</hi> from the Strength of the Kingdome.</head>
               <p>THer is not such an intrinsique united Power, such a knot of Strength any where as <hi>France</hi> is: Ther are in <hi>France</hi> thirty thousand Parishes, so that taking but ten men out of one Parish with another, an Army may be composd of two hundred and fifty thousand Combatants; besides the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> that huge <hi>Mass</hi> and <hi>Miscelany</hi> of all Nations, which may furnish well-neer as many more: And it may be said that <hi>France</hi> was never so powerful since the time of <hi>Charlemain</hi> as now she is, nor so <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,</hi> and that for many reasons. First, in regard that the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots,</hi> or they of the Protestant Religion, are reduced to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act subjection, who indeed were the greatest weakness of <hi>France</hi> before; for oftentimes they servd as <hi>Dark Lanterns</hi> to other Princes both abroad as well as at home, to put <hi>Combustions</hi> in <hi>France</hi> at plesure. They might be calld <hi>Regnum in Regno,</hi> having such a considerable strength as above 200 Towns, in many wherof they kept Garisons, for the maintenance wherof the King himself was to contribut by <hi>Article.</hi> Two of these Towns commanded the great River of <hi>Loire,</hi> and others were neer the Sea, so consequently fit to receave Forren assistance, as <hi>Rochel,</hi> the taking wherof did much startle <hi>Spain,</hi> who had she foreknown that <hi>England</hi> could not have done it, she wold have sent assistance her self: which made Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> to raunt that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Rochel en depit de Trois Roys,</hi> in despite of three Kings, <hi>viz.</hi> the King of <hi>England,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the King of <hi>France</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who was a great while averse to that business. But now all those Towns of caution and safety the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had, are dismantled; besides, they have no <hi>Garison</hi> any where, so that they are to relie for the future soly upon the Kings savor, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are brought to a perfect pass of obedience; which great Five Kings of <hi>France</hi> before the <hi>last</hi> endevoured to do, but could never effect it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>France</hi> is far more powerful because of the three <hi>Keys</hi> which <hi>Richelieu</hi> said he had got, <hi>viz. Brisac</hi> to enter <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Pignorol</hi> to enter <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Perpignan</hi> to enter <hi>Spain</hi> at ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, having therby besides added to <hi>France</hi> the whole County of <hi>Roussillon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:59014:65"/>Thirdly, because he hath got in a manner all <hi>Lorain,</hi> which was formerly a Countermure twixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> being engagd by homage to the <hi>Empire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, he hath got the Garison of <hi>Strange</hi> Soldiers which were in <hi>Orenge</hi> to be dismissd, and the Castle as good as disman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled; which lying within the bowels of one of his own Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, might be said to be another weakness to <hi>France.</hi> He hath also got the <hi>Italian</hi> Garison in <hi>Avignon</hi> to be casheerd, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was another inconvenience to <hi>France</hi> lying within her Verge, and hath made himself Master of the place, though it was part of St. <hi>Peters</hi> possession above 300 years.</p>
               <p>Lastly, he hath <hi>Graveling</hi> with <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and other Towns in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> All which considered, it may be said that the power of the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> is much more improvd then it was formerly in many hundred years.</p>

               <head>The eighth Argument, <hi>Ab Opulentia &amp; Fertilitate,</hi> from Wealth and Fertility.</head>
               <p>IN one of the former Arguments we spake of the four Staple Commodities of <hi>France, viz. Corn, Salt, Hemp</hi> and <hi>Wines;</hi> To these may be added <hi>Silks, Oyls, Woollen Stuffs,</hi> and <hi>Saffron;</hi> All manner of delicat fruits, as <hi>Orenges, Lemons, Cytrons:</hi> The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Flora</hi> also hath one of her choicest houses of plesure there, as well as <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> ther being such abundance of choice fragrant flowers to be found in evry Garden; As likewise all sorts of Edible Roots and Salade-Herbs. <hi>Pomona</hi> also may be said to have her best Orchard there, for the excellentst <hi>Cyder</hi> is made in <hi>Low Normandy;</hi> and those who are habituated to drink it, are observd to have cleerer Complexions then others who have only <hi>Wine</hi> for their drink. Ther are not more delightful Medows and Fields on the surface of the earth, such huge herds of Cattle, and variety of Stuffs and Cloth made, which makes <hi>Le. Drap de Berry</hi> in such high request; with the most curious rich Sattins and Velvets of <hi>Tours.</hi> Ther is not such a <hi>Beau-die,</hi> such a Scarlet Die in any Country. What thick swarms of Bees, and delicat Hony is found in every Peasans Garden? What delightful Woods and Lawns, Chaces and vast Forests, with whole Hosts of huge headed Deer, (and other Beasts for <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>) range up and down! Such <hi>Forests</hi> that the <hi>Sylvan Gods</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs are seen sometimes to hunt in them: As ther is a rare Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage recorded by the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rhodes</hi> in his late Annals of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, that at a great appointment of Hunting one day in <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> as the King was in the heat of his chace, ther was another cry of Hounds and Horns heard, which afterward co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neer, a black man plainly appeerd to all, who cryed out
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59014:66"/>
three times, <hi>Amendez vous, Amendez vous, Amendez vous;</hi> and so he and his Hounds vanished: The Wood-men and Officers of the Forest being questiond about it, they answerd, That that black man was often seen to hunt there with his Dogs, and wold suddenly disappeer, but he never usd to do hurt to any body: And surely this could not be the Devil, as some poor shallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braind <hi>Authors</hi> do assert <hi>all Spirits of the Air</hi> to be. Go to the Bowels of <hi>France,</hi> and she is full of Mines, and Marble in many places, with great plenty of <hi>Iron,</hi> (the best and worst thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to humane use.) Look upwards towards <hi>Heven,</hi> and you shall see the <hi>Air</hi> throngd with <hi>Volatils</hi> of all sorts. Nor is ther any Country on earth so conveniently <hi>waterd</hi> as well with Sources and <hi>Sanative</hi> waters, as with great <hi>Navigable</hi> Rivers; which makes evry part of the Country communicable one to the other in point of mutual commerce, for all the great Towns are situated upon some <hi>Boat-bearing</hi> Rivers: And besides, they are so delightful, that some of them are said to be <hi>embroderd with Swans, borderd with Crevices, and pavd with Troutes,</hi> with all sorts of delicat Fish: Insomuch that ther is nothing which Air, Earth or Water can affoord as well for Voluptuousness and Lux<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>IT is recorded in good Story, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great Founder of the third <hi>Monarchy, viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the <hi>Greek,</hi> hearing much of the Fortitude of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and it seems having read of the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits performd both in <hi>Italy,</hi> by ransacking <hi>Rome,</hi> as also in <hi>Greece</hi> her self, under the conduct of <hi>Brennus</hi> that valiant <hi>Britain,</hi> the <hi>Cadet</hi> of <hi>Mulmutius Donwallo</hi> the famous <hi>Legislator,</hi> and first King that wore a Crown of Gold in <hi>Great Britain</hi> many hundred years before the <hi>Romanes</hi> entred: I say, that <hi>Alexander</hi> hearing so much, and reading of the Martial Achievments of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> (now <hi>French</hi>) sent to know of Them, <hi>What they feard most?</hi> They answerd, <hi>Ne Coelum rueret,</hi> Lest the Heven shold fall: A mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous answer! And the <hi>French</hi> Nation must by natural inclination be magnanimous and Martial, because the Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers who are so conversant with Hevenly Bodies, and their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual power in relation to <hi>Earth,</hi> affirm, that the Planet <hi>Mars</hi> is the Ascendent of <hi>France,</hi> and hath a peculiar influence upon that Nation more then upon any other. To pretermit for brevities sake many other <hi>victorious Kings</hi> who had raignd formerly, what a triumphant <hi>Hero</hi> was <hi>Charlemain!</hi> He vanquishd the <hi>Saracens</hi> in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> He freed <hi>Spain</hi> from them; He was a mighty Champion of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of the Roman Church: For He restord two Popes, <hi>viz. Adrian</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> the one being <hi>besiegd,</hi> the other <hi>banishd,</hi> and living in exile. This was the Prince who repaird the Western <hi>Empire</hi> being almost mouldred into dust, and raysd it to as high a pitch of sublimity as ever it was, by congregating the scatterd Dominions therof: This was He who overthrew the Tyranny of the <hi>Longobards</hi> which his Father <hi>Pepin</hi> had begun, and quite freed <hi>Italy</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> where they had lived and <hi>lorded</hi> above two hundred yeers. He subdued the Empire of the <hi>Huns,</hi> securd <hi>England,</hi> tam'd <hi>Bavaria,</hi> subjugated <hi>Spain,</hi> and possessd <hi>Italy.</hi> He drive the <hi>Moors</hi> out of <hi>Corsica,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> out of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> the <hi>Saracens</hi> from the <hi>Baleares Insulae Malliorca,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:59014:67"/>This is He whom all the <hi>Oriental</hi> Princes admird, (as well as the <hi>West</hi>) receaving their Ambassadors laden with rich presents, and desiring a frendship and confederacy with him. This is He who was the founder of the <hi>University</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> being very learned himself by the Instructions he receavd from <hi>Alcuin</hi> that famous <hi>English-man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was that pious Prince who confirmd the Donation which <hi>Constantin</hi> the great his predecessor made unto the Holy Father the Vicar of Christ of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and conferd also upon Him the <hi>Exarchatship</hi> of <hi>Ravenna:</hi> Therfore was he as deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly as gloriously Crownd in <hi>Rome</hi> Emperour of the <hi>West,</hi> and the Title of <hi>Christianissimus</hi> given Him, the Empire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in his Race by direct Line above a hundred and ten yeers.</p>
               <p>What glorious Expeditions have bin made since in the Holy Land by five several Kings of <hi>France</hi> in person? Me thinks I behold <hi>Godefroy</hi> of <hi>Bouillon</hi> being countenancd and assisted by the <hi>French</hi> King, and having morgagd some part, and sold the rest of his Duchy for that Enterprise, marching with a huge Army through <hi>Germany, Hungary</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> and so passing to <hi>Asia</hi> to encounter the Forces of <hi>Solyman</hi> the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperour, and <hi>Chalypha</hi> the Soldan of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with other Infidel Kings whom he put to flight, making himself Master of <hi>Nice,</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Hierusalem</hi> her self, with the Holy Sepulchre of <hi>Christ.</hi> Me thinks I see Him when he was to be crownd King of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> throwing away the Crown of <hi>Gold,</hi> and taking one of <hi>Thorns</hi> in imitation of our blessed <hi>Saviour.</hi> Me thinks I see all the Princes therabouts Tributaries unto him, and bringing him rich pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, though He himself went clad but in the habit of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Gregarian</hi> Soldier; wherat some of the said Princes being astonishd, askd, How comes it to pass that so great a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror who hath shaken all the Eastern world shold go so plain and homely?</p>
               <p>But to draw to a conclusion of this Argument, let's descend lower to some of the Modern Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and the two last will afford matter enough to confirm the <hi>Fortitude</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, <hi>viz.

               <p>Touching his Son and immediat Successor <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, he also did mighty things.

He bangd all his Neighbours round about him: He clammerd twice with his Armies ore the <hi>Alps,</hi> and came back again, having done the business he went for.

               <p>We will not make such over-curious Retrospects as to look on the times before <hi>Charlemain,</hi> though ther be divers examples that ever since the time of <hi>Clouis,</hi> who was the first <hi>Christian</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> (which was above 300 years before) which prove that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> had Prerogatives of Session, and Precedence both of Place and Person next to the Emperour. But since <hi>Charlemain</hi> had the title of <hi>Christianissimus</hi> given him, ther be divers cleer and convincing proofs, how after the Empire was devolvd from <hi>Charlemains</hi> Race to the houses of <hi>Saxony, Suevia</hi> and <hi>Austria;</hi> nay since <hi>Austria</hi> came to the highest cumble of greatness and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of new Dominions, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have still had the Antecedence both in General Councils, in assisting the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Offices of the Church, and in attending the Popes Person. Now tis known that the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Rules and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice therof, is fittest to determine this Question of Precedence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mausonius</hi> and others have it upon good record, how <hi>Anno</hi> 1564.

                  <head>The famous Contest twixt the most <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Catholique</hi> Kings in <hi>Venice,</hi> as also in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT is well known how that before the rearing up of that huge Colosse of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> which was <hi>Anno</hi> 1516. when <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> died, <hi>Charles</hi> rendred himself very potent both in <hi>Italy</hi> as well as in <hi>Spain.</hi> But he encreasd more strength af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> being chosen Emperour in his place, at which time he was mounted to the highest pitch of subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and power: I say, tis well known how till that time the Kings of <hi>France</hi> were acknowledged the <hi>first</hi> after the person of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> who hath still preference given him before all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Princes whatsoever. Now, the Question was never <hi>Sur le tapis,</hi> was never controverted about <hi>Priority</hi> twixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> till the house of <hi>Austria</hi> started up to that enormous great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And although before <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth ther were <hi>Six</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of that <hi>House,</hi> and that the quality of Emperour gives precedence to any who legally possesseth the title, be he of what <hi>Family</hi> soever, yet that Prerogative is not given to any of their posterity being not calld to the <hi>Empire.</hi> In regard in <hi>Electif</hi> States the Election adhering only to the person of the Elected, gives the Eminence only to his person, excluding all other; yea his own Sons unless they be formally elected, although in <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessif</hi>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:59014:69"/>
hereditary patrimonial Estates tis otherwise. Insomuch that the house of <hi>Austria</hi> hath no more right to the Empire then the house of <hi>Saxe, Luxemburg,</hi> or <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> with other Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies who were <hi>Caesars</hi> before them.</p>
                  <p>Another <hi>House</hi> which much strengthend that of <hi>Austria,</hi> was that of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which yet was feudetary to <hi>France,</hi> as also the Counties of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> though the rest of the seventeen Provinces (which came to <hi>Spain</hi> by this alliance with <hi>Burgundy</hi>) are Fiefs of the Empire. The other Houses who did aggrandize <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, were <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Aragon; Castile</hi> came to be a Kingdome but after the yeer 1000. And the Kings of <hi>England</hi> took always precedence of them. <hi>Arragon</hi> was but a small State, feodary to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> until the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> which is also a Fief of the Church was annexd unto it. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto as Fortune wold have it, were added the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd first by an <hi>Italian,</hi> and offerd to the King of <hi>England.</hi> Then by alliance with <hi>Portugal</hi> the <hi>East-Indies</hi> came also to the Crown of <hi>Castile.</hi> This increase of <hi>Countries</hi> raisd the Spirits of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to claim Precedence of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> two of the most ancient Christian Kings. And to go more methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to work, we will divide the State of the house of <hi>Austria</hi> to three times; First, to that which preceded the year 1519. when <hi>Charles</hi> was establishd in the Empire; The second during his Raign, until he retird to a Claustral Life <hi>Anno</hi> 1555; The third to his Progeny since.</p>
                  <p>Touching the first, tis certain that notwithstanding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of this Family to the Empire, yet it continued still ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageable to the Empire: For <hi>Philip</hi> the Father of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour rendred solemn homage to the Chancellor <hi>du Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> after him for the Counties of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois Anno</hi> 1507. so that the said <hi>Charles</hi> being born in Gant, was born a Vassal to the King of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That in the Interview of <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Aragon Anno</hi> 1507. at <hi>Savona,</hi> although King <hi>Lewis</hi> usd great civilities to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> coming to visit him upon his own Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and so gave him Precedence, yet the world knows that it was but by way of <hi>Complement:</hi> But before <hi>Charles</hi> mounted the Empire, this Dispute of Precedence never entred into the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the year 1519. <hi>Charles</hi> was created Emperour, which <hi>Anno</hi> 1555. he resignd to his Brother <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> and at the same time he made a voluntary and absolut Cession of all the rest of his Dominions to his Son <hi>Philip</hi> the second, except the Archduchy of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the dependences therof in <hi>Germany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Philip</hi> though he succeeded in the <hi>Empire</hi> to which the Precedence only belongs, yet he endevourd to keep it still, under <hi>pretext</hi> that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59014:69"/>
he succeeded the Emperour his Father in all his large her hereditary Dominions, who always took place in all Assemblies, Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views and Tretises, specially in the great Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> though it was confusedly, because two qualities were in him of Emperour and King which could not be distinguished or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated.</p>
                  <p>But in the yeer 1555. when meditating upon a retirement he resignd the Empire to his Brother, and all his Kingdomes to his Son <hi>Philip,</hi> perceaving that his Son could not take precedence of the King of <hi>France</hi> because he was not Emperour, He made use of another artifice for conserving this pre-eminence for his <hi>Son</hi> as well as for his <hi>Brother.</hi> Before his retirement he revokd <hi>Don Francisco de Vargas</hi> his Ambassador in <hi>Venice,</hi> who had always taken precedence of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador without scruple: Now, after his resignation of the Empire, he sends again the said <hi>Vargas</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi> as <hi>his,</hi> and also his Sons Ambassador joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though indeed he was but Ambassador only to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> But he thought to over-reach the <hi>Venetian</hi> because he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployd still the same man qualified in apparance as formerly. <hi>Vargas</hi> demanded of the Senat the same precedence as formerly, which the Bishop of <hi>Lodeve,</hi> Ambassador at the same time to <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. of <hi>France,</hi> opposd, remonstrating to the Senat that <hi>Charles</hi> was no more considerable to the world being a reclusd person; And if the Ambassador of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to whom he had transferrd the Empire were present, he wold yeild place unto <hi>Him,</hi> but he wold not come after the Ambassador of King <hi>Philip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Senat apprehending some ill issue from this Dispute, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd that neither of the Ambassadors shold be present at the Feast of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> and so the business remaind at a stand by the irresolution of the Senat, and the simplicity of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador, who at last was contented to give way to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the <hi>Republique</hi> in favor of <hi>Vargas.</hi> But <hi>Anno</hi> 1558. <hi>Francis de Novailles</hi> Bishop of <hi>Acs</hi> succeeding him of <hi>Lodeve,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newd the Dispute; and the Ambassador of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> arriving about the same time, <hi>Novailles</hi> demanded of the Senat to be maintaind in his <hi>Rights,</hi> and to have the first place next the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial</hi> Ambassadors, and so took it couragiously before <hi>Vargas,</hi> who observing the cunning of the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> (who died in this conjuncture of time) was discoverd, and that he passd for no more then for the Ambassador of King <hi>Philip, Vargas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to speak high of the Grandeur of his Master, and to display the large Dominions and States he lorded over, far more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee then those of the <hi>French</hi> King; alledging that these Customs of Honor and Antecedences ought to be alterd according to the times: That his Master was the greatest King of the world, That he was able to assist the Republique with Arms, Men and Mony
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59014:70"/>
more then the King of the <hi>French, &amp;c.</hi> But the Bishop of <hi>Acs</hi> though much heat intervend, obtaind of the Senat a <hi>Deer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>e</hi> wherby the precedence was adjudgd him before the <hi>Spanish</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador; who loudly complaining therof, the Senat made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That the Republik did not trouble her self to examine the greatness of their Majesties, but she found within her Registers that in all Acts both publik and privat, in all Ceremonies, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits, and Audiences, the Ambassadors of <hi>France</hi> preceded those of <hi>Spain;</hi> wherin she wold acquiesce. This answer offended King <hi>Philip,</hi> who therupon revokd his Ambassador. But <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Surianus</hi> Ambassador for the Republick in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Court, defended the <hi>Decree</hi> of the Senat very vigorously, and in some mesure appeasd the spirit of King <hi>Philip,</hi> who notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding advancd this question upon all occasions. The greatest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours he usd, was four years after in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which was the greatest Theatre of Religion and Honor that had been seen above a hundred years before, wherof we shall give an exact Relation as followeth.</p>

                  <head>Of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>A General Council after the Revolt of <hi>Luther Anno</hi> 1517. was desird by all Christians, and often proposd by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth and <hi>Francis</hi> the first of <hi>France</hi> to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the seventh, and <hi>Paul</hi> the third, who at last convokd an Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenical Free Council to be held at <hi>Trent,</hi> which was also kept at <hi>Bolonia</hi> some part of the time, and ther were ten <hi>Sessions</hi> made in eighteen months. Then it ceasd until the death of <hi>Paul</hi> the third, 1549. The Cardinal <hi>Iohn Maria de Monte</hi> who had bin first President of the Council under <hi>Paul</hi> 3. succeeded by the the name of <hi>Iulius</hi> 3. who presently made an <hi>Indiction</hi> of the Council again, which recommencd at <hi>Trent Anno</hi> 1550. and lasted also under this Pope above 18 months; during which time ther were six <hi>Sessions:</hi> but being summond again by the same <hi>Iulius,</hi> it ceasd under <hi>Marcellus</hi> 2. who held the Pontificat but 22 days. Then it continued under <hi>Paul</hi> 4. <hi>Anno</hi> 1559. <hi>Pius</hi> 4. succeeding him, made a new Indiction of the Council again, which began 1561. under whom it lasted two years, during which time the nine last <hi>Sessions</hi> were made: Insomuch that the whole Council by intermissions lasted about eighteen yeers, from the year 1545. to 1563. but the Council sate together in deliberation but five years, take all the Adjournments toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Now, to understand the Right of the Precedences of Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors, we must know that in the said Council three kinds of Assemblies were made, <hi>viz.</hi> Congregations <hi>General, Particular</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:59014:70"/>
Congregations, and <hi>Sessions.</hi> In the particular Congregations the Doctors assisted by some Bishops examined Questions of <hi>Faith</hi> and Reformation, according to the distribution that was made them; and in this ther was no consideration had of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence or Ceremony; They were Actions <hi>intra privatos parietes,</hi> within privat Walls.</p>
                  <p>In the General Congregation all the Prelats assembled, and the Legats presided, who proposed what ought to be treated in the particular Congregations: There the Theologians were heard, and Ambassadors of Princes had audience after their Commissions had been examined. In brief, all things were concluded there which were to be promulgated in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Session,</hi> and Ambassadors had their places there according to their Rank.</p>
                  <p>At last the <hi>Session</hi> was the solemn day, at which after the Mass of the Holy Spirit, and a Sermon preachd by some Prelat, or great Theologian, the Prelat Officiating, pronounced aloud the Decrees already resolvd upon, which had been approvd by the Fathers by this Canonical word <hi>Placet.</hi> Now all Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors had their seats of honor in those <hi>Sessions,</hi> and at <hi>Mass;</hi> and this Honor appeerd by the places where they sate, as also by the <hi>Censer</hi> and <hi>Pax</hi> which were given them to kiss during the celebration of the <hi>Mass.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Council held by <hi>Paul</hi> 3. and <hi>Iulius</hi> 3. <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth was Emperour, and without any the least contradiction his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors preceded all others, though the <hi>French</hi> scarce appeerd there, and in the 16 first <hi>Sessions</hi> ther was hardly any Prelat of <hi>France:</hi> so there was no dispute of any precedence at all, the Emperour having the first rank; and ther was no occasion at all for any Ambassador from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> because it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volvd then in the Empire: yet ther intervend some things which declard the Prerogatives of the King of <hi>France.</hi>

Props of Christianity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that ther is no other Prince par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly namd in the <hi>Bull</hi> but the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the other Kings and Princes go under one general no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is a great advantage of Honour to the Kings of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the entry of the Council 1545. <hi>Francis</hi> the first of <hi>France</hi> had appointed for his Ambassadors <hi>Claude d' Urfé</hi> Seneshal of the <hi>Forests, Iacques de Ligneres</hi> President of the third Chamber of <hi>Enquests,</hi> and Dean <hi>Peter Danes</hi> afterwards Bishop of <hi>Vaur:</hi> but being advertisd by some Bishops which were at <hi>Trent</hi> how ther were but little hopes that the said Council was like to have good success, he revokd the said Ambassadors who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peerd not at all in the Council. But <hi>Anthony Filiolo</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Aix</hi> being there, and demanding that in the publik Prayers which were made for all Christian Princes, the King of <hi>France</hi> shold be expresly nominated as he was in the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Indiction:</hi> the Legats eluded this demand, insomuch that the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Emperour</hi> were only namd in the Prayers, and all other Princes conceavd in General terms.</p>
                  <p>In the yeer 1546. King <hi>Francis</hi> 1. sent <hi>Peter Danes</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vaur</hi> for his Ambassador to the Council, where making an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Oration, he represented the sad state of Christendome, and the disorders which were crept into the Church, yea into the <hi>Roman</hi> Court: wherupon one Bishop laughd, saying, <hi>Gallus cantat,</hi> The Cock crows. <hi>Danes</hi> replied suddenly, <hi>Utinam illo Gallocinio Petrus ad resipiscentiam &amp; fletum excitetur;</hi> I wold to God that by this crowing of the Cock <hi>Peter</hi> wold be raisd up to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and tears. And this saying was afterwards in evry ones mouth.</p>
                  <p>In the yeer 1547. <hi>Paul</hi> 3. in regard of the Plague and Wars then in <hi>Germany,</hi> transferrd the Council from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Bolonia:</hi> but this he did, <hi>Communicato etiam Consilio cum Imperatore, Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissimo Rege, &amp; aliis Regibus ac Principibus Christianis,</hi> where the King of <hi>France</hi> is particularly namd.</p>
                  <p>In the yeer 1551. when <hi>Iulius</hi> 3. had re-established the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil again at <hi>Trent,</hi> although <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. the King of <hi>France</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a hot War against Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> for the Affairs of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> yet he employd <hi>Iaques Amyot</hi> Abbot of <hi>Belosana,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Bishop of <hi>Auxerre</hi> with a Letter bearing this Inscription, <hi>Sanctissimis in Christo &amp; observandis Patribus Tridentini Conventus.</hi> Which Letter the said <hi>Amyot</hi> having delivered to Cardinal <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scentius</hi> President of the Council, and the Secretary having read the Inscription, the Spanish Bishops cryed out, That it was a wrong done to the Council to call it <hi>Conventum,</hi> a Convention, therfore protested against it. Nevertheless after long dispute upon the signification of the word <hi>Conventus,</hi> it was concluded
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59014:71"/>
that it might be taken in good part. The Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologize for <hi>France,</hi> stood up and said, How shall we receave the Papers of the <hi>German</hi> Protestants which we call <hi>Concilium Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantium,</hi> if we reject the King of <hi>France's</hi> Letter for calling us <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventum?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour being also King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ther was no Question of Precedence: but at the third Indiction of the Council by <hi>Pius</hi> 4. <hi>Anno</hi> 1561. ther were divers clashes happend twixt the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors and those of <hi>Philip,</hi> which engendred great jelousies twixt the two Crowns, and high Contests which happend principally from the imprudence of <hi>Pius</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>In his <hi>Bull</hi> of Indiction he used other terms then <hi>Paul</hi> 3. and <hi>Iulius</hi> 3. did; for he names not the King of <hi>France</hi> as formerly, but involves him under the general notions of other Christian Princes: Therupon <hi>Philibert de la Bourdesiere</hi> Bishop of <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leme,</hi> Ambassador for the King in the Popes Court, complaind of this omission in the Kings name; yet with a protestation, that notwithstanding this misprision and prejudice to his Crown, he wold not hinder the continuance and progress of the Council whither he had commanded his Bishops to repair. The Pope made answer, that he had given order to some Cardinals to draw the <hi>Bull,</hi> and it seems they had not been careful of this pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio: for having namd the <hi>Emperour,</hi> they judgd it not so necessary to name all <hi>Kings,</hi> but to comprize them under one general notion: wherupon the French Ambassador replyed, That it was one of the Prerogatives of his most Christian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty not to be involvd in generals, but in <hi>express</hi> terms. The Pope rejoynd, That he could not foresee all things, and for the future ther shold be a care had ther shold be no such omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>In the yeer 1562. ther arrivd at <hi>Trent, Lewis de Saint Gelais,</hi> Lord of <hi>Lansac;</hi> and three days after <hi>Arnaud Ferrier,</hi> and <hi>Guy du Faur Pybrac,</hi> Judge of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> who were receavd very honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by the <hi>Council:</hi> nay, a gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>at part of the Prelats subject to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> went out to meet them; but <hi>Ferdinand de Avalos</hi> Marquiss of <hi>Pescara</hi> and Ambassador to King <hi>Philip,</hi> departed from <hi>Trent</hi> three days before, and retird to <hi>Milan,</hi> wherof He was Governor, under pretext that ther were some apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of danger from the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and from the <hi>Swisse;</hi> But in effect it was to avoid the meeting of the French Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors who took place in the <hi>General Congregation</hi> next the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial. The Lord of <hi>Pybrac</hi> made a notable Oration, wherin speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the enormities of the Church, the small progress the <hi>Council</hi> had made in so long a time, and also for freedome of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, it was not fit to stand waiting of things so long from <hi>Rome:</hi>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:59014:72"/>
and being seconded by <hi>Lansac</hi> and <hi>Ferrier</hi> upon the same subject, the <hi>Pope</hi> complaind therof, and spoke loud that the King of <hi>France</hi> had not sent Ambassadors to the Council, but rather Advocats for the <hi>Hugonots, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Bishops arrivd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward at <hi>Trent</hi> in <hi>November,</hi> conducted by the Cardinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> who was receavd honorably by the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and other Legats; but hitherto the point of Precedence was not touchd.</p>
                  <p>A little after the Arrival of the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the <hi>Gallican</hi> Bishops, <hi>Philip</hi> the second having revokd the Marquiss of <hi>Pescara,</hi> employd to <hi>Trent Ferdinand Quiniones Count of Luna</hi> in quality of Ambassador, who having passd before to <hi>Germany</hi> to be assistant at the Coronation of <hi>Maximilian</hi> Son to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the <hi>Count of Luna</hi> desird to know of the Fathers of the <hi>Council</hi> what place he shold receave. Therupon the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> of <hi>Mantua</hi> the chief Legat having consulted the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Lorain,</hi> he proposd unto them a form of Accommodation, That concerning <hi>them</hi> they shold hold their place next the Imperial Ambassadors, and another place shold be given the <hi>Count of Luna</hi> opposite to the <hi>Legats</hi> on the other side, or after the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Ambassadors, or in some other part out of the bank of Ambassadors. Wherunto the <hi>French</hi> replyed, That they were employd by their King not to judge of Processes, or decide the Rights of King <hi>Philip,</hi> who was a good Frend and Brother-in-law to <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth; But if any offerd to take that place which was due to <hi>them,</hi> they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvd to defend it against any person whatsoever. And if the <hi>Council</hi> wold question it, they had in their Instructions order to withdraw themselfs with all the <hi>French</hi> Prelats, and to protest against the nullity of all resolutions that shold be there transa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. To this the <hi>Legat</hi> made no reply. This Answer in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance was fair and generous, but in effect it gave occasion of affronts, which afterwards were done to the <hi>French</hi> at the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> and tended to strengthen the pretensions of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> which continue to this day. For the Right of the King of <hi>France</hi> is not only to be immediatly next the Emperour, but to see all other Kings come behind him: insomuch that it was the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors duty at that time to stand still upon it, and oblige the <hi>Count of Luna</hi> to take his place after them; but to permit him to sit elswhere, was to cut out matter for a Process: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors did hold their places, yet to suffer the <hi>Count of Luna</hi> to sit apart, was tacitly to receave him into an <hi>equality:</hi> Insomuch that as well in this first rancounter as afterwards when the dispute happend in the General <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Lorain</hi> was blamd that he was not pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual enough in things relating to his Masters Honor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:59014:72"/>In the yeer 1563. the Legats apprehending some clash twixt the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Doctors in point of Precedence of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Opinions, ordaind, that without distinction of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on evry one shold speak according to the antiquity of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorship. And because ther were some <hi>French</hi> Doctors that were more ancient then the <hi>Spanish,</hi> yet not permitted to speak first, the Legats quickly satisfied them, saying, That the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> do not represent the Prince his person as Ambassadors use to do.</p>
                  <p>But to compose these differences which grew very high, the Doctors were divided to four Classes; and it was orderd that those which were sent from the Pope being <hi>de Iure</hi> to speak first, the <hi>French</hi> Doctors shold speak next; which was accorded by the Legats: Therfore it was voted that after <hi>Salmeron</hi> the Jesuit, and the Popes <hi>Theologue, Nicholas Maillart</hi> Dean of the Faculty in <hi>Paris,</hi> shold speak, and after that, evry one shold speak accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his reception into the degree of Doctor, which was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctisd accordingly. But to content the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> it was couched in the Register of the <hi>Council,</hi> that the French Doctor <hi>Maillart</hi> had spoken according to his antiquity into Doctorship, no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being had to precedence of Nation.</p>
                  <p>In the same year 1563. on <hi>Easter</hi>-day the <hi>Count of Luna</hi> was receavd at <hi>Trent;</hi> at his entry he marchd between the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the Emperour and the King's of <hi>France.</hi> This action passd with much honor and civility twixt both Nations; and the same time the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Lorain</hi> writ to the Emperour <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> who was then at <hi>Insbrug</hi> in the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Tirol</hi> three days distant from <hi>Trent,</hi> upon divers affairs of the <hi>Council,</hi> and at the end prayed him to find out some temperament for allaying the dispute of Precedence twixt the two Crowns. But this clause of the <hi>Cardinal</hi> to the Emperour was blamd by divers, for he shold not have desird a temperament in the business, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Right. The Emperour made answer, That it did not concern him to determine the Differences twixt the two Kings in this particular; But to speak his sentiment herin, He thought that if the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors come immediatly after <hi>His,</hi> and that none disturbs them, what matter is it where the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadors sit? But these words were held to be of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous consequence: For in point of Precedence, whosoever quits his place is presumed to scorn it, and seek after a higher; which cannot be done without a prejudice to them who sate high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er before.</p>
                  <p>Upon the 21 of <hi>May,</hi> at the General Congregation, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> appeerd more cleer: The Count of <hi>Luna</hi> after the foresaid solemn <hi>Entry</hi> absconded himself for 40 days, without appeering openly in any <hi>Ceremony</hi> or publik <hi>Act;</hi> and so
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59014:73"/>
being puzzled what cours to take in this busines, Somtimess he resolvd to enter the Assembly in the midst of the Emperours Ambassadors, aud after they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ate to stand by them while his Commission was verified, and then retire to his House. But thinking this cours not generous enough for his Masters honor, He prayed the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors not to be there that day; which being denied him, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Bishops proposd that <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Ambassadors shold be prayed not to enter into the General Congregations, but only the day of their <hi>Reception,</hi> and that They wold be contented to assist the Ceremony at the <hi>Session</hi> only; alledging, that it was practisd so in other General Councils. But all the Ambassadors did mainly oppose this.</p>
                  <p>Then it was privatly suggested to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Bishops by the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> that they shold propose some point that might make the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors <hi>Parties,</hi> and so not capable to sit in the Assembly. As for example, they shold represent the Domages which the whole Church hath receivd by the peace which the King of <hi>France</hi> had made with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> or some such other thing. But that also taking no effect, and the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> being put to delays from day to day by the obstinacy of the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> at last that the Affairs of the Council shold not be retarded, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors declard to the <hi>Legats,</hi> that, provided their place shold remain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the Imperial Ambassadors, they did not much heed what place the Ambassadors of <hi>Spain</hi> shold take.</p>
                  <p>This weakness of the Cardinal, and of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, did scandalize all <hi>Christendome;</hi> and in <hi>France</hi> they blamd Him to have betrayed the Honor of their <hi>Master;</hi> Nay, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Council</hi> took it in ill part, and at <hi>Rome</hi> the Cardinal <hi>de Bourdesiere</hi> who was with the <hi>Pope</hi> for the <hi>King,</hi> having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaind of this <hi>Spanish Ambition,</hi> and of this <hi>Innovation</hi> introducd against the Ancient Orders, Pope <hi>Pius</hi> made answer, That he shold blame the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors, and their imbecility; For his part, although he had bin sollicited before and after the Count of <hi>Luna</hi>'s arrival at <hi>Trent,</hi> that he shold favor this dessein, yet He remaind constant and inflexible; and He wonderd that the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors were wrought upon so easily.</p>
                  <p>The great day of the Congregation being come, and evry Ambassador having taken his place, the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> enters, and seats himself face to face to the <hi>Legats,</hi> a good distance from the bank of the Ambassadors; and standing up, he presents his Orders, and the Will of his Master; protesting afterwards, that although the first place was due to him after the Emperours Ambassador, as representing the greatest Prince of <hi>Christendom,</hi> the greatest Pillar of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet not to introduce any confusion in the affairs of the <hi>Council,</hi> he deported himself from
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59014:73"/>
this Right; yet with condition that this his <hi>Protestation</hi> shold be inserted in the Acts of the <hi>Council,</hi> and that they shold not be printed or publishd without it; besides, that a Copy shold be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered Him by the Secretary of the <hi>Council.</hi> When he had said these words, he took the place which was appointed Him neer the Table of the Secretary of the <hi>Council.</hi> Therupon the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors who were next the Imperials, said, That if the place which they had were not the most Honorable after the <hi>Emperours,</hi> as it was acknowledgd in all <hi>Councils,</hi> and namely in the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> and in the last <hi>Lateran</hi> Council held under <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth; Or if the place they had given the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> was any way prejudicial to them, they prayed the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> to provide presently either by Orders, Commandments, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications, or other courses taken in such a case, without having any regard to the person; But because no body spake a word, and that also the <hi>Imperial</hi> Ambassadors connivd at this <hi>Innovation,</hi> although they had equal interest to hinder it as well as the <hi>French</hi> because it might be disputed on against them, they added, that without any blemish to the Honor of King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> and to the alliance of the two Crowns, they protested for a nullity of these Proceedings, and requird that their <hi>Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> might also be inserted in the Acts of the Council, and a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py deliverd them. After these Disputes, the Fathers of the Council not saying any thing, <hi>Fontidon</hi> a Spanish Doctor made a <hi>Latin</hi> Oration in the name of the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> wherin he exalted the Grandeur of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> His Zeal to Religion, and the <hi>Church</hi> in such extravagant expressions, and so deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to other Princes, that the Imperial Ambassadors themselfs made complaint therof to the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Luna,</hi> who excusd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, saying, That that <hi>Harang</hi> had displeasd Him as much as any other. Now, the <hi>Promoter</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> having made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the said Oration, the Spanish Ambassador suddenly went from the Assembly, (not staying until the Legats had ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen up) it seems of purpose to prevent a Dispute that might happen with the <hi>French,</hi> which He observd also in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Congregations,</hi> sitting always a part, and going out alone.</p>
                  <p>But the same Order could not be observd in the <hi>Church</hi> upon the day of the <hi>Session,</hi> because the mode of sitting was otherwise, and the Ceremonies were more precise in point of Precedencie, as that of the <hi>Pax</hi> and <hi>Censer</hi> at the celebration of Masse. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> consulted the <hi>Pope</hi> before the <hi>Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> who being gaind by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and thinking also that the <hi>French</hi> wold shew another trick of weakness, He writ to his <hi>Legats,</hi> That although in the <hi>Session</hi> a place was given apart to the <hi>Spanish,</hi> yet that the <hi>Pax</hi> and <hi>Censer</hi> shold be given to both the Ambassadors at one time: But they were commanded to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59014:74"/>
keep the business secret until the very point of the action, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that the <hi>French</hi> shold make no stir.</p>
                  <p>The day of the <hi>Session</hi> being come, which was 29 <hi>Iune,</hi> being St. <hi>Peters</hi> day, after that the Bishop of <hi>Valdasto</hi> in <hi>Savoy</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to sing the Mass of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> ther was suddenly a chair of Black Velvet brought from the <hi>Sacristia</hi> or Vestry, which was plac'd twixt the last Cardinal and the first Patriark, wherin the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> sate; The Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> together with the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors, made a great noise, and did rise up with an intention to depart, when they understood that the <hi>Pax</hi> with the <hi>Censer</hi> shold be presented at the same time: But for fear to trouble the solemnity of the act, they were contented to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test only against it, and to declare that the <hi>Right</hi> of the King of <hi>France</hi> did not consist in an <hi>Equality,</hi> but in <hi>Precedence.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel being read, and a Theologue going up to the chair to make an Oration, the <hi>Legats,</hi> with the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and the other Cardinals, with the Ambassador of the Emperour, and <hi>Ferrier</hi> the second <hi>French</hi> Ambassador, (for <hi>Lansac</hi> was returned to <hi>France,</hi> and had left behind him <hi>Ferrier</hi> and <hi>Pybrack</hi>) I say, all these enterd into the <hi>Sextry,</hi> whither they calld the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Granada,</hi> (a <hi>Spaniard</hi>) to find out some way of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation: at last, after many disputes and contestations on both sides, with many entrances and returns of the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> it was concluded that Mass shold be ended with the <hi>Pax</hi> or <hi>Censer;</hi> wherupon <hi>Luna</hi> went out of the Church accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his <hi>Spaniards,</hi> triumphing as it were that he had made this first pass for the advantage and honor of his Master.</p>
                  <p>This action seemd very scandalous, and the <hi>Legats</hi> were much cryed down, until at last being not able to bear the outcry, they were constrained to produce the Commands they had receavd from <hi>Rome:</hi> and the Injury was held the more sensible, because it was offerd to an Infant and Pupil <hi>King</hi> as <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth was, who was at the same time assiegd by the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in a Civil War; The Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> did write sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letters to the <hi>Pope,</hi> yet all within the compass of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: But <hi>Ferrier</hi> being a spritful and violent man, cryed aloud, That if at the first publick <hi>Masse</hi> the <hi>Preference</hi> of the <hi>Pax</hi> and <hi>Censer</hi> was not given to his Master, He wold <hi>protest</hi> not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Legats</hi> and the <hi>Council,</hi> who had their hands as it were tied up, nor against King <hi>Philip</hi> who made use of these advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nor against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (towards which he wold never loose due respects) but against the proper person of the <hi>Pope</hi> himself, who, as he wold prove, had <hi>bought</hi> the <hi>Pontificat,</hi> and so wold appeal from Him to a <hi>Legal</hi> Pope, and to a free and tru <hi>Council;</hi> And if the most Christian King his Master wold convoke a <hi>National Council,</hi> it shold be as numerous and</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:59014:74"/>It is very tru that <hi>Ferrier</hi> and <hi>Pybrak</hi> had prepard a most <hi>acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Harang</hi> against the Pope, and against this <hi>Innovation</hi> which <hi>Ferrier</hi> was to pronounce, and to command at the same time all the <hi>French</hi> Bishops and Doctors to retire home, with a promise they shold return when God shold please to give his Church a <hi>Legal Pope,</hi> and re-establish the <hi>Councils</hi> in their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and full Liberties.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Harang</hi> was printed, but not pronouncd: in the mean time the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> did glory that the <hi>Legats</hi> had promisd Him that at the first Masse he shold be receavd in an <hi>Equality</hi> touching the <hi>Pax</hi> and the <hi>Censer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Legats</hi> apprehending some ilfavourd issue from these ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, and because the Ambassador of <hi>Poland</hi> declard that if the Ambassador of <hi>France</hi> wold withdraw himself from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Council he wold quickly follow him, as the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of divers other Princes wold do; The <hi>Legats,</hi> and the most advised Members of the Council, specially <hi>Madruccio</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Trent</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> thought it expedient to sing publick Masse without giving the <hi>Pax</hi> or the <hi>Censer;</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they had the consent of the Count of <hi>Luna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the cours which was taken to offer so signal an affront to the King of <hi>France,</hi> wherof so much hath been spoken, and which hindred the good that was expected in <hi>France</hi> from this great <hi>Council.</hi> A little after, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Lorain</hi> retird to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Ferrier</hi> declaimd loudly in one General <hi>Congregation</hi> against the enormities and disorders which had crept into the <hi>Church, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pope took this much to heart, and for to sweeten the business, he sent the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Lorain</hi> back again to the <hi>Council</hi> with full authority to regulat, together with the <hi>Legats,</hi> what was amiss in the Proceedings of the <hi>Council.</hi> He assisted at the twenty fourth <hi>Session</hi> held the 11 of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1563. the day of the Sacrament of <hi>Marriage,</hi> and having receavd order from <hi>France</hi> to retire speedily with all the <hi>French</hi> Bishops, the Legats hastned the conclusion of the <hi>Council,</hi> and inorderd that the <hi>five and twentieth</hi> and last <hi>Session</hi> shold be held the third and fourth day of <hi>December,</hi> wherin as before, the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors took place, and the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> sate neer the <hi>Secretary</hi> of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;</hi> and in the publick Masses ther was no speech either of the <hi>Pax</hi> or <hi>Censer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> finishd the 4 of <hi>December</hi> 1563. and Cardinal <hi>Moron</hi> who was then <hi>President</hi> gave the publik <hi>Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> saying, <hi>Post gratias Deo actas reverendissimi Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres Ite in pace:</hi> Most reverend Fathers, after giving God thanks go in peace: wherunto all answerd, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But because the custome is, that at the end of evry <hi>General</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:59014:75"/>
                     <hi>Council</hi> acclamations shold be made to <hi>felicitat</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> who had convoqud it, the <hi>Fathers</hi> who had held it, and the <hi>Princes</hi> who had assisted, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> took a particular care this shold be performd, for which he was censurd as a care too infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to his <hi>Eminence,</hi> which he shold have left to the <hi>Deacons, Promoters, Secretaries,</hi> and <hi>Masters of the Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi> But above all he was blamd that in the Acclamation made for the <hi>Secular</hi> Princes, he causd not the name of the King of <hi>France</hi> to be particularly mentiond, as it was observd in the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Indiction;</hi> and for omission wherof, complaint was made that <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth did it not, wherof the <hi>Cardinal</hi> could not be ignorant.</p>
                  <p>Now, the Acclamation that was made in favor of the <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Princes, (wherin the name of the King of <hi>France</hi> was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) ran thus: The Cardinal said aloud, <hi>Caroli quinti Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, &amp; serenissimorum Regum qui hoc universale Concilium promove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, &amp; protexerunt, Memoria in Benedictione sit;</hi> Let the memory of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and of the most serene Kings who have promoted this universal Council, be always Blessed. Then, <hi>Serenissimo Imperatori Ferdinando semper Augusto, Orthodoxo, &amp; Pacifico, &amp; omnibus Regibus, Reipublicis, &amp; principibus nostris mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti anni:</hi> Many years to the most serene Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver August, Orthodoxal, and Peaceful; and to all our Kings, Commonwealths, and Princes. Then the Fathers answerd, <hi>Pium &amp; Christianum Imperatorem Domine conserva, Imperator Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestis Terrenos Reges Rectae Fidei conservatores custodi:</hi> O Lord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Pious and Christian Emperour; O Coelestial Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour defend Earthly Kings, Conservers of the Right Faith.</p>
                  <p>The first Acclamation was for the Dead, wherin the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal forgot to express the name of <hi>Francis</hi> the 1. and <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. who had contributed their care and zeal for the good of the <hi>Council.</hi> The second was for <hi>living</hi> Princes, wherin he also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the name of <hi>Charles</hi> 9. for which the said Cardinal was blamd at the King of <hi>France</hi> his <hi>Council.</hi> He excusd himself that it was for the fear he had to put division between the two Kings; and withal, that <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>France</hi> being yet a <hi>minor,</hi> he was like to be troubled about matters of Religion in regard of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and might have need of King <hi>Philip,</hi> therfore it was no wisdom to exasperat Him.</p>
                  <p>Thus have you a kinde of Epitome of the great <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> specially of the celebrous Contests, Intrigues, Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Artifices twixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> in point of Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Place, and Priority of Session.</p>
                  <p>The next Contest was at the Congress of Ambassadors in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59014:75"/>
                     <hi>Vervins,</hi> 1598. (touchd at before) where the <hi>French</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors receivd an Accommodation by the moderation of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Medici.</hi> The manner of this Accommodation was thus: The Cardinal <hi>Legat</hi> being under a Cloth of State at the end of the Table where the Treaty was to be held, had upon his <hi>Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand</hi> the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and next <hi>Him</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadors; upon his <hi>Left</hi>-hand the <hi>Legat</hi> had the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors, and in that posture they proceeded to negotiat and Treat without any exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption or animosities; wherby the Business producd peaceful and blessed effects, wherof all <hi>Christendome</hi> did reap very whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some fruit.</p>
                  <p>After this, ther happend a tough competition upon the same account of <hi>Precedence</hi> in the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> and when the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> could not prevail there, He went to the Emperours Court <hi>Maximilian</hi> the second his neer Kinsman, wher his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors had the Prerogative of Place before the Ambassadors of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth King of <hi>France:</hi> wherupon <hi>Gaspar Coligni</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested loudly against this apparent injury, and that it was a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause to denounce War. But <hi>Mendosa</hi> the <hi>Spanish Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador</hi> being much pressd hereabouts, and reducd to a narrow streight, found out at last this witty evasion, saying, <hi>Se nolle quidem anteire, tamen cogi non posse ut Francorum Legatos sequeretur:</hi> If He did not go before, yet He could not be forcd to <hi>follow</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Besoldus</hi> (with others who are great Advocats for the <hi>Spanish</hi> Precedence) beat their Brains to find out arguments to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: amongst which, the greatest is, the multitude of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that have accrued to the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> whence they deduce this Principle, <hi>Ex facto sumitur Ius,</hi> Right is to be taken out of the <hi>Fact;</hi> and the Fact being changd, the Right also changeth. Therfore the Fact and circumstances of things being changd on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> side, and respect had to his encrease of Territories, and present condition, it may well alter the former custome of giving precedence to <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then he takes the Cudgels against <hi>England</hi> in behalf of <hi>Spain,</hi> notwithstanding that he acknowledgeth out of <hi>Meteranus</hi> that the <hi>English</hi> are the most <hi>ancient Christians,</hi> and that <hi>Germany</hi> his own Country owes her <hi>Religion</hi> first to <hi>Them;</hi> That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are descended of the <hi>Noblest Families</hi> of any, which makes him instance in King <hi>Cunobelinus,</hi> whose Coyn is to be seen to this day, who raignd in <hi>Great Britain</hi> about our Saviours Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He alledgeth further how the King of <hi>England</hi> is feodary or subordinat to no earthly Power, but is <hi>Gods immediat Vicar</hi> in his own Dominions: yet he concludes simply and irrationally in these words; <hi>Verùm &amp; Angli nimis antiquis argumentis pugnant, &amp; praesenti Majestati Hispaniae aequiparandi minimè esse videntur:</hi> The
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59014:76"/>
English fight with too ancient arguments, and <hi>seem</hi> not to be compard to the present Majesty of <hi>Spain.</hi> He speaks also as <hi>simply,</hi> and indeed not without some absurdity, when after those uncontroulable arguments, he saith, <hi>Sed porro absonum est quod Anglus Hispano Sessionis litem movet;</hi> It is a senseless thing that the English shold move any debate with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of <hi>Session.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And another great Champion for the <hi>Precedence</hi> of <hi>Spain, viz. Diego Valdez,</hi> discourseth as weakly; for notwithstanding that he acknowledgeth <hi>Lucius</hi> to be a <hi>Christian</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> in the time of Pope <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> (which was many hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ther was any in <hi>Spain</hi>) &amp; that he confesseth that <hi>Summa Ratio est quae ducitur à Religione,</hi> yet he wold not have <hi>England</hi> compare with <hi>Spain</hi> in point of <hi>Precedence:</hi> wherby he discovers not only a great deal of injustice and partiality, but also a gross Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Antiquity, by calling <hi>Lucius</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> wheras this Country had not that <hi>Name</hi> till the <hi>Saxons</hi> came in, which was above three hundred years after: For till then twas calld <hi>Britannia</hi> by all Forreners, and <hi>Loegria</hi> or <hi>Lloygher</hi> by the native Inhabitants; which name continues among the <hi>Welch</hi> to this day. Nor is this <hi>His Error</hi> alone, but of many other great <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquaries,</hi> and some of our own <hi>Authors,</hi> who having no due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the computation of time, do very frequently call this Country <hi>England</hi> many hundred of years before the word was created.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we producd and faithfully alledgd the principal Arguments that <hi>France</hi> hath for a <hi>Precedence:</hi> We will conclude with two late Passages which happend in this kind; One was in the <hi>Hague</hi> twixt <hi>Monsieur de Thou,</hi> and <hi>Don Estevan de Gamarra</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador; whose Coaches meeting casually in a place where ther were two Rails, ther happend a scustle for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence; but a band of Soldiers came and kept them quiet till notice was sent to the <hi>Council of State;</hi> who sitting three or four hours about it, at last they gave command that the Rails shold be cut down; and so the way being left open, the scustle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>The second was in <hi>London</hi> twixt <hi>Monsieur l' Estrade</hi> and the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron de Batteville,</hi> both of them <hi>Ambassadors</hi> at the <hi>English</hi> Court, the latter for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the other for <hi>France;</hi> A new <hi>Danish</hi> Ambassador was to make his Entry through <hi>London;</hi> and His Majesty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> having intimation that ther might be some clash between the Coaches of the foresaid Ambassadors if they sent them according to custome to bring in the said new Ambassador, He sent unto them that they wold forbear to send their Coaches because some inconvenience might arise: <hi>Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:59014:76"/>
answerd, That he wold conform to his Majesties plesure, provided <hi>l' Estrade</hi> did likewise do so: But <hi>l' Estrade</hi> gave answer to the Kings Message, That his Predecessor the <hi>French</hi> Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador immediatly before him had receavd a check at his return to <hi>France</hi> for omitting this ceremony, and so was he like to do if he did not perform it. So both of them sending their rich Coaches and Laquays to <hi>Tower-wharf</hi> where the new Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor was to land, <hi>Batteville</hi> it seems had taken such a survey of the place, that his Coach stood in such a posture that none could get before it and the Kings Coach: besides, he had causd the Rains and Harness of his Coach to be lin'd with <hi>Wire,</hi> making them therby poof against the strokes of Swords: so ther hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend a hot and fierce Scirmige, ther being Pistols on both sides besides Swords, and the <hi>French</hi> had some horsmen also; so the poor Horses were slashd, and some Laquays killd on both sides, and one <hi>Spanish</hi> Gentleman was killd in the Coach: but <hi>Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> stood firm to his ground, and so his Coach went next to the Kings all the way. News being sent herof to <hi>Paris,</hi> it was much resented, and the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador there being confind to his House, he presently dispatchd an <hi>Expresse</hi> to <hi>Madrid;</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returnd, He sent to the <hi>Louvre</hi> that he had receavd such Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that wold give his Majesty satisfaction touching the late Traverses in <hi>England,</hi> and so desired Audience, which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him the next day: In the interim command was sent that the Princes of the Blood and chief Officers of the Crown shold be there. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador being come, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a <hi>privat</hi> audience, but finding such a solemn meeting, was a little stunnd at first; yet he went on, and deliverd his Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the King: which was, that touching the late Contest in <hi>England,</hi> it was done without his <hi>Catholique</hi> Majesties direction and knowledge, therfore he wold take a cours that no occasion shold be offerd for such differences herafter. Besides these, he pronouncd other Explanatory words that were equivalent to an acknowledgment of <hi>Precedence</hi> to his most Christian Majesty, which were suddenly commanded to be registred in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for an Act of State, and so to stand upon Record to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon ther was a most prudent <hi>Act</hi> of State passd in the Privy Council of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> That in regard of the inconvenience and disturbances which did thence arise, his Majesty commanded that no <hi>Forren</hi> Ambassadors Coaches shall for the future go to accompany and introduce any new Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador whatsoever, because his Majesties Coaches are sufficient to accompany them in a fitting Equippage: which <hi>Act</hi> I believe will be a leading case to all the Courts of <hi>Christendome.</hi>

            <p>OF all these Arguments we shall treat distinctly in several divisions according to the former method, and <hi>distil</hi> out of the chiefest <hi>Spanish</hi> Authors that write of this subject, the <hi>Elixir</hi> and strength of their Reasons.

                  </gap>; And his Vicar-general upon earth (the Pope) is calld <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put Ecclesiae Militantis,</hi> The Head of the Militant Church. For in the Head, as Philosophers teach us, Nature shews her chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est skill in the architecture and composition of Man (the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosm</hi>) in regard that in the <hi>Head</hi> all the Senses are placd; The Eyes which are the Casements of the <hi>Soul</hi> are there; The Toung which is her chief Interpreter moves there; Nay, all her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as the <hi>Will,</hi> the <hi>Memory,</hi> and the <hi>Intellect,</hi> by which we are distinguished from Beasts, have their dwelling there as in a Capitol: Therfore, as <hi>Cassanaeus</hi> saith, He is a Monster of a Man who wold compare the <hi>Body</hi> with the <hi>Head.</hi> Now, by consent of all, if the Head be the predominant part of the Body, surely He who governs the Head must be more excellent then He who governs the Body; As the City of <hi>Rome</hi> being the <hi>Capital</hi> City of the Christian Empire, the <hi>Pope</hi> being Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is acknowledgd the Metropolitan and chiefest among the rest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath the excellentst City and Diocess.</p>
               <p>Now an Argument for <hi>Precedence</hi> drawn <hi>A Nobilitate Regni,</hi> carries much strength and reason with it: Therfore if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> be He who governs the Head of <hi>Europe,</hi> it follows that He may be calld the chiefest King. Now, to prove that <hi>Spain</hi> is so, we will produce these proofs; First, the Authority of <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> who saith thus: <hi>Terrarum Orbis Universi in tres dividitur partes, Europam, Asiam, Africam, Origo ab Occasu Solis, &amp; Gaditano Freto, quò irrumpens Oceanus Atlanticus in Maria Interiora diffundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> The Globe of the earth is divided into three parts, <hi>Europe, Asia</hi> and <hi>Afrik,</hi> the Head is from the setting of the Sun, and the <hi>Gaditan Frete,</hi> which Navigators commonly call <hi>The Streights mouth,</hi> where the Atlantick Ocean breaking into the inner Seas diffuseth it self. Whence it appeers, that the beginning of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> is placed in the <hi>Gaditan streight. Strabo</hi> likewise in his Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mography, and others of the most ancient and best Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers concur herin, among whom <hi>Nicephorus</hi> saith, <hi>In Hispania sedes fixerunt quae prima ab Hespero Regio est;</hi> And <hi>Lucius Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus Siculus,</hi> speaking of the situation of <hi>Spain,</hi> begins thus: <hi>Hispania sicuti Plinius alii<expan>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59014:80"/>

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s;</hi> And it may be provd by two Reasons that <hi>Spain</hi> is the Head, First, that since the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Orb is begirt with the Sea on all sides, the Sea cannot dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it self to visit other <hi>Regions</hi> but by the Regions of <hi>Spain,</hi> where the <hi>Gaditan</hi> Streight is as it were a Fountain, beginning and origine; where ther is a gate open, and whence as it were from a Head it derives it self through <hi>Europe,</hi> flowing one way into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and on the other side into the Ocean, and so protends it self to <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Afrik;</hi> insomuch that from this Head the other members proceed, and from this Spring other Seas flow out like Rivers, as <hi>Pliny</hi> commemorates in another place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it make infinitly for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he doth <hi>Lord</hi> over the New World where <hi>Asia, Afrik, Europe,</hi> and divers parts of the East, West, North and South do converse, and where <hi>Spain</hi> commands as Queen and <hi>Head,</hi> and reduceth dayly other Regions to the Catholik Faith as Members of that Head.</p>
               <p>It being thus provd that <hi>Spain</hi> is the <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> it remains to prove that it is the Noblest Region, and that it is a Kingdom then which the Sun doth not behold a more large and florishing; for whatsoever hath Nobleness, Wit or Splendor in it, she hath. Ther is not any thing that can be expected from Nature, Vertue and Fortune, but <hi>Spain</hi> hath it abundantly; she hath subdued most Noble Peeple, most Resolut Spirits, most Warlike Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by Wisdome as well as by Arms: Therfore <hi>Spain</hi> is to have Precedence after <hi>Italy</hi> of all other <hi>European</hi> Regions.

               <p>THe Philsopher beats still upon the Anvil of <hi>Reason</hi> to make his Conclusions good; The Mathematician by practical and visible Experiments brings his Conclusions to Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; The Jurists and Theologues do commonly make good their Tenets by Authority of the Ancients, by Examples of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; And indeed <hi>Responsa Patrum, Consulta Prudentum,</hi> have bin much reputed in all Ages; ther was always a venerable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious esteem had of them, so that it is held one of the strongest ways of disputing; therfore the dint of this second Argument shall be to produce the Authority of ancient Oecumenical Councils, that the Noble Kingdome of <hi>Spain</hi> hath had the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence from time to time of <hi>France,</hi> and consequently of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries.</p>
               <p>But let this previous Advertisement go before, That superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of session, and subscription in General Councils, hath bin diversly usd: For sometimes the Bishops have not subscribd, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken place, or given their suffrages in their own names, but in the name of the Province or Kingdom which they represented; and in that case ther is not so much regard had of the Person, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of Consecration, but the Dignity of the Nation, as it appeers in two Decrees of <hi>Gratianus:</hi> Therfore the Bishop of <hi>Milan</hi> did subscribe before him of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> though <hi>Ravenna</hi> be much the more ancient. This cours was observd in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, where the Bishops voted, and subscribd not according to Priority of Consecration, but Dignity of Provinces, and of the Souverain Prince who sent them. The like cours was taken in the first <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Council, and others. But as <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> observes, to sit on the <hi>Right-hand</hi> doth nor always imply su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of place; for he relates according to the ancient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Priests had sometimes the Right hand of the Bishops, as appeers by these words, <hi>Sedebunt ex locali dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitione ut intrantibus Ecclesiam Episcopi sint ad sinistram, Presbyteri verò ad dexteram; &amp; quando Pontifex sederit, &amp; ad eos respexerit, Episcopos ad dextram, Presbyteros intueatur ad sinistram:</hi> They shall sit by local disposition so, that in entring the Church the Bishops shall be on the Left hand, and the Priests on the Right; but when the Pope shall be sate, and looks upon them, the Bishops shall be on the Right, and the Priests on the Left.</p>
               <p>In the first Act of the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Chalcedonian</hi> Synod, it is left
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59014:82"/>
upon record that the <hi>Pontificial</hi> Legats sate on the Left hand, the <hi>Bible</hi> being placed in the middle of the Hall, which denoted that Christ was present and President. Moreover, in the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Masse the Epistle is read upon the Right hand, and the Gospel on the Left, though we know the Gospel to be the worthier of the two.</p>
               <p>This being premisd, we will now to the promised Authorities of ancient Councils. We read that in the time of the Apostles, and the very infancie of the Church, ther were four publik As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies or Councils; The first was of about 120 of the Faithful who met to elect and substitut <hi>Matthias</hi> to be Apostle in the room of <hi>Iudas.</hi> The second, was to choose Deacons, in whose num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the blessed Protomartyr St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was one. The third, was to confute <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the Heretique, and whether <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> was to continue. The fourth, was to give the <hi>Circumcision</hi> an honorable Burial. Now, it is to be observd, that before the two last were held, St. <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle had travelld <hi>Spain,</hi> and having reducd that Peeple to <hi>Christianity,</hi> he brought over some of them to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> who were in all probability present at those two last <hi>Councils:</hi> for in the Acts of the Apostles we read that all the Faithful were at them. Then was St. <hi>Iames</hi> the first Converter of <hi>Spain,</hi> made the first Martyr of all the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> being beheaded by <hi>Herod Agrippa,</hi> 44 <hi>Anno</hi> after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>It having appeerd that some <hi>Spaniards</hi> had bin at the first <hi>Councils</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> We will now pass to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, (pretermitting the <hi>Ancyritan</hi> and <hi>Illiberitan</hi> Synods, with others) Now, That of <hi>Nice</hi> was the first Universal or Oecumenical Council that ever was; for it was convokd by authority of the secular power the Emperour being then become <hi>Christian.</hi> This celebrous Council was in the time of Pope <hi>Sylvester</hi> 325. And as in the Acts it stands upon record, the Bishops therin did not subscribe according to antiquity of Consecration, but according to the Dignity and Renown of the <hi>Province</hi> for which they servd; <hi>Osius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cordoua</hi> servd then for <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Nicasius Divien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> for <hi>Gallia,</hi> but <hi>Osius</hi> subscribd first to the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and they are the first most authentik and legal <hi>Canons</hi> of any, for the Emperour did consent therunto. Now as the Record hath it, 318 Bishops subscribd to the Acts therof, which begin thus:</p>

                  <hi>Argum. 3.</hi> That the King of <hi>Spain</hi> may challenge Precedence, because <hi>Spain</hi> first receavd, and professd the Catholik Faith; That the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church was built there; The first Council was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated there; The first Bishop and the first Emperour was out of Her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THey who write of the Glory of Nations, shold in the first place look upon their antiquity and origine. Ther is a Topik Axiome, That <hi>Bonum quò antiquius eò melius;</hi> Therfore Antiquity conduceth much to the Honour and Dignity of a Peeple; As <hi>Pliny</hi> doth elegantly express, <hi>Reverere gloriam Veterum; nam hanc ipsam senectutem quae in Homine venerabilis, in Urbibus sacra est:</hi> Reverence the Glory of the Ancients, for that Old Age which is venerable in Man, is sacred in Cities.</p>
               <p>Touching the Originals of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of Her Inhabitants, with the propagation and succession of them, ther are four things to be considered in the enquiry therof; first, of what Peeple they first descended; what transmigrations they made; at what time; and by what Right or Title. These may be calld the principles of a Country. The <hi>Arcadians</hi> did vaunt that they were synchronical, or contemporary with the Gods; that they were before the Sun and the Stars. Other Nations do labour much to derive themselfs from before the Floud. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Spain,</hi> all Annalists concur that <hi>Tubal Cain</hi> was her first Populator, being allurd by the amoenity and fruitfulness of the Country and Clime; and this was 2173 years before the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of our Saviour, and 1179 from the Creation, and 143 years after the general Deluge. <hi>Berosus</hi> affirms that <hi>Tubal</hi> raignd in <hi>Spain</hi> 151 yeers, and <hi>Strabo</hi> concurs with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some call him <hi>Iobel,</hi> and <hi>Iosephus</hi> calls the <hi>Spaniards Iobeles</hi> from him. <hi>Setubal</hi> in <hi>Portugal</hi> receaves her denomination thence, as also <hi>Tudela</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Navarre.</hi> Some are of opinion that <hi>Noe</hi> came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to <hi>Spain,</hi> for in <hi>Asturia</hi> ther is a Town calld <hi>Noega,</hi> and <hi>Noela</hi> in <hi>Galicia. Spain</hi> was calld <hi>Iberia</hi> from King <hi>Iberus;</hi> and ther's a great River also of his name, vulgarly calld <hi>Ebro,</hi> wherin ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Rivers do disburden themselfs, which was the occasion of the Proverb, <hi>Me Llamo</hi> Ebro <hi>porque de todas aguas bevo.</hi> It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so calld <hi>Hesperia</hi> from the Occidental Star; At last it came to be calld <hi>Hispania</hi> from King <hi>Hispanus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will now proceed to prove that <hi>Spain</hi> receavd, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessd the Christian Religion first of any. And, as this Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our World is governd by the motion, and circumgyrations of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59014:85"/>
the Heavens, so Christian Kingdoms are governd by Religion and Faith, and by the holy Professors therof. Now, <hi>Spain</hi> had the advantage and honor to have the first Martyr among the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles for her Father and Founder, which was St. <hi>Iames,</hi> who though he was beheaded in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> yet his Body was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported to <hi>Spain</hi> by a wonderful Providence, where a stately Dome or Church is built for him, frequented by Emperours and Kings, with innumerable sorts of Pilgrims. <hi>Charlemain</hi> came of purpose to do his Devotions in that Church where such mighty miracles are daily wrought. Now in <hi>Tarragona</hi> the most blessed Virgin appeerd to St. <hi>Iames,</hi> and gave him order to erect a Church there, which is the ancientst of any in the Christian world.</p>
               <p>Moreover, for the predication of the Gospel, the hevenly ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of salvation, it began in <hi>Spain</hi> three yeers after the passion of Christ, as it is recorded in the Ecclesiastical History of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,</hi> and confirmd in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> with the whole current of Antiquity, so that it can be no less then an Impiety to make any hesitation therin.</p>
               <p>After the predication of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> also came to <hi>Spain;</hi> nay the Prince of the Apostles St. <hi>Peter</hi> performd a pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grination thither; and among others he converted <hi>Epinetus;</hi> so that the Christian Faith was founded in <hi>Spain</hi> by these three great Pillars of the Church. Saint <hi>Torquatus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Guadix</hi> was one of the first whom St. <hi>Iames</hi> reducd to Christ, and ther is an Olive-tree planted by his hand which bears fruit to this day; and the Bridg is yet remaining which broke and fell down under those who did poursue and persecure the Christians in those days.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Cecilius</hi> his Church neer <hi>Granada</hi> is standing to this day, where also so many miracles and wonderful cures are commonly wrought. There also is the famous <hi>Valparayso,</hi> the Valley of Paradise, where so many Martyrs sufferd, and their Reliques remain to this day, as appeers by this Record which I thought worthy to insert here.</p>

Besides these, ther was, after due process made, a sentence passd also for seven more great Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Secundus Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Abulensis,</hi> where his body is had in great reverence to this day; St. <hi>Indalecius Episcopus Urcetanus,</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> upon the confines of <hi>Navarre;</hi> St. <hi>Cthesiphon</hi> Bishop of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria;</hi> St. <hi>Hesichius; St. Euphrasius Episcopus Illurgitanus</hi> of <hi>Iaen</hi> in <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> who as <hi>Baronius</hi> affirms was Auditor and Disciple to St. <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle, and was ordained Bishop <hi>anno Christi</hi> 43. in the raign of <hi>Claudius Caesar.</hi> Besides these seven, ther is <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Theodorus</hi> neer the body of the holy Apostle, the one on the right, the other on the left hand of the Apostle, preserved with great vigilance to this day. Now, all these Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Patrons of <hi>Spain</hi> are mentioned by Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Galesinus</hi> in their Martyrologies, as also by <hi>Vaseus, Morales,</hi> and <hi>Mariana, &amp;c.</hi> Now, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was in <hi>Spain,</hi> hear what Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh saith in his Epistle: <hi>Gregorius Episcopus Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus servorum Dei, Alfonso, &amp; Sanctio Regibus Hispaniae, Abbatibus, &amp; Episcopis in ditione sua constitutis salutem, &amp; Apostolicam Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionem.

               <p>In the second persecution under <hi>Domitian,</hi> after the cruelties of <hi>Nero, Eugenius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Toledo</hi> was Disciple of <hi>Dionysius Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagita.</hi> This <hi>Eugenius</hi> being a man excellent for wisdome and Doctrine, made choice of the City of <hi>Toledo</hi> for his fear, as being situated in the centre of the Kingdome, that the Spirit of Christ might be diffusd thence as from the heart into the whole body of the Country. The Body of which <hi>Eugenius</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movd from <hi>France</hi> into the great Church of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and carried upon the sholders of the most religious King <hi>Philip</hi> 2 part of the way, <hi>Anno</hi> 1565.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it stands upon good record according to <hi>Mariana,</hi> how Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> St. <hi>Peters</hi> immediat Successor, sent <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> as Legats, and with Letters and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59014:87"/>
accordingly; And it is agreed by all that they were the first <hi>Legats,</hi> and they carried the first <hi>Letters</hi> that ever were sent from <hi>Rome</hi> by any <hi>Nuncios,</hi> which are to be found to this day in the Church of <hi>Compostella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third persecution of <hi>Trajan, Sanctus Mancius</hi> florishd in <hi>Spain,</hi> who was one of the seventy two Disciples of our Saviour, and servd him at administration of the Holy Sacrament, and spread his vestment when he entred into <hi>Ierusalem</hi> upon <hi>Palm-Sunday,</hi> who afterwards was made a glorious Martyr.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Ther is another Epistle of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> written to the Bishops of <hi>Spain,</hi> which is also conservd in <hi>Compostella</hi>-Church to this day. And this was the state of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Church the first cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury of yeers after the Nativity of Christ, wherin <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist livd, during which time thirteen Bishopricks are registred in <hi>Spain,</hi> and a great number of the Faithful; for in the City of <hi>Pampelona</hi> 40000 were converted, and <hi>Biscay</hi> or <hi>Cantabria</hi> was most inhabited by Martyrs, as <hi>Iraeneus</hi> relates, an Author who was neer the time of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, ther was a most signal and notable rare thing happend in <hi>Spain;</hi> for the same night that our blessed Saviour was born, ther were three Suns appeerd visibly in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Region, which by gentle degrees came to concentre into one.

               </head>
               <p>ONe of the greatest Foundations wheron <hi>France</hi> doth build her right to a Precedence, is, that she wold perswade the world, that her Kings are more <hi>Ancient</hi> both in the recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and profession of <hi>Christianity;</hi> which assertion being well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amind and discussd, it will appeer that both generally and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly ther were <hi>Catholik</hi> Kings in <hi>Spain</hi> before any in <hi>France;</hi> and to proceed more methodically, we will deduce the business from the beginning. We know that the blessed Apostle St. <hi>Iames</hi> was put to death with the sword by <hi>Herod,</hi> as appeers in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> touching his Martyrdome, and the translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Body into <hi>Spain;</hi> which Epistle he destinated for the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> wherin He relates, that when the <hi>Iews</hi> had hurld his whole body without the City to be devourd by Beasts and Birds, his Disciples having notice therof in his life-time, they recoverd the whole body, head and all, in the night-time, and carried it to <hi>Ioppa</hi> for transportation of it to <hi>Spain;</hi> where being careful for the embarcation therof, they found a ship ready in the Port, and some say it was of stone, where, after thanks being given to God, they placd the body of the most holy Apostle; and after many dangers they arrivd at <hi>Iria Flaria,</hi> now calld <hi>Padron;</hi> thence they carried it to <hi>Liberum Donum,</hi> now calld <hi>Compostella,</hi> where they entombd it in a Marble Monument: But, as the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were seeking for a place fit for so great an <hi>Apostle,</hi> they made their address to Queen <hi>Luparia</hi> or <hi>Lupa,</hi> who sent them to King <hi>Philotrus,</hi> who casting them into an obscure prison, they were freed by an Angel; and while the soldiers were in pursute of them, they were all drownd in a River, the Bridg and all falling down with them, by which miracle King <hi>Philotrus</hi> was converted. But <hi>Luparia</hi> continuing obstinat, she threw their Bodies to Bulls and Dragons, wherof some they slew, and some grew mild. Then <hi>Luparia</hi> being orecome by these miracles, causd a Temple to be erected there for the holy Apostle, as <hi>Faber</hi> out of <hi>Sophorinus</hi> doth affirm; And although <hi>Morales</hi> makes a doubt herof, in regard that <hi>Spain</hi> was then subject to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and so could have no Kings, yet ther might be some Kings there though subject and tributary to <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Herodes Agrippa</hi> was in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and as Queen <hi>Candacis</hi> was. But because these passages are so overgrown with yeers, let us hasten to later times.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59014:88"/>The second signal time that <hi>Spain</hi> receavd extraordinary influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christian Faith, was in the raign of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, who was so glorious an Instrument to the Church, his Mother, a <hi>British</hi> Lady being a <hi>Christian,</hi> and <hi>Osius</hi> a Spanish Bishop ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken so much pains for his conversion; Then <hi>Theodosius</hi> who did propagat the Faith more openly, and did destroy the <hi>Pagan</hi> Churches which were stuffd with Idols, was by Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and his sons who succeeded him in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>The third time was, when the seat of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing translated to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> divers rough Northern Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons broke in, and seazd upon most parts of the Western Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries therof, so that the <hi>Goths</hi> invaded <hi>Spain,</hi> and came to possess it; and then by the special benediction of God, ther was a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik King in <hi>Spain</hi> before any in <hi>France:</hi> For <hi>an.</hi> 554. <hi>Athanagil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> according to the currant consent of all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiographers, professd the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> as <hi>Lucas Tudensis</hi> hath it.

                     </gap>dus;</hi> Then a little after came <hi>Richaredus,</hi> and in his raign the whole Kingdome of <hi>Spain</hi> became <hi>Catholik,</hi> and florishd exceedingly.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>French</hi> object that <hi>Anno</hi> 496. <hi>Clodovaeus</hi> was baptizd by St. <hi>Rhemigius,</hi> and so had the start of <hi>Richaredus</hi> in Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but to that tis answerd, That the whole Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> was not then converted; Nor was He King of all the Kingdome, as <hi>Richaredus</hi> was of <hi>Spain:</hi> For <hi>Gregorius Turonen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> relates, that <hi>Clodovaeus</hi> with his two sisters were baptizd, and three thousand <hi>French</hi> more, the whole Kingdome came not to be Christian a good while after, wheras all <hi>Spain</hi> was reducd entirely to the Faith a good while before, and did make open profession therof in the Council of <hi>Toledo.</hi> Moreover, a good part of <hi>France</hi> was then subject to <hi>Theodoricus</hi> King of the <hi>Ostro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goths,</hi> who then raignd in <hi>Italy;</hi> who were of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie. But <hi>Spain</hi> was then totally under <hi>Richaredus:</hi> whence may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrd that <hi>Spain</hi> generally had a <hi>Christian</hi> King before <hi>France.</hi> But if we divide <hi>Spain</hi> into Provinces, ther were divers of them had Christianity planted, and publiquely preferrd before <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis;</hi> for <hi>Rechiarius</hi> King of the <hi>Suevians</hi> was <hi>Christian Anno</hi> 440. Furthermore, tis very observable that from <hi>Richaredus</hi> no King in <hi>Spain</hi> fell from the true Catholick Church; wheras, divers in <hi>France</hi> did after <hi>Clodoveus,</hi> as <hi>Chilperik</hi> and others; witness what <hi>Gaguinus</hi> writes, <hi>Nec multò post Chilpericus cujus malitia ut in Homines multis fraudibus perspicua esset, in Deum quo<expan>

               </p>
               <p>And in this last Age, the last King of <hi>France</hi> before <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. having done some acts of Impiety, as imprisoning of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and other things, it induced a Brother of the <hi>Dominican</hi> Order to dispatch him violently out of the world.</p>
               <p>Besides, a King of <hi>Spain Rechiarius</hi> was the first, who out of a Zeal to protect the tru Religion, made the first War against the Enemies therof, which were the <hi>Arrian Goths;</hi> and ever since the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have bin the greatest Champions and Propugnators of the Catholik Church upon all occasions.</p>
               <p>But now we will take in hand the Titles of <hi>Christianissimus</hi> and <hi>Catholik,</hi> and make it appeer that the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> had the one, before the <hi>French</hi> Kings had the other; and because that <hi>Names are the Images of Things,</hi> we will give you their primitive derivations.</p>
               <p>The first Propagators of <hi>Christianity</hi> we all know were the holy <hi>Apostles,</hi> and their <hi>Disciples;</hi> but some of the latter falling into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, the Orthodoxal <hi>Disciples</hi> to distinguish themselfs from the false, calld themselfs <hi>Christians,</hi> which name they first assumd at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and then it grew general, being derivd from <hi>Christ,</hi> and Christ a Crismate or Unction. It was afterwards raisd to a superlatif, to <hi>Christianissimus,</hi> which was first given to the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> and to this day, as <hi>Castaldus</hi> observes, they are solemnly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>in Oratione Parasceue,</hi> in Good-Friday-Prayer evry yeer, <hi>Oremus &amp; pro Christianissimo Imperatore nostro;</hi> wherin <hi>Ferrault</hi> is deceavd by attributing it onely to the <hi>French King.</hi> Moreover, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> had that <hi>Title</hi> given them upon oceasion, as all the <hi>Spanish</hi> Annalists do aver; For <hi>Richaredus</hi> was calld <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissimus Anno</hi> 589. and after him <hi>Sisebutus Anno</hi> 616. when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelld the <hi>Iews</hi> out of the Territories of <hi>Spain;</hi> and <hi>Cinthillanus</hi> is calld so in the sixth Council of <hi>Toledo;</hi> and Pope <hi>Leo</hi> writing to <hi>Quirico</hi> calls <hi>Flavium Ervigium</hi> then King of <hi>Spain, Christianissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum</hi> in the fourth Council of <hi>Toledo;</hi> and this was before <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemain,</hi> who first bore that Title in <hi>France. Ramirus</hi> King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> 3. as also <hi>Alphonsus Magnus,</hi> was entitled so.</p>
               <p>Now let us examine when this Title <hi>Christianissimus</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>French</hi> Kings: Most do affirm that it began in <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> but observe, it was given him, and to some of his Successors as they were <hi>Emperours:</hi> for the ordinary Title which was usd
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59014:89"/>
to be given the Kings of <hi>France</hi> before, was <hi>Illustris.</hi> Ther is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother opinion, that Pope <hi>Pius</hi> 2. gave <hi>Lewis</hi> 11. of <hi>France</hi> the Title of <hi>Christianissimus,</hi> and that his Father <hi>Charles</hi> had it in the Council of <hi>Mantua Anno</hi> 1459.</p>
               <p>But grant that the <hi>French</hi> Kings had the Title <hi>Christianissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> given them since <hi>Charlemain,</hi> yet the Title <hi>Catholicus</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before to the Kings of <hi>Spain:</hi> For <hi>Alfonso</hi> Son-in-law to <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> had it <hi>Anno</hi> 734. as <hi>Garabai</hi> and <hi>Morales</hi> do affirm, and the Epitaph upon his Tomb doth justifie it, which is <hi>Alfonsus Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus.</hi> Others are of opinion that <hi>Richaredus</hi> who quelld the <hi>Arrian Heresie</hi> was first intitled <hi>Catholicus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now that we have spoken of the Antiquity of these two Titles in relation to the two Kings, we will examine which is the superior and more excellent, <hi>Christianissimus</hi> or <hi>Catholicus,</hi> not but that both of them are sublime and glorious. Touching the Title <hi>Catholik,</hi> it is so complete a word that nothing can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, therfore it admits no <hi>superlatif;</hi> it is of that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensif latitude, that it is <hi>Universal,</hi> which is the tru Etymologie of the Greek word: now it is an Axiome in all Sciences, <hi>Qui totum dicit, nihil excludit;</hi> Who says All, excludes nothing: therfore we say, <hi>Ecclesiam Catholicam,</hi> not <hi>Catholicissimam;</hi> as we say, <hi>Concilium oecumenicum,</hi> or <hi>Universale,</hi> not <hi>Universalissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly this word <hi>Catholicum</hi> must be of extraordinary value, and ancient extraction, since it was an Epithet given the Church of Christ in the Apostolical Creed, in that first Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole of Faith, <hi>Credo in Spiritum sanctum, &amp; sanctam Ecclesiam Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicam.</hi> Now, as we pointed at before, wheras any Beleever was calld <hi>Christian</hi> at first, and that by erroneous interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, some Heresies began to creep in, the name of <hi>Catholik</hi> was given <hi>him</hi> who was a constant embracer of the tru Doctrine of the <hi>Church:</hi> wheras the simple name <hi>Christian</hi> might comprehend also a Heretik, as <hi>Pacianus</hi> observes against the <hi>Novatians, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus mihi nomen est, Catholicus vero cognomen; Illud me nuncupat, Istud ostendit; Hoc probat, Illud significat:</hi> My name is <hi>Christian,</hi> my firname <hi>Catholik;</hi> the one calls me, the other shews me; this proves, the other signifies. Insomuch that the word <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik</hi> did distinguish a tru Beleever from a Heretik. Whence the excellencie of this word appeers, being a primitive attribut given both to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> for they were both calld <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik.</hi> Nor doth it follow though evry <hi>Catholik</hi> be a <hi>Christian,</hi> that evry <hi>Christian</hi> is a <hi>Catholik:</hi> For when one is calld <hi>Catholik,</hi> tis understood that he is an Elect, that he is saithful, pure, constant and obedient to the Doctrine of the holy Church without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or taint: Therfore most meritoriously is this high Epithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>MUltitude of Regions, Affluence of Wealth, and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Power, is so considerable in Kings, that this one Reason of it self were sufficient by Divine Laws as well as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, to yeeld unto <hi>Him</hi> who excels in these Particulars supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of session and precedence.</p>
               <p>Now, in all things by the very constitution of the Creator, ther is a superiority and excellence; Eternity is above Time; The Intellect is beyond Reason; and Reason above Sense. Go to the Fabrick of Coelestial Cretures, and the pulchritude of the Stars; We see the Sun is as their Prince; and one Star exceeds another in glory: so in this Elementary and the lower world, specially among Mankind, some are more Illustrious, some more Potent then others; Nature will tell you that all the Fingers of the hand are not equal; and this inequality conduceth to the bewty of the Univers, and <hi>Manilius</hi> tells us,</p>
               <q>Est aequale nihil, Terrenos aspice tractus.</q>
               <p>By which Ratiocination he is most sublime, and may claim superiority who exceeds in multitude of Peeple, in extent of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, in Wealth and Dominions; and since the <hi>Catholik</hi> King excels in all these, as the <hi>French</hi> Authors themselfs confess out of <hi>Cassanaeus,</hi> certainly the higher seat is to be assignd Him. The wisest of Kings tells us, that <hi>In multitudine Populi dignitas Reg is, &amp; in paucitate Plebis ignominia Principis;</hi> In the multitude consists the dignity of a King, and in the paucity of peeple his shame. Therfore at the meeting of Councils, an <hi>Universal</hi> Council which is made up of most Bishops is more illustrious, and carrieth a greater stamp of authority then a Provincial, which consisteth

               <p>Now, to prove that the Catholik King is more potent then any other in spacious Dominions, it is no hard task: For go to <hi>Spain</hi> it self, it cannot be denied but it is a large Empire.

               </p>
               <p>O Immortal God! what an heroik and incomparable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit was that of discovering and conquering the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> which counterbalanceth all the old world were they cast into a pair of scales! which mighty benediction was reservd by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence for <hi>Spain.</hi> But what a world of dangers, doubts and difficulties did precede the work! On the one side the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certitude of the Thing, and the perils of the angry-tumbling O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean did offer themsells; On the other side the vast expences of the Viage, with despair of new provision when the old was spent; And in case they shold take sooting on a new earth, the Clime might perhaps not agree with their bodies, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages might prove stronger then they, as they were in number above a thousand for one. Tis tru, that such imaginations as these did much distract them a while; but at last their courage and constancy was such, that they broke through all these dissi culties. And touching that huge mass of peeple in <hi>America,</hi> as a wild boistrous Boar taken within the toyls doth foam, strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and turn about to try all ways how he may get out, at last when all will not serve, and having wasted his spirits he lies down with quietness and despair, putting himself upon the mercy of the Huntsmen; so the wild <hi>American</hi> having tryed all ways of opposition, lay down at last succumbent and prostrat at the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> feet; and for a reward of their indefatigable pains and prowess, the Divine Providence gave them afterwards Mines and Mountains of Tresure, yea, Rivers running with Gold, Seas full of Perl, with all sorts of Gems and precious stones; all kind

               <p>But what Exchanges and recompence did <hi>Spain</hi> make to <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> for all this?

It is recorded by <hi>Boterus</hi> that one <hi>Franciscan</hi> Fryar did baptise about 400000 Savages in the sacred Laver of Regeneration; insomuch that one may now travel thousands of miles in <hi>America,</hi> and very frequently meet with Christian Churches, Chappels, Monasteries, Convents, Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries, Towns, Villages, Castles, Forts, or Bulwarks as he goes along.</p>
               <p>What a coyle do the Historians keep about the Achievements of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great? We well know that he subdued but part of <hi>Asia;</hi> But here a new world is conquerd about thrice as big as whole <hi>Asia:</hi> Therfore the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> may be only said to have done Miracles in steed of Exploits. And as God Al mighty when He builds, creates no less then a World; when <hi>He</hi> is angry, sends no less then an Universal Deluge; when <hi>He</hi> confers Grace, doth sacrifice no less then the prime Son; when <hi>He</hi> rewards, gives no less then Paradis; when <hi>He</hi> wars, sends no less then Legions of Angels, making also the Elements to fight, the Sea to open, and the Sun to stand: So, if Finite things may bear any proportion with Infinit, the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have bin desigud to do mighty things, if not miracles: when They build, they build no less then an <hi>Escurial;</hi> if They are angry, they drive forth whole Nations, as the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Moors;</hi> if they provide for the publick good, they sacrifice no less then their own <hi>Sons;</hi> if they take Arms, they conquer not only whole Kingdoms, but new Worlds: insomuch that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> may be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proverb, truly called <hi>Rex Hominum,</hi> the King of Men; wheras those of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> are calld, the first, <hi>King of Devils,</hi> the other King of Asses.

               <p>Therfore it can be no derogation from any other <hi>Monark,</hi> if for Glory and Amplitude of Dominions, for Men and Mines, for fulgor of Majesty and Power, for Islands and Continents,

               <p>NObility among the Heralds is of two sorts, the one is of Parental Extraction and Blood, and this is rather our Progenitors then our own, being ingrafted or traducd unto us from them: Ther is another Nobility which is accidental, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derivd or personal, and this comes either from abundance of Riches, or from excellency of Parts, or from the Merit and Glory of some great Exploit. The first proceeds from <hi>Descent,</hi> the other from <hi>Desert.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now among other Prerogatives of Kings, one of the highest is, that they are the source and fountain of Nobility and Honor; Therfore no Vassal whatsoever, be he of never so ancient and illustrious extraction, is capable to compare with the King, though I am not ignorant that some of your <hi>French Monsieurs</hi> will vapor somtimes that way. Now, it contributs much to the honor of any Country to have a King of a long-lind Royal Race. There is a good Text which tells us, That <hi>Beata Terra, cujus Rex nobilis est;</hi> with another, <hi>Quàm puchra est generatio cum claritate, Immortalis enim est memoria illius, quoniam, &amp; apud Deum nota est, &amp; apud Homines:</hi> The Land is blessd whose King is Noble; How beutiful is a Generation with brightness! the memory therof is Immortal, because tis known with God and Men.</p>
               <p>The Kingdome of <hi>Spain</hi> may glory to have had Kings of both the foresaid Nobilities, both <hi>Progenial</hi> derivd from their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, and <hi>Personal</hi> from their own Merit, and heroik perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Vertue, as Magnanimity and Fortitude, as Prudence and high Wisdome, as extraordinary Devotion and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>Touching the Royal Tree of the Genealogie of the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> we can fetch it from the Families of the <hi>Amalis</hi> and <hi>Baltheis,</hi> whence the Kings of the <hi>Visigoths</hi> and <hi>Ostrogoths</hi> descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded above a thousand yeers since: Then from the glorious house of <hi>Austria,</hi> which may be calld a tru <hi>Imperial Tree</hi> by having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducd so many Emperours that have continued in that stem above these two hundred years without interruption, which House began with <hi>Theobarto</hi> who came from <hi>Sigebart</hi> Duke of <hi>Germany, Anno</hi> 604.</p>

               <p>But grant that <hi>France</hi> hath reason to give the Lilies or Flower de Luces for her Royal Arms, yet <hi>Spain</hi> hath a nobler; for <hi>Spain</hi> gives the <hi>Crosse</hi> in her Shield: For we know that many ancient and Authentik Writers affirm, how the <hi>Cantabrians</hi> or <hi>Biscay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> (who were left unconquerd by the <hi>Romans</hi>) carried a <hi>Crosse</hi> in their Banner long before the Nativity of our Saviour; which <hi>King Pelagius</hi> carried when issuing forth of the great Cave calld <hi>Cobadonga</hi> to this day, with not much above 1000 <hi>Christians,</hi> he utterly routed 60000 <hi>Saracens;</hi> to the memory wherof tis thought the great Church <hi>Cangas</hi> calld St. <hi>Crosses Church</hi> was erected, where he lieth buried with a Crosse ingraven upon his Tomb. And after <hi>King Pelagius</hi> who is calld the <hi>Instaurator</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> with other <hi>Kings</hi> had the Crosse in their Banner. And <hi>San Isodorus,</hi> who after St. <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle is the Patron of <hi>Spain,</hi> always usd it, who was a Bishop and a Knight, so that wheresoever he is represented either in shadow or stone, he is painted in a Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical vest, having the <hi>Crosse</hi> in one hand, and the <hi>Sword</hi> in the other; and as the <hi>Oriflambe</hi> is the chiefest Banner of <hi>France,</hi> which is kept in the great Church of St. <hi>Denis;</hi> so in the great Church of <hi>Leon</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> Saint <hi>Isodorus</hi> Banner is devoutly kept up, which upon occasion of urgent necessity was usd by divers <hi>Kings</hi> to be brought to the Field against the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards against the <hi>Moores,</hi> wherby many glorious and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Victories were obtaind.</p>

This signal <hi>Diploma,</hi> or publick Protestation is yet to be seen in the Archives of <hi>Spain,</hi> and is mentiond in the History of <hi>Pedro Mexia,</hi> which runs thus.</p>

               <p>This Royal <hi>Manifesto,</hi> or Pragmatical Sanction you see doth assert the absolut and independent Authority of the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that they do not only renounce all subordinations, but are free from the least acknowledgment to any Forren Power: insomuch that it is enacted by the Laws of <hi>Spain,</hi> that to avoid the least suspition of any obedience to the <hi>Empire,</hi> the Civil <hi>Roman</hi> Law is not to be kept, or alledgd as Law. Nor indeed for driving out the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and other Infidels was <hi>Spain</hi> ever obligd to the Empire, or any other Extrinsik Power, but she did it by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of her own blood, by the strength and valour of her own Natives.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> are so far from any recognition of subjection to the Empire, or any outward power, that they themselfs in former Ages have bin frequently called <hi>Emperours</hi> in publik Instruments, as Decretals, Acts of Councils, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Epistles from <hi>Rome.</hi> Now if they did merit to be calld <hi>Emperours</hi> then, how much more is that Title adaequat to the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> in these latter times, wherin they are grown to be Lords of above half of the whole Terrestrial Globe?</p>
               <p>Nor is the King of <hi>Spain</hi> thus exempt from all Forren extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Authority, but in point of intrinsecal and domestik Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he is as absolut as any other: for it hath not bin found this hundred yeers that his Subjects did refuse the payment of any Impositions, which have bin many in regard he wars with all the world who repine at his Greatness.

               <p>THer are three Offices which all Christian Kings are bound to perform towards the holy Church.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>The first is, To obey the Precepts, Canons and Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church, though it be only by an humble implicit Faith.</item>
                  <item>The second is, To protect and defend the holy Church not only from Infidels, and open Enemies, but from Heretiks and Scismatiks.</item>
                  <item>The third is, To erect Temples and decent Domes of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the service and worship of God, and to bewtifie and enrich them accordingly with Rents and Ornaments.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have bin more renownd for these three then any in <hi>Christendome.</hi> Touching the first, Ther is no King or Souverain Prince whatsoever hath bin or is so exactly obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Canonical Laws, and the Constitutions, Commands and Sanctions of the Church, as the Catholik King is known to be. Ther are no Kings that do more <hi>Corporal Penances</hi> when they are laid upon them by their Ghostly Fathers: For that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Whip which <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth usd, and left all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smeard with his own Blood, is usd often by this King, wherby he mingles his Blood with that of his great Granfather, besides that of his Granfather and Father; which Penitential Whip is the most precious Legacie that the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> use to leave their Sons upon their Death-beds, and is like so to continue to all Posterity.</p>
               <p>Touching the second Office for protecting the holy Church as well from Aposta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s and Scismatiks as from open Enemies, I may well say without any derogation, that ther is no King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the Catholik King. <hi>Spain</hi> did cleer her self with admired Valour and Prudence of three Nations that were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Christian Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Saracens,</hi> the <hi>Moors,</hi> and the <hi>Iews:</hi> And the Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>olik King always bore such a high reverence to the holy Church, that they never got any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Victory but they sent the Trophies therof to the Vicar of Christ. I will produce one signal example: When King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bohazin Belamarin</hi> had invaded <hi>Spain</hi> with a mighty Fleet, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sporting 20000 Horse, and 400000 Foot, the King of <hi>Granada</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:59014:95"/>
joyning with him also, with all the <hi>Moriscos</hi> that were yet left in <hi>Spain,</hi> He first besiegd <hi>Tarifa,</hi> but <hi>Alfonso</hi> the eleventh King of <hi>Castile,</hi> with <hi>Alfonso</hi> King of <hi>Portugal</hi> did comport themselfs with such admired Courage and Magnanimity, having no Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from any other Christian Nation, but a pure Army of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> that they obtaind a wonderful and glorious Victory, so that above 200000 <hi>Moors</hi> were destroyed in fight and flight, the rest made all slaves, as <hi>Mariana</hi> and <hi>Zurita</hi> make particular mention in their Chronicles. As soon as the triumphs for so blessd a Victory were ended in <hi>Spain,</hi> King <hi>Alfonso</hi> sent a splendid Embassy by Don <hi>Iuan de Leiva</hi> to Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> II. then keeping the Apostolik Seat at <hi>Auignon</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> which Ambassador presented his Holiness with a great Banner, and four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the chiefest Colours they had taken from the <hi>Moors.</hi> Ther were presented besides 100 Barb Horses with rich saddles, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Shields, Swords and Javelins were hung, and evry horse had a <hi>Marisco</hi> slave to attend him. Then the very Ginet wheron King <hi>Alfonso</hi> himself did ride when he got the Field, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented with rich Caparisons embroderd with Perl. The Pope having notice herof, sent all the Cardinals, with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Prelats to meet the Ambassador; who being conducted to the Pope, he descended from the Pontifical Throne, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Kings Banner into his hands, he sang with a loud voice, <hi>Vexilla Regis prodeunt, Fulget Christi mysterium:</hi> so making a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetik elegant speech of so glorious an Exploit, they went all to the great Church to give God the glory, where the said Colours, Ensignes and Shields were hung up.</p>
               <p>I could bring many instances more of this nature, how highly respectful the Catholik Kings have bin always of the holy Church, and of her chief Governor in all Ages; and how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they have bin to sacrifice their bloods in defence of her. But let us go to these modern times, we know that his Catholik Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty is in perpetual feud with the Common Enemy the <hi>Turk,</hi> and how he still disdaind to make a Peace with him though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wooed therunto, wheras other Kings make not only a Peace but Confederacies with him ever and anon. We know what a professd eager Enemy the Catholik King is to all Heretiks, how he suffers none to breathe in his Dominions; How ready he is always to suppress them in defence of the Catholik Church, and St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair, which by the supplantings and Machinations of the late Apostats had quite fallen down, unless the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik King had reachd his arms to support and bear it up.</p>
               <p>Touching the third Office of a Christian King, which is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Temples, and hansome places for the worship of Almighty God, no Kings have bin more pious and munificent in that kind: Witness that mighty Monument the Royal Monastery of St.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59014:95"/>
                  <hi>Laurence</hi> at the <hi>Escurial,</hi> a Monument built to Eternity, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ug with the Iron teeth of time, as the thickness and solidity of the walls do shew. This one stupendous Monument of Piety, which is worthily accounted the eighth Wonder of the World, wold afford matter for one entire Volume of it self: Let it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to know here that it cost above twenty Millions the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: It was twenty years before it was finishd; yet the Founder <hi>Philip</hi> the second, of eternal memory, enjoyd it twelve yeers after, and at last carried his own bones to be interrd in that glorious <hi>Pantheon</hi> he had expresly causd to be built for that use. What a world of Religious Houses did this pious Prince erect besides I for in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America</hi> he built upon his own charge above a hundred Churches, Monasteries, and Hospitals. Now, it is a great matter for other Kings if they build a College, or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and are prayed for as great Benefactors; then I pray what Prayers and Praises doth such a King deserve as <hi>Philip the Prudent</hi> was!</p>

               <p>IT is recorded, That when Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth was sick, it was told him that he was much prayed for, in regard his Life so much concernd the welfare of the Church: He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerd, <hi>Helas, the prolongation of any Life can little avail the Catholik Church; but pray for the health of King</hi> Philip, <hi>for his Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Her more.</hi>

               <p>Now, <hi>Spain</hi> hath been always renowned not only for prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of the Church, and conquering of Infidels, but also for converting of Hereticks.

               <p>Moreover, ther have bin no Kings so eminently liberal, and munificent to the holy House of God, together with their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors and Ministers, as the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have bin in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; insomuch that a computation hath bin made, that well neer the third part of <hi>Spain</hi> are spiritual Revenues, and the third part of the Churches have bin founded by Kings. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Toledo</hi> is the greatest Ecclesiastical Dignity in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome next the <hi>Papacy;</hi> for it hath above 300000 Crowns annual Revenues, which countervails three of the best Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopriks in <hi>France.</hi> Nor have the <hi>Catholik</hi> Kings thought it any derogation to make their Sons Archbishops of that <hi>place,</hi> and Chancellors of <hi>Castile.</hi>

                  <hi>1 Paragraph,</hi> Touching the derivation and Etymologie of this word <hi>Ambassador;</hi> With the Definition, Division, and Denomination of Ambassadors and Legats.</head>
               <p>NEither Don <hi>Antonio de Zuniga</hi> the Spaniard, nor Doctor <hi>Gasparo Bragaccia</hi> the Italian, with divers others who have written so largely of an <hi>Ambassador,</hi> do let us know what the <hi>Word</hi> is, either <hi>Ambassadeur, Ambasciatore, Embaxador,</hi> or <hi>Ambascia.</hi> Now we find them all to be of great Antiquity, for they are derivd of an old <hi>Celtik</hi> or <hi>Gaulish</hi> word; which <hi>Celtiks</hi> were before the <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Latins,</hi> a Peeple that dwelt where <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France</hi> now stands, being calld so before the <hi>Romans</hi> or the <hi>Franconians</hi> came in. Now <hi>Embassy</hi> or <hi>Ambascy</hi> comes of <hi>Ambachten,</hi> which is to work; and <hi>Ambacht</hi> was a servant in the old <hi>Gaulik</hi> or <hi>Celtik</hi> toung, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto alludes <hi>Bachken,</hi> usd yet in <hi>Wales</hi> for a servant; wherby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong divers other Arguments it is very probable that the ancient <hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> spake one Language originally; From hence came <hi>Ambactus</hi> which <hi>Tacitus</hi> useth, when he saith, That <hi>Galli plurimos circumse Ambactos Clientes<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> habent.</hi> So that <hi>Ambasciator</hi> derivd hence, is come now to be a servant, or Minister of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; for in some Translations we have <hi>Paulus Dei gratia Diaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, &amp; Ambasciator:</hi> Insomuch that it may well extend to the holy Function of <hi>Priests:</hi> For the Minister on the Desk may be said to be the <hi>Peeples Ambassador</hi> to God, and in the Pulpit <hi>Gods Ambassador</hi> to the Peeple. But the Italians wold have <hi>Ambasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atore</hi> to come from the old <hi>Hetruscan</hi> word <hi>Bascer,</hi> which signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dth <hi>nunciare,</hi> to report or declare. Others have a conceit that it may come from the word <hi>Ambo,</hi> because he is a Mediator twixt both Parties.</p>
               <p>Now, touching the Definition of an Ambassador, or Legat, Don <hi>Antonio de Zuniga,</hi> defines him thus: <hi>A Legat or Ambassador is a Conciliator of the Affairs of Princes; A Man sent from far to treat of publik Concernments by particular Election, not by strength and stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems of War, but by Eloquence and force of Wit.</hi> Others define him to be <hi>a Subject who resembleth a Mediator of Love.</hi> Concerning the word <hi>Legat, Resoldus</hi> tells us in brief, that <hi>He is one who is sent to deliver the Commands of another:</hi> but none of these can be calld properly <hi>Definitions</hi> according to the Rules of Logik, but <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions.</hi> They are calld sometimes <hi>Orators,</hi> from <hi>Oracion,</hi> or the fluency of the Toung, which is the chiefest tool of an <hi>Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador.</hi> They are calld also <hi>Nuncii,</hi> because they come to declare and tell. Now, <hi>Nuncii</hi> and <hi>Legats</hi> are of late Ages they whom the <hi>Popa</hi> sends, whose Ministers of this kind have a mixt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment

twixt Spiritual and Secular. <hi>Legats</hi> are of three sorts, ther is <hi>Legatus Natus, Legatus Missus,</hi> and <hi>Legatus à Latere:</hi> The first hath a perpetual successif Legantine Power, as the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> is endowed with that Prerogative as a Dignity annexd to the Archbishoprik above 1000 years since; therfore ther can no other Legats come to <hi>England</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kings special consent: wherupon one of the Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> was, That he exercised a Legantine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in <hi>England</hi> without the Kings privity. Then ther is <hi>Legatus Missus,</hi> and he signifieth as much as an ordinary <hi>Nuncio.</hi> Then ther is <hi>Legatus à Latere,</hi> or <hi>Apostolical Nuncio,</hi> who is desumd out of the number of <hi>Cardinals</hi> only, and they are sometimes G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>We may read in <hi>Iustine</hi> that Ambassadors by some are calld <hi>Lenones</hi> Bawds, (but taken in a chast sense) because by smooth and alluring Language they move the affections of the Prince to whom they are sent. The <hi>Greeks</hi> call their Ambassadors <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because they ought to be of yeers, and well salted in the world. Ther are also Deputies and Commissaries who have the same Office as Ambassadors; but the Civilians make this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them, that Ambassadors are sent to Equals, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to Superiors, and Commissaries to Inferiors.</p>
               <p>Ther is also a publik Minister of State calld <hi>Agent;</hi> and he is sent when ther is a suspition that the <hi>Ambassador</hi> will not be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nord as he shold be. Therfore the <hi>French</hi> Kings of late yeers have no <hi>Ambassadors</hi> in the Emperors Court, but <hi>Agents,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Competition for <hi>Precedence</hi> twixt him and <hi>Spain.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents are likewise employd sometimes to save charges, or that the Business may be done without noise. Ahd of late yeers ther is a new Minister of State invented, which is a <hi>Resident,</hi> who is superiour to an <hi>Agent,</hi> and inferiour to an <hi>Ambassador.</hi> Both <hi>Agent</hi> and <hi>Resident</hi> have the <hi>Security,</hi> though not the Session and state, or such a latitude of power as Ambassadors have: Now, <hi>Agents</hi> may dispatch Businesses of as great consequence as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, though they do it more secretly, and with lesse stir. Therfore <hi>Hottoman</hi> saith, That the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> had <hi>des Agens Secrets</hi> in <hi>Venice,</hi> because that in regard of diversity of Religion, the Senat wold not seem to make too strict a frendship with them; and for these secret Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Merchants</hi> have bin thought to be the fittest Instruments, because under the cloak of Trading they may also hide Affairs of State.</p>
               <p>Ther are also <hi>Heralds</hi> which are a sort of Ambassadors, and they are very ancient; They are calld <hi>Caduceatores,</hi> whose Office
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59014:100"/>
is to denounce War: for such was the open honesty of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, that they would not commence a War until they had sent notice of it in a convenient time beforehand; and these had also the security of <hi>Ambassadors</hi> for the time, but they were strictly tied to the very same words that were dictated unto them. Their persons also are to be as free from any outrage as Ambassadors are, which made the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> check his soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in <hi>Keinton</hi>-field when the late King sent Sir <hi>William le Neve</hi> King of Arms the next morning after the Battail was sought; who wold have outragd Him. Ther are also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ministers of State that draw neer to the nature of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,</hi> which are calld <hi>Consuls,</hi> wherof some have Royal Commission, though the nature of their Office be to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and assist the Merchant, being practisd in the Custome and Language of the Country, in their Law-suits; and ther is as much esteem had of these as of <hi>Agents.</hi> Of these <hi>England</hi> hath more then any, and they are allowd very noble allowance; as he of <hi>Aleppo</hi> hath 4000 Dollars yeerly, and they of <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Mosco</hi> little less: but if ther be an Ambassador in that Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion where they serve, they are subordinat to his commands in divers things.</p>
               <p>We will conclude this Paragraph with this distinction of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,</hi> That some are extraordinary or <hi>pro tempore</hi> employd upon some particular great Affairs, or Condolements, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations, or for Overtures of Marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they use to go with greater lustre and magnificence, and may return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sending for leave, unless ther be a restraining clause in their Commission. The other are Ordinary or Lidger <hi>Ambassadors</hi> commanded to <hi>reside</hi> in the place until they receave Letters of Revocation; and as their time of return is indefinit, so their business is incertain, arising out of emergent occasions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the protection and affairs of the Merchants is their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est care. But <hi>Albericus Gentilis,</hi> with all the great Civilians, alledge that these kinde of <hi>Ambassadors</hi> were not known but of late yeers, and <hi>Paschalius</hi> calls them no better then Emissaries, Explorators or Spyes, which made <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. of <hi>England,</hi> as he saith, admit of none.</p>

               <p>It is observd in all stories, and confirmd by multitude of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, that the Interview and encounter of Kings hath bin ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a disadvantage then an advance to any great business, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in treating of Capitulations of Peace. Therfore in the Politiks tis a Principle, that in Colloquies for Pacification Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces shold not appeer in person, but be represented by their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors and Commissaries. A Journey to be performd by Kings requires much trouble and charges; much ado ther is in fitting their train, that they may appeer in a fitting equippage; all which consumes time, as also what high ceremonies are to be usd in so solemn an action. <hi>Philip Comines,</hi> who always dismisseth his Readers wiser then they came, gives special Cautions for this, Affirming that the congress of Souverain Princes in regard of the various circumstances that attend it, is a meer folly; it is exposd to emulation, jelousies, and envy, as also to delays, and retarding of things by needless solemnities. He makes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the personal Encounter which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> had, (where it is observable that he puts <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>France</hi>) adding further, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh though a politik wise King, was much afraid before-hand that some word might slip from him which might give offence, or some advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the King of <hi>England,</hi> or his Ministers; Herunto he adds an infortunat Journey that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> made to the said
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59014:101"/>
King <hi>Lewis</hi> for assistance against the <hi>Castilians,</hi> which perhaps he might have procurd by a discreet Ambassador, which makes him give a caution touching this point. <hi>Bien tard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>We will adde herunto the memorable example twixt <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Uladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who after a long War were to meet for concluding a peace in <hi>Olmutts</hi> in <hi>Moravia,</hi> where <hi>Matthias</hi> (meerly out of state) made <hi>Uladislaus</hi> stay for him 15 days; Moreover, <hi>Matthias</hi> came with a green Garland about his temples in policy that he might not uncover his head: <hi>Uladislaus</hi> therupon causd his Cap to be so girded and knotted about that it could not be taken off.</p>

               <p>But ther is a Modern Example far more pregnant then any of these, of <hi>Charles</hi> the first King of <hi>England,</hi> whose Journey to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> though the designe was Princely and Noble in it self, for it was to endear himself the more to the Lady <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta;</hi> yet it provd very disadvantagious, for it distracted and retarded the whole business both of <hi>Match</hi> and restitution of the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> when by the negotiation of Ambassadors it had bin brought to such a passe of perfection, that it had taken effect had not the Prince come thither, which gave occasion for the two great Favorits <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Olivares</hi> to clash one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which broke the neck of so great a Business that had bin a moulding above ten yeers; which had it bin left to the sole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Ambassadors, had in all probability bin consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated.</p>

                  <hi>The third Paragraph,</hi> Of the Antiquity, the first Rise and Pedigree of Ambassadors; as also of their Dignity, high Honor and Pre-eminence, and who are capable to qualifie, and employ Ambassadors.</head>
               <p>FRom the <hi>Necessity</hi> of Ambassadors we will proceed to their <hi>Antiquity;</hi> and surely they must needs be very ancient if they are so necessary.</p>
               <p>Some draw their antiquity from <hi>Belus</hi> the Father of <hi>Ninus;</hi> but <hi>Iosephus</hi> makes them more ancient, and refers their Original to God Himself, who was pleasd to create the <hi>Angels</hi> for this Ministry; Therfore <hi>Embassy</hi> in <hi>Greek</hi> is calld <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivd by imitation from the Hierarchy of Angels, who are made the Ambassadors of the great King of Heven upon extraordinary occasions, either for revelation of the successe of Kingdoms, as the <hi>Archangel Gabriel</hi> was to <hi>Daniel;</hi> Or for the declaring of some rare and signal thing, as <hi>He</hi> was sent also to the Blessed Virgin of the Conception of our <hi>Saviour, &amp;c.</hi> Now, ther is no Order or Government in this lower World as well Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal as Secular but it is had from the Pattern of the higher, in regard that God Almighty created the Elementary World, and appointed the Government therof to conform with the Architype and chief Pattern, or Ideal Form of the same conceavd at first in the Divine mind, and prescribd to the <hi>Hevenly</hi> Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Herunto alludes the Fiction of the ancient Pagans; For <hi>Aristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> tels us, that in the first Age of the World, wheras Mankind was infected by Brute Animals, wherof some were far stronger, others swifter, others were Venemous, which made Mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come often a prey to Birds, to Beasts and Serpents, <hi>Prometheus</hi> being sollicitous and studious for the safety of the humane Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, became Ambassador, or Orator to <hi>Iupiter</hi> for declaring the misery of Mankinde; Herupon <hi>Iupiter</hi> resolvd to send his son <hi>Mercury</hi> to teach Man Rhetorik, that is, to speak well and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly; but with this restriction, that he shold not communicat this Art to all, but to the excellentst, the wisest and valiantst sort of men: By means herof they came down from the mountains, and forth out of Caves and places of fastness, and by means of that Art of Rhetorik or Eloquence they united themselfs to civil Societies and coalitions. Hence it may be inferrd that <hi>Mercury</hi> the God of Eloquence was the first <hi>Ambassador,</hi> and he is painted with wings on his heels to denote expedition; Besides, he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a white Wand calld <hi>Caduceus</hi> in his hand, encircled with two Dragons greeting one another, which signifieth that his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59014:102"/>
Office is to make Peace, Alliances and Legues, as also to de nounce VVar, which is intimated by the immanity of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. Having thus displayed the <hi>Antiquity,</hi> we come now to the <hi>Honor</hi> of Ambassadors; and questionless they must needs be very <hi>honorable</hi> being so <hi>ancient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Royalty</hi> may be said, without prophaness, to be a Ray of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity;</hi> and <hi>Honor</hi> is a Ray of <hi>Royalty;</hi> The first is derivd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly from Heven, the other from Earthly Kings, who are calld the Fountains of <hi>Honor.</hi> Now, the reflections of this second <hi>Ray</hi> falls no where so directly as upon <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> who represent and personat Souverain Princes, which makes their Houses San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries, and their Persons so sacred, inviolable and excellent: and they have this high honor given them not only for their own sakes, and their Masters, but as they are Instruments of so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal good, as suppressing of Wars by making Peace, Frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Concord; or for the advancement of Commerce and Frendship.</p>
               <p>Now, it adds much to the <hi>Honor</hi> of <hi>Ambassadors</hi> that none can send any under that Title unless he be a Souverain Prince: Ther is no subject capable to send or receave any <hi>Ambassador,</hi> be he never so great a <hi>Viceroy;</hi> if he do, it is no less then High Treson. Therfore before the beginning of the last Civil Wars in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it was Treson in the highest degree for the <hi>Scots Inconsulto Principe,</hi> to send <hi>Lowden</hi> and others in quality of privat Clancular Commissioners to treat with the <hi>French</hi> King in the name of the whole Nation for assistance. And though the King himself made a semblance not to admit or hear them, yet his fiery <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> huggd them; whence it may be well said the first flames of the said VVars broke out.</p>
               <p>It is recorded in the Life of <hi>Eliz.</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> when he was Governor of <hi>Flanders</hi> sent <hi>Christopher Assonville</hi> in quality of a Minister of State; but the Queen wold not admit him, because he could produce neither Commission or Credential Letter from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whose Vassal <hi>Alva</hi> was. In the year 1604. the King of <hi>Spain</hi> motiond that the publik Minister who was here for the <hi>Hollanders</hi> shold not be stild <hi>Ambassador,</hi> because they are subject to the <hi>Empire,</hi> and have a Superior, having bin incorporated in the <hi>Empire</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth 1548. at the Diet of <hi>Auspurg,</hi> as <hi>Meteranus</hi> relates, and says besides that <hi>Rodolphus</hi> 2. writ Letters unto them 1607. as to Vassals of the Empire, and consequently they had no power to make Peace or War without the consent of <hi>Caesar,</hi> which they then acknowledgd by their Letters sent to <hi>Colen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Electors and Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> have got a privilege to send and receave <hi>Ambassadors</hi> touching matters that concern their own Territories, but not the state of the Empire: The like the <hi>Hans</hi> Town may do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:59014:103"/>But Rebels have no capacity to employ any in quality of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of State, no not so much as an <hi>Herald:</hi> Therfore <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth was censurd for admitting a Herald with Letters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a War from the <hi>Lutheran</hi> party in <hi>Germany,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missing him unpunishd; though he told him that if he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in steed of a <hi>Gold Chain</hi> he shold have a <hi>Halter</hi> for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Touching the Electors or Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns, or Cities of the <hi>Hansa,</hi> it hath bin much controverted whether they had <hi>Ius Legationis,</hi> whether they had a capacity to make a Mission of Ministers of State that might bear the quality and privilege of Ambassadors. Concerning the first, <hi>Kirknerus</hi> a great Civilian holds, That the <hi>German</hi> Princes may have such a Prerogative, but it is <hi>secundario tantum Iure. Et qui Ius mittendorum Legatorum secundario tantùm Iure habent mittuntur Legati non de Rebus universum concernentibus Imperium, sed tantùm sui Territorii ratione, eo enim Ipsis intuitu tantùm datum; ultra igitur terminos non est procedendum, fieret enim altàs prejudicium Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>German</hi> Princes may employ Ambassadors to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Princes by a secondary Right, not to treat of Affairs concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Universal Empire, but of things only appertaining to their own particular Territories, and beyond those bounds they must not proceed. And ther are some Princes in <hi>Italy</hi> also that are no less under the Majesty of the Empire in this kind, but, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns and Corporations, they claim the same privilege as the Princes do, for they are free <hi>Imperial</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and communicat of the same Regalias, yet all by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of the Emperour, wherunto his necessities from time to time enforcd him. The Provinces of <hi>Belgia,</hi> or the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> under pretext of such a Right sent the Baron of <hi>Montigni</hi> as Ambassador to <hi>Spain</hi> at the beginning of the tumults; but <hi>Philip</hi> the second choppd off his head, saying, That Vassals, much less Rebels, have no power to employ Ambassadors; Yet this King his Grandchild admitted <hi>Ascham</hi> who came from as notorious Rebels, (though not in reference to him) which he excusd in regard that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had receavd Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors from <hi>Holland</hi> at their first revolt before they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgd a <hi>State,</hi> and that she was the chiefest supportress of them.</p>
               <p>VVe will conclude this Paragraph with this Ticklish Point, VVhether a <hi>Protestant</hi> Prince may not send an Ambassador to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and by way of civil correspondence receave another from <hi>Him:</hi> though <hi>Iustice Ashton</hi> was of a contrary opinion, yet Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> was for the <hi>Affirmatif;</hi> and his reason is,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59014:103"/>
because that besides his <hi>Spiritual</hi> Jurisdiction the Pope is a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> Prince; and ther may be Ambassadors sent to <hi>him</hi> as well as to the Turk, or <hi>Mogor.</hi>

Nay, the Electors jointly hold themselfs to be more then the Emperour, he being their production, and made by their Suffrages and election; and the Rule of Heraldry is <hi>Honor est in Dante.</hi> But all this is by the by.</p>
               <p>Now, so high and transcendent is the privilege of an <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> and his Person so sacred, that whosoever doth perpetrat any thing against his safety, he is guilty of High Treson of <hi>Laesae Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestatis,</hi> that is, of prostituted Faith, Publik Authority, and of a breach of the Law of Nations. <hi>Qui violarit Legatum Lege Iulia de vi publica tenetur,</hi> VVho violats an Ambassador by the <hi>Iulian Law</hi> he is guilty of publik violence; and by the Pontifical Law tis no less then a <hi>Piacle,</hi> therfore he is interdicted from the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of holy things.</p>
               <p>We will produce some Examples what revenges have followd for the violation of <hi>Ambassadors.</hi> The King of the <hi>Ammonits</hi> did deride and ill entreat the Ambassadors of King <hi>David,</hi> and to make them more contumelious, their Beards were half shaven, and their garments torn to their tails; but what ensued? the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monits</hi> afterward were overcome in Battail, and <hi>Rabba</hi> their chief City being taken, it was sacrificed with other Cities also to free plunder, and the fury of the soldiers; so the affronts done to the <hi>Ambassadors</hi> were vindicated.

So <hi>Minutius</hi> and <hi>Manlius</hi> were sent to <hi>Carthage</hi> by a solemn Decree of the Senat because they had wrongd her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors at <hi>Rome.</hi> And so respectful were the <hi>Romans</hi> of the sacred Persons of Ambassadors, that if any free Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> did offer the least violence though by words only, he was degraded of being a free Citizen ever after. Nay, the very name of <hi>Ambassador</hi> is so sacred, that ther is a rare example that though some did counterfait it, yet they wold lay no violent hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; For <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> having taken a ship laden with many illustrious <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> they said that they were <hi>Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors</hi> sent to him, yet, though it was found they were none, he dismissd them peaceably, That as <hi>Valerius</hi> hath it, <hi>Romani Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratoris potiùs decepta fides quàm frustra implorata videretur.</hi>

                  <hi>Ambassadors</hi> also have a privilege that what children they get abroad, be it under what Climat it will during their <hi>Legation,</hi> they are free-born <hi>Denizens</hi> of that Country whence they come, and need no <hi>Naturalization;</hi> and the reason which <hi>Hotoman</hi>

gives, is, that they cannot be said to be absent thence all the while, being still doing the business of their own Country, though they live as <hi>Exiles</hi> for the time for the common good. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if they chance to die there, their goods are not subject to <hi>droit d' Aubaine,</hi> that is, they do not fall by Escheatage to the King as other strangers goods do in some Countries.

                  <hi>The fifth Paragraph,</hi> Of the Breeding and Education, of the Parts and Perfections both Acquird and Natural which are requird in an Ambassador.</head>
               <p>AS in a <hi>General,</hi> or Commander in chief of an Army, ther is requird Valour, Magnanimity and Courage; so in an <hi>Ambassador</hi> ther is Wisdome, Discretion and Prudence requird: The one is for Performance and Action, the other is for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and Negotiation. Ther is also <hi>Elocution</hi> requisit in both, in the one to enforce the justice of the Quarrel, and to infuse cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage into the soldiers by his <hi>Hortatives,</hi> in lieu wherof <hi>Sermons</hi> are made use of in latter Ages; in the other to move the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Prince he is sent unto. Therfore <hi>Mercury</hi> was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be <hi>Ambassador</hi> of the Gods in regard of his <hi>Eloquence.</hi> And this strain of well-speaking in an <hi>Ambassador</hi> must be natural as well as by art; for the <hi>Italian</hi> tells us, <hi>Una oncia di Natura vale una libra di Dottrina,</hi> An ounce of Nature is worth a pound of Learning. Touching matter of <hi>Literature,</hi> ther are two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Qualities requird in him, <hi>viz.</hi> to be a good <hi>Historian</hi> and a good <hi>Linguist;</hi> being the first, tis presumd he is stord with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, Precedents and Observations of the Carriage of other Ambassadors; Of what encounters and difficulties they found in their Negotiations, and what successes they had. By being a good <hi>Linguist</hi> he hath extraordinary advantage to facilitat his affairs, to converse with other Ambassadors upon the <hi>place;</hi> to get intelligence, and gain the knowledge and frendship of the prime men and Ministers of that Prince to whom he is employd, and to get <hi>his</hi> favor also. But it is a caution which the <hi>Civilians</hi> give, That an Ambassador shold not speak but in a Language which he well understands for fear of slips, and placing a word amiss: Now, tis a great truth specially in an Ambassador, that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59014:105"/>
                  <hi>Meglio è sducciolare co 'piedi che con la lingua,</hi> Tis better to slip with the foot then with the toung: Now, the toung being by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Nature <hi>in udo posita,</hi> put in a moist place, is very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to slip.</p>
               <p>That worthy Knight <hi>Frederik Marselaer</hi> in his Book calld the <hi>Legat,</hi> and the <hi>Civilians,</hi> point at divers qualities that shold be in an Ambassador.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He shold be an <hi>Indigena</hi> born in that Country whence he comes, that all his hopes of preferment may be there: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a <hi>Stranger</hi> or <hi>Alien</hi> though made free Denizen cannot be so proper; for a true-born Childe must needs negotiat with more affection for the honor and safety, for the benefit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of his own native Country and Mother.</item>
                  <item>2. He must be a Gentleman born, or Noble; for all Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are accounted Noble in other Countries. He must be no <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaso</hi> or <hi>Caprimulgus,</hi> and then he will gain more respect from the Prince and Peeple to whom he is employd: for since he must take Precedence of Princes, Dukes, Marquisses and Earls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they will not think it much to give him priority of place being well born.</item>
                  <item>3. He must be a comely and graceful Person being to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the person of his Prince; for the peeple of that Country to whom he is sent will be apt to think that the Prince whom he personats is so. We read that <hi>Artaxerces</hi> culld out sorty of the hansomst men that could be found to send in quality of Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors to <hi>Alexander,</hi> who were also hansomely clad, so that it was a question whether <hi>they</hi> were a greater ornament to their Garments, or their Garments to them, as the Greeks said. An Ambassador being employed from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> with a train of very comely Gentlemen, the Pope beholding them, said, <hi>Hi videntur potius Angeli quam Angli,</hi> These appeer rather to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels then English-men. <hi>Aristotle</hi> being askd why outward beuty and comliness begat so much love, answerd, <hi>That this was a Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans question.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. That he shold be well in yeers; for Experience being the great Looking-glass of Wisdome, and Wisdome being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Vertu requird in an Ambassador, Men that have many yeers on their backs <hi>qui ont pisse en beaucoup de neiges,</hi> as the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> saith, must needs have more experience by observing the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitude of worldly things, and the successes therof; who have passed the unruly affections of Youth, which like so many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiffs do daily set upon us. Senators (or Counsellors of State) are denominated from <hi>Senes,</hi> Old men; and an <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> who may be rankd among the highest Counsellors of State, shold be so. Tis a tru saying, <hi>Qui in multis versati, versuti sunt.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:59014:105"/>5. That he shold be of a proportionable good Estate, and not indigent, for then he will be the more sedulous, diligent and careful in his charge, because he hath something to loose: for his Estate may be said to be his Bayl all the while he is abroad. Moreover, it will add much to the reputation of an <hi>Ambassador</hi> if he be known to be rich.</item>
                  <item>6. He must be liberal and munificent, remembring the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whom he represents: for a sordid parsimony and niggardness is odious in all men, specially in an <hi>Ambassador.</hi> The <hi>Spaniaro</hi> saith, That <hi>Dadivas entran sin taladro,</hi> Gifts make their way in without a Wimble, and nothing concerns an Ambassador more then to make his way into the Consults and Transactions of state of that Court where he resides, which cannot be done if he be close-fisted. When <hi>Sulpitius Galba</hi> and <hi>Aurelius Cotta</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend who shold be sent to <hi>Spain</hi> Ambassador in the time of <hi>Viria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Emilianus</hi> one of the Senators said, That neither of them was fit; for the one was poor, and the other was covetous; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> one had nothing, and nothing wold satisfie the other. Ther is a remarkable passage in <hi>Iovius,</hi> That when the <hi>Florentines</hi> sent Ambassadors to <hi>Charles</hi> 5. and <hi>Clement</hi> 7. being then at <hi>Bolonia,</hi> together with their houshold-stuff, they brought covertly many rich Commodities to sell, because they might be free from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gabel: But the Searchers of the Custome house having discoverd it, they became a laughing-stock; and, as unworthy of the Office of <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> they were remanded home without audience. By this example it appeers that <hi>Ambassadors</hi> Lugga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges may be searchd; Wherunto we may add another of Sir <hi>Thomas Chaloner</hi> sent <hi>Ambassador</hi> to <hi>Spain</hi> by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who sending complaint home that his Chests had bin searchd, the Council sitting therupon determind, as <hi>Campden</hi> hath it, in these words, <hi>Legato omnia aequi boni<expan>

                  <item>7. He must be accostable and courteous, and not of a moross humor, yet reserving still his sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e and gravity when time, place and persons require. Urbanity and gentleness works much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all affections, and he is a <hi>cheap Frend who is got by a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> Therfore it becomes and behoves an Ambassador to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with all in civilities by being of a winning, complacentious and benign behaviour; yet not to make himself too cheap, and to have a special care where he placeth his Complements.</item>
                  <item>8. An Ambassador also must be constant, and tenacious of the Religion of his Prince and Country, both in the confident profession, and constant practice therof; if he cannot publikly, yet privatly within the walls of his own House; for nothing
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59014:106"/>
raiseth a repute more then an opinion of Piety. Therfore he must be very careful in the choice of his house, that it be fair and large, and a good distance from the Court, otherwise he may be pesterd with too many Visiters that will have their feet under his table ever and anon. He must be also constant to the habit and vests of his own King and Country: For he who doth not follow the fashion of his Prince herin, may be said <hi>Exuere Personam;</hi> and this was imputed as a great fault and fantastiqueness in my Lord <hi>Rosse</hi> when he went to <hi>Spain</hi> in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time, who appeerd at his first Audience, and continued afterwards in the <hi>Spanish</hi> habit. An Ambassador must be also very careful in the choice of Liveries for his Pages and Laquays, that they be rich and fair, but not fantastical: As likewise that he be well Coachd, and that his Coach be well drawn by good Horses; for nothing sets forth the lustre of an <hi>Ambassador</hi> more.</item>

               <p>THe discretion and prudence of a Prince discovers it self in nothing more then in the choice of his Instruments. The old Poet tells us,</p>

               </lg>
               <p>But of all other Instruments and Officers, ther must be most inspection had in the choice of his Ambassador: for as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>columity of the Kingdome depends upon the King, so the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the King depends much upon the ability of his <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</hi> Therfore this trustful Charge, this sacred Function must not be prostituted to evry one, for <hi>Ex quol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> for a time did choose Ambassadors <hi>Sortilegio,</hi> by Lots, as the <hi>Venetians</hi> now choose their <hi>Doge;</hi> and this was to prevent competitions and corruptions: Some were chosen <hi>Togâ,</hi> by the Gown for their wisdome; some <hi>Sago,</hi> by the Cassock <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59014:106"/>
though he treats of peace. The principalst quality requird in him is to be <hi>Intrepidus,</hi> to be fearless, resolut and stout. He must not be pusillanimous and sheepish; for the witty Proverb will tell him, <hi>Chi pecora si fà il lupo se la mangia,</hi> Who makes himself a sheep the wolf will devour him: Therfore ther must be a special care had to pry into the genius and natural dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the party in this particular; for tis a tru principle in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, That <hi>a Coward cannot be an honest man,</hi> and Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty is a main thing requird in an <hi>Ambassador.</hi> Therfore he must not be dejected and cast down at the cross traverses and success of any business; his courage must not be daunted or dashd at any thing. He must be also bold and confident in his Proposals and Demands; for <hi>Qui timidè rogat docet negare,</hi> Who asks with fear teacheth how to deny: And let him be sure to ask ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too much then too little; for <hi>Domanda assai, che non manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rà poi à calare;</hi> Ask enough, and ther will be enough to aba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e afterwards: Therfore let him not be stanchd, or mealy-mouthd in his Demands and Audiences; Blushing and Bashfulness are commendable in Maids and Boys, but odious in Ambassadors; therfore the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath a witty Proverb, <hi>Al Vergonzoso el Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablo le truxo al Palacio,</hi> The Devil brought the Bashful to Court. Wherfore in the election of an Ambassador ther must be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had to his natural disposition, that he be confident and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Ther is a memorable observation and saying of <hi>Philip</hi> the second King of <hi>Spain,</hi> calld <hi>El Prudente,</hi> that when he had designd one for an <hi>Ambassador,</hi> he came faintily and coldly to him to propose some things for the accommodation of his Embassy; The King observing it, said, <hi>How can I expect that this man can promote and effectuat my Businesses, when he is so fainty and fearful in the sollicitation of his own?</hi> To prevent this, the probablest way is to make choice of a generous and well-<hi>extracted</hi> person, for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generes animos Timor arguit.</hi> One of the greatest blemishes that Historians do cast upon <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh of <hi>France,</hi> is, that he made choice of his Barbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>er luck then the <hi>French</hi> Barber had; For he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent in quality of Ambassador to <hi>Alfonso</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and having acquitted himself so elegantly, and with so much gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity at his first audience, and the King understanding that he was an Apothecary, said, <hi>Se tali sono gli Speciali di Fierenze, quali debbono essere gli Medici?</hi> If the Apothecaries of <hi>Florence</hi> are such, what shall we think of their Physitians? But this Apothecary although he was of an ordinary Trade, yet he was
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59014:107"/>
an extraordinary man in point of Parts and Erudition, which made compensation for the meanness of his Profession.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is an advantage to the affairs of a King that he make choice of a proper and graceful person, and of a sound healthful constitution to represent him abroad. We read that it was prohibited by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> that any man who had any blemish or mutilation shold be made a <hi>Levite:</hi> Now, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits,</hi> as it was insinuated before, are as the Legats of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and Kings being types of him, shold not have any to personat them that had any deformity or indisposition. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member when Count <hi>Gondamar</hi> and the Marquiss of <hi>Inojosa</hi> were here Ambassadors for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the one was troubled with the <hi>Fistula,</hi> and the other had lost a peece of his Nostril, therupon a Libel was made that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> made an odd choice of his <hi>Ambassadors</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> for the one had the Pox in his <hi>Brich,</hi> the other in his <hi>Nose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath bin much controverted among Statists whether one person singly, or many joynd in Commission be fittest for an Embassy: this business is much canvasd <hi>Pro &amp; Con</hi> among the <hi>Civilians;</hi> they that are for plurality urge <hi>Solomon,</hi> That <hi>in multitude of Counsellors ther is safety.</hi> They instance in divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and produce <hi>Virgil,</hi>

So <hi>Peter Matthieu</hi> relates that ther were 400 <hi>Spanish</hi> Gentlemen at the confirmation of the Peace of <hi>Vervins</hi> twixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which might be calld a <hi>Legion</hi> rather then a <hi>Legation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the most political <hi>Civilians</hi> are for one single person, <hi>trop gran nombre est encombre,</hi> too great a number is an encumber a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Ambassadors, it is subject to confusion and delays; it will make the business in treaty to take air, and be sooner discoverd. One is far more secret and sedulous when he acts by himself, then when he must concur with others. Then ther are Maximes in the Law, <hi>Cura plurium, cura nullorum;</hi> The care of many, the care of none; <hi>Quod multos tangit, paucos angit.</hi> Then many emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and envy do often creep in with other inconveniences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many. Therfore the most expedit and advantagious
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59014:107"/>
cours is, that ther be but one Ambassador, but the Prince must choose a choice man to be he; He must be <hi>Lectus antequam Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus.</hi>

               <p>Another debate ther is, Whether <hi>Legatio</hi> be only a <hi>Virile Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> a Masculin task, or whether <hi>Women</hi> are capable to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployd in an Embassy; and more are for the Affirmatif part then the Negatif. It was much controverted in <hi>Rome</hi> whether <hi>Vetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> and <hi>Volumnia,</hi> two <hi>Roman</hi> Matrons, were fit to be sent as the desperatness of the case then stood, upon an Embassy to <hi>Cori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and the <hi>Volscians;</hi> it was determind they shold, and the treaty took good effect. Ther were <hi>Roman</hi> Dames sent upon an Embassy to <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour for revoking Pope <hi>Liberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and they prevaild. It was a practice among the <hi>Romans</hi> to send the <hi>Vestal Virgins</hi> upon Embassies. Ther is a memorable example how <hi>Guelpso</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> having provokd the Emperour <hi>Conradus,</hi> he set so close upon his skits that he coopd him up in <hi>Winsberg,</hi> where he beleagerd him; <hi>Caesar</hi> was so incensd that he vowd to put all to fire and sword. So the Duke being reducd to great extremities, it was thought fit to send the <hi>Duchess</hi> as <hi>Ambassadress</hi> to the Emperours Camp, where she performd her part so gallantly, that she so movd and melted his heart, that for her sake all the Women in <hi>Winsberg</hi> shold have safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to depart, and carry away upon their backs as much of the most precious wealth as they could bear, but the Men shold abide his mercy. Herupon the Duchess took the Duke upon her shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and evry Wife after her example took her Husband; Maids and Unmarried Women took up some their Brothers, some their Kinred, and so all marchd out; so <hi>Caesar</hi> pardond all. I will conclude with a late example of Madame <hi>Sardaus,</hi> who went so often privatly twixt <hi>Bruxels</hi> and the <hi>Hague</hi> until the peace was concluded twixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> after fourscore yeers Wars by Sea and Land: Therfore she was calld <hi>La Maquarelle de la Paix;</hi> which was no disgrace to her.</p>

                  <hi>The seventh Paragraph,</hi> Touching the Office, Function and Duty of an Ambassador in the execution of his Place, and acquitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the great Fiduciary Trust reposd in Him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Civilians, who are best versd in the Laws of Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, say, <hi>Legatio est mysteriosum quid,</hi> that it is a mysterious thing; It is full of secrecie and darkness, as it is of Faith and Trust. The Lord high Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> who is Keeper of the Kings <hi>Conscience</hi> as well as of the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> hath a great trust reposd in him for to mitigat the rigor of the Laws by way of Equity. The Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, he of the Common Pleas, and the Lord Chief Baron of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, have great trusts reposd in them: but all these deal twixt Subject and Subject, and sometimes twixt King and Subject: But Ambassadors have a higher trust, for they deal twixt Kings and Kings, twixt Countries and Countries; therfore as the burden is heavier, so the honor is the greater: ther is no secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie belongs to the other Offices; but reservedness and secrecie is the soul of Embassy; which made one say, <hi>If his Cap knew his privat Instructions, he wold hurle it into the fire and burn it.</hi> And as ther is honor in this high employment, so ther is much honor attends it; which made one say, <hi>That that Ambassador who loseth one hair of his Masters honor, forfeits his head at his return.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of the principal Duties of an Ambassador, is to stick close to his <hi>Instructions,</hi> and the Mandats of his Master; and therin an Ambassador Lidger doth not run so much hazard as an Extraordinary, who hath many things commonly left to discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by way of implicit trust. <hi>Besoldus</hi> defines the Office of an Ambassador thus, <hi>Ut Mandatum fideliter, &amp; cum dexteritate exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatur, &amp; acceptum responsum diligentissime notatum referat Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenti;</hi> That with faithfulness and dexterity he execut the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and report to him who sent him the Answer most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently noted. Ther is a shorter definition, <hi>Officium Legati est ut Mandata Legationis diligenter conficiat, &amp; ex F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>de,</hi> That he perform carefully the Command of the Embassy, and with Faith. He derives all his Power from his Instructions; for without them ther is no Mission or Embassy. Ther is an Example of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> that having employd Ambassadors with divers Iustru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, wherof one was, that they shold take such a way as they went, they going another way, though they had performd all the rest of the Instructions, yet they were put to death at their return for infringing this one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:59014:108"/>Ther are divers instances how Ambassadors exceeding their Commissions, and falling into follies, have bin punishd upon the place. <hi>Hector Boetius</hi> relates that <hi>Olaus</hi> and <hi>Evetus</hi> killd the Scots Ambassadors. <hi>Teaca</hi> Queen of <hi>Sclavonia</hi> killd a Roman Ambassador, as <hi>Polybius</hi> mentions. The <hi>Athenians</hi> causd <hi>Darius</hi> Ambassadors to be thrown into a Well. <hi>Dandolo</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambassador had his eyes pluckd out by the King of <hi>Sicily.</hi> But let us descend to latter Ages: <hi>Francis</hi> the first of <hi>France</hi> sent <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gosa</hi> and <hi>Rinion</hi> Ambassadors to the <hi>Turk; Charles</hi> 5. soldiers discoverd, surprizd and flew them in <hi>Italy:</hi> The fact was justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Emperour because they were both his subjects, the one being a <hi>Milanois,</hi> the other of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and servd his Enemy, for ther were Wars then twixt <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Francis. Edward</hi> the second of <hi>England</hi> employd a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman Ambassador to <hi>France,</hi> who had bin executed for a Traytor for serving the Enemy had not the Queen interceded. <hi>Anno</hi> 1302. the Pope sent an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador to <hi>France,</hi> where he practisd some Treson; and being arraigned, convicted, and condemned to die, the Popes Frends procurd that he shold be banishd only. The <hi>Venetian</hi> drew out of the <hi>French Ambassadors</hi> House some who bad discoverd their secrets to the <hi>Turk,</hi> where resistance being made, Cannons were sent for from the Arsenal, and so they were taken out by force, and the <hi>French</hi> King not offended.</p>
               <p>The Ambassadors in these latter examples by their own indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and misdemenures drew these violences upon themselfs. We will concude this point with a latter example in <hi>England</hi> 1624. at which time ther were two Spanish Ambassadors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding in <hi>London,</hi> who were the <hi>Marquiss of Inojosa,</hi> and <hi>Don Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los Coloma;</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> being newly returnd from <hi>Madrid Re infectâ,</hi> without the Infanta, matters began to gather ill bloud twixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in regard that the Treties both of <hi>Match</hi> and <hi>Palatinat</hi> were dissolvd by Act of Parlement, which was done by means of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> The said Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors finding <hi>that,</hi> they contrivd a way how to supplant and destroy the Duke. Herupon falling into consideration that King <hi>Iames</hi> was grown old, and that the least thing might make impressions of distrust and jealousies in him, therfore in a privat audience they did intimat unto him that ther was a very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous designe against his Royal Authority traced by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and his Complices, which was, that at the beginning of that Parlement the said Duke with certain Lords, and others consulted of the argument &amp; means which were to be taken for the breaking and dissolving of the Treties both of the Spanish Match, and for the restitution of the Palatinat; and if his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty wold not conform therunto, their consultations passd so far, that he shold have a house of plesure where he might retire
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59014:109"/>
himself to his sports, in regard that the Prince had now yeers sufficient, and parts answerable for the Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The King for the present dismissd them with thanks; But the next day he made earnest instances that as they had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd a Conspiracie, they wold also detect the Conspirators, this being the only means wherby their own honor might be preservd in proving the truth of things. To this they replyed, That they had reveald enough already in order to the care and zeal they had to his Royal Person and Dignity. Therupon the King commanded that the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> shold be put to his Oath, with others who were most suspectful, which they all took for cleering their integrity.</p>
               <p>This being done, the King returnd to make new instances to the said Ambassadors, that they wold not prefer the discovery of the names of the Conspirators to the security of his Person, as also to the truth and honor of themselfs, and to the hazard of an opinion to be held the Authors and Betrayers of a Plot of so much malice, sedition and danger; but they wold discover no more.</p>
               <p>Yet a few days after they desird new audience, which was suspended to be given them, and in the interim the King sent Sir <hi>Edward Conway</hi> his principal Secretary of State, and Sir <hi>Francis Cottington</hi> Secretary to the Prince, (both Lords afterwards) to signifie unto the said Ambassadors that he desird nothing more then a continuance of frendship twixt the two Crowns; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they had any thing to say they shold communicat it to the said Secretaries as persons of trust, which he employd expresly for that purpose; and if they made any difficulty of this also, then they might choose among his Council of State those whom they likd best, and he wold command that they shold presently repair unto them: and if this also shold seem inconvenient, they might send him what they had to say in a Letter by whom they thought fittest, and he wold receave it with his own hands. But they gave no answer to all this: therupon the said Secretaries told them according to their Instructions which they had receavd from his Majesty, That they being the Authors of an Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so dangerous and seditious, had made themselfs incapable to treat further with the King their Master; and were it not for the respect he bore to the Catholik King his dear and beloved Brother their Master, and that they were in quality of Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors to such a Majesty, he wold and could by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the right of his own Royal Justice, proceed against them with such severity as their offence deservd; but for the reasons before said he wold leave the reparation to the Justice of their own King, of whom he wold demand and require it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:59014:109"/>Herupon Sir <hi>Walter Ashton</hi> Ambassador then in <hi>Spain</hi> for the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> had audience of that King, wherin he said, That the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> his Master had commanded him to demand refaction and satisfaction of his Majesty against the Marquiss of <hi>Inojosa</hi> and Don <hi>Carlos Coloma</hi> for scandalizing the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> (with other of his best subjects) and through his sides aiming at the Prince himself; for it is unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Duke wold have cast himself upon such a designe without the communication of it to him, and to know his plesure: so he remonstrated the whole circumstance of the business, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in conclusion he said, That he humbly beseechd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to observe and weigh well the care and tenderness wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the King his Master had proceeded towards his Majesties Ambassadors; not obliging them to any precipitat resolutions, but giving them time, and opening a way how they might have cleerd themselfs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was expected that the said Ambassadors at their return to <hi>Spain</hi> wold have bin punishd, or at least checkd; but matters growing daily worse and worse twixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the said Ambassadors were rather rewarded then reprehended at their return, <hi>Inojosa</hi> being made afterwards Governor of <hi>Milan;</hi> and <hi>Coloma</hi> receavd addition of command, and honors in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the high civilities of <hi>England</hi> at that time towards the said Ambassadors was much cryed up abroad, that notwithstanding so pernicious a machination to demolish <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and to discompose the whole <hi>English</hi> Court, yet they were permitted to depart peaceably; and Sir <hi>Lewis Leukner</hi> was commanded to conduct them to the Sea-side for prevention of any outrage upon their persons.</p>
               <p>We have dwelt the longer upon this business, in regard ther are extraordinary traverses of State in it, being a Plot of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual reach of policy, which will be found more amply related in the addition the <hi>Author</hi> made to <hi>Finets</hi> Ambassador: but in regard it is so pertinent to this Paragraph, he thought it fit to insert the substance of it here.</p>
               <p>We will now resume things touching the Office of an <hi>Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador.</hi> It is very necessary he shold have his Credential Letters exact and plain; His Commission plenary, and fortified with as much authority as he can. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers when the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was there, objected against the Duke of <hi>Buching<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> that his Commission (for he came also in quality of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador) was not so compleat and authentik as that of the Earl of <hi>Bristols;</hi> for he had his Commission under the Broad Seal of <hi>England,</hi> wheras the Duke had his by the King only.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:59014:110"/>The Civilians make a question, <hi>Si à Legato Mandata poscantur, is adigi possit ad ea exhibenda.</hi> Their opinion is, That besides his Credential or Fiduciary Letters, and his General Commission, he is not bound to shew any more. Touching his privat <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Paschalius</hi> saith, <hi>Mala eum agitat res qui in Legati Secreta irreligiose irrumpit.</hi> It is questiond further, Whether it may stand with the Office and Honor of an <hi>Ambassador</hi> to receave Gifts and Presents from the Prince he is sent unto, which the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians</hi> call <hi>Lautia,</hi> a word peculiar only to <hi>Ambassadors:</hi> some are for the Negative, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> do follow; for their <hi>Ambassadors</hi> use to receave none, not so much as a Bottle of Wine: But most are for the Affirmatif. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> (who are reputed to have the best Rules touching <hi>Ambassadors</hi>) though they allow it, yet, their <hi>Ambassadors</hi> are bound to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit their Presents to the <hi>Senat;</hi> and tis thought much of St. <hi>Marks</hi> tresure consists of it. They are also bound in a large Oration to give an account (besides that of their Embassy) what they observd most remarkable in the Government, State and Quality of the Country; of which Oration they bring also a Manuscript which is put up in their <hi>Archives. Iohn</hi> Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Madrid</hi> (notwithstanding that the weather had grown foul twixt us and <hi>Spain</hi>) receavd a Cupboard of huge massie Plate valued at 20000 Crowns of this King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who also gave him a Diamond Ring off his Finger, rated at 1500 <hi>l.</hi> sterling; and the reason was, because he had found him so wise, faithful and industrious a servant to his King.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Civilians</hi> make likewise a doubt whether it may not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Office of an <hi>Ambassador</hi> to have his Wife and Children along with him; but they who hold the contrary are rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded then approved: For to leave his Wife, is for one to leave half himself behind him; besides, Conjugal society is counted the prime of comforts: moreover, it saves trouble of Writing, and charges for Letters and Packets, which come to no small sum at the yeers end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will conclude this Paragraph with two special things which the Civilians require further for the performance of the Office of an <hi>Ambassador, viz.</hi> That he be reservd and secret in an intense degree; he must not be <hi>Plenus Rimarum,</hi> full of chinks: and herin the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> are eminently imitable; for all the Drugs in <hi>Egypt</hi> cannot draw away a secret from them, wheras a small Purge or Vomit will make others cast it up.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that an <hi>Ambassador</hi> may facilitat the discharge of his Office the better, it is requisit that he have a previous knowledg of the Court and Country wherunto he is employd:
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59014:110"/>
that he be well versd in the <hi>Speech</hi> therof; for it is a sad thing when one is sent <hi>Ambassador</hi> to see fashions, and learn the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a Country.</p>
               <p>Lastly, ther's nothing more concerns the Office and Duty of an <hi>Ambassador</hi> (as it was touchd before) then to be true to his <hi>Instructions. Brunus</hi> tells us, that <hi>Qui extra Mandatum agit, aliud agit;</hi> Who acts beyond his Commission, acts another thing: Yet it cannot be denied but many things in point of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance are left to the discretion of a Plenipotentiary <hi>Ambassador;</hi> therfore, as I take it, ther was by the twelve Tables in <hi>Rome</hi> a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of power left to Legats, <hi>Quae bonum Patriae eminenter tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt etiamsi non Mandentur, agunto:</hi> What eminently concerns the publik good, though not commanded, let them be done.</p>

               <p>HAving spoken hitherto generally of the concernments of <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> and the privileges of <hi>Legation,</hi> We will now make some inspections in particular into the Constitutions and Common Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which may be calld <hi>Civil,</hi> and very complying in this point.</p>
               <p>The Law of <hi>England,</hi> as the great Father of it my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> says, That <hi>Honor Legati honor mittentis est,</hi> The honor of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador is the honor of him who sent him: That <hi>Legati, aut Proregis dedecus redundat in Regem,</hi> The affront offerd an Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador redounds to his King. By the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> tis High Treson to kill an Ambassador; as among others ther are Examples in the persons of <hi>Iohn Kerby</hi> and <hi>Iohn Algore,</hi> the one a <hi>London</hi>-Mercer, the other a Grocer, who were both ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignd, convicted, and condemned for killing <hi>Iohn Imperial,</hi> who was <hi>Ambassador</hi> from <hi>Genoa,</hi> for a Patent he had got of the King for the sole importing of all Commodities from the Levant parts. <hi>I. Hill</hi> was also condemned of High Treson for killing of <hi>A. de Walton</hi> who was Ambassador, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then the high civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that were shewd by King <hi>Iames</hi> to the <hi>Marquiss</hi> of <hi>Inojosa,</hi> and <hi>Don Carlos Coloma</hi> the Spanish <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> notwithstanding their high misdemenures for calumniating the last Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> and through him the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> his sole Son, and Heir apparent to the Crown, as it is mentiond in the next pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Paragraph.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:59014:111"/>And as the Law of <hi>England</hi> is so respectful of <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> so for her <hi>own</hi> she useth to furnish them with as political Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Instructions, and as exactly couchd as any other Kings Ambassadors whatsoever.

                        <q>Your Message in the first part is a Ceremony sutable to the affections and obligations of Princes, to express the sense they have of the mortality of their Frends; which Office is best performd by a person of noble rank, capable of the impression wrought in noble hearts. But the substance of your Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage is for the publik Peace, and the interest of our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (the Palsgrave) and our dear Sister depending therup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>

fit your self for your journey, and pass the Seas in a ship ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to transport you to the Sound, or the River of <hi>Elve,</hi> as by the way you shall learn where our Uncle the King doth now reside. When you are landed, you shall forthwith give notice of your coming, that your <hi>Reception</hi> may be with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor due to our Ambassador of your rank. Then, after your coming to Court, you shall in our name demand Audience, and then attend the Kings plesure for your access; but you shall not visit any other until you have had the honor of his presence to whom you are employd.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>At your first audience you shall deliver our Letter of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to our Uncle; and then with a significant expression of our entire and cordial affection proceeding from the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of frendship, you shall tell him what great sorrow we have conceavd together with him for the death of our dear Granmother the late Queen his Mother, whose memory you must adorn with her stile, and due Praises enlargd, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of her Life and Death, and your own Judgment will best direct.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>This Office being performd with the King without any mention of other business at that time, you shall address your self to the Prince if he be present, or otherwise by special audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and deliver with our Letter of Credence our like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doleance, with expression of our hearty affection, as to a Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whose prosperity and inward frendship we very much desire.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>Whilst you attend this Ceremony, you are to inform your self by <hi>Avery,</hi> who hath the charge of our affairs at <hi>Hambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> and is also chosen Commissioner for our sister: what is done concerning that Portion of our Granmothers personal Estate which is due unto Us, as by our Uncles own Letters now to be deliverd unto you, may appeer. Which Portion we have given entirely to our said Sister, with order to her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners to sollicit for the same at the appointed time: and in case you find performance to our Sisters satisfaction, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our former Letters sent on her behalf, you shall take notice of it, and give our Uncle hearty thanks for his just favor and expedition. But if you find refusal, or delay for the discounting of such debt as upon former Treties, and by his last Letters our Uncle doth demand; you shall assure him that before the receit of those Letters which mention the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of such Debts, We had conveyd by Deed of Gift to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59014:112"/>
our Sister all our interest in the Goods; and given warrant to her Commissioners to attend the division: and we hope our good Uncle in his Royal justice and favor to our Sister his Neece, and her many distressed children, will not add affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to affliction, but rather give them help by his forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in this our gift, which we can no more revoke.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>If this prevail not, you shall modestly demand what those Debts are wherof he expecteth compensation; and therin to clear all misunderstanding, you are thus to distinguish. The Debts to which our Uncle pretendeth, are of two kinds, all contracted by our Father of blessed memory, and not by us.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>First, our Father after that our Uncle had undertaken the <hi>German</hi> War, sent Sir <hi>Robert Anstruther</hi> with an advance of forty six thousand pounds present moneys, and promised to pay thirty thousand pounds monthly so our Uncle wold main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one thousand horse, and four thousand foot, for restoring our Brother and Sister to all their Patrimonial Dignities and Estates. If then our Uncle shall declare, that this is the debt he pretendeth to defalque out of the divided Goods; you shall with due respects (and as it were unwillingly) call unto his mind what manner of performance was found on his part, and how little those designes have bin advanced for which our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expressed his Royal affection by so large an offer; which caused us at our coming to the Crown to send the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> to meet our Uncles Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors at the <hi>Hague</hi> to qualifie those indigested assumptions, made <hi>de bene esse,</hi> for the present, without debate of Articles indifferent for both parts. And then (as our Uncle well knoweth) we setled the accompt upon a new foot, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought no more to be called back to those exorbitant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which notwithstanding upon due calculation of all our disbursements in money, and in charges of our Auxiliary aids and diversions, we have so much exceeded: That (lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a side all exception for not performing conditions) we have just cause to claim retribution, or at least acknowledgment of well-deserved thanks, and not to be now strained for compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of those Debts. Of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>
                        <q>But ther is another debt for money borrowed by our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which we do acknowledg both principal and interest, and for liquidation therof have given former directions to our Ambassador Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> who is to meet the Kings Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters at the <hi>Hague</hi> in his return out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of a cours for our Uncles satisfaction, according to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and our desire. Upon this meeting (if otherwise you cannot) you must discharge your self; and having setled the division of the Portion, and put off the accompts in this manner, you shall afterwards proceed as you find time and opportunity to your more weighty negotiation concerning the common cause; representing to that King our Uncle the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state of <hi>Christendome,</hi> specially of <hi>Germany,</hi> the seat of the War, that upon a mature consideration therof both he and we may best advise how to govern our Proceedings, as well for our safety as for our interests with others, and chiefly for the obtaining of a sure peace, which is to be desired for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good. To this purpose you shall move him to cast his eyes upon that progress the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> (his Neighbour) hath already made by his sword, almost through the Empire, beyond all mens expectation: and to foresee in his great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome what the consequence will be, if by victorious Arms he shall obtain power to give the Princes and States on both sides what Law shall please himself; which may reasonably be feared, if no cours be timely taken for preservation of their rights by treaty or otherwise.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>On the other side you may lay before him the power yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the puissant house of <hi>Austria,</hi> with the dependance of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and other <hi>German</hi> Princes; and how both sides are supported by forren assistants, those with the money and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of <hi>Spain,</hi> these with the actual arms of <hi>France,</hi> besides the diversions of the Low Countries and <hi>Italy;</hi> so as in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability the War is like to last long, and the balance may be swayd as other Princes put to their hands.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>And the King of <hi>Swede</hi> having lately moved both the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States of his alliance, and others, to joyn league for the liberty of <hi>Germany,</hi> and for peace, and inviting us to joyn ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: and the Emperour also discovering on his side an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to treaty and to peace, you must entreat for our better information our Uncles sound advice, and how he stands affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and whether he be engaged in any such treaty; with whom, and how far; and whether our conjunction with the rest will be desired. To which we may by him be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to apply our selves, so as by the treaty the full restitution of our Brother and Sister to their Patrimonial Dignities and Estates, (being the only interest of our engagement) may be effectually provided for. If upon these intimations the King shall reveal unto you any overtures of a treaty already in hand, and that therin our conjunction will be desired, you shall with speed give us account of the particulars, and of the grounds therof, with all the circumstances of persons, times and places,

By these two Presidents of Commission and Instructions, we may see how exact and curious the English Court is in this point; how quaintly such Publik Dispatches are couchd, not so plain and flat, with such superfluity of speech as I have seen the Instructions of other Princes stuffd withal.</p>
               <p>We will to the Reception, Attendance, Treatments, Gifts, (<hi>Lautia</hi>) composing of Differences, with other high civilities usd towards Forren Ambassadors in the English Court.</p>
               <p>Touching the first, Ther are no Ambassadors whatsoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceavd more splendidly, and with greater state both by water and land, then in <hi>England:</hi> For first, he is brought in Royal Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges a good way upon a Noble Navigable River, through a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of main Masts on both sides, and landed at the stairs of a huge Tower in sight of a stupendious Bridg, such as I may well say the world hath not the like. Then is he conducted in the Kings Coach with a great number besides through the centre of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>London,</hi> to a house expresly provided for him if he comes extraordinary, where he is magnificently treated for divers days upon the Kings charge. Now the Rule of the Court is, That the Ambassador of a <hi>King</hi> is to be brought in by an <hi>Earl</hi> at least; an Ambassador from <hi>Dukes</hi> and Republiks to be brought in by a <hi>Baron.</hi> Tis a Rule also that no Ambassadors be allowd this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor at privat Audiences but only at the first and last publik, or when any are invited to Dine with the King. Moreover, that no Ambassador except a <hi>Kings,</hi> is to be met with the Kings Coach further off then the Tower-wharf: And wheras the Coaches of other Ambassadors residing upon the place were usd to go to accompany the new-landed Ambassador from Tower-wharf, which gave occasion of clashing for Precede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ce of Coaches, as happened the last yeer twixt the Spanish Ambassador, the Baron of <hi>Batteville,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Lestrade</hi> the French, which flew so high that it went to effusion of blood, and killing, (as it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiond before in the last Paragraph of the first Section more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly) Ther is an Act of State passd, that all Forren Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors shall forbear for the future from that complement of sending their Coaches to that purpose. Well, the new Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador being so housd, is visited by persons of Quality, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by other Ambassadors: Now, it is a Maxime among Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, <hi>That the first come is to visit the last come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching Presents, ther's no Court goes beyond that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> It was a Rule that the French and Spanish Ordinaries were to have 4000 Ounces of Gilt Plate at their departure; The Venetian Ambassador 2000; The Archdukes 1600, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But (by the Examples of other Courts) ther was a retrenchment
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59014:114"/>
herof, and it began first with Monsieur <hi>Buisseaux</hi> in King <hi>Iames</hi> his Raign; who had but 2000 Ounces sent Him; the Venetian 1600, and the Archdukes 1000, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching divers sorts of Clashes, Contestations, Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Punctilios betwixt Ambassadors, ther have bin as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and preventing courses taken in the English Court from time to time as in any other; as will appeer in the printed Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations of that worthy Knight Sir <hi>Iohn Finets,</hi> to whom I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>We will conclude this Paragraph with some further inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the Laws of <hi>England</hi> concerning Ambassadors. In the 13 of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> it was gravely debated in the Bishop of <hi>Rosse</hi> his case, who was Ambassador here for <hi>Scotland, An Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus qui Rebellionem contra Principem ad quem Legatus, concitat, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gati privilegi is gaudeat, an ut hostis poenis subjaceat:</hi> Whether an <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador</hi> who raiseth Rebellion against the Prince to whom he is sent, is to enjoy the privileges of an <hi>Ambassador;</hi> or whether he is to lie under a punishment as an Enemy; It was resolved by all the Judges of the Land that he had lost the privileges of an <hi>Ambassador,</hi> and was punishable by the Law of the Land.

               </p>
               <p>Moreover, as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> hath it, and therin he agreeth with the Civilians, If an <hi>Ambassador</hi> committeth a delect <hi>contra Ius Gentium,</hi> as Treason, Felony, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he loseth the privilege of an <hi>Ambassador,</hi> and may be punished in <hi>England</hi> as any privat <hi>Alien,</hi> and not to be remanded but upon courtesie: But committing any thing against the privat Municipal Law and Customes of <hi>England,</hi> which is not <hi>Malum in se Iure gentium,</hi> He is not punishable. The breaking of Truces and Safe-conducts was once High Treason by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> but that was mitigated 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. Furthermore, my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> holds in his fourth Institut, That if one be namd but <hi>Agent</hi> in his Credenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als from a King, yet he is an <hi>Ambassador.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>AS it is a principal quality in an <hi>Ambassador</hi> to be serious, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse, and reservd in the discharge of his Function; so it is a mighty advantage for him to be <hi>Witty</hi> as well as <hi>Wise;</hi> to be facetious, and play the <hi>Drol</hi> sometimes; for the Italian says, <hi>Non è saggio chi non sà esser pazzo,</hi> He is not wise who knows not how to play the Fool sometimes. Apt, pleasant and sudden Reparties discover a great deal of wit. An Ambassador being sent to the King of <hi>Morocco</hi> (whose Law we know is not to eat Swines Flesh) be brought him Letters wherin all his Titles were not given him; The King said, <hi>Sus has Literas peperit,</hi> A Sow begat these Letters. The Ambassador suddenly answerd, <hi>Ne iis Vescaris,</hi> It was done that you shold not eat them. The Town of <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> reports, having sent <hi>Gellias</hi> a very hard-favord man <hi>Ambassador</hi> to <hi>Centuripe,</hi> a low dirty Town in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and being jeerd, and stard upon at his audience, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerd, <hi>Ne Miremini Centuripini, ut Urbes sunt, ita Cives mei Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos mittunt, pulchros ad pulchras, deformes ad deformes:</hi> Do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, O you of <hi>Centuripe</hi> at <hi>me,</hi> for my Masters of <hi>Agrigentum</hi> send their Ambassadors as the Cities are, Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, Foul to Foul. Don <hi>Pedro de Toledo</hi> being employd Ambassador to <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. of <hi>France,</hi> ther were many traverses between them at one privat audience, and Don <hi>Pedro</hi> magnifying much the power of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy, King <hi>Henry</hi> said, That it was much like the Statue of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> composd of divers peeces, but having Feet of clay; Don <hi>Pedro</hi> then replying somewhat high, the King rejoynd that if he were provokd he wold carry flames even to the <hi>Escurial;</hi> and if that he once mounted, he wold be soon in <hi>Madrid.</hi> Don <hi>Pedro</hi> answerd, <hi>Indeed King</hi> Francis <hi>was there,</hi> meaning <hi>Francis</hi> the first, who was taken at the Battail of <hi>Pavia,</hi> and remaind Prisoner in <hi>Madrid</hi> divers yeers; The King going on further to tax the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for usurping divers Countries of his, and namely the Kingdome of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which he might live to recover; Don <hi>Pedro</hi> answerd, <hi>That the Iustice wherby the King his Master held Navarre, wold help him to defend it;</hi> The King replyd, Your reason is good till I be in <hi>Pampelona; Don Pedro</hi> therupon rising hastily, and going towards the door; The King askd whither went he so hastily? He answerd, <hi>To provide enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for your Majesty at</hi> Pampelona. A <hi>French</hi> Ambassador (Monsieur <hi>de Tilliers</hi> as I take it) residing here, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59014:115"/>
one day to Dine with <hi>King Iames,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> being well disposd began a Health to him, saying, The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> drinks the French Kings Health; The <hi>Ambassador</hi> answerd as pleasantly, <hi>Le Roy mon Maitre est bon Lieutenant, Il tient bien la France de Luy;</hi> The King my Master is a good Lieutenant, he holds <hi>France</hi> well from him. But of any that I have heard or read of, <hi>Don Diego de Acunia Count of Gondamar,</hi> had an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary faculty this way; and besides, he had well studied the Genius of King <hi>Iames,</hi> (in whose Raign he resided here) how he was pleasd with sudden plesant Reparties, therfore he did <hi>Seria jocose,</hi> he did dispatch serious things in a merry way. When Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> was gone with a Fleet to <hi>Guiana,</hi> and when news was broght that he had taken <hi>San Toma,</hi> plunderd the place, and killd the Governor, which was as some say beyond the bounds of his Commission, wherin he was restraind from doing any Acts of hostility upon the <hi>firm Land, Gondamar</hi> came early one morning to the King, desiring to speak but only <hi>one word</hi> to his Majesty: being admitted, he cryed out, <hi>Pyratas, Pyratas, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratas;</hi> intimating that Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> was turnd Pyrat; but that word was so fatal, that it took off Sir <hi>Walters</hi> head, though upon an old score.</p>
               <p>Another time having discoursd of many things with the King in a privat audience in <hi>French,</hi> the King askd him whether he understood <hi>Latin</hi> or no? Yes, Sir, said <hi>Gondomar,</hi> I understand it, and speak it. Discoursing afterwards in <hi>Latin</hi> of divers things in a free and facetions way, it happend that <hi>Gondamar</hi> spoke false <hi>Latin</hi> once or twice; the King smiling, said, How comes it to pass that you being an <hi>Ambassador</hi> to so great a <hi>King,</hi> who shold be exact in all things, how comes it that you break <hi>Prisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> head so often? <hi>Gondamar</hi> replyed, <hi>Sir, I speak Latin like a King, and your Majesty speaks Latin like an Ambassador.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Count <hi>Gondamar</hi> having bin outragd by the Rabble in <hi>London,</hi> who threw Tobacco-pipes into his Litter, and did him other affronts, coming after to have a privat audience, and the King taking notice of it, he said, <hi>La Harina de Ingalatierra es muy del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gada, y fina, pero el afrecho es muy grossero:</hi> Sir, the Flowre of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (meaning the Gentry) is very fine; but the Bran is very coorse, meaning the common peeple.</p>
               <p>Another time being to dispatch a Courrier to <hi>Spain,</hi> and the old Countess of <hi>Buckingham</hi> being then in extraordinary high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, that most Suters made their address unto her, he writ in a Postscript to Count <hi>Olivares,</hi> That ther were never greater hopes then now that <hi>England</hi> wold turn <hi>Roman</hi> Catholik, for the Mother was more worshippd then the Son.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Gondamar</hi> being invited another time to Dine with the Reader at <hi>Grayes</hi> Inne, at which time the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> was newly
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59014:116"/>
come to <hi>Prague,</hi> among other Healths ther was one begun to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> He pledgd it very merrily, and thankd the Reader, with the rest of the Company; for it was the first time that ever he pledgd the <hi>Emperours</hi> Health in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having another time dispatchd an <hi>Express</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> and the weather having continued dark and clowdy in <hi>London</hi> for many days, the Post having receavd the Packet, and taken his leave, Count <hi>Gondamar</hi> commanded, and told him, I forgot one thing, I prethee when thou art come to <hi>Spain</hi> commend me to the <hi>Sun,</hi> for I have not seen him here a great while, and I am sure thou wilt meet with him there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>King Iames</hi> having granted leave to Count <hi>Gondamar</hi> to raise Volonteers to <hi>Flanders</hi> for the service of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> under my Lord <hi>Vaux,</hi> and soldiers coming but slowly to the sound of the Drum; <hi>Gondamar</hi> coming a little afterwards to Court, the <hi>King</hi> askd him what number of soldiers he had levied? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerd, <hi>Truly, Sir, I can have but few soldiers, but thousands that wold be Captains though they were but common soldiers before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will conclude with Count <hi>Gondamar</hi> in this very witty pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage: when he was to take his leave of <hi>England</hi> in his last Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy, the <hi>King</hi> sent to my Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> to invite him to Dinner; which he did with much solemnity, having bid the chiefest Lords of the Court to bear him company: At first the Lord Mayor after other Complements told him, My Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, your Excellency me thinks begins to grow very gray. Yes, Sir, said he; but my Lord Mayor, we have a Proverb in <hi>Spain, Canos y Cuernos no Uienen Porannos;</hi> Gray Hairs and Horns come not by yeers. Being sate at Table, the Lord Mayor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan divers Healths; at last <hi>Gondamar</hi> calls for a good Glass-full of Canary, and said, You are the greatest Magistrat in the world, for you give place to none but to your own <hi>King,</hi> as I hear, and you live also as plentifully: But now that you have made so much of me, that having pledgd so many Healths you put me in a Jovial humor, I crave leave of these Noble Lords and you to begin a Health or two; and the first shall be to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spains</hi> Mistress; so the Health was drunk round. Then he took another Glass of Canary, and began a Health to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spains</hi> Wife; which also passd round among the Lords and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen. Then standing up, He thankd them all with many Complements, and said, I will now discover who these two Ladies are; The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spains Mistress</hi> is the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and his <hi>Wife</hi> the <hi>West-Indies;</hi> Ther's none so fond of a Mistress but that if a Frend hath a favor of her, he will connive at it, as you my Lord Mayor, and these worthy Aldermen whom I have in my eye, use to have of the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> But my Masters <hi>Wife</hi> is the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> which he desires to have soly to himself accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59014:116"/>
to the Law of Nations; Therfore I pray you my Lord Mayor, and these Noble Aldermen, do not offer to meddle with the <hi>King</hi> my Masters <hi>Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will now proceed to a few others. An Ambassador Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary being sent by an Italian Prince to the Emperour that he wold confer the Title of <hi>Serenity</hi> upon his Master as he had done lately upon divers other Princes; But being to depart <hi>Re infectâ,</hi> and taking his leave of the Emperour that morning, and the weather being foul and very tempestuous, he askd what was the reason he wold begin his Journey upon such stormy weather? He answerd, <hi>Ilne faut pas craindre la Tempeste, puis que votre Majesté à remply le monde de tant de Serenité;</hi> One ought not to fear Tempests, since your Majesty hath filld the world with such <hi>Serenity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Don <hi>Pedro Andrea</hi> being sent Ambassador to a Prince whom he had offended so far that he threatned to have his head cut off, He answerd, Sir, my dead head will do you more mischief then now that tis living.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Francisco Marco</hi> being sent from <hi>Genoa</hi> to <hi>Galeazzo</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> but being delayed audience, and St. <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, who was Protector of <hi>Milan,</hi> he presented the Duke with a Golden Vessel full of <hi>Basilique;</hi> Being askd the reason, he sent word that the <hi>Genouois have the property of the Herb Basilique, which if one handle gently, it will yeeld a sweet smell; but if it be rubbd, and trod upon it, it will engender Serpents:</hi> And this witty passage conducd much towards the ending of the differences which were then a foot.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Samnits</hi> being pressd hard by the <hi>Romans,</hi> they sent <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors</hi> to capitulat; who said, <hi>Noble Romans, you are grown too strong for us; therfore if you propose moderat terms we will observe them eternally: if otherwise, we will observe them no longer then till we have opportunity to break them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Ambassador wanted no wit, who being in a Pagan Country, and standing in the way where the great Idol whom all were to worship which passd by, he let fall his Ring, and as he bowd to take it up, twas thought he adord the Idol.</p>
               <p>The Ambassadors of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> being at <hi>Sigismund</hi> the Emperours Court, and ther being always competition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them for Precedence of Session, they met casually at a place, where the <hi>Portugais</hi> having come before, he was got into the upper Chair; The <hi>Pole</hi> rising up, and making a step for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in a posture as if he wold speak with him, and the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gais</hi> coming towards him, he whippd behind him into the upper Chair, and so kept it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:59014:117"/>We will conclude this Paragraph with the two <hi>Ambassadors</hi> of <hi>Perugia</hi> sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> wherof the one was witty, but the other not so wise: Being admitted to the Pope, who was then very sick a bed, one of made them a long tedious Speech, wherof the Pope had shewn signes of distast: Therupon the second said, Most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, our Commission implies, that if your Beatitude will not suddenly dispatch us with satisfaction, my Collegue shold recommence his Speech, and pronounce it again more lesurely. The <hi>Pope</hi> was so taken with this, that he gave order they shold be presently dispatchd.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WE will begin with that <hi>Grandee</hi> of his time Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> who went over to <hi>France</hi> upon an Extraordinary <hi>Embassy;</hi> and he had to attend him (though not in joynt commission) <hi>Cutbert Tunstal</hi> Bishop of <hi>London;</hi> the Lord <hi>Sands,</hi> late <hi>Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi> to the King; the Earl of <hi>Derby;</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Moore;</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Guilford,</hi> with other Knights and Gentlemen of great rank, to the number of a thousand two hundred horse: for after a short transfretation from <hi>Dover,</hi> he had so many in his train when he went out of <hi>Calice.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Francis</hi> 1. in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with his <hi>Mother,</hi> and most of the chief <hi>Peers,</hi> came to meet Him as far as <hi>Amyens,</hi> above two days distant from <hi>Paris.</hi> He carried with him <hi>140000l.</hi> sterling, a prodigious sum in those days, (though Silver was but <hi>20d.</hi> an Ounce) He transported that vast sum with him to assist the <hi>French</hi> King, and other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federats in a War against <hi>Charles</hi> 5. Emperour. Ther is no History can parallel this <hi>Embassy,</hi> it was performd with such a glorious Equippage; Besides, the <hi>Ambassador</hi> had such a Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiary and transcendent Cummission, that he gave the Law both to <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Popedome;</hi> and he comported himself with such dexterity and high wisdome, that all the Princes of Christendome (who had their eyes fixt upon him) admired him.</p>
               <p>This second example shall be of another strain of Gallantry by Sir <hi>Ierome Bowes,</hi> who was employd <hi>Ambassador</hi> to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Russia,</hi> who was cryed up for a Tyrant; Sir <hi>Ierome</hi> at his first audience having some affronts offerd to be put upon him, that he shold put off his Hat, els it shold be naild to his head, he was not a whit daunted, but kept it on still, saying, he had no such
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59014:117"/>
commission from the Queen his Mistress. Therupon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour slighting the <hi>Queen</hi> in comparison of the Emperour of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> who was the only Prince Paramount; Sir <hi>Ierome</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That his great Mistresses Father had the <hi>Emperour</hi> (his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty speaks of) to serve him in the Wars, and receavd pay of him. Wherupon with a kind of astonishment at his courage he part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed peaceably. But afterwards being advancd in his Journey as far as <hi>Archangel,</hi> and being embarkd, ther came some of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Officers with Presents of rich Furs for the Queen, and some for himself; and being come to the side of the ship with them, He wold not suffer them to board, but drawing out his Sword, said, My Mistress the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath no need of your Catskins, nor I neither, therfore you may carry them back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ambassadors</hi> being sent to <hi>Bourbourgh</hi> to treat of a Truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> Doctor <hi>Dale</hi> was sent for an assistant; and coming to kiss the <hi>Queens</hi> hands, she told him, That understanding he was a Learned Man, and a good <hi>Civilian,</hi> she made choice of him for that employment, and she wold allow him <hi>20s.</hi> a day. He humbly thankd her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and said he wold spend nineteen of them evry day for her Majesties honor: therupon the <hi>Queen</hi> asking him what he wold do with the other odd shilling; he replyed, I will keep that for my Wife <hi>Kate:</hi> so the <hi>Queen</hi> encreasd his allowance. Being assembled to treat, ther was a Debate in what <hi>Language</hi> they shold treat: the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador thinking to put a jeer upon our Ambassadors, said, Let us treat in <hi>French,</hi> for your <hi>Queen</hi> is Queen of <hi>France.</hi> No, said Doctor <hi>Dale,</hi> then let us treat in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for your Master the King of <hi>Spain</hi> calls himself King of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>

               <p>Sir <hi>Edward Herbert</hi> late Earl of <hi>Cherberry,</hi> being <hi>Ambassador</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> it happend that he had a clash with the great Favorit, and Constable <hi>Luynes,</hi> which was thus: Sir <hi>Edward</hi> had receavd pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat Instructions from <hi>England</hi> to mediat a Peace for <hi>Them of the Religion;</hi> and in case of refusal, to use certain Menaces. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon He coming to the Army which was then before St. <hi>Iean d'Angely,</hi> where the King was in person, and he finding that the approches to the Town were almost finishd, He hastned his address to the King for an audience. The King referrd him to <hi>Luynes,</hi> desiring that what he had to say might be imparted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Him:</hi> Wherupon he went accordingly to <hi>Luynes</hi> Lodgings, and deliverd his Message; but so that he reservd the latter part, which was Menaces until he heard how the business was relishd. <hi>Luynes</hi> had hid behind the Hangings a Gentleman of the <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> who was upon point of turning <hi>Roman,</hi> that being an Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witness of what had passd between the English <hi>Ambassador</hi> and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59014:118"/>
                  <hi>Luynes,</hi> he might relate unto Them of the <hi>Religion</hi> what little hopes they were to expect from the intercession of the King of <hi>England.</hi> The Ambassador and <hi>Luynes</hi> having mingled some Speeches, the language of <hi>Luynes</hi> was very haughty, saying, <hi>What hath your Master to do with our Affairs? why doth he meddle with our Actions?</hi> Sir <hi>Edward</hi> replyed, <hi>It is not you to whom the King my Master doth owe an account of his Actions; and for Me, tis enough that I obey</hi> Him: <hi>In the mean time I must maintain that the King my Master hath more reason to do what he pleaseth to do, then you have to ask why he doth it; Nevertheless if you desire me in a gentle fashion I shall acquaint you further.</hi> Wherupon <hi>Luynes</hi> bowing a little, said, <hi>Very well.</hi> The Ambassador answerd, That it was not on this occasion only that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> had desired the peace and prosperity of <hi>France,</hi> but upon all other occasions whensoever any troubles were raisd in that Country; And this he said was his first reason. The second was, That when a Peace was setled there, his Majesty of <hi>France</hi> might be better disposd to assist the Palatin in the affairs of <hi>Germany. Luynes</hi> said, We will none of your advices. The Ambassador replyed, That He took that for an answer, and was sorry only that the affection and good will of the <hi>King</hi> his Master was not sufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; and that since twas rejected in that manner, He could do no less then say, that the <hi>King</hi> his Master knew well enough what He had to do. <hi>Luynes</hi> answerd, We are not afraid of you. The Ambassador smiling a little, replyed, If you had said you had not <hi>loved</hi> us, I shold have beleevd you, and made you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answer; in the mean time all that I will tell you more, is this, <hi>That we know very well what we have to do. Luynes</hi> herupon rising a little from his Chair with a fashion and countenance much discomposd, said, <hi>By God, if you were not Monsieur the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador I know very well how I wold use you.</hi> The Ambassador r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing also from his Chair, said, That as he was his Majestie of <hi>Great Britain's</hi> Ambassador, so he was also a Gentleman, and that his Sword (wheron he laid his hand) shold do him reason if he had taken any offence. After which <hi>Luynes</hi> replying nothing, the Ambassador went on his way towards the door, and <hi>Luynes</hi> seeming to accompany him, the Ambassador told him, That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such Language ther was no occasion to use such ceremony, and so departed, expecting to hear further from him. But no message being brought him from <hi>Luynes,</hi> he did in poursuance of his Instructions demand audience of the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Coignac,</hi> St. <hi>Iean d'Angely</hi> being now renderd up; who granting it, he did in the same terms, and upon the same motives mediat a Peace for Them of the <hi>Religion,</hi> and receavd a far more gentle answer from the <hi>King.</hi> The Marshal of St. <hi>Geran</hi> coming to Sir <hi>Edward Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart,</hi> told him in a frendly manner, <hi>You have offended the Constable,</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:59014:118"/>
and you are not in a place of surety here. Wherunto he answerd, <hi>That he held himself to be in a place of surety whersoever he had his sword by him.</hi>

                  <hi>Luynes</hi> little resenting the affront he had receavd from Sir <hi>Edward Herbert,</hi> got <hi>Cadenet</hi> his Brother Duke of <hi>Chaune</hi> with a ruffling Train of Field-Officers, neer upon a hundred, (wherof ther was not one, as <hi>Cadenet</hi> told King <hi>Iames,</hi> but <hi>had killd his man</hi>) I say, this Man came Ambassador Extraordinary to <hi>England</hi> a little after, who mis-reporting the Traverses twixt <hi>Herbert</hi> and <hi>Luynes,</hi> prevailed so far, that Sir <hi>Edward Herbert</hi> was presently revokd to answer the Charge that shold be laid against him. In the mean time the Earl of <hi>Carlile</hi> was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployd Ambassador Extraordinary to <hi>France</hi> for accommodating <hi>Le Mal Entendu</hi> which might arise betwixt the two Crowns. <hi>Carlile</hi> was commanded to inform himself of the truth of the business aforementiond, and he could meet with no relation but what <hi>Luynes</hi> had made himself, wherin more affronting and haughty expressions were laid to Sir <hi>Edward Herberts</hi> charge then had truly passed: For though the first provocation came from <hi>Luynes,</hi> yet the <hi>Ambassador</hi> kept himself within the bounds both of his Instructions and Honor. But as my Lord of <hi>Carlile</hi> was ready to send this mis-information to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Gentleman formerly spoken of who stood behind the Hangings came to the Earl of <hi>Carlile,</hi> and said, That he owd so much duty to Truth and Honor that he could do no less then vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat Cavalier <hi>Herbert</hi> from all indiscretion and unworthiness; and therupon related the true circumstance of the business, which was as it was before told. The Earl of <hi>Carlile</hi> being thus rectified in knowledg of the truth, gave account to King <hi>Iames</hi> accordingly, who cleerd Sir <hi>Edward Herbert,</hi> and resolvd to renvoy him Ambassador to <hi>France,</hi> wherof he having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, He kneeld to the King before the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and desird that since the business was publik in both Kingdoms, he might in a publik way demand reparation of Monsieur <hi>Luynes:</hi> for which purpose he beseechd his Majesty that a Trumpeter if not a Herald might be sent on his part to Monsieur <hi>Luynes</hi> to tell him, That he had made a false relation of the passages before mentiond, and that Sir <hi>Edward Herbert</hi> wold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand reason of him with sword in hand on that point. The <hi>King</hi> answerd that he wold take it into consideration; but <hi>Luy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> a little after died, and Sir <hi>Edward Herbert</hi> was sent <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> to <hi>France</hi> again.</p>

                  <hi>Iohn</hi> the late Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> being <hi>Ambassador</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> had many clashes with the <hi>Alguazils,</hi> and the <hi>Alcalde</hi> himself, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with divers Officers, to preserve the <hi>Privileges</hi> of his House in point of Sanctuary, which was done with much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

and discretion. But ther was one signal passage among di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other, One <hi>Scoppius</hi> had publishd an infamous base Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>King Iames,</hi> and being in <hi>Flanders,</hi> (where Sir <hi>Iohn Benet</hi> was sent for, among other things, to demand Justice of the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke</hi> upon him) he had fled to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the Earl being in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair to get him punishd there where the <hi>Iesuits</hi> are so powerful, he employd a good resolut Gentleman Mr. <hi>George Digby</hi> his <hi>Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to give the said <hi>Scoppius</hi> a <hi>Bala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>re</hi> or slash ore the face, which he did to some purpose, for tis athwart ore his face, and his mouth that had offended, which he carried as a mark of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge to his Grave.</p>
               <p>The said <hi>Earl</hi> being also employd <hi>Ambassador</hi> to the <hi>Emperour</hi> in the heighth of the Wars for the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> and returning neer <hi>Heydelberg,</hi> or therabouts where Count <hi>Mansfelts</hi> Army was, upon which the greatest strength of the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which Army being ready to disband for want of Pay, the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> pawnd his whole Cupboard of Plate to find mony for the said Army, els all had bin lost at that time.</p>
               <p>Such an extraordinary Noble Act (and beyond Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> did propose also to do when he was <hi>Ambassador</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmark:</hi> For wheras that <hi>King</hi> made a delay to pay the Portion which was due unto the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> out of the Estate of <hi>Queen Sophia</hi> her Granmother, which amounted to about 150000 <hi>l.</hi> and which the said <hi>Earl</hi> had power to receave; and the reason of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmarks</hi> delay, being, because ther were some accounts to be liquidated twixt his Nephew the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and Him; The said Earl (provided he might receave the said Portion due to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to comfort her now in her great extremities) offerd to engage besides his <hi>Honor,</hi> all the <hi>Estate</hi> he had in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (which his Majesty must partly know) that this shold no way prejudice the accounts that were twixt <hi>Him</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> This motion of the <hi>Ambassadors</hi> was highly extolld by the <hi>King</hi> and all the <hi>Danish</hi> Court for the Nobleness of it. The said Earl being afterwards <hi>Ambassador</hi> for many yeers in <hi>France,</hi> he wold never give Precedence to Cardinal <hi>Richelieu:</hi> and touching <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> who, as he was <hi>Ambassador</hi> for <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> wold have made his Coaches drive before his, he was put back <hi>avec un pied de nez,</hi> with a Nose a footlong, as is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiond more at large in the last Paragraph of <hi>Great Britain</hi> which went before.</p>

            <p>THe Reason why ther is no Table or Index added herunto, is, That evry Page in this Work is so full of signal Remarks, that were they couchd in an Index, it wold make a Volume as big as the Book, and so make the Postern Gate to bear no proportion with the Building.</p>
