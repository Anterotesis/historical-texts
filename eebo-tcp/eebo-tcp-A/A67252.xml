            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not the design of this Discourse to intrench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any knowledg already disposed, and appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Arts and Sciences, as they are at this time delivered; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to propose such things to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and use, as, lying scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and in common, are less culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and regarded. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son 'tis in vain to expect accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of method or stile; but the first part is almost wholly writ in manner of <hi>Essaies,</hi> the second of <hi>Aphorismes:</hi> the stiles most free, loose, and unscientifical.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56954:3"/>
The most useful knowledg is that, of a mans self: and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon that more universal consideration of, <hi>Quid homo potest;</hi> naturally, and artificially: <hi>i. e.</hi> what abilities are in us originally, by the gift of God; and what attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by our own industry. And both these in order to <hi>Knowledg</hi> or <hi>Action.</hi> To advance this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, it is hoped that these papers may contribute some hints and steps; whereby others may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to perfect the whole building. Which who shall effect, or but considerably promote, shall perform a service as acceptable, as benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, to Mankind.</p>
            <p>The perfecting of a young Man in <hi>Sciences</hi> and <hi>speculative Learning</hi> is the business of so many Books and Persons; that it seems superfluous to engage in that part of Instruction. It was therefore thought more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to furnish some rules and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb facs="tcp:56954:3"/>
of <hi>Active life;</hi> as being that, whereto Gentlemen seem more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed both by their births, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral inclinations; and whereto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so little assistance could be expected from our ordinary speculations. I have therefore rather chused to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up disorderly, and bind toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, such scattered counsels and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as have occurred either in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, or in some <hi>Italian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> not ordinary amongst us. If any person shall hereby be any whit forwarded toward the attaining the great end of his Creation; 'tis all that is here aimed at. Almighty God give success according to the riches of his goodness.</p>

And these in several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are very different. For granting, what some Philosophers say, that they are <hi>originally</hi> equal in all men, as being the soul it self; yet <hi>in reality,</hi> because every soul comes into a body endued with various dispositions; and the Organs, which the soul em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth, and are as necessary to the producing its operations as the soul it self, are not in all equally well-disposed, there ariseth great <hi>variety of capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and abilities:</hi> God Almighty distributing these his <hi>Gifts of Nature</hi> to every one in what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure himself thinks fittest.</p>

2. I know there are, who accuse the divine Providence, as more niggardly or sparing towards <hi>men,</hi> then other <hi>Animals;</hi> which <hi>without teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> know not onely what is sufficient for their <hi>subsistence,</hi> but some things also, which men learn by <hi>long imitation:</hi> As, to go, to swim, to express their passions and thoughts. Yea and some manual arts, which are in us the <hi>effects of Education,</hi> are in beasts the <hi>actions of sense, or instinct.</hi> But truely this complaint is without reason. For if we think <hi>Impotency</hi> to be an <hi>advantage,</hi> and those creatures to be in the <hi>best condition</hi> who have <hi>least to do;</hi> it is true that beasts are happier than men, and vegetables than Animals. But if every thing be <hi>made for action,</hi> and the more <hi>able it is to work,</hi> the more <hi>noble;</hi> if <hi>plus posse</hi> follows &amp; argues <hi>nobilius &amp; perfectius esse;</hi> then is our condition infinitely the better; as not only having <hi>more,</hi> but <hi>more various, more sublime, and more difficult</hi> Operations. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for beasts to be born with haire, feathers, scales, or shels, because they had not the <hi>ingeny</hi> to make themselves <hi>garments;</hi> which, to their very great convenience, they might <hi>alter according to the seasons:</hi> nor had they the knowledge of <hi>creating fire, building houses,</hi> and the like. Nature furnished them with <hi>beaks, claws, and horns,</hi> because they could never arrive to find out a <hi>stone,</hi> to be <hi>melted</hi> and <hi>framed</hi> into <hi>all sorts of instruments</hi> and <hi>utensils.</hi> Their knowledge ariseth no higher then of what is <hi>pleasant</hi> or <hi>painful;</hi> they apprehend not <hi>conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> or <hi>inconvenient; just,</hi> or <hi>unjust; happy,</hi> or <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> God, as a Master of a family, gives the <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> their <hi>set salary,</hi> and <hi>employs them;</hi> but his <hi>Children</hi> he <hi>educates</hi> and <hi>instructs</hi> to <hi>command</hi> and <hi>dispose,</hi> not <hi>their own</hi> onely, but even the faculties of <hi>all the other:</hi> therefore were beasts to live by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56954:7"/>
                  <hi>Nature,</hi> but man by <hi>Art. Beasts</hi> were to be perfect at first that they might be presently employed, <hi>man</hi> by <hi>habits</hi> of his own acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. For <hi>beasts,</hi> besides their sustentation in this present life, were to expect no other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense; but <hi>man</hi> by his labour was to merit, and by wel-employing his abilities to inherit a <hi>reward,</hi> and that <hi>eternal.</hi> He made indeed no creature, which he endowed not with <hi>sufficient</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities for the uses of their Creation: and most also with a power to <hi>better</hi> and <hi>advance</hi> them by assiduous practice; but the <hi>end of all inferior Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> was comprehended in their <hi>actions of life,</hi> for the conserving, and propagating <hi>that:</hi> But man he created capable of a <hi>supernatural employment;</hi> of a life to be continued infinitely <hi>beyond</hi> and <hi>above</hi> this small moment; and of operations sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limer then providing for the belly. And therefore he adorned him with faculties accordingly; an ability to <hi>discern</hi> betwixt <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad, virtue</hi> and <hi>vice; reflection</hi> upon his <hi>own actions;</hi> an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>comprehend</hi> the <hi>whole World;</hi> and more then that also, <hi>to be present</hi> to all <hi>past,</hi> and <hi>future,</hi> as well as <hi>present things;</hi> to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply a <hi>small inconsiderable</hi> proposition to <hi>infinity;</hi> and to <hi>know him</hi> who <hi>exceedeth all knowledg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. NOR are these faculties even <hi>in infants</hi> (tho imperfect) altogether <hi>obscure.</hi> For as soon as they have strength (with which beasts are born) they do more then <hi>beasts;</hi> they exert greater testimonies of Natures bounty, framing in themselves <hi>human actions,</hi> whereas beasts work only according to their <hi>own kind.</hi> For even the nobler faculties shew themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; <hi>Fancy</hi> in <hi>imitation of others; Memory</hi> in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi>

what is imitated; and <hi>Judgment</hi> in <hi>select<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> certain actions, and parts of actions for their imitation, which are the principles and manner of all learning. I deny not, but sometimes there is such <hi>an impotency, or defect</hi> in the Organs (which also I doubt not most frequently, if not alwaies, to be a disease, and often curable by a discreet Physician) as renders the subjects, according to the degrees of the indisposition, <hi>unfit</hi> or <hi>uncapable</hi> of any Instruction; and that all labour bestowed upon them is lost: or at least so unapt are they, as it is not <hi>tanti</hi> to employ so much industry as is requisite to render them, <hi>indifferently,</hi> like other men. Neither is this exact <hi>difference of capacities</hi> alwaies (in childhood especially) so <hi>easily discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> as it may be with <hi>conversation</hi> and <hi>tryal.</hi> Let the <hi>Educator</hi> therefore think himself to be but as a <hi>Midwife,</hi> who cannot bring forth a child, where there is none; but where there is, can assist the birth, though the mother be sickly, and the child infirm. And <hi>as</hi> it is loss of labour to <hi>sow</hi> where there is <hi>no soil;</hi> and <hi>as</hi> where the parts are mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the greater measure of cultivating by Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and practice is requisite; by which even mean parts may be bettered: <hi>So</hi> where there is a greater measure of parts, <hi>less institution</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> will advance in them a <hi>greater harvest,</hi> and <hi>great industry</hi> will raise them to <hi>admiration.</hi> Of these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>degrees,</hi> it is diligently to be considered, that some have a <hi>bare capacity,</hi> sufficient to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, moving only as they are drawn; who, like <hi>Bottles,</hi> render no more then is just put into them. Others have a <hi>great inclination</hi> to knowledg, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when once set in the way, either to any, or some one science in particular; and having the grounds and principles given, they are able to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56954:8"/>
                  <hi>raise Conclusions,</hi> gather <hi>Corollaries;</hi> and having the <hi>foundation</hi> laid, <hi>build</hi> up the rest themselves. Others (though few) are as <hi>automata,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, their <hi>own Masters;</hi> and have a <hi>genius,</hi> or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what extraordinary, to assist them. Which who so have, and withal a probity of affection, and willingnes to take pains, they seem set out by God himself richly fraught for his glory, and the good of Mankind. It is also to be observed, that, where there is a <hi>great indisposition to one study,</hi> (as many times there is, some being by nature more <hi>inventive,</hi> others more <hi>retentive;</hi> some very <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi> others <hi>slow,</hi> &amp;c.) it is seldome worth the labour to strive to introduce the <hi>contrary to such inclination. Amended</hi> and <hi>bettered</hi> such persons may be, but <hi>totally cured</hi> they rarely are; and in their own way they may prosper excellently with less pains. I speak not here of inclination to virtue or vice; for there is no man so disposed, but he may be virtuous if he please, as shall be shewed hereafter. This of Capacities.</p>

produce good or evil; and <hi>great parts</hi> (as <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi> was told by his Master, <hi>fili, tu nihil me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocre eris, sed vel magnum patriae lumen, vel magna pestis)</hi> are fitted for <hi>great,</hi> whether <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings; <hi>great errors</hi> and <hi>wickednesses</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only from <hi>great Wits. Education</hi> and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline form our <hi>manners;</hi> and that only every one <hi>knows</hi> which he is <hi>taught.</hi> The faculties of the soul can work of themselves; but as not except upon an external object; so neither to the <hi>utmost of their power,</hi> without <hi>imitation;</hi> nor in the <hi>best,</hi> i. e. the right and true <hi>manner,</hi> but by instruction. We are <hi>born</hi> with hands, feet, and tongue; and have <hi>by nature power</hi> to write, dance, and speak; yet none of these can we do, except assisted, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained, and formed by either those, whom we <hi>see so to employ</hi> the same members; or by those by whom we are, as soon as strength permits, <hi>taught</hi> and <hi>moulded</hi> into <hi>such habits.</hi> So all men are <hi>born</hi> with <hi>reason,</hi> but have not the <hi>use</hi> of it at first. And when we begin to serve our selves of it, it is so weakly, that we are easily overcome by <hi>sense,</hi> which till then hath guided us. And, if at this <hi>dangerous conjuncture</hi> we be not assisted, 'tis much to be feared our <hi>reason</hi> will be but of small use to us: especially since we find great store of <hi>tracks</hi> and encouragements in the broad <hi>way of pleasure;</hi> and therefore shall be unwilling to leave it for the narrow, rough, and <hi>unbeaten routtes</hi> of <hi>Industry</hi> and <hi>labour.</hi> It is true, that persons of <hi>very great parts</hi> can, out of their <hi>own observation,</hi> (for so all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences at first began) or when they arrive at years of discretion by the <hi>help of books,</hi> (that is, other mens experience) advance <hi>without a Teacher</hi> to a considerable perfection. As <hi>Lucullus</hi> is said to have come into <hi>Asia</hi> an <hi>excellent General,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56954:9"/>
from Rome an <hi>unexperienced Soldier.</hi> The same is also storied of the <hi>Lord Deputy Montjoy.</hi> Though, to confess the truth, these instances are not very rare: for (which seems strangely absurd) there is no Art, to obtain which less diligence is used, then this of <hi>Soldiership,</hi> though of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est consequence. But we had lately a person, who <hi>without</hi> any <hi>experience</hi> in <hi>Navigation,</hi> by reading and study, at the very <hi>first essay of his Art,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily and discreetly <hi>commanded</hi> a <hi>Ship</hi> to the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> Some commend only <hi>practice:</hi> Others think <hi>reading</hi> sufficient; both to blame: joyned together they do best. <hi>Reading</hi> advanceth more, and sooner then <hi>practise</hi> alone. A <hi>Reader</hi> is more universal, better for <hi>many things;</hi> more accurate and observant in his practise: A <hi>Practisers know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> is in a <hi>shorter compass,</hi> in ordinary cases, and is longer before it come to perfection. <hi>Reading</hi> is <hi>other mens experience,</hi> which by meditation and practise becomes <hi>our own;</hi> but it makes us some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <hi>too exact,</hi> and to expect all things should fall out according to <hi>our Imaginations;</hi> whereas the <hi>World in fancy</hi> is much different from that in <hi>reality;</hi> not clothed with those particularities, and circumstances, which are either parts of, or inseparable from it. Though <hi>reading</hi> however be good, yet 'tis best with those who have already had an <hi>Instructer;</hi> who can apply his precepts and advices to all accidents, supply defects, answer all doubts, retrench excesses, inculcate what is neglected, call to mind what is forgotten, and set his charge in the straightest and nearest way.</p>
               <p n="5">5. YET both <hi>Capacity</hi> and <hi>Instruction</hi> are effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les without <hi>practise</hi> and <hi>exercise;</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists (according to the nature of the thing to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56954:10"/>
learned) in <hi>Meditation,</hi> thinking, or contriving; <hi>observing</hi> others practises; and actually <hi>trying</hi> and working. <hi>Precepts</hi> serve very well for a guide; but advance not the guided, except himself fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; they facilitate the beginning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, but the person himself must set to his own endeavour, if ever he intends to attain perfection. Never have I seen parts, how great soever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out industry and study to produce any good; much evil indeed I have known proceed from thence. Such persons may prove sometimes <hi>plausible discoursers,</hi> and of an <hi>agreable conversation</hi> in ordinary companies for a time, till their <hi>Stock</hi> be spent: but it is industry and exercise, that renders a man <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>solid;</hi> that makes him not fear to be asked a question in what he professeth. And if <hi>industry</hi> be necessary <hi>to great,</hi> much more to <hi>mean</hi> parts; which it bettereth and advanceth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and honour. And since to have great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural parts is not in <hi>our power,</hi> but we must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with those which God hath <hi>given</hi> us; we must set our rest upon our <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>industry,</hi> for correcting our bad, bettering our indifferent, and perfecting our good <hi>inclinations.</hi> And of this (the use and profit we make of our talents) must we give a severe account. Nothing <hi>changeth</hi> Nature, but another Nature, <hi>Custome;</hi> not force, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not passion. Our <hi>thoughts</hi> are according to our <hi>inclinations,</hi> our <hi>discours</hi> and <hi>speeches</hi> according to what we <hi>have learned,</hi> but our <hi>Actions</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what we have bin <hi>accustomed.</hi> How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do we see men promise, vow, engage, yea and resolve to change <hi>v. g.</hi> an ill habit, and yet continue to do as they did before? How many see we daily who began well, and, as long as they took pains, profited exceedingly; but when tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56954:10"/>
to the goodness of their parts, and that small stock of knowledge laid in before, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it further, but giving themselves liberty of mirth and pleasure, have not only <hi>not profited,</hi> but <hi>bankerupted</hi> also, and lost their <hi>principal?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, industry and exercise of themselves <hi>render</hi> us thinking, vigilant, attentive, provident for all cases, and accidents; <hi>lay up</hi> a treasury against all events; <hi>prevent</hi> surprizes; and <hi>make</hi> us famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, and ready to all that may happen. But by idleness, and pleasures, the <hi>spirit</hi> is <hi>relaxed,</hi> the <hi>understanding unbended,</hi> the <hi>fancy over-grown with rust</hi> and rubbish, and the <hi>memory perished.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. THESE two last <hi>(Instruction,</hi> and <hi>Practise)</hi> are comprehended in <hi>Education.</hi> There is but <hi>one way and manner of learning,</hi> be the subject what ever it will. In <hi>manual Arts</hi> the Master first <hi>shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> his Apprentice what he is to do; next <hi>works</hi> it himself in his presence, and <hi>gives</hi> him rules, and then <hi>sets him to work.</hi> The same is the way of breeding a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> or a <hi>Scholar.</hi> The Educator prescribeth his <hi>end;</hi> gives him <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>precepts;</hi> presents him <hi>examples</hi> and <hi>patterns;</hi> and then <hi>sets him to act</hi> according to what was before taught him. And if the Educated apply himself seriously to meditate, contrive, observe his copy, and be content to be admonished and corrected when faulty, he will, no doubt, arrive to the intended perfection; which is to <hi>perform his duty with ease, readiness, and delight; i. e.</hi> to advance his <hi>Art</hi> into another <hi>Nature.</hi> For in this <hi>Art</hi> equals <hi>Nature,</hi> that is, as she, works without deliberation, and is indisposed to the contrary; as a good <hi>Musicians</hi> hand consulteth not what string to touch, but runs to it as readily, as <hi>Nature</hi> doth to the proper
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56954:11"/>
muscle, when she would move a finger. Only in this they differ, that <hi>Nature</hi> God hath given us, <hi>Art</hi> is of our own acquisition; <hi>Nature</hi> is <hi>perfect</hi> at the first moment, <hi>Art</hi> is not <hi>obtained</hi> without study and industry. And the <hi>earlier</hi> we begin, the <hi>better</hi> it is. For should we suffer young-men, as they say of <hi>Hercules,</hi> to chuse virtue or vice, labour or pleasure, when they come to <hi>years of Discretion;</hi> and in the interim let them spend their <hi>youth in the vanities, and follies,</hi> that age suggests to them; is not this that wherein the Devil tempted our first Parents, presenting them the excellency of the knowledge of <hi>good and evil?</hi> whereas it had bin much better to have known <hi>good</hi> only, and left <hi>evil</hi> to have been understood by the examples of such, as would not consider. But into what <hi>hazzards</hi> are these uninstructed persons cast, should it please God to <hi>cut them of</hi> in their youth? Is it not, as if they said; let them habituate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in <hi>vanity, idlenes</hi> and <hi>folly,</hi> that they may afterwards judg better of <hi>virtue, i. e.</hi> of that whereof they have no experience? How can they <hi>chuse</hi> good, since they <hi>know not</hi> what it is? and every one must follow and embrace what he knows. Shall we let them first <hi>vent their malice?</hi> but by practise <hi>it increaseth:</hi> let them <hi>defer their choice</hi> till they may make it with <hi>Discretion?</hi> but without <hi>teaching</hi> they will <hi>never come to Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For every <hi>habit,</hi> especially when accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a <hi>natural inclination</hi> (as these are by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the remainder of that evil, left in us for our exercise) <hi>hurries</hi> them <hi>violently,</hi> and at length <hi>irresistably</hi> also. At best; suppose a child should escape accidentally, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the care of parents, or his own naturally good disposition, this rock; yet those, who <hi>start late,</hi> are so <hi>far</hi>

                  <hi>behind,</hi> that when they should be <hi>ready for employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> they are <hi>learning the principles</hi> of it, and are surpriz'd and at a gaze where to begin. The great inclination of Youth is to <hi>pleasures;</hi> and that, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>idlenes</hi> and <hi>sleep;</hi> whence proceed incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, carelesnes, hatred of labour and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or else to <hi>eating, drinking,</hi> or the <hi>other lusts of the flesh.</hi> And all these, indulged and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed, grow <hi>stronger,</hi> and at last <hi>inextirpable.</hi> For they end in habitual sin, darknes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and extinguishing the light both of Gods spirit, and reason. <hi>Virtutem</hi> (saith <hi>Pasc.</hi> vit. <hi>Pibr.) nisi in primaeva germina, dum tenera sint &amp; mollia, instilletur, frustra in adultis requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras.</hi> The reason why we see so many <hi>old men fools,</hi> is because we see so many <hi>young men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned.</hi> Those, who are employed in <hi>Missions</hi> for <hi>converting Nations</hi> to Christianity, find little fruit in treating with <hi>ancient men.</hi> It is also ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to get an habitude of virtue and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in Youth, that in that Age, when our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding fails us, wee may do nothing unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming us. But the force of <hi>Education</hi> is seen in nothing more, then that whole <hi>Nations,</hi> from age to age, continue in the very same customes and manners: and to change these, especially to the better, is a difficulty even beyond imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Those, who are brought up <hi>in Wars,</hi> are active, restles, violent, ungovernable but by force; brought up <hi>in peace,</hi> lazy, unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; <hi>in trade,</hi> subtil, interessed, covetous; <hi>amongst poor men,</hi> mean-spirited; <hi>amongst idle persons,</hi> good for nothing. Again, were there a <hi>City</hi> consisting of <hi>Subjects without Education,</hi> what a <hi>confusion</hi> would it be? without obedience, without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own humors and passions, every one
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56954:12"/>
following his own lusts, without regarding any other, without discretion, civility, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out humanity it self. Tis good <hi>Education of Youth,</hi> that makes <hi>virtuous men</hi> and <hi>obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi> that fills the <hi>Court</hi> with <hi>wise Councellers,</hi> and the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> with <hi>good Patriots.</hi> Even <hi>Trees,</hi> if <hi>not cultivated</hi> when young, change their nature into <hi>wildnes;</hi> and <hi>Beasts</hi> grow fierce and resty if not tamed and broken in youth. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is bettered, and made useful by Education; and what our industry produceth in us contrary to Nature, is stronger, and converts Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it self. To <hi>neglect instructions</hi> is to <hi>want other mens experience,</hi> and to begin again at the very foundation of every Art, or Science; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by little and little advanced, and not yet perfected; he much hinders himself, that takes not advantage of the height they are already ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to. And <hi>not to exercise</hi> parts is <hi>to loose them;</hi> and <hi>not to use them to the best,</hi> is to <hi>debase</hi> and vilify them. For they, whose spirit suffers them not to be <hi>idle,</hi> and yet are not instructed to the <hi>best advantage,</hi> fall upon <hi>trifles,</hi> turning, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, hunting, or worse. One I have read of brought to <hi>Alexander,</hi> who by many years practise, had obtained the dexterity of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a small seed through a needles eye. The King for a just reward gave him a sack full of those Seeds. But <hi>Math. Huniades the Warlike King of Hungary,</hi> was more severe with him, that brought him a wooden Coat of male, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was not one ring wanting, a work of fifteen years; for he commanded him to prison for fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen yeares more, to expiate for so much time and parts spent in so fruitles an employment.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Duty of Parents in educating their Children.</head>
               <p n="1">1 I desire <hi>Parents</hi> would seriously consider, that <hi>Education of their Children is not left to their pleasure,</hi> but a <hi>duty</hi> imposed on them. <hi>God,</hi> the great Father of us all, <hi>deposited</hi> the Children in the Fathers <hi>charge;</hi> and provided by his Laws, and threatnings, they should be reverenced and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them. They are part of your selves, and what you do for them is indeed for your selves. You expect honour by them at <hi>all times,</hi> &amp; may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time also stand in <hi>need</hi> of their <hi>help.</hi> 'Tis what you either have <hi>enjoyed</hi> from <hi>your Parents,</hi> or <hi>lament your loss</hi> by their neglect. You have brought forth Children into this <hi>World of misery</hi> and <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and will you so leave them? Will you not assist them in passing through it as well as they can? It is but reasonable they should by a speedy death <hi>be taken away</hi> from the future evil, if you refuse to <hi>fortify them against it.</hi> You <hi>provide</hi> them <hi>estates;</hi> to what purpose, if you also <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> them <hi>not parts</hi> to use them? By that you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be their provident <hi>Parents,</hi> but by this you are paralleled to their <hi>good Angels,</hi> in taking care and watching over them.</p>
               <p>BUT I will speak no more of this: for though there be some inhuman and <hi>irrational Parents,</hi> that desire their Children should be like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; that think their own honour and respect eclipsed if their Sons be wiser, or worthier then
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56954:13"/>
they; and are contented their Children be wicked, least their own actions be shamed: some also who for covetuousnes, neglect, or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, will not bestow good Education upon them; yet there are so few of this sort, and their error so manifest, that it needs no further discovery.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER and not inferior <hi>error of Parents</hi> there is, that out of I know not what <hi>tendernes,</hi> they are unwilling their Children should undergo such <hi>hardships</hi> and <hi>severities</hi> as a good Education doth require. Which is, as if the <hi>mother</hi> should not suffer her new-born <hi>Infant</hi> to be molested with the pain of <hi>swathing,</hi> and <hi>binding,</hi> till it grows better able to endure that torment. Many Parents are afraid, their Childrens <hi>spirits, i. e.</hi> their <hi>obstinacy</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> should be broken with due correction, and harsher chiding.</p>
               <p>BUT the greatest, and most general <hi>error</hi> of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> is; that they desire their Children to be more <hi>plausible,</hi> then <hi>knowing;</hi> and to have a good <hi>mine,</hi> rather then a good <hi>understanding;</hi> or at least, to have both together: to employ the same time to acquire serious <hi>studies,</hi> and <hi>à-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeness;</hi> to study <hi>gravity</hi> and <hi>levity; gallantry</hi> and <hi>Philosophy</hi> together. But (besides what I said before, if these come in competition, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure will certainly carry the cause; both more time bestowed and greater proficiency shall be made in that, then the other) it seems to me little less then impossible, that <hi>two things so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> if not contrary, should be <hi>together attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> (one hour of pleasure obliterating more, then three of study will imprint;) that two so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56954:13"/>
commanding <hi>Masters</hi> should be <hi>obeyed.</hi> If the Soul can apply it self to such <hi>dissonant stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> why may not the eye also, at once, aime at two <hi>opposite marks?</hi> The <hi>Gallants</hi> chiefest study is to <hi>spend</hi> his time; the <hi>other's</hi> to <hi>save</hi> it: the <hi>one</hi> is for living in <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>mirth;</hi> the <hi>other,</hi> in <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>seriousnes.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> for <hi>adorning</hi> and <hi>trimming</hi> himself, to visit, game, play, &amp;c. the <hi>other</hi> for <hi>watchfulnes, industry, devotion.</hi> In sum, the <hi>one</hi> placeth his design to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable and acceptable to those, who <hi>understand least;</hi> to some such silly Women and Ladies, from whom if you take vanity, nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains: the <hi>other</hi> strives to approve himself to <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>holy Angels,</hi> the example of all <hi>worthy and wise men</hi> of <hi>the past</hi> and <hi>present age.</hi> Why are <hi>rich clothes</hi> but to be <hi>shown; shown</hi> to them, who best <hi>understand</hi> them? They best understand them who <hi>mind nothing else,</hi> who can judg of every punctilio of the mode, and can read a lecture upon a knot of ruban. Besides <hi>gallantry</hi> is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, except accompanied with <hi>formality</hi> of <hi>conversation, punctuality</hi> in <hi>dancing, visiting, court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> which inevitably engage them in loss of time, folly, and averting the understanding from serious and useful thoughts. And this is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentaneous to reason, as experience; for the Soul is <hi>fortified</hi> by <hi>introversion</hi> upon it self, continual meditation, and reflecting upon its operations, faculties, and the objects therein reserved: whereas all <hi>sensual pleasures call forth</hi> the forces of the Soul to the outward parts and members of the body: whence proceeds that <hi>continual combat,</hi> so much spoken of both by Philosophers and Divines, between sense and reason, the body and the soul, wisdome and pleasure.</p>

METHINKS therefore <hi>Children</hi> should be educated to all <hi>severity</hi> of labour, and virtue; and to this <hi>outward politure,</hi> by the bye only; to make <hi>those</hi> their <hi>study and employment,</hi> and to regard <hi>these</hi> so much as <hi>not to be offensive</hi> to those they converse withal. <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>recreation</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is so far necessary, as to keep up the strength and alacrity of the bodily forces, without which the Soul cannot work; But I speak not of these at this time, but of that which is esteemed <hi>a part of busines,</hi> and employment. <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> great Captains and wise men, ruin'd their families and Monarchy, because they educated their Children after the <hi>Median fashion, i. e.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst their Wives and Women; who never suffering them to want any thing, nor to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted, their <hi>delicacy</hi> made them <hi>slothful</hi> and <hi>languid;</hi> the <hi>slavery</hi> and <hi>flattery</hi> of those about them rendred them <hi>haughty</hi> and <hi>imperious:</hi> so that they could neither <hi>labour</hi> wirh <hi>cheerfulnes,</hi> nor <hi>command</hi> without <hi>arrogancy:</hi> that made them <hi>contemptible,</hi> as <hi>effeminate;</hi> this <hi>odious,</hi> as <hi>insolent.</hi> I wish the Persians were the onely faulty in this matter.

His Grand-father would not permit him to be brought up with that delicatnes, ordinarily used to persons of his quality; well knowing, that seldome lodgeth other then a mean and feeble spirit in an effeminate and tender body. Neither would he allow him rich habilements, and Childrens usual trifles: nor to be flattered or treated like a Prince. Because all these things are causers only of vanity, and rather raise pride in the hearts of Infants, then any sentiments of true generosity. But he commanded, he should be habited, and educated like the other Children of that country; that he should be accustomed to run, to leap, to climb the rocks and mountains; that by such means he might be inured to labour, &amp;c. His ordinary food also was course Bread, Beef, Cheese, and Garlick; and he often went bare-foot, and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</hi> The same care was taken by whole Nations, especially such as were of a <hi>military</hi> constitution. The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> and other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Nations Customs are to every one known. <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> describes the manner of the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Nobility of the <hi>Warlike</hi> Nation of the <hi>Goths,</hi> l. 8. c. 4. <hi>They were accustomed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure beating and wounds, to change of heat into sudden cold, to suffering of fire and frost, to lying upon boards, course and uneasy clothing, strong, but</hi>

               <p n="2">2. THE <hi>Duty of the Parents</hi> therefore is first to <hi>begin betimes;</hi> for very frequently the blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishments of Nurses, and the foolish, vain, or evil conversation of those about them, leave such impressions even upon their <hi>Infancy,</hi> as are difficultly defaced, even when the child arrives to discretion, and <hi>maturity.</hi> Besides, the <hi>Nurses</hi> form the speech, the garbe, and much of the sentiments of the child. <hi>The ancient</hi> Romans <hi>(saith</hi> Quintilian) <hi>when a child was born, put him not out to an hired Nurse, but brought him up in his Mothers chamber, under the eye of some grave and virtuous Matron, chosen out of the Neighbourhood, who was to have him continually in her presence;</hi> Coram quâ neque dicere fas erat quod turpe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu, neque facere quod inhonestum factu vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur: Ac non studia modo, sed remissiones e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, lususque puerorum sanctâ quâdam gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ac verecundiâ temperabat, &amp;c. And so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable was the Education of Children thought to be, that, as he saith, <hi>Cornelia</hi> the mother of the <hi>Gracchi, Aurelia,</hi> the mother of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> were Governesses to great mens Children.</p>
               <p n="3">3. SECONDLY, though a discreet and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Nurse be provided, yet let not the Father remit his diligence to wean him betimes; nor permit <hi>tenderness</hi> to overcome his <hi>judgment,</hi> or his present false, the durable and perfect love;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56954:15"/>
but hinder, as much as is possible, the <hi>sowing</hi> of evil seeds, and prevent the very first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and <hi>sprowtings</hi> of bad actions. There is indeed no man that seeth not the vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Childrens <hi>inclinations</hi> to virtue or vice; how easy some are <hi>advised,</hi> how difficultly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>restrained,</hi> even by correction. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in every one somewhat of that <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> derived to us from our first Parents, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining us as much, if not more, to evil, then to good; yet some more violently then others: which <hi>inclinations,</hi> though they render us not <hi>guilty</hi> (the sin being washed away by Baptisme) yet our <hi>consenting</hi> to them is <hi>sin,</hi> as our resisting them is virtue, and our fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against and <hi>overcoming</hi> them, is the great <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment</hi> of our life. And truely were it not for <hi>evil examples</hi> and <hi>councells,</hi> or at least for <hi>want of good ones,</hi> the victory would not be so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, as we commonly suppose, and find it; nor the difference of inclinations so manifest. For thus much must be acknowledged <hi>to the glory of our Maker;</hi> first that as every constitution hath a disposition to evil, so that very disposition is contrary to another evil, to which the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent would be more obnoxious; and Secondly, inclineth also to the neighbouring good; <hi>every defect,</hi> by the wise ordering of providence, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ballanced with another advantage;</hi> as proneness to <hi>anger</hi> prompts also to <hi>activenes,</hi> and hardiness to attempt difficulties; the <hi>slow,</hi> and phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, are also <hi>perseverant</hi> and constant in their resolutions; that which <hi>disposeth to lust,</hi> suggests also <hi>persuasivenes,</hi> plausibility, and cheerfulnes: <hi>desire</hi> produceth <hi>Industry, fear</hi> breeds <hi>quiet</hi> and cautiousnes. And by the way, let this be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56954:16"/>
that it is much easier to bend a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural mis-inclination to its neighbour virtue, then to its opposite: as an angry person is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silier perswaded to <hi>activenes,</hi> then <hi>meeknes;</hi> the <hi>tenacious,</hi> to <hi>frugality,</hi> rather then <hi>bounty; obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy</hi> to <hi>constancy, fawningnes</hi> to <hi>complaisance,</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> to <hi>obedience.</hi> So that any one becomes evil rather then good, is not so much the <hi>fault</hi> of his <hi>constitution,</hi> as the <hi>perversnes</hi> of <hi>his will;</hi> following the <hi>suggestions of sense</hi> rather then the <hi>Dictates of reason.</hi> 'Tis pleasure in Children, that recommends the evil, and warps them from the good: 'tis <hi>inconsideration</hi> and <hi>folly</hi> more then the <hi>difficulty</hi> or <hi>unnaturalnes</hi> of virtue. And if there be any such man, as without delight or interest, pursues bad rather then good, he wanteth either the reason, or desires common to all Mankind. Nor did wise Law-makers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute <hi>reward and punishment</hi> to constrain men <hi>to doe against nature;</hi> but to <hi>equiponderate</hi> the prejudices of pleasure and interest, <hi>i. e.</hi> to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance reason against sensuality. I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare setting down a notable saying of <hi>Quintilian</hi> cap. ult. <hi>Natura nos ad optimam mentem genuit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deoque discere meliora volentibus promtum est; ut verè intuenti mirum sit illud magis, malos esse tam multos.</hi> And Seneca, <hi>Nihil est tam arduum &amp; difficile, quod non humana mens vincat, &amp; in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritatem producat assidua meditatio: nullique sunt tam feri &amp; sui juris affectus, ut non disciplinâ domen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Quodcunque sibi imperavit animus, obtinuit. Sanabilibus aegrotamus malis, ipsaque nos in rectum genitos natura, si emendari voluerimus, juvat.</hi> Thus they out of the strength of their reason and experience: perhaps also they had learned so much from <hi>Socrates,</hi> who by his own exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56954:16"/>
shewed that even the worst dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was conquerable by reason. And this is to the shame of so many pretended Christians. But how would they have <hi>glorified God,</hi> had they known the advantage given us by <hi>grace</hi> and his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> always ready to assist our good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours? Though <hi>Seneca</hi> seems to have discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some glimpse of that also. Ep. 41. <hi>Sacer intra nos spiritus sedet, malorum bonorumque nostrorum observator &amp; custos. Bonus vir sine Deo nemo est. An potest aliquis supra fortunam, nisi ab ipso, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere? ille dat consilia erecta &amp; magnifica. O pie Domine, O Salvator bone,</hi> saith Salvian l. 7. <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum per te efficiunt studia Disciplinae, per quae mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari possunt vitia Naturae!</hi> And speaking there of the Africans, he saith, <hi>Adeo exclusa naturae originalis sinceritas, ut aliam quodammodo in his naturam vitia fecerunt.</hi> The sum is, Though all <hi>Dispositions</hi> be not <hi>equally good,</hi> yet the <hi>worst</hi> may, by the industry of the Educators, and Gods grace, never wanting till refused, be so <hi>reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and bettered, as to be able to do God, his Prince, and family, honour and service. And the greatest frowardnes and worst inclinations, we find in Children, are <hi>conquerable;</hi> and when <hi>actually overcome,</hi> those very persons may <hi>better succeed,</hi> then the more <hi>facile and complying.</hi> Only as I said let them be taken betimes: and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because it cannot be known but by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, how any childs disposition may prove and shew it self. But if instead of <hi>rectifying</hi> his evil inclination, any one <hi>indulge</hi> it; and instead of <hi>bridling incourage</hi> it; he makes it his <hi>Master.</hi> Whence come those irregular and extravagant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and actions, which we see in many persons, of stealing, drinking, inconstancy, and the like.</p>

4 MY third advice is, that <hi>Parents</hi> would have their Children (as much as they can) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their <hi>own eye</hi> and inspection. By this they shall be preserved from <hi>evil companions,</hi> imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of bad Superiors, their councel, discours, and such like; but more then all, from indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, impertinent, unmanaged <hi>Servants.</hi> For <hi>Youth</hi> not having the judgment to measure it self from its own actions, knows it only by <hi>reflection,</hi> from others <hi>relations;</hi> and thinks it self such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as a fawning servant represents him: and servants who are usually brought up in that <hi>low condition,</hi> and have their <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>speeches</hi> suitable, cannot be fit companions to a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> But above all, the <hi>example of the Father</hi> is of greatest force to educate a Son. O <hi>te bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Adolescentem</hi> (Plin. lib. 8. ep. 13.) <hi>qui-eum potissimum imitandum habes, cui natura te similli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum esse voluit.</hi> The Father's actions <hi>authorise</hi> the same in the Child; nor can the Father cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise him for what himself is guilty. Great care must the Father take therefore least he give any bad example either of <hi>intemperate anger</hi> with ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or of using any evil, obscene, or <hi>unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent words;</hi> and to <hi>be</hi> such as he desireth his Son should <hi>represent</hi> him. It concerns him also to <hi>overlook</hi> even his Governor and Educator, when he is of age to stand in need of one, both to keep him to his diligence, and create authority to his instruction. <hi>Cato,</hi> though he kept a Master expresly for his Son in his own house, yet did himself always frequently teach him. So did <hi>Augustus</hi> his Grand-children <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Lucius.</hi> The great <hi>Theodosius</hi> used frequently to fit by <hi>Arsenius,</hi> whilst he taught his Sons <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> and <hi>Honorius;</hi> to whom also he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56954:17"/>
such respect to be given by them, that sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing them once sitting, and <hi>Arsenius</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he took from them their <hi>robes;</hi> and not till after a long time and much intreaty restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. And if the Father and Family be of <hi>good example,</hi> it seems to me best to educate him <hi>at home,</hi> and leave him in his <hi>first bed,</hi> till he have taken some root before he be <hi>transplanted.</hi> If the child be of a <hi>soft,</hi> or of an <hi>haughty</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, or the <hi>family of evil examples,</hi> 'tis better to send him <hi>abroad</hi> betimes. But generally, the best place of Education seems to be amongst <hi>companions</hi> (as near as may be, his equals) at some distance <hi>from home;</hi> but whether he may repair every night, or very frequently. If this cannot be, then with companions in his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house;</hi> for to teach one alone, besides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconveniences, is extreamly tedious both to Master and Scholar. For want of these op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities the next is at a <hi>public School;</hi> but then great care is to be had that the <hi>Family,</hi> where he sojourneth, be of good example. And much better would it be for him there to have a <hi>Pedagogue</hi> (which in those Countrys, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with Clergy, is seldome omitted) <hi>i. e.</hi> one somewhat versed in learning; who may continually attend the Child, see to his repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the performing his tasks &amp; exercises, model his manners, and preserve him from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the like.</p>
               <p n="5">5. PARENTS also, <hi>fourthly,</hi> ought to guide them, as much as is possible, with <hi>kindnes</hi> and <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; endeavoring to</hi> convince and <hi>perswade</hi> them of the excellency of labour, seriousnes, learning, virtue, sufferings, and the like; and even <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56954:18"/>
what they think not fit to grant them with sweetnes and love; and even <hi>chastising</hi> them with sorrow, and for vices only, in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different giving them liberty. In <hi>bodily sicknesses</hi> the patient is the first who desireth the cure; but the <hi>distempers of the mind</hi> are to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and perswaded to the <hi>Patient</hi> by reason and good admonition. Neither must the Father <hi>destine</hi> his Child to such an employment as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thinks fittest to serve his other occasions. Though most mens parts are capable of many employments, yet are many less disposed to one then another; and so much, as it is not worth the time and labour many times (as is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) to endeavour the change of such inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Consider therefore both his <hi>disposition,</hi> and the nature of the <hi>calling, i. e.</hi> what facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it chiefly employs: and whether those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties be most eminent in the subject; and so fit them together; and you shall not need to fear their corresponding to your care. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if after all your endeavours they prove not to your desire; as many times it happens: <hi>murmur not</hi> against God, who <hi>permits them to miscarry; either that</hi> men may take notice, that all wel-doing is from his grace, not our wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; <hi>or that</hi> your faith and patience may be tried, and your self purged from all human and secular affections and interests; <hi>or that</hi> some faults in your self may be punished in them.</p>

A good <hi>Educator</hi> therefore, whether one be to be chosen, or any one desires to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himself such, being <hi>instead of a Father</hi> to his charge, ought to be; First, <hi>religious,</hi> virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and grave, both <hi>himself</hi> and <hi>family;</hi> that he may give good example, and not need to fear that his <hi>Scholar</hi> resemble him.

Then also may he hope by his <hi>prayers</hi> to obtain a blessing upon his endeavours; and (performing his duty as in the sight of God) to give up his accounts cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and receive his reward from him.</p>

passions change with new objects. Besides, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while he will be look'd upon as imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and exercising ridiculously an obsolete power.

               <p n="7">7. IN all times, great care was taken for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding good <hi>Educators;</hi> for they said, it was better to <hi>prevent</hi> vices, then <hi>punish</hi> them. And in most States the <hi>Magistrates</hi> appointed them; nor was it lawful amongst many Nations for Parents to employ any others, or educate their Children, but in public. The <hi>Canons</hi> of most <hi>Churches,</hi> since Christianity, have charged that election upon the <hi>Bishops:</hi> and that with so much reason and prudence, that the contrary practice hath once, and is even now ready, to endanger the ruin of this Government. The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Persians</hi> (despairing to find all requisite ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments in one) had usually four distinct persons to educate their Princes: one <hi>supreme,</hi> who had the general inspection over both Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Scholar; another <hi>eminent for sanctity and virtue,</hi> to teach him Religion, Honor and Justice: a third for <hi>learning,</hi> to principle him in knowledg and wisdome: and a <hi>fourth</hi> to <hi>perfect him in his carriage, valour,</hi> exercise of Armes and Chivalry. And, tho this be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the capacity and reach of most subjects; yet by this every one may see what is perfectest, toward which he may advance as his estate will bear. And let them be sure of this, that if they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56954:20"/>
will have the best <hi>Educators,</hi> they must libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>encourage</hi> them; for worthy persons will not labour without considerable rewards, both of means and respect. Besides, the gratitude of Princes, and great Persons to their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, invites others to fit themselvs, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo that laborious and hazardous employment. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great built up <hi>Stagyra</hi> for <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi> sake, and spared <hi>Lampsacus</hi> for <hi>Anaxime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>'s. <hi>Augustus</hi> bestowed great honours upon the person and Country of <hi>Apollodorus;</hi> and forgave the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> to gratify <hi>Areus</hi> his Master in Philosophy. Trajan dignified his Master Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tark with the Consulship. Memorable is the piety of <hi>M. Aurelius,</hi> who made <hi>Proculus</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consul; and took <hi>Junius Rusticus</hi> with him in all his expeditions, advised with him of all his both publick and private businesses, saluted him before the <hi>Praefecti-Praetorio,</hi> designed him to be second time <hi>Consul,</hi> and after his death ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the <hi>Senate</hi> publicly to erect a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to his memory. <hi>Tantum autem honoris Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistris suis detulit, ut imagines eorum aureas in lara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio haberet, ac sepulchra eorum aditu, hostiis, flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus semper honoraret,</hi> saith <hi>Capitolinus.</hi> See the gratitude of <hi>Gratianus</hi> to his Educator <hi>Ausonius</hi> in his Epistle to him. <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly honoured <hi>Alcuinus;</hi> as did also <hi>Theodorick Cassiodorus,</hi> making him his Counceller and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident. So did <hi>Otho</hi> III. <hi>Gerbertus;</hi> for whose sake, <hi>&amp; ut habeat Magister quid Principi nostro Petro à parte sui Discipuli offerat, Otho</hi> gave to the Church, to be disposed of by his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, eight <hi>Comitatus,</hi> or Counties, <hi>Pesaurum, Fanum, &amp;c. Will. Rufus</hi> made <hi>Lanfranc</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury. Laur. Medices</hi> greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched

                  <hi>Joh. Argyropilus,</hi> and <hi>Marsilius Ficinus</hi> his Educators. And truely it seems to me, that one of the greatest <hi>advantages of wealth</hi> is, that thereby may be procured better <hi>Education,</hi> then those can have, who are not able to requite a worthy person.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Educated.</head>
               <p>THE Educator cannot perform his Duty, unless he know the aime and scope of his employment, <hi>i. e.</hi> unless he consider dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, what a one the <hi>Educated</hi> ought to be framed by him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. FIRST then we suppose, that <hi>no man cometh into this World either to be idle, or follow and enjoy only his own pleasure and humour;</hi> but to be serviceable to his <hi>Maker:</hi> who (acting as a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal agent) maketh nothing for <hi>our,</hi> but <hi>him,</hi> self; and out of his infinite favour to us, is pleased to honour us so much, as both that some way we may do him service, and thereby also in the highest manner advantage our selves, by advancing his Kingdome and interest, <hi>i. e.</hi> by <hi>doing good</hi> (for God is the universal good) both to our selves and others. There is no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on even of the greatest Prince from that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral burden laid upon us by God himself: <hi>In su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore vultus tui vesceris pane tuo. i. e.</hi> Every man is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56954:21"/>
to have some <hi>laborious employment,</hi> either of body or mind, which is to be his <hi>calling,</hi> and of which he is to render a strict and severe <hi>account.</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Princess eats not the bread of Idlenes. S. Paul laboured. Our Lords whole life was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in <hi>labores</hi> and <hi>dolores.</hi> The greatest Prince is obliged to the greatest observance; and some have accounted themselves but as the General Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters or Stewards of their Subjects. The <hi>High Priest</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> had, and the <hi>Grand Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnior</hi> at this time hath a trade, at which (as I am informed) he is to labour every day; which is for no other intent but to mind him of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral obligation. And good reason this is; for there cannot be imagined such a difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men, all of the same kind, made all of one mass, having the same entrance into, and exit out of this life; that some should be born for <hi>pleasure</hi> only, others for <hi>labour;</hi> some for <hi>themselves</hi> only, others for the <hi>sustentation</hi> of them in their Idlenes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THE <hi>greater means</hi> and opportunities any one hath of glorifying God, the <hi>greater Duty</hi> and <hi>obligation</hi> lieth upon him. The reason is plain; it is God that bestows all good things; who being no respecter of persons, gives to every man to profit others. And the more he (as the Husband-man) <hi>sows,</hi> the more he expects to <hi>reap;</hi> more from him that had <hi>five Talents,</hi> then from him that had but <hi>two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. WHATEVER a man enjoys, enabling him to glorify God, and to do good to himself, or others, is <hi>a Talent.</hi> As strength, health, parts, &amp;c. Also whatever gives him greater <hi>Authority,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:56954:21"/>
as riches, and honors, or reputation; the two foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of <hi>Nobility;</hi> which rendring them emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and conspicuous above other men, sets them also, at least, as lights and examples to be followed by their Inferiors.</p>
               <p n="4">4. PERSONS <hi>of quality,</hi> therefore, besides the obligation of private <hi>persons,</hi> have others also particular and peculiar to their condition. First, <hi>as rich men,</hi> they are to make all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they can for bettering themselves and others by their <hi>riches.</hi> They are Gods <hi>Stewards</hi> (after they have taken what is necessary or convenient to themselves, and families, the better to perform such duties) <hi>not for luxury,</hi> delicious fare, or fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselves, as beast are for the day of slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>nor for accumulating wealth,</hi> the rust whereof will corrode their consciences as fire would their flesh: <hi>nor for furnishing their vain pleasures,</hi> or extravagant desires. But <hi>for providing for the poor,</hi> (the immediate and particular care and charge of Almighty God) many of whom he hath left in worse condition then the Beasts and Fowls; were they not preferred to these <hi>Treasurers;</hi> but <hi>for public and magnificent works,</hi> which exceed the ability of meaner persons. Besides, that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Generosity are ingenious to invent many waies of assisting others.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, As <hi>Masters of numerous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> they are to provide for their several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Wife, Children, Servants, Neighbors. And not only <hi>temporal,</hi> but also, <hi>spiritual</hi> supplies. Every <hi>Family</hi> being a little <hi>Church,</hi> and every <hi>Master</hi> of a Family a <hi>Magistrate</hi> within his own walls to govern, advise, direct, reward and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56954:22"/>
punish those under his charge.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, As <hi>Members of a noble Stock,</hi> they are to advise, assist and benefit also their brethren and kindred, to whom they have a more particular relation then to the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. They are also to correspond unto, and in themselves (as in a burning-glass) concenter the characters of their worthy <hi>Predecessors;</hi> and communicate them as well as their wealth down also with advantage to their <hi>Descendants.</hi> And let them remember that it is not less praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to <hi>deserve</hi> to be a Prince, then to <hi>be</hi> one.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As the <hi>most considerable members of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> they are engaged in more peculiar Duties toward the <hi>Prince,</hi> and his subordinate Magistrate; <hi>to know</hi> and obey the Laws, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist toward the observation of them by others. Beside this, <hi>to fit</hi> themselves for such employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as they may probably be call'd unto. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>to be</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. THESE, and such like, are the <hi>Callings</hi> and <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments</hi> of <hi>Gentlemen;</hi> who, as you see, ought not to overvalue or think themselves better, because
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56954:22"/>
of their wealth or honour; but to have greater obligations. And as they may justly expect greater rewards, because of greater temptations, so are they to fear greater punishments, because of greater opportunities of doing good, and because every fault is more conspicuous and dangerous in them then in inferiors. But besides they must not forget themselves also to be <hi>private Persons:</hi> But let their public busines be what it will; they will, and must have some time to themselves also to bestow on their particular Inclinations. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, first, that is best spent, which is employed upon <hi>Almighty God.</hi> And by the way, let them take notice, 1. That they ought not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any employment, which will not allow them every day a competent time for their <hi>Devotions.</hi> 2. Next, that is best employed which is set upon <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious studies;</hi> especially such as are beneficial and advantagious to the Public; or such as poorer persons are not able to support. Such are the <hi>History</hi> of his own or other Countreys, search of <hi>Antiquity, Natural History,</hi> and experiments; <hi>Medicine;</hi> forreign <hi>Laws; Mathematicks, Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical</hi> observations; <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> and the like; It being a noble study to observe, how God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns <hi>natural,</hi> as well as <hi>free</hi> Agents. Thus is <hi>Salomon</hi> praised for his knowledg in Plants; <hi>Moses</hi> for being versed in all the learning of the Egyptians; <hi>Daniel</hi> was chief of the Magicians; <hi>Abraham</hi> a great Astronomer; <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> eminent Philosophers, <hi>Avicen, Averroes,</hi> and <hi>Almansor</hi> were all Princes. <hi>Radulfus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror gave his mind to Jewelling; <hi>Gratianus</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Arms. But heed must be taken least those be made the <hi>principal,</hi> which should only be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessories</hi> and divertisements.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56954:23"/>
6. Now to all these the <hi>Educators</hi> care can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not extend, nor is it expected it should. But this he ought to do: First, to lay in his charge the foundation of Religion and virtue. 2. To im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his natural parts as much as he shall be able. 3. To ground him so far in such general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as may be serviceable or useful unto him, till he be able in some measure to proceed in them by his own Industry, and by them be also fitted for the other. 4. And lastly to assist him in such particular Arts or Faculties as he seems most fit for, inclined unto, or likely to follow. But these not all at once, but as his judgment and parts are prepared to receive them: that being not superficially or slightly <hi>painted</hi> or <hi>tincted,</hi> but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly <hi>furnish'd</hi> to all good employments, he may have both ability and delight to pursue <hi>by himself</hi> the same <hi>routte;</hi> and in his private studies <hi>build up</hi> that knowledg and wisedome, whose <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was laid by his Teachers. Which is the end of the Educators pains, and will perhaps take up more of the Young-mans age, then is usually allowed by Parents to that purpose. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it will not be amiss here to advertise, that Governors be not too soon cast off. <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> kept <hi>Posidonius</hi> his Instructor with him till his old age; and when he then desired of the Emperor to be dismissed into his own Countrey, where he might dye in quiet out of the tracas and noise of the World; <hi>Cesar</hi> desired before his departure, to receive some good rules from him for better governing himself; the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher answered, that when he perceived himself angry, he should, before he undertook any busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, repeat over the Alphabet; <hi>Augustus</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his prescription, replyed, that he perceived he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56954:23"/>
had still need of him, and perhaps as much as when he was first under his care; so refused to dismiss him, but gave him an appartment in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, better, and nearer to himself, increased his revenues, and kept him with him as long as he lived.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> General Directions to the Educator.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE <hi>Educator</hi> having thus his <hi>end</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and his <hi>matter</hi> (the Educated) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into his hands, let him consider how to work this matter to that end. And first he should endeavour thorowly to understand what parts and <hi>capacity,</hi> as also what <hi>dispositions</hi> and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his charge hath; <hi>i. e.</hi> how apt to, or averse from this end. Next, how to frame and order these dispositions; which to <hi>correct,</hi> which <hi>restrain,</hi> which <hi>encourage.</hi> For many times an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Gardiner spends much vain labour to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out the roots of <hi>Summer-weeds,</hi> which would perish in the <hi>digging.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. MUCH doth it concern the Educator to <hi>carry himself discreetly.</hi> For young Men observe diligently, and censure severely (when amongst their Camerades) and their Governors in the first place. His first case must be to steer evenly between <hi>mildness</hi> and <hi>severity.</hi> Yet making use of more or less of each, according to the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56954:24"/>
of his charge, and the present occasion. It requires great judgment to join sweetnes and efficaciousnes in his commands: not to advance into <hi>harshnes</hi> and <hi>morosity</hi> on the one side; nor degenerate into <hi>softnes</hi> and <hi>laschenes</hi> on the other. <hi>Harshnes</hi> is discovered in these and the like par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. In <hi>enjoyning</hi> things in themselves too difficult, unfesible, unsuportable, or too hard for that person: or <hi>commanding</hi> obscurely, or equivocally, as if he were seeking an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to chide; or <hi>enjoyning</hi> them too imperiously, and not shewing the reason of his commands: in <hi>not directing</hi> him how to do them: in <hi>unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable urging,</hi> and exacting them either in regard of the time, or the ability, or disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his charge: In <hi>pressing</hi> all things great and small with the same vigour and importancy, or because it is his command: in <hi>rejecting</hi> all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to the contrary, as excuses; and not <hi>hearing</hi> his charge speak for himself: In <hi>shewing</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self jealous and suspicious, or to have an ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his charge, or giving occasion to suspect him morose, unsatisfiable; or that all his actions and speeches, tho dubious, are interpreted in the worst sense: In <hi>exaggerating</hi> all mistakes and errours into sins and crimes: In <hi>denying</hi> all, or most of his desires, tho the things be reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, or unprejudiciable: In <hi>unseasonble,</hi> ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious, opprobrious chiding, and such like.</p>
               <p n="3">3. REMISSNES on the contrary shews it self in these things. <hi>If he take</hi> notice only of great and scandalous, not smaller or secreter faults. <hi>If what is well enjoyned,</hi> either because of the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated's unwillingnes, or others intercessions, be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56954:24"/>
not as it ought, exacted; but either omitted, or changed into an easier. <hi>If he judg</hi> faults, because ordinarily committed, or his charge is inclined to them, lesser then indeed they are. <hi>If he think</hi> them incorrigible, and so go not about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify them. <hi>If indeed he resent</hi> them as faults, but chideth or correcteth not so much, as is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to amendment. <hi>If,</hi> when he hath shewed him his faults, and that he is displeased with them, <hi>he leave</hi> the amendment to the young Man. <hi>If,</hi> to please others, as the Parents, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, companions of his charge, <hi>he yeild to</hi> a greater indulgence then he ought, Or <hi>if</hi> out of timidity and fear of offending his charge, he <hi>neglect his duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Now to avoid both these rocks, either of which is fatal; let the Governor be <hi>resolute</hi> to obtain his <hi>end,</hi> but <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>mild</hi> in prescribing and exacting the <hi>means.</hi> To be sure not to let any vice pass unreprehended, and according to the nature or danger of it, to be more or less eager; but for things <hi>indifferent,</hi> indecencies, fancies, little humors (which are neither vicious, nor scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous) to bear with them till their turn come to be weeded out. Endeavour to beget in your charge a <hi>perswasion,</hi> that you reprehend or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, <hi>not out</hi> of your own interest, pleasure, or passion; <hi>but out of</hi> a true, internal, sincere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; which, if you really bear such towards him, will not be difficult. And if you can thus far advance, you may go a step farther; <hi>i. e.</hi> breed in him an affection toward you (for love begets love) and then the great difficulty of your work is past: in this also the Parents must assist. This must be increased by shewing your self at
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56954:25"/>
all times <hi>concerned in his interests; openly</hi> taking part in, and justifying his quarrels, tho <hi>privately</hi> you reprehend him severely, (for thus he sees you are careful of his reputation;) by your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent care and attendance on him when <hi>sick;</hi> and many other occasions will be suggested of honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly insinuating into his affections. But take heed you <hi>flatter</hi> him not, nor <hi>praise</hi> him too much, yea tho he deserve very well; for many times immoderate praise makes him proud and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent; many times also lasch and negligent, thinking he hath got applause enough, and needs no more endeavour; but, as if he hath already hit <hi>the mark, unbends</hi> and throws away his <hi>bow.</hi> Indeed the moderate suffering of praise, is as great a tryal of wisedome and prudence, as the cupel is of silver.</p>
               <p n="5">5. STRIVE also to <hi>enamour</hi> him of what you would teach him. For to him that doth <hi>willingly</hi> what he must of <hi>necessity,</hi> the proficiency is certain. To be a good and virtuous man, consists almost solely in the will: <hi>Quid tibi opus est ut sis bonus? velle.</hi> Sen. ep. 80. He that desires to be so, wants little of being so. And this is done by recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending your commands &amp; instructions with the <hi>reason</hi> of them; for when the <hi>judgment</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, the <hi>Will</hi> surrenders of her self. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny but this is contrary to the practise of too many of our great <hi>Schools,</hi> where Children learn only, because it is <hi>minus malum;</hi> tho painful and troublesome, yet not so much altogether as perpetual chastisement. Many have doubted whether Children of Person of quality should at all be beaten, pretending it is slavish, and if in another age, injurious; that he, who will not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56954:25"/>
reform with chiding, will be also obstinate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst beating. Tho there is no justifying those Masters, who think every thing lawful against that unresisting age, who being overburdened with numbers, make <hi>cruelty</hi> pass for <hi>diligence,</hi> and supply their want of <hi>care</hi> with plenty of the <hi>rod:</hi> as if they, who are committed to their charge, are abandoned to their <hi>passion;</hi> or as if reason were not to be used to those who are not yet Masters of it: Yet <hi>corporal chastisement</hi> is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, even for great Mens Children also, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for such stubborn dispositions, as care not for <hi>shame,</hi> but are afraid of <hi>pain.</hi> But not this till last of all. For the Educator is to try all means before he comes to that: Exhorting, examples, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, praise and shame, promising, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, rewards alwaies before punishments. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>laudable crafts</hi> also, and deceits are to be practised; as to commend him sometimes more then he deserves, or for what he hath not done, but you feign <hi>to believe</hi> he hath done it. <hi>To let him know</hi> that you pass-by many failings in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to his age; <hi>to seem</hi> not to believe the evil related of him, but to nourish a better opinion: <hi>to put his faults</hi> upon another, and exaggerate them in his presence; <hi>to declare</hi> the punishment deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or inflicted; <hi>to watch</hi> over him so as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the acting of his evil intention, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of it. It was also the custome to punish the young Prince's Favorite for the Prince. If these suffice not, try <hi>smart chiding;</hi> wherein take heed of <hi>unbeseeming</hi> words, which a noble nature many times resents long after, but all are apt to imitate towards others. Beware also of too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate, or <hi>unseasonable reprehensions;</hi> as <hi>either</hi> when the offender is in passion, <hi>or</hi> in public,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56954:26"/>
                  <hi>or</hi> your self in passion; tho it be not amiss sometimes to seem so. Neither be <hi>alwayes</hi> chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for that breeds insensibility and carelesnes, and authorizeth his fault by your own. <hi>Nescio quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo hoc ipsum, quod concupiscitur, jucundius fit cum vetatur, &amp; contumax est animus (maxime puerorum) &amp; in contrarium atque arduum nitens. Indiscreet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension</hi> is many times recommendation of the vice. Let <hi>corporal punishments</hi> be the last refuge, and when the rest, tryed, are found insufficient; for what is done willingly is best done, Horses and Beasts are subdued by the <hi>rod,</hi> but man hath a <hi>free-will,</hi> which (if possible) is to be gained by <hi>reason.</hi> What we do for fear of punishment we really detest; and, were we left to our selves, we would not do it. Yet by accustoming to do it, though for fear, the bugbear that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed our hatred is driven away, and by little and little we acquire an habit of, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees a love to, it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. TAKE all faults, vices especially, <hi>at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> by preventing as much as you can all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions and opportunities of ill-doing; as let him not frequent <hi>suspected places,</hi> not be abroad, tho with a friend, nor be late from his lodging, and the like. For tho he do at such time no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing blame-worthy, yet that <hi>irregularity</hi> indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged will breed <hi>inconveniencies</hi> first, and <hi>faultines</hi> afterwards. <hi>Plato</hi> having chid a young man for a slight fault, and he replying 'twas no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, answered, But the <hi>custome</hi> of it is.

if any of his young Scholars commited a fault, especially too bold and venturous, would tell him, that for the present he disliked it not, but for the future he would not endure it: so he both <hi>indulged</hi> their <hi>wit,</hi> and <hi>corrected</hi> theit <hi>errours aegre enim reprehendas quae sinis consuescere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ESPECIALLY beware of all <hi>obscene discourse,</hi> and those <hi>equivocal</hi> phrases, which the wicked invent to express their lust <hi>(ingeniously</hi> as they think) most <hi>plausibly, i. e. dangerously.</hi> As likewise of all filthy <hi>Songs,</hi> and of <hi>Libels,</hi> wherein either the Magistrate, or other person is taxed. Forbear also (chiefly if the Child be naturally timorous) all <hi>discourse of witches, Spirits, Fayries,</hi> and the like; which intimidate the spirit, and fill the head with vain and frightful imaginations. Also all fond <hi>Romances,</hi> whether of Giants or Love. Those seem to have taken their original about the time of the Holy-War, when all Europe was upon the gog of fighting, to which they thought those fond Stories were very conducing; but these from later times, when <hi>Courtship</hi> and <hi>lust</hi> were in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account then <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Valour.</hi> But whatever they be, being but <hi>Castles in the Aire,</hi> it matters not whether they are built for <hi>Palaces</hi> or <hi>Prisons;</hi> thay have both a bad effect: For they impress upon Children, and (which is almost the same) upon Women, and weak silly men also, <hi>false notions.</hi> They are to the mind what a <hi>Feaver</hi> is to the body, filling the Soul with preternatural, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular conceits, and hindering the <hi>true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> and <hi>reall notion</hi> of things as they are in the World, which <hi>true Histories</hi> set forth. They represent actions by a false glass, as in the idle imaginations of silly and loose people. If wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56954:27"/>
and insignificant fancies <hi>in the brain,</hi> (Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances in the thought) be so troublesome to all well-minded people; to have such <hi>in writing,</hi> is certainly much worse. What a madness is it to increase these by suggesting <hi>more</hi> non-sense? by <hi>printing</hi> our follies, and <hi>publishing</hi> our resveries? They shew us <hi>lust</hi> instead of <hi>love, false honour</hi> and valour instead of <hi>true;</hi> the <hi>World in imagination</hi> for <hi>that in reality,</hi> agreeable dotages, pleasant means to render men fools. The most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of all <hi>Romances,</hi> are those, which are dressed up with all the artifice of good words, habits, action, &amp;c. on purpose to withdraw the Soul from seriousnes and virtue, to vanity and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines: <hi>Comedies,</hi> I mean, which who with delight frequenteth, returns with the passions and humours there <hi>represented,</hi> shall I say? or <hi>recommended.</hi> The design of them is sensual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleasure (to say no worse) which a good serious man looks upon as his greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: <hi>Nemo ad voluptatem venit sine affectu; nemo affectum sine casibus suis patitur. Vbi voluptas ibi studium, per quod sc. voluptas sapit.</hi> Tert. de Spect. Upon the same reason I would disswade all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with <hi>Fools, Jesters, Buffoons,</hi> and all such as accustome to, and study to procure, <hi>laughter.</hi> A dangerous and pestilent sort of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that renders the mind's indulging it, like to his that causeth it, light, foolish, vain, and contrary to that seriousnes and thinkingnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to prudence and gallantry of spirit. When this passion is over, reflect upon what caused it, and the manner of it, and you shall scarce find any action wherof you will be more really a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed; as of that which Nature hath not suffer'd to be acted without uncomely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

LET him do every thing for a <hi>good end,</hi> &amp; the <hi>best way.</hi> First, direct his <hi>intentions</hi> aright, and by that means his <hi>actions</hi> become <hi>virtues;</hi> and (which is more) there will be insensibly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted the very essence of Religion. To <hi>carry himself decently,</hi> tell him, not <hi>that</hi> the people will think better of him, <hi>that</hi> he shall be more accepted in conversation; but tell him <hi>that</hi> he ought to carry himself as the noblest and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest of Gods creatures. <hi>To study and be diligent; not that</hi> thereby he may arrive to honors here, and be acceptable to great persons, <hi>but to</hi> do God his Creator the more service, and the like. To do his actions the <hi>best way,</hi> will breed a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>ambition</hi> in him to excell in that which is good. And since in every age the same <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> are employ'd, only the <hi>objects</hi> changed, and the <hi>actions</hi> of those faculties not many; it must need be, that our whole life is but <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting</hi> the same thing frequently over upon divers subjects and occasions. As the Fool personates the same humour, tho in divers Comedies; and tho sometimes <hi>Lance, Jodelet,</hi> or <hi>Scara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muccio,</hi> yet 'tis all but the same <hi>Buffoon.</hi> In <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy</hi> little quarrels with their brethren, peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, wilfulnes, &amp;c. are afterwards angers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds, envies, prides, jealousies; and a sensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in <hi>Youth</hi> for a gig or a suggar-plum, is the same afterwards for honour or interest. And he is not the only wise man who discourseth of,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56954:28"/>
or acteth, <hi>great and high matters,</hi> but he who speaks or doth, whatever it be, great or small, <hi>pertinently,</hi> and according to the nature of the subject. Therefore let your charge, even in his youth, frequently <hi>reflect</hi> upon his own and others actions, and <hi>censure</hi> them freely, that himself may be engaged to know to do better when the like occasion recurs. 'Tis <hi>generosity</hi> not to admire every thing he hears or sees (which some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call civility) but to use his judgment; to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend</hi> as well as <hi>praise;</hi> nor to acquiesce in every answer, but to seek for solid reason, and, according to his capacity, <hi>satisfaction.</hi> Let him also in <hi>in his sports</hi> be prompt, diligent, active, subtil, free, not dishonest; and where there is any <hi>engagement for victory,</hi> earnest, contriving, watching advantages, yet not quarrelsome; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to overcome, yet patient if van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished: and these qualities will be also afterward put on in more serious matters; for if hunting be a <hi>praeludium</hi> to War, Childrens sports are so to all other actions of their life.</p>
               <p n="8">8. IT is also necessary that the Educator have the <hi>disposing of the servants;</hi> or at least that the Child have none but virtuous and discreet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to serve and wait upon him, especially in his <hi>Chamber:</hi> whose discourse at his rising and going to bed have great influence upon him many times, either to <hi>confirme</hi> or <hi>deface</hi> such notions, as have bin infused into him the day before. Great care also must be had of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending him to good <hi>Companions,</hi> and rather those that are somewhat above him in years, of a good reputation, and such as you will be content he may imitate. If you come into a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56954:28"/>
strange place, you may discover <hi>evill company; if they be</hi> extraordinarily officious without any reason; <hi>if they</hi> applaud whatever the young man saith, or doth; <hi>if they</hi> offer their service and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to all purposes; <hi>if they</hi> advise against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, or to liberty, libertinisme, or idlenes; <hi>if they</hi> railly, droll, and speak evil of others, especially of virtuous men, or such as the young man is recommended to; <hi>if they</hi> endeavour to draw him to unknown, obscure, or suspected places, or bring him into much company. Beware of such men, and get your charge out of their hands as soon as you can.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I have often thought it a great shame to see <hi>Beasts,</hi> as Horses and Dogs, <hi>taught with so much care</hi> and industry, their natural vices cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and their disposition reformed, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most certain rules fitted, out of observation, to every humour and imperfection: Yet many men to return not only not <hi>bettered,</hi> but much <hi>dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorated</hi> from their <hi>Governors;</hi> till I considered, that besides the ignorance, negligence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency of the <hi>Educators,</hi> or their undertaking to bring up too many, and all by the same way, there was also required on the part of the <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi> the <hi>generous concurrence</hi> of his own free de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and endeavour to do well. That some also have such natural imperfections and <hi>perverse dispositions,</hi> as if not taken at the first moment, as it were, the <hi>primo-prime acts,</hi> and preserved with infinite care and industry from temptation, are difficultly reformed and straightned. <hi>Nero</hi> was not rectified by <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Burrhus,</hi> tho it is probable, had he been a private person, and so long under their care till he had got an
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56954:29"/>
habit, and imbibed those instructions they gave, he might have proved a virtuous person. But the <hi>Tree</hi> returned to its native <hi>crookednes</hi> before it had time to <hi>grow straight. Cicero</hi>'s Son to the <hi>stupidity</hi> of his nature, added <hi>Drunkennes</hi> and good fellowship; and no wonder if from <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Cratippus,</hi> he returned as he went to them. <hi>M. Aurelius</hi> provided 14. of the most approved Masters of the whole Empire (the learned <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Pollux</hi> being one) to educate his Son <hi>Commodus;</hi> and within a while cashiered five of them, because he had observed some <hi>levities</hi> in their carriage. Yet could not the other nine rectify the froward and barbarous humour, perhaps suck'd from, and encouraged afterward, by his Mother, at the time of his conception in love with a Gladiator. <hi>Caracalla</hi> was nursed by a <hi>Christian</hi> (Tert. ad Scapulam) whose education had such force upon him, that for a long time he behaved himself so, as he gained the love of all men, <hi>hujus puo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritia blanda, ingeniosa,</hi> &amp;c. saith Spartianus. But afterward the <hi>natural humors</hi> which were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently by that short time of good education purged out, <hi>sermented</hi> again, and corrupted the whole mass. In such cases therefore, I advise the <hi>Educator</hi> to be <hi>contented</hi> to do his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and not easily <hi>despond;</hi> but if no better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to have <hi>patience;</hi> and without all passion, and with due respect to the person (careful not to fix any scandal or permanent infamy upon the family) <hi>send him away.</hi> He may be fit for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what else; as the Spanish Proverb saith, <hi>that which will not make a pot, may make a cover:</hi> or others may be more fitting for him, or more fortunate then your self. And so, as Physicians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their incurable Patients far off into the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56954:29"/>
countrey, free your self from him, that you may not be shamed by him, nor your self see his shame.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

Our Lord said, that the good <hi>Seed,</hi> being <hi>sown</hi> in the <hi>ground</hi> of an honest and tractable disposition, cannot but bring forth in youth the <hi>blade,</hi> then the <hi>eare,</hi> and at last arrive at maturity.

Neither can he in his whole life <hi>miscarry.</hi> For this is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him upon the <hi>rock,</hi> which withstands all floods and tempests; <hi>i. e.</hi> it is a <hi>principle,</hi> univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, perfect, unfailable; upon which whoever builds, shall live uniformly, contentedly, and happily, both here and hereafter: A <hi>principle</hi> which will bear him up in all estates, accidents, and actions; a <hi>principle,</hi> he never need change, or forget. His <hi>sufferings</hi> by it will be pleasant, his <hi>life</hi> blameles, his <hi>actions</hi> prudent, his <hi>words</hi> discreet, his <hi>thoughts</hi> virtuous and regular, and in all things shall he live according to the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> human nature is capable of. <hi>Religion</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes a <hi>certain end,</hi> the Glory of God, or doing as much good as he can to himself and others; which is an high and <hi>noble aime,</hi> and direction; and hinders all <hi>lownes of spirit,</hi> disorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in actions, and inconstancy in resolutions. For if any object be proposed, he considers not so much what is <hi>lawfull</hi> or <hi>expedient,</hi> as what is <hi>best</hi> to be done.

Indeed our <hi>understandings</hi> are <hi>foolish,</hi> and <hi>desires irregular;</hi> and to rectify them we have <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Governors,</hi> whose wisedome we make our guide; yet is not theirs comparable to that of our Lord set forth in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently therefore inculcate the greatness of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Governor</hi> of all, and every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, in this World; the <hi>shortnes</hi> of our <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>judgment;</hi> the great <hi>reward</hi> for

the good, and severe <hi>punishment</hi> for the bad. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to him the mysteries of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Creed, Commandments,</hi> his obligation in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism,</hi> and the doctrine of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> in due time. Accustom him often to <hi>meditate,</hi> and set before him the manner of the life, which our great Lord, the only Son of God, lived here on Earth; and the great <hi>sufferings</hi> and <hi>mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> he voluntarily chose and underwent; that so he may not prefer in his thoughts any way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.

Let him also frequently (suppose twice a day) <hi>read</hi> some part of the Scripture, and the <hi>Historical</hi> and <hi>Sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> Books rather then the other, which are more difficultly understood. In the morning let him, as much as he can, <hi>order</hi> his actions and emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the whole day; foreseeing what temta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that day are likely to come upon him, and how he may best prepare against them.</p>

The <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> he invents, the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> he <hi>establisheth,</hi> the <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Fleets</hi> he <hi>buildeth,</hi> argue him to be of a most noble extraction; and that a good man is worthy to be reverenced of his own self; in as much as he will do nothing misbeseeming so noble and eminent a nature. And especially let him be fortified, and well prepared to <hi>entertain sufferings;</hi> which is the great trial and cupel of gallant spirits, and without which he can never become perfect, <hi>i. e.</hi> his faculties can never be advanced to the height of their power. For in some sort <hi>suffering</hi> is the one half of our life, as <hi>doing</hi> is the other. Sufferings <hi>in body,</hi> sicknesses, pains, want of conveniencies in diet, lodging, liberty, wearines, &amp;c. In <hi>good name,</hi> obloquies, defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, revilings, affronts, too much reputation, expectation, and the like. In his <hi>mind,</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of what he desires, or is fitting for him to know, discontents for loss, or miscarriage of Relations, and Friends, breaches of friendship, treacheries, ingratitudes, failings of his designs, insulting of enemies, &amp;c. In <hi>external things,</hi> losses, poverty, with infinite more. I shall not name <hi>spiritual afflictions,</hi> because seldom inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to this age. Now for these and the like, let him be instructed how to render himself as <hi>little,</hi> as is possible, <hi>obnoxious</hi> to them, by not <hi>setting his mind upon what is not in his power;</hi> by <hi>good considerations</hi> proper to every sort, such as are furnished in many Books, particularly in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch.</hi>

But especially let him be practised and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to suffer and bear so many as his age well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, with <hi>courage</hi> and patience. However, he may arrive to the discretion <hi>not to be disturb'd for trifles,</hi> for the loss of a Horse, a Dog, or a Picture, or somewhat of smaller value.

The desire of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is of so great force in all our actions, <hi>that</hi> the false and conterfeit of it is the great incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and encouragment to all wickednes; <hi>that</hi> those men, who neglect and <hi>despise Religion,</hi> yet <hi>pretend</hi> altogether for <hi>honor; that</hi> the horridest and most dangerous designs never want persons to act them, if they can be perswaded to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable; <hi>that</hi> the pretended diminution of it is thought not sufficiently revenged with the loss of life; <hi>that</hi> for it so many <hi>Battels</hi> are fought, so many <hi>friendships</hi> broken, so many <hi>Laws,</hi> even of Religion despised, and <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> trampled on. But these are from a <hi>misapprehension</hi> and mistaking that to be honorable, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is not so. But I would my <hi>Educated</hi> should esteem reputation only from <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>virtuous persons,</hi> which is the <hi>attestation</hi> of them, that know best, to his actions, and a public <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation</hi> to emploiment. By this means he shall <hi>list</hi> himself under that <hi>ensign,</hi> and be <hi>ranged</hi> with that <hi>party,</hi> whereof <hi>our Lord</hi> himself is the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> and he will take <hi>pleasure</hi> in virtue and piety,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56954:32"/>
when he sees his actions and waies conformed to the sentiment of the World of all gallant persons, both past and present. Nor shall he need to hunt after <hi>applause</hi> and <hi>fame;</hi> that will follow him fast enough, with those that are either indifferently, or well inclined. But he must expect <hi>obloquy</hi> from the contrary party; and many evil words, and much raillery will be spent upon him; <hi>in vain,</hi> if he have the courage to despise them. Being a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> then let him consider that he is <hi>above</hi> the tongues of evil men: That he is engaged to nobler and sublimer designs and actions then other persons; he must <hi>steer by higher Stars,</hi> and aim at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more <hi>Heroical. Other men</hi> labour for a <hi>fortune,</hi> and are a long time before they can arrive at that height to which <hi>he is born,</hi> and wherein the virtues of his fore fathers have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him: he is already, because of his wealth, secured from necessity and want of what may be convenient or useful for his studies; <hi>from neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> too often the mother of low and abject thoughts, with which a <hi>poor man</hi> first combats before he can conquer any advantage of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment. Besides, by his <hi>Family</hi> he is already placed upon the <hi>Theater,</hi> where all his actions shall be observed and praised, even more then they deserve; all mens eyes are upon him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting somewhat extraordinary from him; and so he needs not some eminent action to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him into the good opinion of the World. Let him therefore aim at somewhat above, not only <hi>ordinary persons,</hi> but <hi>his own condition</hi> also; least he fall equal to those below him; for he cannot in <hi>practise</hi> reach the height his <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> designs. Let him say continually with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56954:32"/>
himself, <hi>for what came I into the World?</hi> Why hath God gived me such riches, such parents, such respect amongst men, but to do more good? Surely I have received five talents, a greater increase and return is expected from me. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnam fortunam magnus animus decet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. THIS <hi>greatnes of spirit</hi> consists principally in these <hi>virtues,</hi> (omitting most of those, which <hi>Erasmus</hi> in his Enchiridion <hi>Militis Christiani,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends very effectually, but are common to all Christians as well as to a Cavalier) I will only recite such as are more <hi>noble, heroical,</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable;</hi> and leave the pressing of them to the industry of the Educator.</p>
               <p>HIS Title of <hi>Gentleman</hi> suggests to him the virtue of <hi>humility, courtesy,</hi> and <hi>affability;</hi> easy of access, and passing by neglects and offences, especially from inferiors. <hi>Pardoning</hi> also <hi>injuries,</hi> as being superior to them; and not provocable to injure another. <hi>Generosum apud animum cito moritur iracundia.</hi> He <hi>despiseth</hi> no man for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or misery; and is <hi>not afraid</hi> to own those who are unjustly oppressed; for such, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, are men of parts, and if of virtue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, they commonly rise again. He is <hi>not proud,</hi> no not when commended, nor doth any thing render him insolent or haughty above other persons. Nor doth he strive to make himself known to be a Gentleman <hi>by huffing,</hi> swelling, strutting, or domineering over <hi>inferiors;</hi> nor <hi>by disobedience,</hi> and restines towards <hi>Superiors;</hi> much less <hi>by hectoring</hi> and quarelling. So neither <hi>by</hi> his clothes and peruque: nor stands he upon his <hi>family, name, wealth, honor</hi> of his <hi>kindred</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:56954:33"/>
or <hi>Ancestors;</hi> but strives to equal himself with those that <hi>began their reputation,</hi> in civility, industry, gentlenes and discretion. <hi>By obedience</hi> to Laws, submission to Governors; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to do barely what is enjoined, or to make <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>adequate rule</hi> of his actions, he forbears more then the law forbids, and doth more then it commands: he <hi>storns</hi> to <hi>take advantage of his quality</hi> to exemt him from such duties, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, and rules, as meaner persons are obliged unto.</p>
               <p>HE doth nothing for <hi>fear of punishment;</hi> nor leaves he a good action because of the <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, obloquy,</hi> or the like. <hi>Courage</hi> is the proper virtue of great spirits. Wherefore he defieth all <hi>little crafts</hi> and subtilties in negotiations, and thinks to master his designs by <hi>reason,</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnanimity,</hi> rather then <hi>finesse</hi> and <hi>devices.</hi> He is also, as much as is possible, <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>alike;</hi> in his conversation, calme, peaceable; and the same in private as in public. He bears also <hi>adversity</hi> cheerfully: when deservedly chid or corrected, is patient; is open, and free, not dissembling or hiding himself behind little nets, or fig-leaves. <hi>Invalidum omne naturâ querulum est.</hi> He scorns to tell a lie. <hi>Tasso</hi> said, that other vices were like <hi>clip'd</hi> or <hi>light,</hi> but lying like <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit</hi> and <hi>false</hi> mony, which an honest man ought not to <hi>pay,</hi> tho himself <hi>received</hi> it. Nor is he afraid to <hi>confess his faults,</hi> because he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth them unwillingly; nor ashamed to <hi>discover his ignorance,</hi> for he hath a desire to learn.</p>
               <p>HE is also <hi>laborious, abstinent, and willingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:56954:33"/>
                  <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>painful emploiments:</hi> he had rather be in a <hi>Camp</hi> then in a <hi>Bed-chamber,</hi> and is afraid of nothing more the the <hi>dead Sea</hi> of sloth and pleasure. <hi>Difficulties,</hi> he knows, <hi>bake</hi> and concoct the mind, <hi>lazines effeminates</hi> and loosneth it.</p>
               <p>HE is <hi>ready to do good to all; give</hi> rather then <hi>receive;</hi> is bountiful, values not great favours done by himself, so much as small ones re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Is not ungrateful to others; but himself desires no recompense, and is content, tho un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily used. <hi>Bona facere &amp; mala pati regium est.</hi> He thinks it much below him to hate any one.</p>
               <p>IN sum, he is <hi>bold</hi> without <hi>rashnes; affable</hi> without <hi>flattery; prudent</hi> without <hi>cunning; secret</hi> without <hi>dissimulation; devout</hi> without <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy.</hi> He is constant, not opiniatre; liberal, not prodigal; gentle, not soft; open, not foolish; fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, not covetous. He <hi>fears</hi> nothing, he <hi>despiseth</hi> nothing, he <hi>admires</hi> nothing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. TO beget in him these and all other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, set before him <hi>good examples;</hi> if of his own <hi>family, ancestors,</hi> and <hi>kindred</hi> 'tis the better: as also are those of his own <hi>Countrey, condition, time, age, acquaintance,</hi> and <hi>present,</hi> rather then <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>absent.</hi> No Prince (except of a very base alloy, as <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Commodus)</hi> if he hear of a <hi>good Musician</hi> or Comedian, desire to be like him; but if he knows of the <hi>noble Acts</hi> of his equal, he wisheth his own were such. Acquaint him also with the stories of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>virtuous,</hi> rather then <hi>great-fam'd</hi> men, for this many times fills his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56954:34"/>
head with vain and fruitles imaginations. And here I cannot but recommend to all persons the <hi>reading of lives,</hi> of modern rather then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient persons: which are not the worse (if drawn truly) because somewhat hansomer then the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. As <hi>Monsieur Peiresk,</hi> and <hi>Monsieur de Renty, Alessandro Luzzaga,</hi> &amp;c <hi>Coglione, Giacome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Pescara, Pibrac, Giac. Foscarini,</hi> &amp;c. Sir <hi>Tho. More,</hi> proposed to himself <hi>Jo. Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Mirandula,</hi> whose life and some of his Works he translated into English. <hi>Carolus Calvus</hi> caused a <hi>Manual</hi> to be made for his instruction in his daily duty, out of the lives of famous persons; and that excellent book of <hi>M. Aurelius,</hi> seems to be no other, then such Memorials as he col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for the governing himself and Empire. <hi>Examples</hi> also of <hi>evil men,</hi> if discreetly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, are as useful (if not more) then others; for wise men learn more by fools, then fools by wise men. The <hi>thorns</hi> also which are <hi>dug</hi> out of his own <hi>ground</hi> by admonition or correction, must serve to make <hi>a fence</hi> for the future: and he must be <hi>manured</hi> with the <hi>weeds</hi> pluck'd up in his own <hi>Garden.</hi> All the faults, both of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and other men, being useful to preserve him from the like.</p>
               <p n="6">6. LET him also know the great advantage of <hi>Innocency</hi> above <hi>Repentance.</hi> He that keeps himself from great sins, is as one that hath a <hi>prosperous voiage;</hi> he that repents as he that <hi>saves himself upon a plank.</hi> Consider what the good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther said to the frugal Son; <hi>All that I have is thine.</hi> And what S. John of those who continue <hi>Virgins,</hi> i. e. <hi>Innocent;</hi> that <hi>they have a new and peculiar song, that they,</hi> as immediate attendants,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56954:34"/>
                  <hi>follow the Lamb whither soever he goeth.</hi> And <hi>that they are the first fruits</hi> most holy <hi>unto God and our Lord.</hi> How happy is he that never goes out of his way! With a reasonable constant pace he must needs advance much further then other persons. Especially fortify him against the three great ruins of youth, <hi>Luxury, debauchery,</hi> and <hi>Gaming;</hi> and all other faults, which tho in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>lesser,</hi> yet his peculiar inclination may render them as <hi>dangerous as</hi> the other. But if his <hi>garment</hi> cannot be kept alwaies <hi>clean;</hi> yet have a care it may be with all possible speed <hi>washed;</hi> and let all endeavour be used to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve him from <hi>habitual and customary</hi> sins; for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then permit these, you ought to render him up to his Parents, who perhaps may find a cure you know not. <hi>Dionysius</hi> ('tis better to use a forreign example for that, which is too common amongst us) having in his youth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged himself the liberty of <hi>debauchery,</hi> and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding too late the inconvenience, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to oblige himself to the strict rules of temperance; was answerd, tho perhaps untruly, that he could not safely do it; if he relinquished his drinking he would fall into a consumtion; so in his own defence he was forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his sottishnes. So true is that of our Lord, <hi>He that committeth sin is the servant of sin;</hi> and especially in this sin of <hi>Drunkennes,</hi> whilst that <hi>extraneous supernatural fire</hi> quenching the <hi>true, native, genuine</hi> heat of the body, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth still to be nourished by its equal or stronger.</p>
               <p n="7">7. THE great spring and origine of <hi>lust</hi> is <hi>Idlenes;</hi> and if <hi>drinking</hi> increase the <hi>fire, lust</hi> takes
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56954:35"/>
away the <hi>fewel,</hi> both shorten the life. Ply him therefore with continual labour and study, that the <hi>Temter</hi> may find no bait to cover his poison. This is the remedy against that fire, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth so many noble Persons, Families and Nations; an enemy not to be <hi>contended</hi> withal, but <hi>avoided.</hi> After you have detained from him all <hi>Romances,</hi> lascivious Books, Pictures and discourses, and yet prevail not; <hi>bodily labour</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanged with study must be prescribed: and if this remedy not, <hi>change places,</hi> and suggest new objects continually. A worthy <hi>Prince</hi> of late times, being, by a servant of his, temted to this sin, shewing him all things prepared for the purpose; the <hi>Prince</hi> opened the door of the room, and commanded the officious Ruffian to give him place and secrecy; which he had no sooner done, but the <hi>Prince</hi> shut the door upon him, and forbad him ever to come again into his presence. And truly this <hi>Temtation</hi> is the exact, and almost <hi>adequate, trial</hi> of a brave and heroical spirit. He that is not carried away with every beauty, nor too much with any one; that is deaf to pleasure &amp; those enticements which so few can avoid, hath a <hi>noble</hi> Soul and <hi>well grounded</hi> virtue. But if neither sense of <hi>honor,</hi> which this sin wounds more then any other, <hi>(shame</hi> alwaies accompanying those unlawful, as <hi>blushing</hi> doth the lawful actions) nor sense of the grievousnes of the sin, nor the <hi>expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivenes,</hi> nor <hi>spoiling</hi> his parts, nor <hi>danger</hi> to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor the <hi>fear of diseases,</hi> and shortnes of life, nor <hi>conscience</hi> of his duty and virtue, nor <hi>emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> nor any other remedy will serve; 'tis best to <hi>marry</hi> him. This sort of Love, said <hi>Tasso,</hi> is a vice, wherein the same <hi>coin</hi> is not <hi>current</hi> between
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56954:35"/>
                  <hi>buyer</hi> and <hi>seller: the one</hi> pays honor, conscience, virtue as well as money, <hi>the other</hi> but love at the very best. But betwixt man and wife there is <hi>money</hi> for <hi>money, love</hi> for <hi>love,</hi> and all other things equal. But I look not upon <hi>Marriage</hi> as a remedy only for fornication, except in such young men, who before the time, are impetuously car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to those desires; it is <hi>much more honorable,</hi> but seldom falls under the Educators cognisance; and if it do, he is rather to advise who is <hi>unfit,</hi> then who is <hi>fit</hi> for a wife.</p>
               <p n="8">8. THE inconveniencies of <hi>gaming,</hi> are, 1. <hi>acquaintance</hi> with low, base, unworthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. 2. <hi>Learning</hi> also from them sordid and unmanly Arts, as sharking, cheating, lying, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating, which is by such counted overwitting their camerade. 3. <hi>Loss of time</hi> and money. 4. Great <hi>engagement of the passions,</hi> which is the most effectual and speedy means to obliterate any good thought, and introduce the superiority of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial part. 5. <hi>Learning,</hi> or at lest patiently enduring those abominable swearings, cursings, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, &amp;c. 6. <hi>Danger</hi> from other mens <hi>Passions.</hi> How many have bin murthered, more duelled, upon play-quarrels? <hi>Monsieur Faret</hi> observes, that only three sorts of persons follow the trade of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. 1. <hi>Covetuous,</hi> who for love of money care not what means they employ to obtain it, and find none easier and cheaper then this which requires no stock, no tools, no learning, and is readily taken up by any one that hath but little wit, and less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. 2. <hi>Lazy and effeminate,</hi> who not knowing how to spend their time better, can devise no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement so proper as this lasch exercise. 3. <hi>Desperate,</hi> who being by fortune, or their own
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56954:36"/>
wickednes, reduced to that extremity, that they live to day, as if they were to die to morrow, think they may obtain that subsistence by cheating or hazard, which they cannot hope reasonably for by their industry; and not having any virtue, ability, or lawful emploiment to supply their debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they betake themselves to prey upon the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and ignorance of better men then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Here then it is to be supposed, that <hi>no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> desires to advance his fortune by the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an other, and that to avoid coveteousnes (the author of those horrid mischiefs in gaming) he ought to forbear <hi>gaming,</hi> as the trade and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment of necessitous, idle, dissolute persons: the <hi>cheats</hi> whereof are so infinite, that it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible a virtuous or ingenious person should learn or avoid them; and that it is a science which will neither <hi>credit</hi> its <hi>Professor,</hi> nor <hi>quit the charge of the learning.</hi> Yet if <hi>not as a trade,</hi> but with due cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on practised, plays may be learned; such especially as are menaged by <hi>skill,</hi> and not fortune only, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with numbring, and to quicken his fancy and memory. Besides, <hi>Musick, discourse,</hi> and such other <hi>divertisements</hi> will not hold out long conversation with the same persons. But then let him not play for more money then the loss of it will be <hi>insensible</hi> to him; and if his play can bear its <hi>own charge,</hi> seek not to gain by it. And let him (as much as is possible) practise to be <hi>unconcern'd</hi> in the winning or loosing; to play <hi>calmly</hi> without passion. To which if he can arrive, he hath been <hi>serious</hi> in his <hi>play</hi> to very good purpose. Let him also be <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious,</hi> and abominate a lie, or cheat, even in his play. And lastly, if a <hi>by-stander,</hi> let him beware of discovering the faults, either unskilfulnes, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the gamesters; else both parties will hate him.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>WEALTH</hi> i. e. <hi>Money</hi> being the great Instrument, <hi>whereby</hi> all things are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in civil Societies; and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal to all other external commodities of our life; <hi>whereby</hi> also well laid out <hi>friends</hi> are gained in the <hi>Court of Heaven;</hi> it is necessary the <hi>Educated</hi> be taught the use and value of it betimes. It is reported of Sr <hi>Thomas More</hi>'s Father, that to the intent his Son might prove a good husband, and employ his time and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention wholly upon learning, he would never permit him to have any money, but when he wanted any thing to ask for it. <hi>Quod adeo stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte observavit, ut nec ad reficiendos attritos cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceos, nisi à patre peteret, pecuniam haberet.</hi> And this <hi>severity</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> afterwards migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily commended; <hi>For by that means</hi> (saith he) <hi>I could not furnish any vice or pleasure, I could not loose my time in gaming, nor knew I what unthris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines or luxury were, nor could I employ my self in any thing but my studies.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> was indeed one of a rare and extraordinary spirit, so observant of his Father, that the History saith he never offended him, nor was ever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with any thing his Father said or did to him: And <hi>when himself was Lord Chancellor of England, before he ascended his own Tribunal in Westminster-Hall, he went to the Kings-Bench-Court</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:56954:37"/>
                  <hi>(where his Father was Judge) to ask him blessing upon his knees:</hi> And I beleive had his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indulged him the command of all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, he would have done no otherwise then as without it. So that whether is better to keep <hi>all money</hi> from a Youth, or let him have <hi>some small proportion</hi> (for any great part he must by no means be possess'd of) is a question not to be decided by this example. I knew two Persons of quality, great friends, who brought up their Sons together, and were of divers opinions and practises in this point. If we may judge by the event, he, who had the power of money, proved the better husband. But neither do I think this to be any more then one single example; more, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, have miscarried on the other side. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the best general rule (because several dispositions are to be handled several waies, which must be left to the discretion of an ex-experienced <hi>Educator)</hi> is; That he be allowed <hi>so much a Month</hi> to be spent according to his own fancy, yet <hi>over-looked,</hi> not <hi>scrictly watched</hi> (except where there is reason to suspect some ill menagement) by the <hi>Governor.</hi> Who is also to restrain him from debauchery, gaming, and all notorious acts of <hi>Prodigality:</hi> and on the contrary to provoke him to <hi>compassionate</hi> the necessitous, <hi>be liberal</hi> to such as have any way served him (nothing being so unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Gentleman</hi> as ingratitude) and such like. But by no means let him have all his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in his own power, for that is to put the <hi>bridle out of his mouth,</hi> the means whereby the <hi>Governor</hi> must <hi>coerce</hi> him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. LET him, (at first with the direction of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56954:37"/>
his Governor) <hi>do as much of his own business</hi> (I mean buying, trucking, giving, receiving, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, chusing, clothes, books, &amp;c.) as he is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for hereby his mind is inured to a great piece of wisdom, <hi>[Soli sapienti notum est, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti res quaeque taxanda sit.</hi> Sen. ep. 82.] to <hi>esteem, compare</hi> one thing with another; to <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>value,</hi> not only things necessary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but all others also. For the <hi>grounds</hi> and principles of judgment and discretion are the same, tho the <hi>subjects,</hi> whereupon they are exercised, are divers. Nor let him fear the silly opinion of such Persons, as think cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or chusing a derogation to their honor, or <hi>buying for the just value a cheating of the sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</hi> I have seen the <hi>greatest King</hi> in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom refuse to buy what he conceived too dear, and to change the Shop where he thought himself not well used. Persons also of very good quality in <hi>Italy</hi> are not asham'd to go to a Shop, chuse, and bargain, <hi>v. g.</hi> for their clothes, and make the <hi>Taylor</hi> also cut them out of the whole piece before them. Whereas an ordinary Gentleman amongst us thinks himself <hi>abused,</hi> if <hi>not cousened.</hi> As if it were <hi>noblenes</hi> to expose and suffer themselves to be <hi>overreach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> derided, and fooled by an impudent <hi>Pedlar,</hi> or flattering <hi>Host.</hi> Who, tho in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they arrive, by the impudent folly of those, who know no nobler way of generosity then to be fooled by the meanest and unworthiest of all people, to buy the estates of such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals, as degrade themselves first into a <hi>famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity,</hi> then into an <hi>equality,</hi> at last into an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority,</hi> with them: yet in other Countreys, where men have and make use of the parts
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56954:38"/>
God hath given them, they are kept in that degree and rank which befits their Profession.</p>
               <p n="3">3. LET him alwaies <hi>buy with ready money;</hi> which will both <hi>keep him</hi> in mediocrity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, within his bounds, <hi>teach him</hi> the value of money, and <hi>acquire him</hi> very great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both with Tradesmen and others. He buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>cheaper</hi> and <hi>better</hi> commodities, and is not imposed upon with false bills and accounts. By this means also he may learn to live <hi>under</hi> his revenue; which whosoever doth not, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver keep himself out of debt. It is therefore dangerous to have to do with them that <hi>keep books,</hi> which are <hi>authentick records,</hi> tho <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned</hi> many times <hi>by careles</hi> or <hi>dishonest Boys;</hi> except himself also keep another, and as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently look to his accounts; and that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to, (old reckonings never turning to the profit of the debtor): and if after the manner of <hi>Merchants,</hi> under the notion of <hi>Creditor</hi> and <hi>Debtor,</hi> 'tis the easier and better. But if he keep his accounts severely, not only they with whom he deals, but his Servants also, will be more careful what reckonings they bring him.</p>

YOUNG <hi>Men</hi> out of emulation have a great vanity of <hi>desiring whatever they see their equals enjoy,</hi> and this proves many times a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and expensive <hi>folly:</hi> being accompanied most-what with a speedy loathing, or neglect of what they unreasonably long'd for. <hi>Omnis flultitia laborat fastidio sui.</hi> A young man need not be altogether cured of this distemper: if it can be regulated, excellent use may be made of it for his instruction in many knowledges,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56954:38"/>
and gaining him much experience. But to <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the exorbitancy,</hi> the best way is to make him an <hi>example to others;</hi> by putting him upon some <hi>particular curiosity</hi> by himself, which may with reputation be opposed to those many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of his Camerades. And such a one also as need not perish with the using, as Globes, Maps, Pictures, Medals, Curiosities of Art and Nature, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. NEITHER let the <hi>Educator</hi> be too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose or solicitous to keep him from <hi>all vanity in clothes</hi> or <hi>expences,</hi> lest he be discouraged. For few being willing to learn out of the School of <hi>Experience,</hi> and she being a <hi>good</hi> Mistress, if not the <hi>sole</hi> one, it is very fitting to make her a partner in our instruction. Only the <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> (that is, <hi>reason)</hi> must be the <hi>chief Master,</hi> and let his charge take out only such lessons under her, as his Guide shall think fit: that is, such as may convince the Younker of the vanity of those and the like desires. <hi>Scriptum est enim</hi> (saith <hi>Rog.

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the preservation of his Health.</head>
               <p>BECAUSE it is very tedious, chargeable, and sometimes dangerous to repair for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry small distemper to a <hi>Physician,</hi> it is very fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Governor</hi> should know to preserve his charge <hi>in health.</hi> For without that he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to undergo any emploiment; neither can he study, nor follow his exercises, when sick; but is troublesom to others, and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to himself.</p>
               <p n="1">1. IN Youth <hi>excess in eating and drinking</hi> is very frequent, necessary therefore it is to <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> his <hi>appetite.</hi> For if the stomack be stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond its true extent, it will require to be filled, but never well digest what it receives. Besides it is much better to <hi>prevent</hi> diseases by <hi>temperance,</hi> sobriety, chastity, and exercise (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) then <hi>cure</hi> them by <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick. Qui enim se Medicis dederit, seipsum sibi eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit. Summa medicinarum ad sanitatem corporis &amp; animae abstinentia est.</hi> He that lives abstemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously or but temperately, needs not study the <hi>wholesomnes</hi> of this meat, nor the <hi>pleasantnes</hi> of that sawce, the <hi>moments</hi> and punctilios of air, heat, cold, exercise, lodging, diet; nor is criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal in cookery and vintnership; but takes thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56954:39"/>
what God gives him. Especially let all young men forbear wines and strong drinks, as well as spiced and hot meats; for they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a <hi>preternatural</hi> heat into the body, and at least <hi>hinder</hi> and obstruct, if not at length <hi>extinguish</hi> the <hi>natural.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. BUT if <hi>overtaken by excess</hi> (as it is difficult alwaies to stand upon guard) the best remedy is <hi>vomiting,</hi> or <hi>fasting</hi> it out; neither go to bed upon a full stomack, except by reason of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it be necessary to remove him from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; that the World may not be witnes of his <hi>brutality;</hi> and that himself may be hindred from all <hi>extravagancies,</hi> and be ashamed of it the next day. Let <hi>Physick</hi> be alwaies the <hi>last</hi> remedy, that Nature may not trust to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IF through <hi>melancholy, timorousnes,</hi> or <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manish education</hi> (for I see very few Women well educate Men; nor Men Women) your charge have <hi>imaginations that he is alwaies sick;</hi> (if he only pretend so that he may avoid stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and labour, 'tis another case) do not at first seem to discourage him, but rather bring him off his humor by <hi>painful</hi> and <hi>harsh Physick;</hi> which is the cure also of those melancholic persons, whose sicknes, tho they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently indisposed, yet is not dangerous either for life or labour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. MUCH of <hi>health</hi> consists in <hi>exercises and recreations,</hi> which must be regulated according to the Country, Season, &amp;c. but generally ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>violent</hi> then <hi>lasch;</hi> such, I mean, as may cause the body to <hi>transpire</hi> plentifully; and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56954:40"/>
                  <hi>exhale</hi> those black and fuliginous vapors, which are wont to oppress young men; that nature be not hindred in her <hi>circulation.</hi> Neither be afraid, tho he be weary and tired: for <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> is no <hi>disease,</hi> nor doth <hi>simple heat</hi> without <hi>putrefaction</hi> cause a <hi>Feaver.</hi> Besides <hi>brisk exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise</hi> will render him strong, active, mettlesome; whereas <hi>idlenes</hi> contracts a <hi>stagnation of humors, numnes</hi> of the joints, and <hi>dulnes</hi> in the brain. Yet <hi>violent exercises,</hi> as running, leaping, wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, are not so fit for thin, choleric, and weak bodies: rendring such old and gowty before their time, as they did <hi>Constans</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>
               <p n="5">5. DANCING is a moderate exercise; so much whereof is to be learn'd as may give a good and <hi>graceful</hi> motion of the body. No Nation civil or barbarous, ancient or modern (except our late contradictive spirits) that express not their joy and mirth by it, which makes it seem a <hi>sprout of the Law of Nature.</hi> But the use, which is now frequently made of it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since it is become a <hi>difficult study,</hi> and many years, besides infinite practise, required to a reasonable perfection in it, I cannot but utterly condemn: subscribing to the <hi>severe,</hi> but <hi>true,</hi> censure of that most excellent modern Historian <hi>Monsieur de Rhodez. There is nothing</hi> (saith he) <hi>which doth more dissipate the powers of the spirit, nor more enervate the forces of the Soul, then the ravishing harmony, the continual agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body, and the charms of Ladies conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</hi> The great <hi>triumph</hi> of <hi>sensuality</hi> is such meetings, where the <hi>eare</hi> is fed with <hi>Musick,</hi> the <hi>eyes</hi> with <hi>Beauties,</hi> the <hi>smell</hi> with <hi>Perfums,</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:56954:40"/>
the <hi>tast</hi> with <hi>Banquets;</hi> whither none are invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or come, but <hi>to please</hi> or <hi>be pleased.</hi> Could their thoughts be then seen, in what a hurry and tumult should we perceive them? what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, what fears, what impatience, what lust, what jealousy, what envying, what despisings! &amp;c. <hi>Card. Borromeus</hi> in his Book against Balls and Dances saith: that he, when a young man at the <hi>University,</hi> and his companions, with great importunity prevailed with one of their <hi>Professors,</hi> a grave and prudent person, to go along with them to a <hi>Ball:</hi> who having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the actions and circumstances thereof, told them with great astonishment, that it was an <hi>invention of the Devil</hi> to destroy <hi>Souls,</hi> by corrupting the very being and essence of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> virtues. When a servant lighteth a torch, we give him strict charge not to carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst flax, straw, or the like. Why do not Parents forbid their Children to frequent those places, where is more danger of kindling ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of flame? to have the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion swelled with the presence of Beauties in their trim, and under a full sail, when the blood is chased, and the mind set upon pleasure; is not drinking <hi>cold water,</hi> but <hi>strong poison</hi> to one overheated.</p>
               <p n="6">6. IT will not be amiss here to add, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>bodily diseases, infirmities, and undecencies</hi> may by the <hi>Educators</hi> care be <hi>regulated,</hi> and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly, or in good part, <hi>amended.</hi> For few there be, who have all the members of their body <hi>equally</hi> sound and well-disposed; the worst is corrected by bringing spirits to that part with labour and exercise: as</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the divers passions, inclinations, and dispositions of Man, and the ways to rectify and order them.</head>
               <p n="1">1. BUT that the <hi>Educator</hi> may clearly see his work, and have it, as it were, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his view; I will dig a little deeper; ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomize and lay open the <hi>Soul</hi> with its <hi>operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Perhaps not so <hi>accurately</hi> and punctually, yet as plainly, and for practice as <hi>usefully,</hi> as I can; regarding not the <hi>curiosity</hi> or Philosophy, but the <hi>necessity</hi> and utility of the knowledge. For he that knows <hi>quid homo potest,</hi> will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive what his <hi>charges</hi> abilities are, and what his defects; and consequently what the remedies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IN the <hi>Soul</hi> then are two sorts of powers, <hi>Cognoscitive</hi> for knowledge. <hi>Motive</hi> for action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knowledge</hi> (omitting <hi>apprehension</hi> as not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under our consideration) consists in <hi>inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, memory,</hi> and <hi>judgment,</hi> of which in their places.</p>
               <p>Action is in the <hi>Will</hi> (of which we shall not speak) or <hi>Affections.</hi> And these are either <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscible</hi> or <hi>Irascible,</hi> and both these are <hi>Passions</hi> or <hi>Inclinations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Passions</hi> are <hi>the natural motions of the Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards objects agreeable or disagreeable.</hi> Or <hi>the</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:56954:42"/>
                  <hi>motions, or effects, which objects pleasing or displeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately cause in the Soul. i. e.</hi> what the Soul suffers from its objects immediately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deliberation. Tho some call <hi>Passions</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the more <hi>irregular</hi> and <hi>ungoverned</hi> actions of the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inclinations</hi> are <hi>the frequenter, and customary working according to those passions.</hi> And, if meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to natural suggestions, they are properly called <hi>Inclinations:</hi> but if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to excess, and be not bridled and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, they become <hi>vices.</hi> But if regulated by reason or Gods spirit, they are properly <hi>Virtues.</hi> If by the probity of <hi>Nature,</hi> without much <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,</hi> our inclinations work <hi>laudably,</hi> i. e. as they do when <hi>habitually</hi> regulated by reason, then are those natural Inclinations called <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral virtues,</hi> or <hi>good nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. BY the way take this caution, <hi>That you trust not to these natural virtues, as if they were, or could be, sufficient to make a man habitually and throughly virtuous:</hi> or, as if he, that acteth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, were really and sufficiently virtuous. What <hi>Seneca</hi> saith of Valour, is true of all the rest. <hi>Paucissimos fortes natura procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, bona institutione plures reddidit industria.</hi> And this our holy Religion expresseth more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when it distinguisheth between <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi> for if <hi>natural</hi> dispositions be not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently virtuous <hi>morally,</hi> neither are <hi>moral</hi> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues sufficient for obtaining <hi>heavenly</hi> and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual graces. <hi>Dispositions</hi> indeed they are to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but must themselves also be ordered and directed by <hi>Prudence:</hi> else they will run into many mistakes; <hi>love,</hi> where there is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reason
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56954:42"/>
to <hi>hate,</hi> and <hi>cajole,</hi> where they should <hi>chastise:</hi> they will also <hi>neglect</hi> many actions of virtue, and <hi>run into</hi> many of vice. Nor is it a sufficient excuse for any evil-dispositioned, <hi>v. g.</hi> an angry person, to say, that he is so <hi>naturally,</hi> for we are to live by <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> not by <hi>Nature;</hi> nor is it well said of a thief, I am so naturally, for to what purpose have you reason?</p>

               </p>
               <p>IT is to be noted, that many times a man <hi>worketh contrary to his natural Inclinations;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Inclinations</hi> follow the <hi>cognoscence</hi> of the Soul: and it happens frequently, that a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and strong apprehension may be formed on a suddain, contrary to what is usual. As the sound of Drums, Trumpets, Shouts, Examples, &amp;c. may put such apprehensions into a <hi>Coward,</hi> as may make him <hi>valiant;</hi> and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weariness, darkness, rumors, sombre and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal accidents, &amp;c. may intimidate a valiant man. Wherefore it is great <hi>rashness</hi> to judge of any mans inclination by any particular action: or to think that every man must work, as he is inclined. Again; <hi>Passions</hi> having their force, because reason and the commanding part of the Soul doth not restrain and bridle them; it seems that <hi>Inclinations</hi> are best discerned when they are most at liberty: as <hi>Childrens at their play,</hi> when they think not of dissembling, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining them. And 2. that they, <hi>who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand not one passion,</hi> are also <hi>obedient to others;</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:56954:43"/>
and that he who is one way passionate, is likely to be so in <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>any.</hi> And 3. that the <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> seeing the inclination of his charge, may moderate, change, and govern it as it shall be convenient; and that by changing objects, and apprehensions; but chiefly by shewing him the good or bad of that, or the contrary, that is, by rationally persuading him to submit it to reason.</p>
               <p n="5">5. THESE <hi>Inclinations</hi> are but as the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and principles of our <hi>dispositions</hi> and <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors:</hi> which are made up of many of these (Man as all other Creatures being <hi>de-de-composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum)</hi> and these in several degrees and predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancies; and these also mingled and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with the differences of knowledge or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension. And by the way, upon these grounds, I perswade my self, it would not be difficult to enumerate <hi>all, or the greatest part of our actions, and the causes and order of them;</hi> which is a piece of knowledge the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the well menaging of our selves that can be; for the variety of passions, inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and dispositions is the cause of all human business and affairs in the whole World. From the mingling of Inclinations, and apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, arise those infinite sorts and varieties of (as the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> call them) <hi>Wits;</hi> we term them <hi>Dispositions.</hi> The chiefest I have observed, I will here set down, for an <hi>essay</hi> and <hi>sampler,</hi> to direct those who have more leisure to add to them according to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. And it would be a good work to <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterize</hi> them so vively, that men (at least such as are <hi>extravagant)</hi> may see themselves as in a

glass; and discovering their imperfections, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and alter them. In general some <hi>dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi> are <hi>bad,</hi> others <hi>good. Bad</hi> are such as these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as want wit, dead, stupid, sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, heavy, dull, forgetful, sottish, not able to apply themselves to any thing, yet are crafty, and deceitful; these are miserable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Idle, sensual, slothful, gluttons, without memory or care, cat-witted, dissolute, foolish, impertinent, obstinate, untractable.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Vain, giddy, harebrain'd, bird-witted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant, such as employ their thoughts in things of no value (as <hi>Domitian</hi> in catching flies) skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from place to place, neglectful, haters of thinking, inconsiderate, heeding nothing after it is out of their hands. Fantastical, restless, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, crack-brain'd, carried away with every new object, never considering what is best, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant, impatient, changeable; that work without affection or delight, doing what they must to make an end, rather then to do it well.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Curious, scornful, mockers, jeerers, taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, abusive, reproachful, tatlers, charlatans, who upon all occasions are ready to publish all they know to the prejudice of another; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful in making debates and mischief, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God and charity, breeders of all petit factions, news-brokers.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Buffoons, ridiculous, flatterers, apes, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, players, wits, airy, light, foolish.</p>

               <p n="11">11. Covetuous, sordid.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Of angry persons some are sour, harsh, ill to please, sturdy, sullen, intractable, unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visable (a disposition mixed up of pride and melancholy) peevish, fixing upon the worst, morose (a delicate sort of wasps) who are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended if every thing be not done the best way, <hi>i. e.</hi> as they would have it. Some mens anger vapoureth away in words, clamor, scolding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling, railing, threatning. Others say little, but lay up revenge against an opportunity; this is incident to superiors, who conceive it below them to quarrel, and who think themselves despised, if every thing is not conformed to their will. Others neither chide nor revenge, but turn their wrath upon themselves, as melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholic men do. I pitty these, for they have already the reward of their peaceable wrath: who have a pleasure in their torment, and a kind of satisfaction in their most agreeable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. But it were better for them to chide even without reason, then store up this sooty humor, which corrodes body and soul.</p>

               <p>There is also great <hi>mixture</hi> and <hi>composition</hi> of these, sometimes contraries seeming equally emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the same person. <hi>Procopius</hi> saith of <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, Juxta malignus erat &amp; deceptu facilis, cujus ingenium pravum &amp; fatuum dixeris. Dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat ipse fraudibus omnium expositus. Temperamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum insolitum, cum ex contrariis constet. Inconstans amicis, inimicis inexorabilis; avarus, contentiosus, novarum rerum cupidus; ad scelera facile, ad opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma nullis suasionibus moveri poterat.</hi> Yet is not this temper so unusual as <hi>Procopius</hi> supposeth. For most men mistake a <hi>vice</hi> for a seemingly like, but really-contrary, <hi>virtue.</hi> As <hi>pride</hi> for <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of spirit; hectorisme</hi> for <hi>valour; cunning</hi> for <hi>wisedome;</hi> which are really contraries. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed concerning <hi>young Men,</hi> and all others (as Women, persons ill-educated, &amp;c.) who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their present apprehensions and <hi>impetus,</hi> without much considering their actions, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying their inclinations by reason, it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hard to discern whether they be virtuous, or vitious; which is not <hi>so</hi> concerning those who are habituated: for then <hi>all virtues</hi> go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as well as <hi>all vices.</hi> And those <hi>constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are easily discovered by their own <hi>light.</hi> But <hi>natural virtues</hi> are often accompanied with such <hi>natural vices</hi> as are <hi>habitually</hi> contrary. As <hi>meekness</hi> is often joined with <hi>faithfulness,</hi> and then it proceeds from <hi>want</hi> of spirit and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56954:46"/>
Whereas <hi>habitual</hi> or acquisite meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hath perhaps an inclination to sloth, but hath mortified and bridled it. And every vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue appeareth and sheweth it self, when necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or fitting occasion requires it. So <hi>gravity</hi> in a child, and those who being old are yet children in understanding, is accompanied with <hi>dulness,</hi> formality, pride, and censoriousness: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it proceeds from want of mettle, not from choice; and seeks to justify and shrow'd that defect by finding fault with others. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as true and laudable <hi>gravity</hi> is opposed only <hi>to levity</hi> and <hi>folly.</hi> So natural <hi>civility</hi> and courtesy is joined with effeminacy; <hi>severity</hi> with impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cability, and the like.</p>
               <p n="6">6. CLIMATS also, and divers other <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> produce various inclinations; not that any Country produceth only one inclination, but only more of one then another. So <hi>all of one age</hi> are not alike inclined, tho <hi>most</hi> of them are; and more in <hi>youth</hi> then age, because the manners are then <hi>least artificial.</hi> I will set down therefore, and because most to our purpose, <hi>inclinations of youth:</hi> that the <hi>Educator</hi> may in some measure be able to judge, which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of the <hi>Age,</hi> and therefore likely to fall off when his charge arrives to <hi>maturity.</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this caution ought to be observ'd; that he <hi>humor</hi> or <hi>encourage not</hi> his charge in any of them, for that is to perswade him <hi>to be a child alwaies.</hi> And 2ly that, if he be in any of them <hi>exorbitant,</hi> the fault then seems to be of the <hi>person,</hi> not of the <hi>age;</hi> which happens very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently: and therefore requires more care, and a more early and efficacious remedy in the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

                  <hi>Young men</hi> then, being guided by <hi>sense, nature</hi> and <hi>passion,</hi> not <hi>reason, experience</hi> or <hi>discretion,</hi> are <hi>inconstant</hi> and unsetled. For the sense being easily tired with the enjoiment of its object, and the Soul (being made for somthing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) not finding satisfaction in things sensible, they conceive à <hi>fastidiousness of the present,</hi> and a <hi>desire to change:</hi> and this is <hi>necessary</hi> for their condition, that they may not obstinately and fixedly resist (as old men commonly do) the introducing of such <hi>habits</hi> as are necessary to the perfecting their faculties, and making them happy. For tho their passions be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and sensuality predominant, yet their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance is strongest at the beginning, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they with patience are brought off; their natural inconstancy suggesting advantages to the Director. For their present thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vented, they are at long-running, as a fish when wearied, brought tamely to your hand: therefore also you may <hi>hope well</hi> of most of them, but be <hi>confident</hi> of none. <hi>Hence</hi> also it cometh that with less reluctance they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace such <hi>knowledges</hi> as do not <hi>thwart their pleasures,</hi> and senses, but of <hi>morality</hi> and prudence they are less capable; and that in sickness when sensuality fails, they are easiliest wrought upon. Therefore also are they <hi>open,</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their thoughts and inclinations. <hi>Eager,</hi> also, <hi>hasty, unadvised,</hi> sudainly resolving and as violently pursuing what they resolve for a little time. <hi>Quicquid volunt valde volunt. Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macful</hi> also, as not tamed by adversity or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. They are also <hi>taken with shows,</hi> gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry in cloathing, &amp;c. desirous of what they see, and weary of what they possess: <hi>ambitious</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:56954:47"/>
                  <hi>to do what they cannot,</hi> or should not, but <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectful</hi> of what they ought and can. Therefore gladly would they be <hi>learned,</hi> but <hi>not study;</hi> be <hi>excellent,</hi> but <hi>not take pains:</hi> consequently <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive,</hi> easily seduced, negligent, careless, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, forgetful, improvident and credulous: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of honor,</hi> and making a shew of excelling in beauty, clothes, &amp;c. of getting the <hi>victory</hi> at play and gaming, yet valuing honour more then gain; <hi>wanting experience</hi> they are <hi>angry,</hi> fierce, enemies of thinking and consideration, and therefore rather affecting bodily exercises, at which they labour and sweat without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. <hi>Full of hope also,</hi> catching at appearances, gay, merry, laughers, modest, bashful (because ignorant) pittiful, loving their companions and and follies more then riches; the want where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they value not, because they <hi>know not</hi> their value; therefore <hi>not looking beyond the present,</hi> nor avoiding ill consequences. <hi>Imitative</hi> also; for the Soul, being a blank paper, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally desiring to be furnished, greedily imbibes what it sees before it; and this is that <hi>faculty,</hi> with which God indued them on purpose that they may learn, and advance in knowledge and wisedom. Children speak nothing but what they hear, and do nothing but what they see: hence they are generally addicted to designing, acting, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>SUCH then being the conditions of <hi>young persons;</hi> those who have the <hi>contrary</hi> are <hi>to be feared</hi> and well look'd after; especially the <hi>sly, reserved, close,</hi> who are also commonly <hi>cunning</hi> and <hi>malicious,</hi> for this reservedness proceeds ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>pride,</hi> conceit of their own abilities,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56954:47"/>
and unwillingness to be taught; or from <hi>evil designs;</hi> for who strives to conceal what he cares not who knows? or from <hi>jealousy,</hi> that other persons counsel them not for the best. These do usually guide themselves by words that seem to them accidentally spoken, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are easily ensnared and ruined. For <hi>no man</hi> being <hi>able to bear the burden of his own thoughts,</hi> and these having no friend or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, they have no other course to steer. They will with all patience hear your advice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, when they are resolved nothing shall work upon or alter their purposes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they will take notice of so much as serves to their own designs, and misinterpret and detort what you say, even contrary to your intention. These persons are commonly seized by flatterers, mistresses, or at best fall into low and mean courses. It is difficult to <hi>cure this malady,</hi> yet ere they know their strength, threats and punishment do them good: or <hi>accidental recommendation</hi> of such to their conversation, who may humor them by counterfeiting the same inclinations, and complying with them, till by little and little they can shew them the great advantage of freedom and openness.</p>
               <p>It hath bin also the observation of learned men, that the <hi>sad, melancholick</hi> and <hi>querulous</hi> hardly advance to any great proficiency. <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipuè vitentur tristes, &amp; omnia deplorantes, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus nulla non causa in querelas placet</hi> Sen. <hi>Neque illum tristem semperque demissum sperare possum cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctae circa studia mentis fore.</hi> Quint. Querulousnes often proceeds from some inward debility of body, as sharp humors, mal-conformation of some part, or the like.</p>

IMPUDENCE is commonly a forerunner of <hi>debauchery,</hi> violence, contemt of Laws; also of <hi>heedlesness,</hi> forgetfulness, slowness to learning and wisedom. <hi>Confidence</hi> is the <hi>medium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt it and bashfulness. 'Tis observed in the life of <hi>Emanuel Philibert</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that when a child, he had the confidence to speak to any person, as he did to <hi>Charles</hi> V. that great Emperor; but if what he said was not approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he pressed it not, nor was offended when denied; which seems indeed to be the true notion of <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Confidence,</hi> to express his mind freely, yet entirely submitting himself to the judgment of his Superiors.</p>
               <p>BASHFULNES on the contrary is an <hi>evil weed,</hi> but <hi>sign</hi> of a fruitful and <hi>good indoles.</hi> Care must be had, that in weeding it we extirpate not modesty.

'Tis also <hi>an evil guardian of youth,</hi> betraying it, contrary to its own desire and inclination, to the worst men, who hurry it to evil actions and places. How many have lost their estates, honors and lives, because they were <hi>ashamed to distrust?</hi> A man invites you to drink, to game, to rob, to be bound for him: cast of that foolish mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, <hi>deny him.</hi> An impudent flatterer comes to eat upon you, he begs an horse, a ring, a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, give to the <hi>deserver,</hi> not the <hi>beggar.</hi> Some are so bashful, as not to send for a <hi>good Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> or chuse a <hi>good Lawyer</hi> or <hi>Governor,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are acquainted with a <hi>worse.</hi> Begin betimes to break this fault in small matters, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert

Also because they are <hi>inconsiderate</hi> and <hi>furious,</hi> they pursue their purposes good or bad with great force and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; and therefore take not the aptest and most rational means to obtain them. (For <hi>reason</hi> judgeth what is fit and just, <hi>anger</hi> useth that as fit which it <hi>judgeth</hi> to be such; which makes many good <hi>Hunters,</hi> for we are not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with Beasts, few good <hi>Soldiers.)</hi> Hence it comes that <hi>angry men</hi> are <hi>unwary,</hi> easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;

not <hi>open</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> but <hi>exposed</hi> to them, who are willing to take advantage. <hi>Apt</hi> also to <hi>judge evil,</hi> and hate other men upon slight occasions; therefore are they not fit for <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:</hi> also <hi>uneven,</hi> and <hi>unequal</hi> in their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; many times also <hi>inexorable,</hi> unsociable, and tyrannical: and their discourses runs much upon oaths and curses. Many are the <hi>causes of angriness;</hi> sometimes a <hi>choleric humor,</hi> from their nativity, or adventitious, so we see families ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry subject to it; but most commonly it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from <hi>weakness of judgment.</hi> And gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the more impotent, the subjecter to it: as children, women, aged, sickly, in adversity, or such as are other-waies also passionate.

               <p>BECAUSE this <hi>passion</hi> admits <hi>no counsel</hi> as other passions do, but is, as when a man <hi>sets his own house on fire,</hi> all full of tumult and confusion, that no orders can be heard or obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it is difficultly cured.

Neither <hi>desire great, much, difficult,</hi> or <hi>rare</hi> things; nor desire <hi>vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently;</hi> be as indifferent to all things as is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; and make use of <hi>common</hi> things, rather then <hi>appropriate</hi> them to your self; that I and <hi>MINE</hi> are great sticklers for anger. When <hi>you are in a fit,</hi> reflect upon your self and your inner constitution, see how the whole frame is disordered (it is a passion even in the external as <hi>deformed</hi> as <hi>dangerous)</hi> and either <hi>conquer</hi> it (which after you have done sometimes, the victory to a vigilant person is much easier) or at least <hi>defer</hi> what your passion promts you to do; for whatever is done in anger, may also be done with judgment. For <hi>discretion</hi> saith not, do not punish a faulty servant, but do it prudently. Some endeavor to <hi>suppress</hi> and quench it by violence, but then it is apt to <hi>ferment</hi> either into melancholy, or malice, and envy.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Education</hi> also <hi>of choleric persons</hi> is not less difficult, except they be menaged when <hi>very young;</hi> for then their humor may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by force and punishment; but when they begin to understand their strength, fair means must be used, for fear of breaking also their <hi>spirit;</hi> and while we cure the <hi>angry</hi> man, we make him <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>lazy.</hi> For this <hi>passion,</hi> and <hi>spirit,</hi> are many times so twisted together, that it is difficult to distinguish the actions of one from those of the other; and consequently to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56954:50"/>
pluck up one without destroying the other. It is <hi>in vain to admonish</hi> or reprehend <hi>when the passion is violent,</hi> for at best 'tis but as burning feathers under the nose of one in a fit of the falling sickness, which may perhaps <hi>raise him</hi> up, but cannot <hi>cure him.</hi> But <hi>when he is sober,</hi> furnish him with good remedies and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations against a time of necessity; as men do when they fear a Siege, and expect no relief from abroad. Or <hi>check it with another passion,</hi> as with shame, or fear, or joy. Indeed cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and moderate pleasure clear up the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: and tho <hi>sadness</hi> and <hi>anger</hi> differ, yet are they much <hi>alike in their causes,</hi> and the same medicines are good for both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. PRIDE is many times grafted upon <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:</hi> and is so like to it, that it is not easy to discern which operations proceed from which cause. It is grounded in an <hi>error of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, i. e.</hi> a vain and false opinion of his own excellency above others, and above the truth. In youth it <hi>discovers</hi> it self by <hi>contemt of others,</hi> ingratitude, injuriousness; <hi>accepting</hi> all honor, respect, and officiousness as due and deserved, but <hi>paying</hi> none: therefore <hi>conversing more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly with inferiors,</hi> and domineering over them also; neither is a proud man familiar or <hi>friendly</hi> to any but <hi>flatterers,</hi> to whom he easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>prey.</hi> His care is not to <hi>do well,</hi> but to <hi>seem</hi> so; and therefore he is <hi>ashamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess a fault,</hi> error, ignorance, or inferiority; to learn or be taught; to be chid or corrected. Instead of amendment he is sullen and dogged. He is seldome free from <hi>envy,</hi> and therefore <hi>impatiently hears the praises of another,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56954:50"/>
his <hi>equal;</hi> but he swells, looks big, struts, vapors, and boasts to shew what he thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be: he is <hi>displeased,</hi> hateth, and reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth if not treated according to his merit. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring himself with others</hi> 'tis to his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; looking only upon their <hi>errors,</hi> and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizing them into faults and <hi>vices:</hi> but upon his own <hi>virtues,</hi> which are all <hi>heroical.</hi> Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>prying into the actions of Superiors,</hi> whom he imagines to usurp upon him, who deserves and can menage all things, better then they. Therefore if in power, he <hi>becomes imperious,</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, opiniastre, impatient, if every thing correspond not to his desires: But if he <hi>fall into misery,</hi> as commonly such do (being more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to it by reason of their high valuing of themselves) he is low, vile, cowardly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. His great badge is <hi>singularity,</hi> and his discours runs much upon <hi>I, we, mine,</hi> &amp;c. This being a fault of the mind, and not radicated in the temper of the body, is reduced to equani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity by <hi>mortification</hi> of his own conceits and fancies: either by <hi>punishments,</hi> by <hi>reason</hi> and good counsel, or <hi>conversing much with strangers;</hi> or by the <hi>method taken by God Almighty</hi> to humble him by others resisting,, despising, and crossing him.</p>
               <p n="8">8 I HAVE not observed that any <hi>Physio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnomical signs</hi> are <hi>infallible:</hi> not, tho many of them concur in the same <hi>indication;</hi> and tho ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny famous Authors and Proverbs in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages seem to authenticate them. For indeed the <hi>temperature of the body</hi> seems no otherwise to be the <hi>cause</hi> of the <hi>actions of the soul</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, then as the <hi>temper of the Axe is</hi> the <hi>cause</hi>

of <hi>cutting;</hi> to which many other things as fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, weight, motion, &amp;c. are required as well as it; and yet all together are but the <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the man,</hi> who by greater strength, dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, &amp;c. can work better with another sort of a worse tool, and can make <hi>one advantage remedy another disadvantage.</hi> We see also that <hi>study and experience</hi> give more force to the soul, then any disposition whatsoever of the body; even as temperance, labour, &amp;c. make the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more obedient: all which are great <hi>testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Souls spirituality.</hi> 'Tis commonly set down by Authors, that <hi>tall</hi> and <hi>strong</hi> men are of <hi>small understanding</hi> and courage: that it is a <hi>sign of wit,</hi> to have a <hi>curiouc tast,</hi> and delicate stomack (which indeed proceeds sometimes from the weakness of that faculty by too much intentive study) and many such like: which it is in vain to repeat; since it is not difficult to shew that some of <hi>contrary dispositions</hi> have the <hi>same signs:</hi> and of <hi>contrary signs, v. g.</hi> to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, are yet ingenious. Seneca</hi> saith of <hi>Clara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ep. 66. <hi>Inique se gessit natura, &amp; talem ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum malè collocavit: aut fortasse voluit ho<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Yet thus much I willingly grant, that the <hi>passions</hi> discover themselves almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably by the <hi>countenance;</hi> because they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sudain and <hi>violent mutations</hi> in the Soul, cause the like also in the <hi>spirits;</hi> which shew themselves <hi>through the skin:</hi> or in the motions

These then <hi>promise virtue;</hi> modesty, obedience, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sableness, compassionateness, loving virtue in others, and consorting with such, cheerfulness, aptness to friendship, impatience till reconciled to any he offended, mildness, humility. Those who are apt to <hi>shed tears,</hi> are of a softer and lovinger disposition, as those who cry and shed no tears, prove commonly stubborn. Signs of <hi>nobleness and generosity</hi> are, to confess a fault ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then tell a ly, or frame a cobweb excuse; to be <hi>ashamed</hi> to be overcome in any laudable study or exercise; <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>angry</hi> when justly reproved, or corrected, <hi>(moneri posse, ac velle, summa virtus est;)</hi> to do <hi>more</hi> for <hi>honor</hi> then <hi>reward; not</hi> to be easily <hi>discouraged or</hi> despond, but to be more sprightly; to <hi>desire difficult</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiments; to <hi>pass by</hi> small offences; <hi>not</hi> to <hi>deride</hi> others defects; to be <hi>more ready</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse then aggravate faults of his Companions; lastly, to <hi>be grateful,</hi> especially to his Masters, Teachers, and Servants. Signs of a <hi>capacity for sciences,</hi> are, <hi>attention</hi> to what he goes about; <hi>demanding</hi> the reasons of things. [By the way, asking questions very much discovers the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny of a child: for to ask many is a sign of curiosity and wit; to ask vain and impertinent

ones, or the same over again, or not to stay for an answer, of folly and inconsiderateness; material and pertinent ones, of judgment and discretion.] <hi>WHY</hi> is the great question of <hi>knowledge; not</hi> to be <hi>satisfied</hi> with a slight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; <hi>sagacity,</hi> and much thinking; <hi>not talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> but reflecting wardly, meditating with, and entertaining himself. <hi>Primum argumentum compositae mentis, posse consistere, &amp; secum morari.</hi> Good <hi>imitation</hi> of what he sees.

               </p>
               <p>Now, of <hi>cures</hi> some are general. As 1. to make them <hi>know</hi> their infirmity, and that it is an infirmity; and 2. that they <hi>be willing</hi> to be cured. For it is not as in corporeal diseases, when the body is necessitated, by connexion of causes, to undergo and suffer the malady in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent. But here the Soul is <hi>in its own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> subject to it self only and its own will, and that directed by the understanding. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first step to a cure, is to <hi>convince</hi> by reason <hi>that they do ill, i. e.</hi> to acknowledge their disease: the desire to have it cured follows na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally. So that it is in the power of <hi>reason</hi> to rule absolutely over the affections and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Soul. But because <hi>reason</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is <hi>misled,</hi> or obstinately <hi>mistaken,</hi> Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God hath given us his holy <hi>Religion,</hi> and his <hi>spirit,</hi> to govern reason also, and render every
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56954:53"/>
                  <hi>thought</hi> obedient to <hi>Faith.</hi> So that in <hi>Religion</hi> lies the universal and never failing remedy of all the evils of the Soul. But many times parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and topical ones are also to be applied. A child, when he begins to go, refuseth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to be assisted; So when the will begins to follow its own choice, it then also begins to scorn a guide; the appetite of <hi>liberty</hi> being stronger then that of <hi>security.</hi> Great industry therefore and discretion is requisite to turn it the best way; endeavouring, as Physicians, to <hi>introduce the contrary</hi> of what is amiss, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply what is defective; to <hi>coerce</hi> and discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the bold and impertinent; to <hi>encourage</hi> the soft and modest: <hi>severe</hi> to the merry, <hi>cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to the melancholic. Waken the <hi>taciturn</hi> with questions, and silence the <hi>loquacious</hi> with baffling fallacies. Bridle the too <hi>forward</hi> and eager, and spur up the <hi>lazy</hi> and slothful.</p>
               <p n="11">11. SOME there are, who are <hi>lazy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>industrious to study,</hi> yet very active and <hi>sprightly in bodily exercises;</hi> these many times are fitter for other emploiments then learning. Others are to all purposes <hi>slow</hi> and <hi>sawntring,</hi> and these are to be cured with bodily labor. First make them <hi>play, run, leap,</hi> &amp;c. afterwards bring them to study. For there seems to be a moisture clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their spirit, which must be first shaken of; for if they be indulged they will become more sleepy, even till chang'd into <hi>dormice.</hi> Then <hi>never let them want work,</hi> yet not much at a time, but be careful that what you command them be sedulously performed. There are also who are <hi>pettish, peevish, hard to please,</hi> and are alwaies lean, maigre, and consumtive: which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56954:54"/>
proceeds from a sharp, thin humor, easily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated, and to such a degree as may be very prejudicial. It is best therefore to deal with those <hi>gently</hi> and <hi>smoothly</hi> (the default being more in the body then the mind) and not put them upon crabbed, intricate, vexatious, or intentive studies; nor be too <hi>rigorous</hi> in exacting an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. It would be worth labor to try whether such <hi>medicines,</hi> as dulcify the blood, would not profit them. Like to these are they, who seem <hi>rough, harsh, regardless of civility, and not easily mingling conversation.</hi> These, (if not such in extremity) when mellowed by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>prove better then the complaisant</hi> and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. Keep this sour disposition to study, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and knowledge; and tho he grumble and repine, be content so as he doth his work; and he is <hi>in less danger of temtation,</hi> becomes more solidly virtuous, and lasts much the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. As the wine, which pleaseth in the <hi>Cuve,</hi> must be drunk in the <hi>must.</hi> They are also <hi>fitter for friendship</hi> then the compliant; for these are equal to all, and the greatest interest can be gain'd in them is but <hi>civility;</hi> the other <hi>chuse</hi> their company, and <hi>fix</hi> upon the best. This <hi>sourness</hi> proceeds ordinarily from a brisker, and fiercer spirit, not willing to go in the ordinary <hi>routte,</hi> nor follow the track of those he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>values; but loves the <hi>generous tast of liberty.</hi> Whereas the <hi>soft wax,</hi> that melts with every ones fingers, <hi>keeps no impression.</hi> But if this <hi>harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be extream,</hi> and increase with age; consider whether it grow from <hi>pride,</hi> and then the root is to be digged up; or from <hi>natural inclination;</hi> and then let him frequent facetious and merry company, let him converse with <hi>Strangers,</hi> with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56954:54"/>
whom he must stand upon his guard. <hi>Womens</hi> acquaintance also, if discreet persons, is not ill for this disease. With the <hi>froward</hi> and <hi>perverse</hi> begin to use severity betimes, and master him before he know his own strength. Let him not be <hi>humored or gain by his sturdiness;</hi> but let him know by experience, that his tricks are not only <hi>undecent,</hi> but vain also and <hi>uneffectual.</hi> Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>God Almighty,</hi> who to the <hi>meek</hi> sheweth himself <hi>gentle,</hi> but to the <hi>perverse, froward:</hi> that he may humble the high looks and thoughts of the proud. For indeed this <hi>sullen humor,</hi> which against all reason will be guided only by its own opinions, and will brook no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, is the effect of the greatest <hi>pride;</hi> and is too frequently found in Persons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, when cockered by Parents, or flattered by Servants. When they are children <hi>rough usage</hi> is good for them, but afterwards it irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates them the more. Then if <hi>sober reasoning</hi> open not their eyes, they must be (as wild Trees) often transplanted and removed into strange company. For where unacquainted they dare not shew their humor; especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such as will not brook their impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but answer them with laughter, scorn, or somewhat more severe. Indeed generally all <hi>bad dispositions</hi> are reclaimed by conversation, and the example of other persons, especially such as are eminent in the virtue you would produce. <hi>Afflictions</hi> also have a wonderful force, which are discreetly to be menaged by the <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,</hi> for then the humors are ripe for purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>HITHERTO we have spoken of <hi>Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi> in order to the <hi>regulation of life and manners.</hi> In the next place we must treat of what concerns <hi>Knowledge and Science.</hi> And in order to this we must resume; that there are <hi>three faculties</hi> (of which we shall speak by and by more copiously) naturally implanted in us, <hi>Wit, Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Memory.</hi> Concerning which that you may the better understand my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will set down the most common and usual differences of <hi>capacities.</hi> And first take notice, that the goodness of <hi>Wit</hi> is seen in, first quick <hi>apprehending</hi> what is proposed: and 2ly ready, pertinent, and copious <hi>invention.</hi> A <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> then is counted excellent, when it <hi>quickly</hi> embraceth, and <hi>long</hi> retaineth, what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it. And that <hi>Judgment</hi> is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which subtilly <hi>compareth,</hi> and accurately <hi>discerns</hi> between things that are like. Next, that <hi>Wits</hi> some are <hi>ordinary,</hi> others <hi>extraordinary.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, such are:</p>
               <p n="1">1. IMAGINATIVE <hi>persons,</hi> who 1. either have their <hi>fancy so volatil and skipping</hi> from one thing to another, that they cannot fix long upon any one subject. Sometimes this proceeds from le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56954:55"/>
and impatience of the labor of thinking <hi>(non est enim minor lassitudo animi quam corporis, sed occultior;)</hi> sometimes from <hi>Melancholy.</hi> And such a degree there is of this, as is incurable but only by Medicine, that is frenzy and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Or 2ly who have <hi>great and ready variety of fancies or suggestions, but little of Judgment.</hi> Even as Cisterns, whereinto the water conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually flows, are never clear. These catch at, and sit down with, their fullest apprehensions, without weighing or considering the contrary; and are called <hi>Phantastical.</hi> The best way to <hi>cure</hi> both these, is to fix them, by setting them to <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> Geometry especially, where they are not suffered to tast a second dish, till they have perfectly digested the former; and by <hi>employing their memory. Disputations</hi> also in public are very profitable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. PRECOCIOUS <hi>persons,</hi> whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb hath branded to be of <hi>small duration.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps because these <hi>sine Tempers</hi> are usually less strong and durable, their spirits either exhaling and spending, or fixing and thickning. So that like corn upon stony ground, they spring up upon a suddain, shew all they can do, are in admiration for their forwardnes; but wanting root, they bring forth yellow, and emty eares before the Harvest, and so vanish. Thus <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes</hi> the Orator was heard with admiration at 12. years old, at 24. with laughter. Yet by the good leave of the <hi>Proverb,</hi> I have not seen many of <hi>precocious</hi> parts, except by their own or Educators fault, miscarry. For many times it happens that those persons, seeing their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the race above their companions,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56954:56"/>
slacken their speed, betaking themselves to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and idlenes; or as they say of <hi>Rablais,</hi> who not finding his good parts and serious studies encouraged according to his expectation, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned himself to <hi>buffoonery.</hi> These <hi>pregnant wits,</hi> being much courted for their <hi>plausible</hi> conversation, endanger their ruin from those, who pretend to woe their friendship. It would be better for them to consider, that they are not matched only with those who started at the same time with them, but with those also who had advantage; and that he is to be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not who doth <hi>as well as others,</hi> but <hi>as well as he can.</hi> But because of the prejudice most men have against <hi>precociousnes,</hi> it will not be amiss to shew some late examples of those who begun betimes, have proved admirable, and lasted a long while. The great <hi>Card. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> whilst at School, interpreted publicly <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Oration <hi>pro Milone;</hi> at 16. began to preach, and openly read the grounds of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Card. du Perron</hi> read over the <hi>Almagest</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> in 13. days before he was 18. years old. <hi>Torquato Tasso</hi> spoke plain at 6. months old; at 3. years went to School; at seven he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood Latin and Greek, and made Verses; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 12. he finished his Cours of Rhetoric, Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Logic, and Ethics; at 17. he received his degrees in Philosophy, Laws, and Divinity; and then printed his <hi>Rinaldo.</hi> And tho of prodigious natural parts, yet the writer of his life observes, that he writ (his Poëms especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) by the force of indefatigable study, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then vivacity of wit, or fruitfulnes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; which rendered them admirable, for he began there where others would have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Let no man therefore <hi>slacken his endeavor</hi> towards these early fruits, nor let the young man himself <hi>despond,</hi> but rather (which is a great truth) say, that God Almighty hath thus furnished him to be an <hi>ornament</hi> to his Creation, and an <hi>assistance</hi> to Mankind. Let the Educator also be more careful of him, and <hi>not leave him to himself,</hi> for there will come cold frosts and hails, loathings and tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of <hi>Labor,</hi> which, if not well defended, will hazard his dropping off.

               <p n="4">4. SOME persons (tho very few) have a strong <hi>indoles</hi> or inclination to, and abilities for, some particular science; <hi>strong,</hi> I say; for a slight fancy to one more then another is not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56954:58"/>
straightways (as they call it) <hi>a Genius</hi> to such a thing: for <hi>most men</hi> are not altogether indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to <hi>all sorts</hi> of learning, (tho <hi>Card. du Perron</hi> could never observe that he was more affected to, or more apt for, one Science then another) and yet may arrive to a great perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in that, whereto they are least disposed. But if his <hi>Genius</hi> lead him so strongly to any one Science, that he be unapt to others, it is by all means to be humored. <hi>Ne tentes</hi> (saith <hi>Quintil.) quod effici non potest; nec ab eo, quod quis optime facit, in aliud, cui minus est idoneus, eum transferas.</hi> It is reported of <hi>Ch. Clavius,</hi> that being found by the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> under whose edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation he was, very unapt for learning, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be sent back to his Parents, to be some other way emploied, before they would quite abandon him, one of them resolved to try him in Mathematics; wherein in a short time he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited to admiration, and grew very famous and eminent in those studies. Or if his <hi>Genius</hi> be accompanied with a noble and generous wit, let great endeavor be used to teach him <hi>other</hi> Sciences; and if that, he is inclined to, be not the noblest, to take him off from <hi>it</hi> also. <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino iniquum est nobiliora ingenia dehonestari studiis minoribus.</hi> Yet many times it is difficult to bring such off their inclination; as in <hi>Monsieur Pascal;</hi> out of the Preface to whose last book I will transcribe some passages very memorable both concerning the <hi>precociousnes</hi> of his wit, and strong <hi>inclination</hi> to Mathematics.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Monsieur Pascal</hi> was observed in his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to have had an admirable understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pierce into the profundity and depth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56954:59"/>
of things; and to discern solid reason from superficial words. In so much that when they offered him words only, his understanding was restles and unsetled, until he had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered reason. At 11. years old, at table, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing struck an earthen dish, and observed it to make a sound, which ceased as soon as touched with his hand, he was very earnest to know the cause thereof; and from that began to demand many other questions concerning sounds, in so much that he made then a small, but very ingenious, treatise concerning sounds. This his strange inclination to ratiocination, made his Father fear, that if he should give him any insight into Geometry and Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics, he would be so much taken with them, that he would neglect all other studies, especially Languages. He therefore resolved to hinder him, to lock up all Books of those Sciences, and not so much as to speak of them in his presence. But all this cautiousnes served only to excite his curiosity; so that he often intreated his Father to teach him Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, or at least to tell him what they were. His Father to satisfy him somewhat, in general said, they were Sciences which taught how to make figures equal or proportional one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and withal forbad him to speak to him, or think any more, of them. A command impossible for such a wit. For upon this hint he began to revolve them continually in his mind, especially at his times of recreation. Once especially being in a large Hall (where he used to divertise himself) he began to make figures with a coal on the pavement, as a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, a triangle of equal sides, or of equal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56954:59"/>
and the like, and this he did easily. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he began to search out and make propositions. But all Books and instruction being by his Fathers diligence concealed from him, he was forced to give names and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions after his own invention. A circle he called a round, a line a bar, &amp;c. After this he framed also to himself Axiomes, and upon them Demonstrations after his own manner, till he arrived to the 32. <hi>Prop.</hi> E. <hi>l.</hi> 1. His Father surprizing him in this posture, was mightily astonished when he heard him discourse, and as it were analize his propositions. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, by the advice of friends, he put into his hands <hi>Euclides Elements,</hi> which he read and comprehended at 12. years old, with as great pleasure and facility, as other Children do Romances: he read and understood it all by himself without any Master; and advanced so much in that knowledg, that a while after at <hi>Paris</hi> he entred into the Conferences of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, held once a week concerning Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical questions. Thither he brought his own inventions, examined others propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. and yet was all this knowledg only the product of his leasure hours. At 16. years old he composed a treatise of <hi>Conics,</hi> which <hi>Monsieur Descartes</hi> would not believe but to have bin the work of his Father, endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to procure reputation to his Son. At 19. years old he invented that Instrument of Arithmetic, which is in print; and at 23. hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seen the experiments of <hi>Torricelli,</hi> he also added to them a great number of his own.</q> This example of <hi>Monsieur Pascal</hi> is very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, as was that of <hi>Pet. Damianus</hi> to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56954:60"/>
who being a Boy and almost starved and naked, by the churlish and unnatural usage of his Brother, yet having found a piece of mony, not regarding his own necessities, he bestowed it upon a Priest to pray for his Fathers Soul. Most men are fit for many Sciences, and that inclination, which they have to one more then another, is ordinarily <hi>from their ability</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form one more then another: as memory is for some; wit for others; courage and bodily strength for others, &amp;c. or <hi>from their own imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or others recommendation,</hi> by word or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to one thing more then another; or <hi>from some external and accidental effect</hi> they have seen or known of any one, or some such like. But tho all men have not, or scarce any have, <hi>all faculties</hi> excellent in an equal degree; it will be the Teachers care and Educateds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to better that, wherein they are <hi>most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective;</hi> but so all waies, that you conduct them by that way they will go. Too much strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-wits, as forced grounds, badly correspond to our hopes. <hi>Unusquisque suum noscat,</hi> saith <hi>Tully, ad quas res aptissimi erimus, in iis potissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum elaborabimus. Seneca</hi> saith, that <hi>Virgil</hi> was as unfortunate in Prose, as <hi>Cicero</hi> in Verse. But I am rather perswaded that both the one and the other proceeded from want of practise. For <hi>Tasso</hi> was eminent in both: and <hi>Ovid</hi> was an acute and eloquent Declamator as well as a flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Poët. And <hi>Sen.</hi> l. 2. Cont. 3. stories of him, that being importuned by his Friends for liberty to expunge three verses out of his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, he yeilded upon condition he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept three, and named those they would have blotted out.</p>

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:56954:60"/>
5. BESIDES what I have already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there are in teaching Sciences, two great rules to be observed. 1. <hi>Begin not to teach a new science till your Scholar understand all that is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> to it; as not Rhetoric till he know Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, and the Latin Tongue, for so he will learn both more, and cheerfuller. Whereas the mind cannot to purpose intend many things at once. Tho such studies as have correspondence and affinity may well be conjoined; for the comparing illustrates both, and variety takes off the tediousnes. See <hi>Quint.</hi> l. 2. c. 12. Be not too hasty with your Scholar; <hi>advance</hi> him <hi>not too fast;</hi> lay the foundation sure and stable. For he that eats faster then he digests, breeds crudities, and work for the Physician to purge away. Besides he that understands, goes on cheerfully and securely. Which I take to be the reason, why <hi>Men of age make greater progress in learning, then Children. Jul. Scaliger</hi> began not to learn <hi>Greek</hi> till 40. years old, and then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered it in a very few months, as he did <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Gascon</hi> in three. <hi>Pet. Damianus</hi> learn'd not to read till mans estate, yet proved one of the eminentest Scholars of his time. <hi>Balaus</hi> entred so late upon the Law, that they told him he intended to be an Advocate in the other World. 2. <hi>Teach not too much at once,</hi> but take your Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in pieces, let him spell before he read; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in English before in Latin, confusedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in order; then <hi>chuse</hi> the best, put it in <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, turn</hi> it into Latin, and then <hi>file</hi> and polish it. It is reported of <hi>Virgil,</hi> that he first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed his matter in Prose, then turn'd it into Verse, afterwards reformed those Verses to fewer; and last of all revised and amended
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56954:61"/>
them. To these rules I must add, that <hi>he be taught things necessary</hi> or <hi>useful.</hi> Such are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. LANGUAGES. The <hi>Bulla Aurea,</hi> tit. 26. commands all the Sons of Electors to be brought up from 7. years old, in the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Slavonian</hi> Languages, and to perfect that study before 14. That is prescribed to the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nobility; but for ours it seems requisite, that they learn the <hi>Latin Tongue,</hi> so much as to understand an Author readily, to write and speak it competently; and if they go abroad, the more readily they speak it, the better. Other of the <hi>learned</hi> Languages are ornaments, but not so necessary as the <hi>Modern:</hi> and of these, theirs, with whom we have most converse, are the most useful.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IT is requisite that he learn to <hi>speak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuously, decently,</hi> and <hi>persuasively,</hi> which is <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric.</hi> To understand the difference of <hi>stiles</hi> Epistolary, Historical, and for Orations in all the three kinds. Also to <hi>compose</hi> and <hi>pronounce</hi> them hansomly, at least in his own Language. It is better also, if he understand and practise (tho not much, except he have a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dexterity in it) <hi>Poetry;</hi> without which no man can be perfect Orator, but his fancy as well as expressions will be low and mean. <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> warms the imagination, makes it active, and promt to soar to the top of <hi>Parnassus;</hi> it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldens to the use of a lofty <hi>Metaphor,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident <hi>Catachresis.</hi> Besides accustoming the <hi>stile to measure</hi> gives insight, judgment, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes also in Oratorical number. It teacheth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to chuse good words, to consider, weigh,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56954:61"/>
and pierce better into what we read, to take notice of the most delicate artifice, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern sparks of diamonds. So that it is observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that when <hi>Poetry</hi> is despised, other Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces also are in the wane. One great piece of <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and perhaps the most familiar and proper, is the <hi>Dramatic,</hi> in which could they be of good subjects, well garbled, and discreetly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it would not misbecome our young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to have his part.</p>
               <p n="3">3. MUSICK I think not worth a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans labor, requiring much industry and time to learn, and little to loose, it. It is used chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to please others, who may receive the same <hi>gusto</hi> from a mercenary (to the perfection of many of whom few Gentlemen arrive) at a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easy rate. I should rather advise <hi>Singing,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if you fear him subject to a <hi>consumtion;</hi> which, besides that it strengthens the lungs, modulates the voice, gives a great grace to elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and needs no instrument to remove or tune.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To <hi>discourse pertinently and rationally</hi> is also necessary. This is <hi>Logic;</hi> which tho taught in every Colledg, and every one learneth, yet do very few attain perfection in it. <hi>Error</hi> is so well disguised, <hi>Verity</hi> is also sometimes so deep, and our cord so shallow, that it requireth very much experience, to be able readily to discover the truth, and dissolve a sophism. These know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges already mentioned are but <hi>foundations,</hi> upon which all Sciences are <hi>built,</hi> but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves appear not in the <hi>edifice.</hi> For they are nothing but regulating and <hi>perfecting the actions</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:56954:62"/>
                  <hi>of our natural faculties;</hi> not <hi>informing</hi> them with any new or extrinsecal accedent; they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing and preparing the <hi>table,</hi> that good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances may be <hi>drawn</hi> upon it. They are necessary that a man may make the best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his natural parts in apprehending of other <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Knowledges.</hi> Some indeed have bin of opinion, that a <hi>Gentleman</hi> needs no more, but what nature hath given him. <hi>Licinius,</hi> and a great <hi>General</hi> in our own times, were so illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, that they could scarce write their own names. <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. desired his Son might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand no more Latin then, <hi>Qui nescit dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare, nescit regnare.</hi> And what harm had it bin, if he had permitted his Son (Charles VIII.) to have learned somewhat of <hi>Latin?</hi> He could at the worst but have done as he did, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his busines to others, and not be able to discern good counsel from evil, and interessed. But it seems that Prince had but one trick in <hi>King-craft,</hi> and that a very mean one; more Latin might have taught him others, and not to have needed that, so base and unworthy of a Prince. As it did those great <hi>Monarcks,</hi> who were practised in them, <hi>Julius, Augustus,</hi> and the rest of that family; (whereof <hi>Nero,</hi> to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor, was the first that stood in need of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed eloquence, <hi>Seneca</hi> making his speeches for him;) <hi>Trajan, Hadrian, M.

Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> writ the lives of two famous Generals: and <hi>Alexander</hi> slept with <hi>Homer</hi> under his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. I will not muster up any more exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; they are infinite. Learning, i. e. <hi>Sciences</hi> are not <hi>necessary</hi> to every man; nor all to any man; yet are they <hi>useful</hi> to all, tho not to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56954:62"/>
all equally. But that is best, which is most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial and proper for every ones condition of life. <hi>Learning and study makes</hi> a young man thinking, attentive, industrious, confident, and wary; an old man cheerful, and resolved. 'Tis an ornament in <hi>prosperity,</hi> a refuge in <hi>adversity;</hi> an entertainment at <hi>home,</hi> a companion <hi>abroad:</hi> it cheers in solitude and <hi>prison;</hi> it moderates in the height of <hi>fortune,</hi> and upon the throne. In <hi>these parts of the World</hi> we seem to run after <hi>Sciences,</hi> and think them to be all things; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the great and <hi>universal busines</hi> of our life, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially active, is wisdom, prudence, noblenes, and liberty of spirit. <hi>Sciences</hi> are necessary to mans life, and Professors of them are requisite to instruct such, whom it concerns to know and exercise them; in other persons <hi>wisdom</hi> is the chiefest, and what can be spared from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring that, let it be bestowed upon <hi>Science.</hi> By the way, take notice, that these are not both the same, that to <hi>be learned</hi> is <hi>not to be wise;</hi> nor are <hi>Sciences</hi> to be placed in the upper room, notwithstanding the honor and wealth to be acquired by them. They are particular means for the obtaining particular ends; and dispose a man very much for wisdom also: but the great universal <hi>Art</hi> is, <hi>Tu regere imperio populos, &amp;c.</hi> to excel others in virtue, prudence, and those abilities which render him more useful in the general concernments of Mankind. Besides <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> are easily learned being taught by routte and course; but <hi>wisdom</hi> requires greater <hi>advertency,</hi> and more <hi>accurate observation;</hi> which all are not able to <hi>learn,</hi> and very few to <hi>teach.</hi> But, if a young man be industrious and of good parts, there is time enough for both <hi>Sciences</hi> and <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:56954:63"/>
Those are more properly the emploiments of youth, this of maturer age. He may obtain those before he be well capable of this, I mean a sufficient perfection in them; not so much as is required for a <hi>Professor,</hi> but so much, as is necessary or requisite for <hi>a Gentleman.</hi> Nor will the acquisition of them hinder his progress in this, but much further, and advance, it. Both because of the well-disposing of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of the affinity between both knowledges. Amongst <hi>Sciences</hi> therefore I recommend to him,</p>
               <p n="5">5. THE <hi>practise of discoursing,</hi> or the seeking after truth by Evidence, which is <hi>Mathematics, Geometry</hi> especially. I mean not a superficial taking upon trust the <hi>Propositions,</hi> or the <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> part only, or <hi>Instruments;</hi> these spoil, make not, <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> but the <hi>high road of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</hi> This is the first part of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that appears above ground; it is practising them in the greatest Instances of invention that we know; it fixeth the fancy, it accustometh to thinking, and enquiring after truth in all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses. <hi>Analytica</hi> is the gage of a mans parts, and <hi>Algebra</hi> the pinnacle of argumentation. Only let it be remembred, that I advise it here as a <hi>piece of Education,</hi> not a profession. I would not have a Gentleman give up himself to it; for it makes him less fit for active life, and common conversation; <hi>except</hi> he well consider that he cannot find his Demonstration in all matters; <hi>except</hi> he can be content with such evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as the subject affords; and not despise a proof, because he can say somewhat against it: and <hi>except</hi> he can apply his mind and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to things as they are in the World; and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56954:63"/>
not rack them to the accurate model of his exactly regulated Imagination.</p>
               <p n="6">6. NATURAL <hi>Philosophy,</hi> but especially <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thics,</hi> and <hi>Politics,</hi> should also not be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which will dispose him, when he comes to greater maturity, to comprehend the <hi>Laws,</hi> especially of his own, and neighboring Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and their Government. Of which I shall speak hereafter.</p>
               <p n="7">7. YET one thing we lack. <hi>Albertus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> desired of God 5. years before his death, that he might forget all that he had learned in those studies, that he might intirely give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up to <hi>devotion.</hi> The example also of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Pascal</hi> is very eminent. <q>Tho he was able, as any man could be, to pierce into the secrets of nature, and actually did see very far into them; yet more then ten years before his death, he so well understood the vanity and nothingnes of all those kinds of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and conceived such a distast against them; that he could hardly endure men of parts should seriously discourse of, or busy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in them: from that time he alwaies professed, that nothing besides <hi>Religion</hi> was an object worthy an ingenious mans study; that it was a proof of the lownes, whereto we were thrown by the fall, that a man should seriously fasten upon the search of such things, as contribute little or nothing to his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Wherefore his usual saying was, that all those Sciences produced no consolation in the times of affliction; but that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of <hi>Christianity</hi> was a comfort both in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56954:64"/>
and defect of all other knowledg. He believed therefore, tho there were some advantage or customary obligation to study things of nature, and to be able to conceive and discourse rationally concerning them; yet it was absolutely necessary not to prize them above their just value. And that if it were better to know and undervalue, then be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, them; yet it were better to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, then know and overvalue, them.</q> The gentle spirit of <hi>Petrarch</hi> also long before his death quitted his <hi>Helicon</hi> and <hi>Muses</hi> for mount <hi>Olivet</hi> and <hi>Divinity. Card. du Perron</hi> kept not so much as any book of humanity (tho for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a great Poet and Orator) either Poetry, Oratory, or History in his Library. <hi>Jo. Picus Mirandula</hi> extreamly repented his love verses; so did <hi>Bembus, Ronsard, Marc-Ant. Muretus, Laur. Gacubaro,</hi> and <hi>Cavalier Marini.</hi> And <hi>Naugerius</hi> tho formerly a famous Poet, yet afterwards so much detested all licentious compositions, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Martial;</hi> that every year he bought up a considerable number of such books, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his birth-day solemnly burnt them. <hi>Nonnus in penance</hi> for his <hi>Dionysiaca</hi> paraphras'd the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of St. <hi>John. Pet. Veliardus</hi> not being able to abolish the custome of reading the Poets, &amp;c. <hi>Omnes Poetas, scriptoresque profanos Evangelicos fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciebat. Omnia ad exaedificandam in timore domini juventutem accommodabat, ut unde non pauci perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem periculumque suis discipulis ferunt, inde illi in salutem &amp; morum disciplinam compararet. Orlan. in vita P. Fabri.</hi> These, you will say, did well to begin to disengage themselves of their riding posture, when they came in sight of their home: but that it will be difficult to perswade young
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56954:64"/>
men coming into the World to follow these examples. This I grant, yet some time should be given to him that gives us all, <hi>even in youth;</hi> and the more the better; and as before I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised to the <hi>practise of Religion</hi> in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, so, as they grow towards maturity, I would perswade them to the <hi>study of Divinity,</hi> even that <hi>decried study of School-Divinity.</hi> Which the great Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and many other very wise Persons and States-men have themselves studied, and to others recommended. <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia Scholastica principi viro necessaria; nam, dum quaestiones suas discutiunt, omnes subtilitates, effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, suspiciones, omnes denique ingenii machinas &amp; vires produnt, &amp;c.</hi> The Writers of this do more exactly canvas, and search out, their subject then any others whatsoever. Which partly might be the reason why <hi>Monsieur Pascal</hi> fell into such an utter dislike and loathing of his Physical and Mathematical studies in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of Divinity. For tho he afterwards made that discourse of the <hi>Roulet</hi> or <hi>Cycloid,</hi> yet all therein was found out by chance, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most without study; and besides he intended it for another purpose far differing from Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics. But if ever this study was <hi>necessary,</hi> it is now much more certainly, when some are ready by the study of Nature to immerse God in the matter; and with those impieties of <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus</hi> to confound him with Nature: and others for want of this ballast in these unsettled times, are driven upon rocks and sands by the ignorance of some, and craft of others, that lye in wait to deceive the <hi>better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,</hi> but <hi>less-learned</hi> then themselves.</p>

6. AND the <hi>best place</hi> and <hi>manner of learning</hi> these, and all other Arts and Sciences, or what belongeth to them, I take to be in <hi>the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.</hi> And so hath bin the general opinion from the very beginning of learning. These were the <hi>Schools of the Prophets</hi> in Gods Church; and such were <hi>Athens, Alexandria,</hi> and many other places, among them that followed their own reason. For these were the great <hi>Markets for Learning; here</hi> resided the best learned, and greatest frequency of them; <hi>here</hi> was emulation and mutual information in studies; <hi>here</hi> were opportunities of discoursing, studying, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual advance; <hi>here</hi> were Books, privacy, and all other necessaries for that purpose. And still to this day in all Christendom is this observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; every Nation, whether Kingdom, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, makes the establishing and well regulating their <hi>Universities,</hi> one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal parts of their care. For from hence they draw <hi>able subjects</hi> for all Professions and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiments; here they institute, both in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and manners, the whole Youth of the Nation, and the hopes and honor of the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing age. And therefore do the Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, by such great rewards, and immunities, encourage and procure the best <hi>Professors and Teachers</hi> in every Art and Faculty. And such rewards are needful to entice persons of great parts (as such must be), to such indefatigable and uncessant labor and study, and to quit all the means of advancing themselves in the Common-wealth to serve the Public. In these places you may find skilful men in all Knowledges you desire: <hi>some</hi> give their mind and time to <hi>Languages, others</hi> to <hi>Sciences;</hi> either to have a right and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56954:65"/>
large knowledg, or comprehension of things, whether the effects of Nature or manner of her operations, or of the sublimer and abstruser ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral propositions concerning the higher and noble entities, and such as are not obliged to the Laws of Nature: <hi>others</hi> to be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press their knowledg and notions, whether <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</hi> by orations and speeches, wherein they are frequently exercised, or <hi>convincingly</hi> to learned Men, by their continual <hi>Disputations,</hi> to which they are educated. I mean not that arguing and discoursing, which a Student useth with his own self to find out truth, but that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth both, and the assistance also of others, <hi>public and open Argumentation pro &amp; con. This is it</hi> which brings a question to a <hi>point,</hi> and discovers the very <hi>center</hi> and knot of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. <hi>This</hi> warms and <hi>activates</hi> the spirit in the search of truth, <hi>excites</hi> notions, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying and frequent beating upon it, <hi>cleanseth</hi> it from the ashes, and makes it shine and flame out the clearer. Besides it puts them upon a continual <hi>stretch</hi> of their wits to defend their cause, it makes them <hi>quick</hi> in replies, <hi>intentive</hi> upon their subject: where the <hi>Opponent</hi> useth all means to drive his Adversary from his hold; and the <hi>Answerer</hi> defends himself <hi>sometimes</hi> with the force of truth; <hi>sometimes</hi> with the subtility of his wit; and <hi>sometimes</hi> also he escapes in a mist of words, and the doubles of a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whilst he seeks all holes and recesses to shelter his persecuted opinion and reputation. This properly belongeth to the <hi>Disputations,</hi> which are exercises of young Students, who are by these velitations and in this palaestra, brought up to a more serious search of truth.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56954:66"/>
And in them I think it not a fault to <hi>dispute for victory,</hi> and to endeavor to save their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not that their questions and subjects are concerning things of small moment, and little reality: yea I have known some Governors that have absolutely forbidden such questions, where the truth was of concernment; on purpose that the youth might have the liberty of exerting their parts to the uttermost, and that their might be no stint to their emulation. But indeed in <hi>natural Philosophy</hi> (wherein the greatest liberty is given) what is there that is not disputable? and even they, who most pretend to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will find it difficult to produce one <hi>new,</hi> or confute an <hi>old,</hi> universal proposition; and when they shall discover one, they will find it disputed both with contrary reasons and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments. So true is that of <hi>Salomon,</hi> Eccles. 3. <hi>Tradidit mundum disputationi eorum, ut non inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat homo opus quod operatus est Deus ab initio us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ad finem.</hi> And of Siracides, Ecclus. 18. <hi>Non est minuere neque ad<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>icere, nec invenire magnalia Dei. Cum consummaverit homo tunc incipiet, &amp; cum quieverit aporiabitur.</hi> There may be further discoveries, as perhaps was the circulation of the blood, and some others; and with all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes we acknowledg, and embrace their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors that endeavor such advancement, but to lay <hi>new principles,</hi> especially since the received are incorporated into all common speech, and our Languages are formed according to them; and consequently all mens notions set accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, which will not be altered and extirpated by small fancies, is a busines of an higher difficulty. Besides that <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself, whom all <hi>Universities,</hi> Christian, have followed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56954:66"/>
about 400. years (longer then any other of his maligners have continued theirs) but the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> much longer time, was not a Novice in <hi>Natural History;</hi> witnes those most learned works in that subject. Yet did he write his Philosophy conformable, not contradictory, to his knowledg in particulars; and therefore it must needs be very difficult to overthrow that <hi>which</hi> is so well grounded, <hi>which</hi> was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of so much experience; and by none but those who are better versed in that learning then himself. Neither is his <hi>Philosophy</hi> more <hi>notional</hi> then all Sciences, which are delivered in a <hi>Synthetical, i. e.</hi> a doctrinal method, and begin with <hi>universal</hi> propositions. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg indeed one point of <hi>Education,</hi> wherein I wish our Universities more defective then they are, <hi>i. e.</hi> that which the Ladies call <hi>breeding</hi> and <hi>accomplishment;</hi> a fault incident to all these Schools of Learning, even to <hi>Athens</hi> it self; for <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, that long before his time some persons wondred, why those, that went <hi>fine Gentlemen</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> and very knowing, after a year or two's stay there began to <hi>know nothing;</hi> and the longer they staied the <hi>greater clowns</hi> they proved. A <hi>negligence</hi> incident to those, who have their minds more emploied then their bodies; and who converse not with the gallantry of the age.</p>
               <p n="7">7. THAT you may judge the better of <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,</hi> I will set down the manner of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting in forreign <hi>Universities,</hi> or also our own in former times; without reflecting upon, or judging our present practise. Anciently in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> (the two only general Studies
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56954:67"/>
for a long time on this side the Alps) I suppose in the others too, their <hi>reading</hi> was <hi>dictating,</hi> and their <hi>learning writing</hi> those dictates of their Master. <hi>Card. d' Estouteville</hi> about 1476. reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this tedious and unprofitable way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and brought in (as it should seem) the manner now generally used; which is, <hi>first</hi> an account of the former Lectures; <hi>then</hi> to read and write about half an hour; <hi>then</hi> to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that about an equal time. Experience since hath added an hour more for the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars <hi>conferring</hi> one with another in circles, in presence of their Reader, and <hi>disputing</hi> upon questions given them the reading before. The hour that remains, the Master begins another Lecture, explains it to them, and gives them questions for their next disputations. Yet the <hi>Jesuits</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> to ease their Scholars also of much of the labor of writing dictates, have printed a <hi>Course of Philosophy,</hi> which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, confer, and dispute upon. And this seems the best way: but whether introduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amongst us; or if it be, whether better then Tutors reading privately in their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, especially if Tutors be diligent, it is not fitting for me to determine.</p>
               <p n="8">8. THE true <hi>method of studying</hi> to render any one a learned man, I conceive <hi>not</hi> to be, <hi>to trust to his memory; Aliud enim est meminisse aliud scire: meminisse est rem commissam memoriae custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire; at scire est &amp; sua quaeque facere, nec ab alio exemplari pendere.</hi> And these differ as much as <hi>digesting</hi> our meat, and <hi>reserving</hi> it in a cupboard. Wherefore <hi>neither</hi> is it <hi>to be able to quote many Authors, nor</hi> tell their opinions, <hi>nor</hi> to repeat
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56954:67"/>
their pretty sentences or profound subtilties: as <hi>neither to read many Books,</hi> nor to say them by heart, is to be a <hi>Scholar:</hi> but to <hi>digest</hi> what is read, and to be able to know where a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty lies, and how to solve it, <hi>i. e.</hi> to make it your own, and to be able to satisfy your self and others in that which you conceive to be truth. <hi>First</hi> of all then, <hi>propose</hi> to your self a subject; never read at adventure the book new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come out, or in fashion, whatever subject it handles, for that is commonly lost labor: but <hi>read</hi> alwaies <hi>with design:</hi> then shall you know where you are, how far you have gone, what is behind both of that Science, or of the whole <hi>Encyclopaedia.</hi> Having fixt upon your subject, <hi>take an Author,</hi> a modern one, and the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eder the better: and <hi>consider first the latitude and method of your Science;</hi> and then <hi>begin with his first question;</hi> upon which first use your own thoughts; or at least yours together with his, <hi>i. e.</hi> let your imagination loose, both before and when you read; discourse, doubt, argue upon and against; and draw consequences from your <hi>Author;</hi> who is many times but a ladder to your own inquisitivenes. When you have <hi>found a difficulty,</hi> which neither your own thoughts, nor his writing, do resolve, make use of other Authors of the same subject; for what one <hi>wants</hi> another <hi>supplies;</hi> your difficulty perhaps your Author foresaw not, another did. And by the citations of modern Authors you will easily be directed where to look for satisfaction. When that question and the difficulties and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions are fixed in your mind by sufficient <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,</hi> go to another, and so forward.</p>

               <p>IT is not my purpose to intermeddle with any particular <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Science</hi> in this discourse; but only with such things, as do not properly fall under, or belong to, any of them, yet are generally required to them all. And first I must reassume, what before I only mentioned, that there are three <hi>faculties</hi> to be cultivated, <hi>Wit, Memory,</hi> and <hi>Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. WIT, the actions whereof are <hi>fancy,</hi> or <hi>invention,</hi> is in ordinary acception, <hi>nothing else but a quicker apprehension of such notions, as do not usually enter into other mens imaginations.</hi> It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists (saith <hi>Thesauro)</hi> in 1. <hi>perspicacity,</hi> which is the consideration of all, even the minutest, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances: and 2. <hi>versability,</hi> or speedy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them together; it conjoins, divides, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth, augmenteth, diminisheth, and in sum puts one thing instead of another, with like dexterity, as a jugler doth his balls. It differs very much from <hi>judgment; that</hi> is more perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, <hi>this more</hi> profound; <hi>that more</hi> quick, <hi>this more</hi> stable; <hi>that</hi> chiefly considers appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, <hi>this</hi> reality; that produceth admiration and popular applause, <hi>this</hi> profit and real ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. <hi>Ingenious men</hi> are commonly impatient
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56954:68"/>
of thinking, and therefore take appearances for reality; and their fancy still suggesting new conceits, suffers them not to weigh or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare reasons: wherefore they are commonly unfit for busines; their ability consisting in sudain apprehensions, and quick expressions; whereas 'tis only study, and thinking, that hatcheth and produceth all noble designs and actions. And if <hi>ingenious</hi> men do come to <hi>consider</hi> seriously, or to deliberate, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to say so much for either side, that they have no <hi>resolution;</hi> they <hi>dispute well,</hi> but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing.</hi> Consequently they are irresolute, inconstant, and unfortunate: and their <hi>wit</hi> fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before they arrive at old age, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furnished in their memory and judgment, they become flat and contemtible. But if <hi>wit</hi> be <hi>joined with power,</hi> it is very dangerous to the public. <hi>Sapientia sine eloquentia parum prodest civitatibus; eloquentia sine sapientia nimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um plerunque obest, prodest nunquam.</hi> saith <hi>Cie.</hi> l. 1. <hi>de Invent.</hi> I think I may truly add, that all mischiefs in Common-wealths proceed from these <hi>Wits;</hi> for wise men <hi>will not</hi> disturb go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and fools <hi>cannot.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious</hi> man is fitted for any emploiment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders what dangers and evils may happen, and avoids them; consequently is prosperous, brings about his designs, advanceth himself and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And the longer he lives, the more doth his Talent increase. In sum, <hi>the one</hi> is best in a Tavern or Coffy-house, <hi>the other</hi> at a Councel-table: <hi>the one</hi> is a facetious compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>the other</hi> a faithful friend; <hi>the one</hi> a good droll, <hi>the other</hi> a good Patriot; <hi>the one</hi> makes us merry, <hi>the other</hi> wise. <hi>Wit,</hi> say some, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56954:69"/>
from active spirits, or a greater degree of heat in the brain; the excess whereof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth <hi>madnes;</hi> and so difficult it is to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what degree serves for one, and what for the other, that the Proverb assigns them the same confines. And indeed the conceits of <hi>Mad-men</hi> are nothing else but high and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant <hi>Metaphors:</hi> as that of one who fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied himself a fire-brand, and desired every one he met to blow him.

A <hi>judicious man</hi> is stable, solid, serious, looks after truth, real advantage, and happines; is fit to govern and obey: is not rash or inconstant; believes not easily; nor easily disbelieves, but as his reason guides him. His discourse is not so <hi>plausible</hi> as <hi>solid;</hi> useth <hi>reasons</hi> more then <hi>Metaphors;</hi> speaks to purpose, and knows when to hold his peace. He is what every one strives, but few arrive, to be. This faculty is proper for all Sciences that depend upon <hi>rational discourse,</hi> and much thinking, as Divinity and the profound myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereof; Natural Philosophy, and Moral; Practical Medicine, Law, Judicature, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Peace and War.</p>
               <p n="3">3. MEMORY <hi>is the calling to mind or recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of what hath bin before known and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</hi> They that excel in it are accounted many times <hi>greater Clerks</hi> then <hi>wise men;</hi> are able to <hi>cite</hi> many Books, and Authors, and their Editions; can <hi>tell</hi> their opinions; and <hi>enterlace</hi> their discourse with ends of gold and silver. Yet, if not menaged by <hi>judgment,</hi> their opinion or learning is of little force or esteem amongst knowing men; who yet can gather many useful things out of their confusion. This faculty is necessary for <hi>Lawyers,</hi> whose learning lies in quotations, and records; and who <hi>number,</hi> rather then <hi>weigh,</hi> their <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> 'Tis also proper for learning Languages, Criticismes, Philology, Antiquities; for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out, commenting upon, and making In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dexes to, Authors. It is a natural faculty, and conspicuous even in Children, who by it learn

               <p n="4">4. IT is commonly imagined, that a <hi>great memory</hi> seldom accompanieth a <hi>great wit,</hi> or a <hi>good judgment;</hi> and that these three are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible one with another; that they have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers habitations in, and a divers temperature of, the brain. Whereas I think the contrary is generally, but not alwaies, true. And thence is gathered an effectual argument, that they are all menaged by one great <hi>Agent, the Soul or spirit;</hi> which is above temperature, place, and matter. That one man proves not excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in all or many Sciences, proceeds not from the inhability of one or other faculty of the Soul; but either <hi>from</hi> the long time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to one study; <hi>from</hi> want of industry, every one being most ready to make use of, and cultivate, that, wherein they have some natural advantage, and to neglect the other; or <hi>from</hi> the two great attachment Men have to what they first master, so that all follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing studies are cast into the mold of the first; or lastly <hi>from</hi> a mistake, for that memory is not so conspicuous, except where wit and judgment are wanting. Yet in these later times what persons have we seen eminent in all three faculties? <hi>Erasmus,</hi> when a youth, had all <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> by heart; <hi>Jos. Scaliger</hi> in 21. daies got by heart all <hi>Homer</hi> (the <hi>Ilias</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 31670 verses, and the <hi>Odysses</hi> about the same number) and in 4. months all the other Greek Poets. <hi>Monsieur Peiresk,</hi> when a youth at School, could repeat all <hi>Ovids Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis,</hi> and <hi>Justins</hi> History without book.

                  <hi>Card.

P. Paolo Sarpi</hi>'s great me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, as well as wit and judgment, even from a child, read in his life. What a man <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Pascal</hi> was in divers Sciences, his other works; what in Divinity, the Provincials Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, demonstrate. I will omit <hi>Julius Scaliger, Joh. Picus, Paulus Scalichius, Adr. Turnebus, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saubon. Card. Perron</hi> in four daies got by heart all Ecclesiastes in Hebrew, and besides his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vast abilities, was also an excellent Poet. Mr <hi>Oughtred</hi> in his old age had <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> fresh in his memory. <hi>Fr. Suarez</hi> had S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi> works so by heart, that he could repeat, not only the sense, but for the most part his very words; and if he was asked of any thing in his own works (22. Volums in fol.) he could tell the place and very page where he treated of it. But this himself called not <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> but <hi>reminiscence;</hi> for it was indeed as much <hi>judgment</hi> as <hi>memory:</hi> for he was so well versed in that learning, and so perfectly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of it (having read the whole Course of School-Divinity, as I remember, 17. times over) that if he were asked of any point, or conclusion, he would discourse of it just in the same manner, and order, as he had writ it in his Books. I could produce many more instances. But in reason, the goodnes of the <hi>judgment</hi> must depend upon <hi>invention</hi> and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;</hi> that being the faculty which gives sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence according to the reports of the other two. Yet few there are in whom these facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are, as I may say, mingled <hi>ana.</hi> It is best
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56954:71"/>
therefore that all be cultivated and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as high as they are capable to be: and what is most defective is most to be helped. And Children having <hi>memory</hi> by nature, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi> not till youth, nor <hi>judgment</hi> till matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, their <hi>memory</hi> is first to be menaged: only with this caution, that they be made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what they learn, and the reason of it, as soon as they shall be capable.</p>

OF the bettering of <hi>Judgment</hi> we shall speak in another place; but <hi>for Memory,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we remember better those things, 1. <hi>which we</hi> learn from our childhood; 2. <hi>which we</hi> are more attentive to; 3. <hi>which we</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise our selves most in; 4. <hi>which we</hi> orderly apprehend; 5. <hi>which we</hi> can call to mind from the beginning; 6. <hi>which we</hi> conceive to be somewhat like; 7. and <hi>which is</hi> pleasing to us; and because childhood and youth have their <hi>memory</hi> (tho not so excellent as men, yet) more useful then their <hi>understanding;</hi> therefore what ever they learn, <hi>let it be got by heart;</hi> that they may repose and store up in their <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> what their understanding afterwards may make use of: let them also <hi>frequently render it,</hi> and after several interstitiums; which will be a great help to their <hi>memory,</hi> to the perfecting of which nothing conduceth so much as <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</hi> Yet there is also an <hi>Artificial</hi> help to <hi>memory,</hi> which is variously and obscurely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by many Authors; the shortest and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest is this. Make use of a sufficient number of places best known to you; as of Towns in the way to <hi>London,</hi> the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> or the Signs in one Street, such in fine as are well
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56954:72"/>
known to you. Keep their order perfectly in mind, which first, which second, &amp;c. and when any word is given you to remember, <hi>place</hi> it in the first Town, Street, or Sign; <hi>joining</hi> them together with some fancy, tho never so extravagant, the calling to mind your known place will draw along with it the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that the word joined to it. And these you may <hi>repeat</hi> afterwards either in the <hi>same order</hi> as they were delivered, or <hi>backwards,</hi> or as you please. This serves very well for <hi>words,</hi> and indifferently for <hi>verses</hi> after much practise; but it requires a long time by this art to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Sentences.</hi> A <hi>succedaneum</hi> to memory is <hi>writing;</hi> and Students are wont to serve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of <hi>Common-place-Books,</hi> excellent helps to ordinary memories. The best way that I know of ordering them, is; To <hi>write down confusedly</hi> what in reading you think observable. [Young Students commonly take notice of remarkable Histories, Fables, Apologues, (such as are not in <hi>Esop)</hi> Adagies, if not in <hi>Erasmus,</hi> or <hi>Manutius.</hi> Hieroglyphics, Emblems, Symbols; (which are all but simile's drest after divers fashions) Histories of heathen Gods, Laws and customes of Nations. Wise and useful Sentences.

Afterwards at your leasure set down in the margin the page of your Index, where the head is, to which such Sentence relates: and so enter into the Index under such a head the page of your Note-book, wherein such sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is stored. These Note-books, if many,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56954:72"/>
are to be distinguished by A, B, C, &amp;c. your Index must be well furnished with heads; yet not too much multiplied, least they cause con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. Your own experience will continually be supplying what is defective.</p>

And it were a good exercise amongst a circle of Scholars, to propose a <hi>Symbol</hi> (the easiest first) and every one to answer in his turn; <hi>v. g.</hi> let every one give his Symbol of <hi>fortitude,</hi> and a motto or word for it such as, <hi>a Pillar,</hi> which sustaineth the greatest weight laid upright upon it, the motto <hi>Rectum stabile; a Palm tree</hi> that grows up against a pressure, <hi>Tu ne cede malis, sed contra audentior ito;</hi> to <hi>a Die, homo quadratus; An oaken-bough</hi> struck with lightning, <hi>impavidum ferient:</hi> A <hi>Rock,</hi> an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> an <hi>helmet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Fables</hi> are taken (as <hi>Symbols</hi> from things natural) from things animate, as an Eagle, Cock, &amp;c. clothing them with speech and action; such betwixt Men, are <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables.</hi> So there are mixtures of all these, as, <hi>Easter said to the Griggs, tarde venerunt.</hi> There are also <hi>compound</hi> subjects, which they call <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems,</hi> of which <hi>Alciat, Sambucus,</hi> and many others have made Volums.

Give him the same subject with an Author unknown to him; and then compare his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, fancies, reasons, metaphors, &amp;c. with the Authors. Let him also vary discourses, as an <hi>History</hi> into a <hi>Dialogue,</hi> or <hi>Epistle;</hi> which take their Arguments from all occasions; as <hi>Antenor</hi> to <hi>Priamus,</hi> to send back <hi>Helena.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56954:74"/>
For that experience testifies; <hi>That those,</hi> who have passed the course of their studies, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver understood or practised this Art, have yet had very good Inventions; <hi>that those</hi> who use their fancies, do not at all serve themselves of these common-places, nor beg at every door for Arguments and Metaphors; <hi>that</hi> the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter suggested by these places is only general, or an heap of universal notions, which is rather a disadvantage then an help. Thus <hi>l' Art de penser.</hi> But on the contrary, it must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, <hi>that</hi> all the Ancients, <hi>Aristotle, Cicero,</hi> &amp;c. made great account of this; <hi>that</hi> tho some have great parts, that they can without Art perform the effects of art, yet all Fields have not a River or a Spring in them, but some require the diligence of a bucket; <hi>that</hi> those (whom they called <hi>Sophistae)</hi> who governed in their daies, made Profession, out of these places, to teach to discourse upon any subject <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> and to say all that could be spoken concerning it: <hi>that</hi> many of late daies have attained to plausibility in discourse meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Lullies</hi> art, which is but a few of those <hi>common-places;</hi> and those too the most general and indistinct: <hi>that</hi> all conceptions are drawn out of these <hi>places;</hi> and if reason naturally as it were, and of her self runs to them, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be very useful (for Art is a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain guide then Nature) to make her see her own power, to discover to her self her great treasure, and to direct her, whither to go for what she wants. For if the Soul be a great Palace furnished with all necessaries; is it not a considerable assistance to the general Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, to shew him where every thing is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed

and deposited in its proper place? The sole reason, why these are not more taught in the Schools, is, because they are included in, and learned together with, Logic and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy; and tho the use of the Topics in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic be quite different from this here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (which seems to be the mistake of that Author) yet being the things are the same, it is left to the diligence and versability of the Understanding, to apply them according to all their uses. The uses of Topics in Logic and Rhetoric, are to discover the value and force of a proposition in order to find out the truth, and to produce assent in our selves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, either by conviction or perswasion; but here they serve to procure a right notion and apprehension of things, by considering all that belongs to them: as also to communicate the same right notions to others; and by questions to draw forth as many notions as the subject will afford. It is true also, that these <hi>places</hi> are general; for being the <hi>common</hi> springs of wit and inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they cannot be otherwise; Invention being the well applying of general <hi>predicates</hi> to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar subjects.

                  <hi>It is</hi> also <hi>to be noted,</hi> that some <hi>subjects</hi> are <hi>barren,</hi> which notwithstanding will serve very well for <hi>beginners;</hi> such are universal, plain, ordinary themes and propositions, which are to be fertilized by divers <hi>Artifices;</hi> chiefly by clothing them with some rare or unaccustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>circumstances;</hi> such as have a shew of <hi>novelty</hi> or <hi>unexpectednes,</hi> for nothing else is grateful.

For every <hi>proposition is the answer to some question,</hi> and we think we understand perfectly, when we are able to answer any question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our subject.

                  <hi>useth it,</hi> or <hi>is it wont to be?</hi> Again all these are either <hi>affirmative</hi> or <hi>negative. Is it not? was it not? hath it not bin? They are</hi> also varied with <hi>If,</hi> as, <hi>if it be, if it were</hi> or <hi>were not</hi> what would follow? <hi>If Alexander,</hi> had fought with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans? If</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> go out of the <hi>Zodiack?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Predicates,</hi> ordinarily Authors do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe no other Common-places for <hi>Invention</hi> then the <hi>Predicaments;</hi> which indeed do sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply answers to very many questions, but not to all. I have therefore rather chosen to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Matteo Pellegrini,</hi> who reduceth all <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates</hi> that can be applied to a subject (as near as his observation could reach) to twelve <hi>heads,</hi> or (as he calls them) <hi>Fountains</hi> and <hi>Springs</hi> of <hi>Invention;</hi> which are these. 1. The <hi>relation</hi> or <hi>commerce between the object and human facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> 2. <hi>Constituents</hi> or parts. 3. The <hi>causes, principles,</hi> or <hi>efficients.</hi> 4. The <hi>End.</hi> 5. The <hi>Action.</hi> 6. <hi>Passion.</hi> 7. <hi>Quality.</hi> 8. <hi>Quantity.</hi> 9. <hi>Time.</hi> 10. <hi>Place.</hi> 11. The <hi>Subjects.</hi> 12. The <hi>Correspondents.</hi> Of which I shall speak in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, shewing what <hi>sub-heads</hi> every place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, and how matter may be drawn out of them by <hi>questions.</hi> Yet I shall not set down all that is to be said, for that were both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible and unnecessary; but sufficient to make the use of them, and of all not set down, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood and practicable. The manner to use them is this; set down the common place with its particular heads upon a several table or page; till by frequent perusing and practising they become ready and familiar to you. Then, by the auxiliary Verbs put in form of a question, find out such notions contained in each place as are agreeable and fitting to your subject:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56954:79"/>
change also the subject (as often as you have need) by some of the former waies, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the questions after the same manner to them also.</p>
               <p n="1">1. COMMON-PLACE. The Relation of the object to the faculties of man, is as divers as the faculties are; 1. <hi>Sense external, internal.</hi> 2. <hi>Understanding.</hi> 3. <hi>Expression.</hi> 4. <hi>Affection.</hi> Concerning sense (your subject being the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of some of them) are these and infinite other questions, <hi>v. g.</hi> a Battel. Have I ever seen it? at least painted? or described? might I have seen it? where? how long agoe? how often? had I seen it, what would it have wrought in me? I would I had seen it, for, How can I imagine it? what notion have I of it? hath my friend, or stranger, or acquaintance seen it? had he seen it, or not seen it, what would have followed? hath he dream'd of it? If a Battel be so terrible when heard, much more when seen; yet more when present in it. Could virtue be seen how would it allure all the World! 'tis pitty a lye cannot be seen, that all men might beware of it. Again, the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the sense affords such questions as these. The Comet, did it deceive, weaken, blind, astonish, confound, please, comfort, cheer, the sense?</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Semper ego Auditor tantum? nunquamne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponam,</l>
                  <l>Vexatus toties rauci Theseide Codri? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
               <p n="2">2. CONCERNING <hi>Understanding,</hi> or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal faculty of knowing. The actions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56954:80"/>
are <hi>thinking, imagination, apprehension, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,</hi> perfected when we have a compleat notion, or <hi>Idea</hi> of our object; this by many men (an original of many errors) is confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with assent. <hi>Assent</hi> or beleif that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is so, or not so; hereto belong also <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, opinion, beleiving</hi> or crediting another, <hi>sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> or perfect knowledg, <hi>deceit, error, prevision</hi> or foresight, <hi>remembrance,</hi> there being nothing that falls not out to be the object of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, &amp;c. Concerning these, we frame commonly these with infinite other questions. <hi>v. g. Columbus</hi>'s finding out the new World. How came it into his thought? did any think of it before? what imagination or conception was formed of it? why were not such, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him had that imagination, excited to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it? did the Ancients think it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? did they doubt, whether it were not all Sea? did they beleive their Predecessors that denied the Antipodes? how did <hi>Columbus</hi> first assent to it? what Arguments, what Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties moved him? if he had not thought upon it, would any other? A thing so probable did it find many abetters? &amp;c. How did it move, work upon <hi>Columbus,</hi> when he first gave his full consent? what Resolutions did he take upon it? &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. EXPRESSION, or that faculty which discovers our minds to others, comprehendeth <hi>Words, languages, spoken</hi> or <hi>written; our own</hi> or <hi>forreign; ancient</hi> or <hi>modern; copious</hi> or <hi>barren; elegant</hi> or <hi>rude; pleasant</hi> or <hi>harsh; perspicuous</hi> or <hi>obscure; ambiguous, equivocal, synonymous, proper, natural, figurative.</hi> Again, <hi>verse</hi> or <hi>prose; nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>

                  <hi>interpretation, question: instructing, disput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, determining, affirming, denying, proposing, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering, confuting, amplifying, exhorting, praying, commanding, advising, congratulating, condoling,</hi> &amp;c. All these again are <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false; likely</hi> or <hi>unlikely; doubtful</hi> or <hi>certain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this head are referred also all expressions not by words; as by <hi>painting, graving, symbols, emblems, characters, cyphers, hieroglyfics, impresas;</hi> as also signs with the hand, eye, or other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body; either natural, or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of general custome, or particular corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence. As also all natural expressions of passions, as sighing, laughing, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V. g.</hi> Being to speak of <hi>America</hi> and its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; I ask what is the name of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? what language it is? who imposed it? whence derived or took he it? what is its true signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? what the reason of imposing it? what synonymas to it? is it equivocal? who hath writ of it? in what language? how much? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Again, is there any Map of it? what doth it resemble? is it painted any where? &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. AFFECTION hath these sub-heads, whence questions may be suggested. <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>trouble; pain</hi> and <hi>pleasure; love</hi> and <hi>hatred; desire</hi> or <hi>aversion; hope</hi> or <hi>fear; gratitude</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude; anger, admiration, veneration, contemt, indignation, compassion, complacency,</hi> and in short all other motions, or passions of the Soul. In reference whereto I demand, if <hi>v. g.</hi> a visit of a friend hath ever, and when, and how often, delighted me? whether it be a thing desirable, joyful, &amp;c. to me? or if to any other, and to whom? &amp;c. If he should come, how would
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56954:81"/>
my passions be affected? what content? &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">II. SECOND common place of <hi>Constituents</hi> containeth three heads. 1. of <hi>essential degrees</hi> of <hi>Genus</hi>'s, <hi>Species,</hi> &amp;c. 2. of <hi>Particulars</hi> of its <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;</hi> and 3. of <hi>parts constitutive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first hath subheads all <hi>Essential predicates.</hi> Beginning first with <hi>ens,</hi> enquiring if your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>(v. g.</hi> an Unicorn) be, or if there be such a thing. So descending, if it be <hi>a substance,</hi> or <hi>accident.</hi> If a substance, whether <hi>corporeal,</hi> or <hi>incorporeal.</hi> If an accident, whether <hi>quantity, quality, motion (action</hi> and <hi>passion) relation, time,</hi> or <hi>place;</hi> running through the <hi>species</hi> of your <hi>genus</hi> till you come to your subject it self. These subdivisions of every <hi>genus</hi> are to be found in the predicaments. For example, an Eagle. Is there such a thing? a substance or accident? is it a substance created? corporeal? com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded? living? mortal? animal? irrational? volative? wild? that flies single, not in flocks? with a hooked-beak? living by prey? &amp;c. So concerning the first <hi>predicate,</hi> many questions offer themselves. As, War is a thing, no great matter if it were not in the World. Were it not that we see it acted every day, we should esteem it a fabulous <hi>chimera;</hi> such as <hi>Cerberus,</hi> and the <hi>Furies.</hi> Were it not, from how many calamities should we be free? Oh that there were never known the names of quarrels, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions, hatreds, fightings! but that love, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and peace reigned every where. What sort of entity is War? pursuing it through all its differences; it is an Action, not peaceable or profitable, but troublesome and offensive: offensive upon deliberation, not by Nature, as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56954:81"/>
cold is contrary to heat: for interest of state, to distinguish it from robbery or private quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels. Menaged with open violence, not secret plots, with armed multitudes, against an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that defends himself with a competent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The second suggesteth to us considerations, if the subject be one or many, simple or various; and of how many sorts, <hi>v. g.</hi> how many sorts of Eagles? of War? by Sea, by Land, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, defensive; just, unjust; horse, or foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fights; fair or barbarous. So for particulars, the War of the <hi>Turks</hi> against the <hi>Venetians, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> against <hi>Hollanders, French</hi> against <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third of <hi>Constituent parts,</hi> whether <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, integral;</hi> and these <hi>homogeneal</hi> or <hi>heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal. Adjuncts,</hi> as hairs are parts of Beasts, leaves of Trees, and these either excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, or else perfective and for ornament; as pillars are parts of noble Buildings, Theaters, Fountains, Piazza's, &amp;c. of great Cities. Or parts of order, as beginning, middle, end: su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, inferior; internal, external, &amp;c. The Soul, hath it parts? may it have? why hath it or hath it not? if it had or had not, what sort of parts? how many, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">III. THE third Common-place is of <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, efficients</hi> or <hi>principles,</hi> to which are reduced, <hi>occasions, instruments, means,</hi> or any <hi>concurrents, assistants,</hi> or <hi>accessories</hi> to produce the effect. These again are <hi>remote, near,</hi> or <hi>immediate; uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, particular: primary principal,</hi> or <hi>secundary</hi> and <hi>less principal: total, partial, separate, conjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: internal, external: necessary, contingent, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous, intended: weak, strong: which may, or</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:56954:82"/>
                  <hi>may not, be hindred: easy, hard: possible, impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: prepared, unprepared: dispositions,</hi> &amp;c. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, all these are either of the thing it self, or the thing being such as it is, clothed with acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and circumstances.</p>
               <p>In human actions also are other heads, as the <hi>Person, our selves,</hi> or <hi>some other, friend, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, stranger, enemy;</hi> which work either <hi>by chance,</hi> by <hi>reason,</hi> by <hi>passion,</hi> and these <hi>love, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,</hi> &amp;c. by <hi>force, necessity,</hi> or <hi>violence;</hi> by <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> by <hi>error</hi> or <hi>mistake,</hi> by <hi>opportunity,</hi> &amp;c. as War: by whom or between whom made? who the occasion? what moved to it? what was the true cause? what the pretence? whence began it? with what Armes and Forces was it menaged? what instruments or furniture? what conveniences? how many artillery? how many horse? how many foot? how many shot? what stock of mony? what strength? what experience? what counsel? who the General? what a one for skill, courage, fortune? what under-Officers of all sorts? how qualified? was he constrained to fight? did he undertake the charge volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily? out of duty? ambition? doth he menage it by intelligence? treachery? or force?</p>
               <p n="4">IV. THE fourth Common-place is of the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Means,</hi> or of Good; for the end of every Agent and every action is <hi>Good</hi> either <hi>real</hi> or <hi>seeming; near</hi> or <hi>far off; private</hi> or <hi>public.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of <hi>Ends</hi> there are several degrees or subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. The <hi>ultimate</hi> or <hi>supreme</hi> end. The chiefest is the <hi>glory of God the Creator:</hi> next, the <hi>perfection of the universe.</hi> And these are <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi> of all things. Next follow more <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:56954:82"/>
or <hi>mediate</hi> ends, the <hi>conservation</hi> of the <hi>Species;</hi> the conservation of the <hi>Individuum:</hi> its <hi>delight</hi> or pleasure; <hi>excellency;</hi> and <hi>convenience; honestum,</hi> or <hi>duty; profit</hi> to the Agent, his friends, neighbors, the public, his Country, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>All <hi>natural Agents,</hi> though they <hi>work</hi> for an <hi>end,</hi> yet <hi>intend</hi> it not, but are <hi>directed</hi> to it. Only <hi>man,</hi> being a rational creature, knows and <hi>aimes</hi> at an end. And the end of the <hi>man</hi> is one; of his <hi>Art,</hi> another: as the <hi>statuary</hi> makes a statue to <hi>get mony,</hi> &amp;c. but of his <hi>Art</hi> is to <hi>resemble the Archetype.</hi> Of mens <hi>intentions</hi> or aims, some are <hi>principal,</hi> others <hi>accessory;</hi> some <hi>ordinary,</hi> others <hi>accidental. Pompey</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Caesars</hi> daughter; <hi>not for</hi> the love of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny, <hi>nor for</hi> her beauty, or dowry; but <hi>for</hi> his own ambition, an <hi>accidental end</hi> to marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Some <hi>direct,</hi> others <hi>perverse;</hi> as a Father recounts to his Son the worthy actions of his Ancestors, to <hi>provoke</hi> him to the like; which he <hi>perverts</hi> to pride, libertinism, dis-subjection to Laws and Magistrates, and insolence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his inferiors. And this happens some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times out of error and mistake; as when an Orator diverts his Art to get applause; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also out of malice and wickednes, as when a General desires Victory to satisfy his private revenge. When a man goes to Church to look upon an hansom woman, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Again of ends, some are <hi>ultimate</hi> and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, others <hi>secundary,</hi> instrumental, or means to obtain the other. As a Prince gives out mony, to form an Army, to fight an enemy, to overcome him, to take away his dominion, to seize it for himself. This is the ultimate end, the other are means. Of these also some
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56954:83"/>
are proper and convenient for the end; as if he, that designs to be a Soldier, learns to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage an Horse, to understand and use arms, to endure hunger, cold, wearines, wounds, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. Others are improper, as to quarrel, to swagger, to be drunk, fight, kill and slay, every one he meets. To be an Orator, the proper means are to study reasoning and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; to imitate <hi>Cicero, Demosthenes,</hi> &amp;c. to observe the best way of disposing his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, clothing it with good words, phrases, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, &amp;c. the contrary and improper way, or rather impediment, is to scrape together a parcel of well-sounding words, a few snaps of wit, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Again, some ends are <hi>obtained,</hi> others <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;</hi> as a man desires health and strength, <hi>sed grandes patinae, tucetaque crassa annuere his supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros vetuere.</hi> A Father desires his Son to be virtuous and prudent, and provides him Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Books, &amp;c. but the young man aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons himself to ill company, &amp;c. hindred by our own folly, opposition of friends, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. &amp;c. or fortuitous accidents.</p>
               <p>Questions concerning the End are such as these. Wherefore? why so? to what end, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, intention? for whose sake? for what good doth, worketh, maketh, he this? what shall he reap by it? hath he obtained his end? hopeth he, shall he obtain it; what means tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he to obtain it? are they rational, prudent, proper? who can, hath, will, hinder him? or it?</p>
               <p n="5">V. THE 5. Common-place is of <hi>Actions.</hi> Whereof some are <hi>immanent,</hi> when the <hi>Agent</hi> is also the <hi>patient,</hi> commonly expressed by <hi>Verbs neuters</hi> in Latin. Such are, to grow, to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56954:83"/>
fail, to move, to rest, to want, to hast, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame, to study, &amp;c. to think, understand, &amp;c. Others are <hi>transient,</hi> when the <hi>Agent</hi> and <hi>Patient</hi> are divers, aad are expressed by <hi>Verbs transitives,</hi> as striking, heating, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Again, some <hi>actions</hi> concern <hi>being;</hi> as <hi>v. g.</hi> Pride, what doth, can, shall, will, &amp;c. it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce? [Note that all the auxiliary Verbs have their greatest use and force in this Classe] ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, perfect, preserve, consume, destroy? Conversation begetteth similitude in manners, mutual confidence, uniting interests, conserves friendship, and is apt to procure advancement, &amp;c. Debauchery consumes the estate, destroies health, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Others <hi>concern qualities,</hi> and indeed all <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> proceeds from the virtues or faculties of their <hi>Agents;</hi> whether natural or acquisite; and <hi>Actions</hi> are as various, and copious, as <hi>Qualities</hi> are. As a wise man gives good counsel, and doth his actions wisely. A young man doth, can, may, is wont to do foolishly. Strong Wine, doth, is apt to inebriate. In action, the place, time, and quantity often afford mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter considerable. He can speak more boldly in an Ale-house, then at Court. The Sun warmeth and enlightneth (because bigger) more then Venus; more also when nearer. How doth it move, act? by it self, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? by Nature, force, chance; as the Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, end, pretence, &amp;c. circularly? directly? how in youth? how in age? how at first? how afterwards? slowly or hastily? constantly or by intermissions? equally or unequally? mediately or immediately?</p>
               <p>To action are reduced also <hi>Consequents</hi> or
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56954:84"/>
                  <hi>Effects,</hi> which answer to the Question, what doth it, or he, work? and of these some are <hi>made,</hi> some are <hi>done;</hi> some endure no longer then the action it self; as, the room is no longer light then it is enlightened. If the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors mind him not, all is done, as soon as the Preacher hath spoke his Sermon.</p>
               <p>Others <hi>remain</hi> after the action is ended; as health remains, tho the Medicine have ended; Science remains, when the study is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. Science gets honor, honor emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, emploiment riches. A Prince what doth he? what ought he, &amp;c. to do? to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Justice. What will that do, or is it apt to produce? to maintain plenty, security, peace. What are the effects of these, naturally, usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, alwaies, continually? the peoples love, and readines to spend their lives and estates for him. Hence no danger of insurrections, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, &amp;c. he will live in great honor, and reverence with his Neighbors, &amp;c. The gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den apple, thrown by discord amongst the Gods at a feast, what consequents had it, might it have? &amp;c. delight of the guests: Emulation and desire of the three Goddesses: Chusing of <hi>Paris</hi> to be Judge: Mercuries descent to carry him the message: His undertaking it: his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the three Goddesses, &amp;c. So the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate effect of the Sun is heat, thence the warming of the Earth, raising vapors, thence clouds, rain. Again, from heat, Seasons of the year, generation of all plants, metals, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. THE sixth Common-place is of <hi>Passion,</hi> or receiving an Action. But especially <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which is chiefly of evil. To this belongs
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56954:84"/>
                  <hi>being made, being done;</hi> was the World, could it be, could it be made, from eternity? the rebuilding of the City, is it, may it, could it be done, finished, perfected, destroied, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed and changed into better, worse?</p>
               <p>Why do some men grow as fat as <hi>Ehud,</hi> none as big as <hi>Goliah?</hi> Qualities.

               <p n="7">VII. THE 7th Common-place is of <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> which hath these heads. 1. <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> in <hi>themselves,</hi> good is perfect, worthy, noble, excellent, happy, &amp;c. <hi>Evil</hi> the contrary. <hi>In respect of others,</hi> necessary, helpful, superfluous, profitable, agreeable, hurtful, &amp;c. as <hi>Lucifer</hi> was created a most noble and excellent spirit; but afterwards became unfortunate, wicked, dangerous, malicious, in endeavoring to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the glory of God, and devising mischief to man. Full of hatred against Heaven, and deceit against Earth, &amp;c. by which means he

               <p n="2">2. QUALITIES <hi>occult,</hi> which are known only by their actions.

So for smells of all sorts, and tasts: also tangible qualities, as heat, cold; dry, moist: heavy, light; hard, soft; liquid, solid, thin, thick, subtil, gross, clear, &amp;c. and all these natural, or adventitious.

Is it possible he should be not eternal? if he were not eternal, what would follow? why is he eternal? can any thing be eternal besides him? Duration is varied into <hi>past, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> and <hi>future.</hi> Prudence considereth things past, that it may govern the present; and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth conjectures from both, that it may well menage the future. The past is considered by memory; the present is in acting; in the future are concerned our hopes, fears, providence, cautiousnes, &amp;c.</p>

               <p n="2">2. PLACE is either <hi>Proper, common;</hi> due be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to another. A Scholar in a Market is a fish on dry land.

               </p>
               <p n="11">XI. THE 11th Common-place is the <hi>subject to which</hi> any thing <hi>belongeth,</hi> or <hi>wherein</hi> any thing <hi>is.</hi> There is nothing that may not be the subject of another. The cause may be of its propriety. Virtuous actions to whom are they proper? in whom to be found? in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent persons. What things are hot? those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the Sun, are neer to the fire, are in motion. Who are cunning? they who have much experience. The effects and signs. Who are noble? they who do nothing basely, or craftily. Who are true Princes? they who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern for the good of their People. Who are subject to anger? they who have a sharp nose, curled hair, red face, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Substances are most properly the subject of other things. As God is the fountain of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the Angels receive it immediately from him. Men and other Creatures are good each in his kind.</p>
               <p>So for all other things. What things are, may be, use to be, ought to be, accounted long? [Actions and Passions] a Journy from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>China.</hi> The works of <hi>Tostatus Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensis.</hi> Delay of what is earnestly desired.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56954:87"/>
[Time] the lives of Men before the Flood. [Piace] the way from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> What things are weak and feeble. [Quantity] things small and little. [Quality] sick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Women, pale persons, fearful, tired, &amp;c. [Action] Children, old Men. [Place] the Asiatics, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. THE last Common-place is <hi>Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondents,</hi> which hath many under it, as</p>

Whether is before, <hi>Saturn</hi> or the <hi>Sun?</hi> in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and perfection the Sun is before: in place descending Saturn is before. In time they are equal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The same</hi> and <hi>divers</hi> or different. Virgil was the Author of the <hi>Georgies,</hi> who of the <hi>Aeneids?</hi> the same. How doth his Poems dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from <hi>Homers, Theocritus, Hesiod, Tasso?</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Like, unlike; contrary, opposite;</hi> and these varied with more and less. <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Jul. Caesar</hi> were like in boldnes, unlike in stature; of contrary dispositions. Whether was more prudent? less fortunate? Was <hi>Plato</hi> a better Philosopher, or <hi>Dionysius</hi> a worse Tyrant? the Astrologues prediction of <hi>Caesars</hi> death, brings to mind the like of the Earl of <hi>Pembrok.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Union</hi> or <hi>conjunction in the same action;</hi> as when two act one upon another.

Or when both act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a third, as two Rivals toward the same Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress. Or both suffer from a third, as two

servants under the same Master. Or one act and the other receive or suffer, as the Master and Scholar, Judge and accused.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Together, near, far of: antecedent, concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, subsequent,</hi> either in place, dignity or time. <hi>Christmas</hi> brings to mind good cheer, mirth, jollity. A feast suggests Meats, Cooks, Fish, Foul, Flesh, Sawces, Dishes, Chargers, Wines, Cups, Plates, &amp;c. The Spring brings in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Autumn, Winter. <hi>Caesar</hi> makes me think of <hi>Brutus, Cassius, Pompey,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

1. CONCISELY, in few short abrupt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, as men ordinarily speak in common conversation, without any art, or order. As</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Dic mihi Damaeta, cujum pecus? An Melibaei?</l>

               </q>
               <p>Such is very frequent in the <hi>Comedians.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. SOMEWHAT <hi>artificially</hi> but <hi>imperfectly;</hi> 1. without any observation of numbers, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence, measure, &amp;c. when a <hi>period</hi> hath no certain bounds, but goes on till the matter be ended, keeping the mind of the <hi>Auditor</hi> still in suspense, till all is said which is to say; which when it will be, the <hi>Auditor</hi> cannot divine, because he cannot foresee where the speakers design will determine. Such are the beginnings of most of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles. Such is that beginning of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s <hi>Oration pro Caelio. Si quis Judices forte adsit, ignarus legum, &amp;c.</hi> till you come to <hi>quibus otiosis, ne in communi qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem otio, liceat esse.</hi> So in that <hi>pro Milone</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at <hi>Occidi, occidi non Sp.

began to understand Rhetoric. And of some Orators in his time he saith; <hi>In iis erat admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis cursus orationis, ornata sententiarum concinni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas non erat. i. e.</hi> they had a wonderful fluency in their stile, choice words, and round full pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, but they wanted the neat distribution of them into parts and members. <hi>The first</hi> is like an head of excellent hair, but hanging down, and flagging; <hi>this other</hi> like the same hair dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and made up into rings and curles.

ought to govern both our selves and others. This if it be applied to particular subjects hath seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall names; as if to govern Cities or Common-wealths, 'tis <hi>political</hi> prudence; if Armies and War, <hi>military;</hi> if a family, <hi>oeconomical,</hi> &amp;c. with none of which I intermeddle, but only with that, which concerns every particular person in the conduct of his life: and here only in general; reserving to the second Part such particular rules, as either my own or others experience, that I have read, have suggested. In this place therefore I shall only advise (as wall as I can) how the <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is to be cultivated for the implanting that great perfection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. AND first take notice; that the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising this faculty is the employing of all the rest.</hi> For it is in vain to give <hi>judgement</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the reasons (devised by <hi>Invention)</hi> for both parties; and the like cases in former times suggested by <hi>memory.</hi> For the chief employment of the <hi>judgment</hi> being concerning the future, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the choice of an End, or of apt means to an end; no man can promise to himself any success in his election without engaging all the powers he hath. As there must be. 1. [Supposing the end to be already resolved upon and alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes] a <hi>proposal</hi> or finding out severall <hi>v. g. mediums</hi> to an end.

This is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate action of <hi>Judgment;</hi> and which consists of many parts. As 1. <hi>circumspection</hi> of all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56954:94"/>
of time, place, and all other opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; 2. <hi>Caution</hi> for prevention of hinderances, considering all dangers, and difficulties, he is likely to encounter; and either providing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and avoid, or arming himself to resist, or suffer them. 3. <hi>Solertia</hi> or good and rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing of what is likely to succeed. 4ly A firm <hi>resolution,</hi> and competent secrecy. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a constant and due <hi>execution</hi> of what is well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved. Now because this knowledge is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and at the best but a conjecture, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to consider <hi>what hath succeeded heretofore upon such premises,</hi> for that is most likely to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen again: but this cannot be done without the assistance either of Books or experienc'd persons, who have seen and known the like cases and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses: and this cannot be without much <hi>obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> and taking notice of things in the time of their actual flourishing; and storing up such rules and histories in the memory for future ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. By the way it will not be amiss to take notice, that as there is <hi>no new thing</hi> under the Sun, so <hi>neither any new action;</hi> but the same are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented over again under varying circumstances; so that he, who intends to be a wise man, must endeavour to distinguish the <hi>Action</hi> (as Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do in judging diseases) from the <hi>circumstances;</hi> that he may be able to give a good judgment and prognostic; and afterwards to frame a <hi>general rule,</hi> which may stand him in stead at other times and occasions.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That a man may be <hi>virtuous</hi> it is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that he <hi>now and then</hi> do virtuous actions; nor that he do them <hi>frequently</hi> out of good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, interest, mode, passion, or the like: but that he work <hi>discreetly, constantly, habitually,</hi> and for a <hi>good end,</hi> and by <hi>deliberation</hi> and <hi>choice;</hi> which two last conditions necessarily presuppose <hi>Prudence.</hi> So that as no <hi>Virtue</hi> without <hi>Prudence,</hi> neither is it without them. For it hath bin the observation of all knowing and discreet persons, and thay have delivered it for a certain rule, as hath also the Holy Spirit, and Wisdom of God himself; that virtuous courses onely, together with Gods grace obtained by much prayer and intercession, are capable to make a man wise, <hi>i. e.</hi> to direct his actions in such manner as he shall not need to repent of them. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such actions are called <hi>good:</hi> and others <hi>evill,</hi> because of the evil consequents; that they bring such as perform them to sorrow, repentance and misery. Hereupon are grounded those rules in the holy Scripture, that <hi>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom, that the beginning of Wisdom is to avoid folly,</hi> and wickedness. That <hi>it is sport to a fool to do wickedly,</hi> and the like: <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:56954:95"/>
being the chiefest and supremest of all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. An <hi>evil man</hi> seeks occasions to gratify his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; and at best thinks to stop at the confines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt passion and vice; but a <hi>wise man</hi> avoids the occasions of vice, which he looks upon as a disease of the Soul, contrary to the natural and due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of it, and subverting its true tone and disposition. And that every <hi>vice</hi> in particular is contrary to <hi>Prudence,</hi> appears; because <hi>Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> instead of wisdome introduceth <hi>craft, subtilty, deceitfulnes,</hi> which are called the wisdom of the World. <hi>Pride</hi> breeds <hi>confidence</hi> of a mans self, and <hi>despising</hi> others advise and counsel; and <hi>lust</hi> (the third fountain of all vices) is the mother of <hi>negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, precipitious inconsiderateness, inconstancy,</hi> and at length of that <hi>blindness of understanding,</hi> which renders them uncapable of discerning, such things especially as concern their Souls, but even such also as are advantageous to their temporal welfare; and of chusing better from worse; fit and convenient from improper and aliene.</p>
               <p n="5">5. PASSIONS, tho not so immediately concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the ruine of the Judgment as vice, yet indirectly and by consequent destroy it also. For being (as I said before) undeliberate motions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards objects pleasing or displeasing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the sensitive Soul; the objects passing through that to the understanding, carry with them that <hi>tincture</hi> or <hi>forme</hi> they there receive by those Actions; not now as pleasing or painful, but as good or bad (for so the <hi>passions</hi> represent them.) And if the <hi>Intellect</hi> do not speedily reflect upon the deceit; and separate and cleanse the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural from the passionate, wherewith it is stained, it becomes partaker of, and ingaged in, the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56954:95"/>
And so not only looseth the true notion and knowledge of the object, but apprehends it also under a wrong and false <hi>Idea;</hi> mistaking <hi>v. g.</hi> the pleasure or good for the object. And whatever it receives or considers, whilest in that disposition, is conceived under the same mistake. So that all passions more or less, according to the degree of their strength, render the understanding par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and unindifferent, and consequently erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and unfit to judge in any thing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hence it is, that a man in <hi>passion,</hi> tho the alteration be only in himself, yet ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines the World without him to be changed. What was <hi>before esteemed;</hi> when now look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through this false light, appears <hi>contemtible;</hi> and the contemned becomes admirable. The <hi>beloved</hi> or desired is without faults, is excellent and easy; the <hi>hated</hi> is all faulty, unworthy, and impossible. Yet is this no great matter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the <hi>Passions,</hi> when they are in their height and vigor. Do we not see how for the satisfying of a lust, and enjoying a revenge, a man breaks through all Laws, all obligations natural and civil? how he regards not what injury or affront he offers even to Magistrates and Parents? how he despiseth all inconveniences and evill consequences, his own or other mens reasons may forewarn him? But I will not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with these <hi>extravagants,</hi> utterly unfit to be carved into <hi>Mercuries,</hi> and will consider those which work more mildely; and <hi>seduce,</hi> not <hi>tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> upon, the Judgement. Such are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. SELF-LOUE, or <hi>self-estimation,</hi> an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vervaluing of a mans own parts, opinions, or actions. An <hi>error</hi> in some sort <hi>necessary</hi> to the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56954:96"/>
well-being of man; for should every one know exactly the measure of his own ability, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of the World would be miserable. Every man, therefore, makes himself the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard for all others, esteeming every ones abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and actions, as they are equal or confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to his own: And this seems to be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural suggestion; but if it be too much indulged, so that either for <hi>pride</hi> of his own parts, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp;c. or for <hi>interest</hi> and <hi>covetousness;</hi> or for <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>reputation;</hi> or for <hi>custom</hi> and <hi>educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> or any other by-respect, a man warp his <hi>Judgment,</hi> he lies under a lasting and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall prejudice. For this is the beginning of <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatrety;</hi> and when <hi>despising</hi> the advice and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others, he <hi>follows</hi> only his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, is it not just that he should be permitted to fall into the consequences of his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? he that bends, and plies his reason to his passion, why should he not enjoy the product of his indiscretion? why should he that <hi>sows</hi> folly, <hi>reap</hi> the fruit of counsel and advise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? But to instance in the foresaid par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. HE that is <hi>conceited of his own worth, eo ipso des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piseth</hi> others, and therefore will not read or take pains to informe himself what other Men say or know, but when he fixeth in himself this proposition, that <hi>other Men are more ignorant</hi> then he; then whatever comes in his fancy, seems to be an addition to knowledg; and must either be reserved as a mystery, or vented as the <hi>Depth of Science,</hi> and <hi>Oracle of wit;</hi> though many times it is but either a <hi>great error,</hi> or at best, a <hi>vulgar truth,</hi> And the most extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56954:96"/>
and grotesque conceits, as being most of all his own, he esteems and values the most. Such a man frames to himself notions and opinions, which all the World is to submit to, and these alone are to be taught and propagated; and all opposers are opiniastres, and ignorant, if not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, contradicters of the truth, and envious of the glory of him that discovers it. Hence comes the <hi>spirit of contradiction,</hi> that let the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse opiner say what he will, his reasons will not be heard; for indeed our <hi>learned man</hi> stands upon his guard against truth; and so at last, instead of fair arguing, turns to <hi>chicanery</hi> and Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How much <hi>interest</hi> and <hi>secular respects</hi> wrest the judgement, is manifest to any one that observes; that the <hi>thriving opinions,</hi> and such as are countenanced by them that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, never fail of abettors. But I can easilier pardon these then those who for <hi>love</hi> of <hi>gain oppose</hi> the <hi>Magistrate</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> who knowing the humor of the ordinary people to be against obedience, and subjection, make use of it to disturb the peace, that they may fish the better. They <hi>gain Proselites</hi> that they may <hi>grow rich;</hi> they <hi>gather Churches</hi> that they may <hi>collect wealth;</hi> and <hi>heap up Disciples,</hi> that they may <hi>multiply collections.</hi> Thus they deceive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and unstable Souls, of their <hi>temporal,</hi> as well as their <hi>spiritual,</hi> goods: and care not what craft and deceitfulnes they use that they may fill their puries; their Arts are infinite, and seen of every one but those who are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them.</p>

                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:56954:97"/>
3. VAIN-GLORY, or <hi>desire of seeming</hi> more knowing then other persons, is as strong a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, ever since our first Parents were carried away by it, as any that molests our Souls. This goes masked many times under a vizor of <hi>seeking Reformation,</hi> advancing knowledg, and the like; when it is in reality <hi>seeking applause,</hi> insinuating into a party, and vaunting our own selves. The beginnings of this <hi>delusion</hi> are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times very subtil, and difficultly discerned, except by those who are very jealous of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Hence comes an <hi>itch to invent</hi> or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish new opinions and fancies; <hi>to quarrel</hi> for a new interpretation, and even <hi>go to Law</hi> for the primogeniture of a notion. From hence also, if sharpned a little by coveteousnes, comes all <hi>seditions, disobedience</hi> to Magistrates, heresies, schismes, and rebellions. Is it not strange to see an ignorant person, without <hi>comprehending,</hi> or so much as <hi>tasting,</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Arts and Knowledg, to <hi>judg</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and scorn to be guided; especially in things of consequence, where most caution is to be used? he that will not refuse to be taught to be a <hi>Shoe-maker,</hi> scorns to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in <hi>Divinity;</hi> and he will submit to a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of a Trade,</hi> that will not bow to a <hi>Doctor.</hi> If a man well furnish'd with this <hi>spiritual Pride,</hi> happens to be informed in some particular knowledg above the rest of his condition; he immediately thinks himself <hi>inferior only to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; instruction</hi> he despiseth; all <hi>ignorance,</hi> yea and sometimes <hi>Science</hi> too, he defieth; and pretends to nothing but <hi>inspiration,</hi> and, the consequent of that, <hi>infallibility;</hi> then hath the Devil perfected his work in him, he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56954:97"/>
as far in error as is possible, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>seducer</hi> and an <hi>impostor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. OF all <hi>Opiniatrety,</hi> that which proceeds from <hi>Custome,</hi> and <hi>Education,</hi> is the least ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd; yet a fault it is also, and more difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conquerable then the rest. For the errors become in a manner <hi>connatural;</hi> and tho a <hi>disease,</hi> yet have so tincted the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it apprehends nothing but through them. And therefore the more any one knows in his error, the more difficultly is it eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; yet time, and labor will do much; <hi>one custome not</hi> being <hi>to be expelled but by another.</hi> From this force of Education it comes, that <hi>heresies</hi> and <hi>dissessions</hi> are for so many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions continued; that whole <hi>Orders,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Nations espouse one opinion;</hi> and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to another as wise and learned as it self.</p>
               <p n="2">2. TIMOROUSNES, <hi>basenes,</hi> or <hi>slothfulnes,</hi> is another origine of <hi>Errors,</hi> quite contrary to those produc'd by <hi>self-love;</hi> when a man seems to have <hi>no opinion of his own,</hi> but to assume the colour and tincture of those with whom he converseth. The <hi>Opiniatre</hi> takes for <hi>false</hi> what any other person affirms, the <hi>Complaisant</hi> for <hi>true.</hi> This is indeed the most peaceable way, and the best to make a fortune, but corrupts the judgment more then the other. For such a man either despiseth <hi>Truth</hi> as a thing of no value, not worth laboring for; or his <hi>own Soul,</hi> as if God had not given him reason, but had brought him into the World, and not endued him with sufficient ability to guide himself in it. Such men usually admire <hi>other mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:56954:98"/>
and take things upon the credit either of a <hi>greater</hi> number against a <hi>less</hi> (which in diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matters is very dangerous) or sometimes of a <hi>less</hi> against <hi>a greater.</hi> Or of persons <hi>not versed</hi> in what is desired to be known, as of a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man in things of piety or secular prudence; of a pious man in matters of learning and the like: yet this is better then to take a mans judgment, because of some <hi>external</hi> and <hi>acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal advantages;</hi> as to think a man <hi>learned,</hi> or in the truth, because a <hi>friend</hi> or acquaintance. Or, I am of <hi>his opinion,</hi> because I gain, or hope to get, by him. Or, <hi>he is rich, for which Men hold him wise.</hi> He hath so many <hi>legions,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath <hi>reason.</hi> Or, he is in great Office, he is above us, therefore wiser then us; he is of our Order, therefore we must sustain him. From this admiration of persons it comes, that he is thought a <hi>good Preacher</hi> that <hi>sweats</hi> and labors in the Pulpit; or he a <hi>good Advocate</hi> that <hi>bawls</hi> at the Bar; or he a <hi>wise man</hi> that <hi>talks gravely.</hi> We also think him a wicked person or our enemy that is acquainted with such, as if all that converse together joined in the same interest; him proud and insolent, that neglects a due civility; him ignorant, that is slow and silent; and him to have taken good counsel, that hath success. Hence also it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that most Men admire what is <hi>in fashion</hi> and vogue even in <hi>Religion</hi> it self, and <hi>learning,</hi> as well as in <hi>clothes</hi> and <hi>phrases.</hi> That Men are taken with shews and splendor, and vain appearances; and are unwilling to go out of the track; but relinquish reason, and many times virtue it self, because they want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:56954:98"/>
But that which most imposeth upon persons of learning and prudence, is; <hi>if they see a man say much truth, and well, they are apt to take the rest of his discourse upon that credit.</hi> The <hi>strong</hi> carries off the <hi>weak;</hi> and the <hi>Understanding</hi> once <hi>conquered,</hi> is not willing to try her strength a second time against the <hi>victor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I WILL mention no more of the <hi>Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> but in short reduce all the <hi>causes of errors</hi> to 2. heads of <hi>misjudging.</hi> The first is <hi>too hasty assenting,</hi> the second <hi>too slow.</hi> For the first,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There being no proposition, for which somewhat may not be said; many Men (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of passion, interest, want of ability or leisure, lazines, or whatever other cause) <hi>rest with the first appearance,</hi> and by little and little take root, and fix in error. Alas how few <hi>can judg</hi> of probabilities! of them that can, how few <hi>will take pains</hi> to weigh and consider? how many are <hi>concern'd</hi> that <hi>Error</hi> should be <hi>Truth?</hi> and who are so easily deceived, as they that think themselves wisest? Hence it comes, that so many Men abandon themselves to <hi>sensuality,</hi> covetousnes, and other vices, without remorse, or discovering the fallacy, for they assume to themselves certain reasons built upon slight foundations, which they are <hi>concern'd</hi> should be true, and therefore they will <hi>not examine</hi> them: but because they have some (tho but very small) <hi>shew</hi> of reason, they serve them, first for discourse with others, and then to fool themselves. As generally for all <hi>vice</hi> they urge.</p>
               <p>The example of other Men, the most, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny also in prosperity, and many esteemed good, that yet are vicious some way.</p>

That it is not so bad, or dangerous, as is pretended.</p>
               <p>That many sin, yet but few punished. And the like.</p>
               <p>For <hi>pleasure,</hi> such as these,</p>
               <p>That natural desires are vainly implanted in us, if not lawful.</p>
               <p>That it is for poor and impotent persons not to bestow upon themselves what they desire; to bridle appetites and lusts is an argument of lownes of spirit, or want of power; and that by this, great persons are distinguished from mean ones and inferiors.</p>
               <p>That if pleasures had not been fitting, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had not joined them to those actions, which are mostly hers; and that therefore Beasts are alwaies regulated by them.</p>
               <p>That no men, whatever they pretend, but use them.</p>
               <p>That studying, or emploiment, is only that pleasures, and rest, may be enjoied in old age with more <hi>gusto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That thinking is a dull formality; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring a laborious life, by him who can live at ease, is a busy folly.</p>
               <p>So for <hi>Covetuousnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That a good Patriot endeavors to encrease the stock and wealth of the Nation, which prodigals wast and consume.</p>
               <p>That it is a great fault to spend and abuse those things, which may be put to good use.</p>
               <p>That nothing breeds respect but wealth; that alone is equal to all things; the ransom of a mans life; the last appeal, and resort of all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous persons.</p>
               <p>That it is but storing up what is necessary, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:56954:99"/>
The like pretences, and fig-leaves may be found for all other irregular and vitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. To which if a man by education, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, passion, or any other way, be biass'd and prepossess'd; and his indifferency removed; he will easily take up these plausibilities; and by them make his reason and truth truckle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his lusts and desires. <hi>Qui vult decipi, decipiatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this fallacy of <hi>hasty judging</hi> reaches fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even the <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>Philosophers</hi> are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of drawing <hi>universal conclusions</hi> out of <hi>insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient inductions.</hi> The Instances are infinite, but not fit for this place. But see in <hi>common Conversation</hi> what argumentations are frequent amongst us. Some professing Religion, live not accordingly, therefore all Religion is hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy. Some grave men are only formal, therefore all gravity is formality. Some things are uncertain, therefore there is no truth at all, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The last <hi>Error</hi> in Judgment I shall note, is contrary to the former, <hi>i. e. too long deferring Assent.</hi> When a man hath considered a <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> and finds on either side <hi>Arguments;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times he <hi>will not</hi> put himself to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or for want of judgment he <hi>is not able,</hi> to consider; which is more probable, which ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silier answered, &amp;c. but sits down with <hi>suspense of assent;</hi> thinks, that of two so equal in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, <hi>either</hi> part, or <hi>neither,</hi> may be safely taken; and is contented with <hi>Scepticism.</hi> In justification of this folly some have made a <hi>profession,</hi> and instituted a <hi>sect;</hi> defending that there is <hi>no proposition so probable, but its contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory is as probable:</hi> and that no man can be <hi>certain</hi> of any thing, against which any reason
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56954:100"/>
may be objected. So that wee are not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive our selves awake, because we, somtimes, dream that we walke, think, eat, &amp;c. A <hi>Doctrine</hi> more then <hi>brutish;</hi> for the Beasts feed, and sleep, guided by their senses, notwithstanding the manifold errors, and deceits of them, without any scruple of doubting. <hi>Against human nature</hi> also, and injurious to our good <hi>Creator;</hi> bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him for giving us no more certainty then is needful or useful; and not such a one as by curious persons may be <hi>imagined.</hi> Tis also <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their own practise;</hi> for what <hi>Sceptic</hi> ever refused to eat or sleep, pretending that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of those actions was not grounded upon a principle of absolute certainty, or the like; which notwithstanding, they willingly sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest to others? Upon the <hi>testimony of senses</hi> and reasoning upon the objects supplied from the senses, all the moments of our <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>fortunes</hi> depend; Peace and War, Government and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and the rest. He would be very <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,</hi> that being convinced of robbery before a Magistrate, should plead that the senses of the witnesses might erre; that they might be at that time asleep; and dream they were rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; that it is dangerous to take away a mans life without <hi>absolute certainty.</hi> In short, not to assent to <hi>sufficient evidence, i. e.</hi> to so much as all men are wont to assent unto, and upon which they set their lives and fortunes, seems to be a disclaiming of humane nature, and a silly affectation to be what man never <hi>was, is,</hi> nor can be.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I Will instance in no more Errors, but proceed to the <hi>Remedies;</hi> of which some concern the <hi>Educator,</hi> others the <hi>Educated.</hi> For the first.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:56954:100"/>
1. I Would not have the <hi>Instructor</hi> to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if his charge take not every thing upon his authority; <hi>Obest plerumque iis, qui discere velint, authoritas docentis.</hi> But encourage him to <hi>ask questions,</hi> and move doubts; accustom him to <hi>give his opinion</hi> and reasons in doubtful ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; especially such as fall out at that time, and upon the place. For want of such, let him <hi>censure the Ancients;</hi> let him accuse the murderers of <hi>Caesar;</hi> jeer <hi>Cato</hi> for killing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, &amp;c. Quicken also and waken his spirit, by giving him liberty to <hi>Contradict</hi> you, when he finds reason for it; and when he doth not, do you shew him what arguments are against your self. Encourage in him all <hi>thinking</hi> and exercise of the mind; and let him judge and censure freely what he reads or hears; sparing persons alwaies for charity sake; and <hi>discourage him not for every error he commits.</hi> Take not all the talk to your self; nor make to him long <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues,</hi> expecting a youth should go along with you, and understand and believe all you say. But discourse with him much after <hi>Socrates</hi>'s man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; which teacheth him to <hi>know</hi> things even before he learn them, <hi>i. e.</hi> by considering and comparing them with things <hi>obvious</hi> and <hi>fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,</hi> to wind up to the knowledge of things <hi>unknown</hi> and <hi>obscure.</hi> This will enlarge and exalt his spirit to an <hi>universal contemplation</hi> of the natures of things as they really are; and make him to <hi>admire</hi> nothing; to be <hi>surpriz'd</hi> with nothing; and not <hi>condemn</hi> every thing that is not cast in his own mold, or framed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own mode and taste. Thus he will not be <hi>offended</hi> with small matters; nor be <hi>amaz'd</hi> to see contrary humors, opinions, or fashions,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56954:101"/>
nor be like a man brought up in a <hi>bottle,</hi> see all things through <hi>one hole.</hi> It is also observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the more any one knows, the less is he ingaged in opiniatrety; but this I only mention.</p>
               <p n="2">2. HE that seeks truth, and to perfect his judgement, must endeavour to render himself <hi>indifferent, free,</hi> and <hi>disengaged,</hi> that he may be ready to pass his Sentence <hi>secundum allegata &amp; probata:</hi> which is chiefly by delivering himself from the power and dominion of all passions whatsoever. Which is done by regulating the <hi>Imagination</hi> (for there is their beginning) <hi>i. e.</hi> by subjecting it to reason and the <hi>Understanding;</hi> that it may not without consultation follow the suggestions of <hi>sense,</hi> and unruly motions of the <hi>Appetite.</hi> And this is not difficult if the particular occasion can be foreseen; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that happens not frequently, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to set a <hi>continual guard</hi> over our weakest place, where we are most obnoxious to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; and to have a continuall magazine of such sober and, moderate <hi>considerations,</hi> as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, reading, and experience will furnish. But if notwithstanding you cannot prevent these apprehensions, which indeed is difficult; I mean for a man to stand so continually upon centry, his arms ready and fixed, and in his hands; then at the time of the assault, <hi>retire;</hi> let the <hi>motion spend it self</hi> in vaine, and suffer it not to fix upon the object. But at the worst, play an aftergame. If anger <hi>v. g.</hi> have prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against you, force your self to beg pardon; and let shame and (especially <hi>voluntary)</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, &amp; penance, bring wrath to reason. So
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56954:101"/>
against <hi>Insolence</hi> contradict your own, tho law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, desires another time, and do contrary to what you most affect. In sum, <hi>observe</hi> your own inclinations (for accidental Passions are not so dangerous) and watch over them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently; which is also better and easilier per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, if you can procure a faithful <hi>monitor</hi> to assist and advise you. Next set not your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to much upon any thing whatsoever, even not upon the <hi>public,</hi> or works of <hi>Charity</hi> which are not necessary; pursue nothing with eagerness and engagement. And think not, when you have conquered three or foure times, that the war is ended. Passions are much the weaker by being overcome; but take heed they rally not. <hi>Qui sani esse volunt, ita vivere debent, ut perpetuo curentur.</hi> Good counsel. is not to be taken as <hi>Physic,</hi> but as <hi>nourishment,</hi> continually received, ruminated, and dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted. And lastly, when you are foiled, put some penance upon your self, and resolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on greater diligence for the future. And using these means, doubt not, by Gods blessing, but to arrive in time to a sedate tranquillity of mind and a clear understanding of the truth, a condition not more advantageous to the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, then grateful to, and admired by, them with whom you converse.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE last means I propose of acquiring a good Judgement, is <hi>consideration, weighing,</hi> or <hi>thinking</hi> much upon the probabilities of both sides; and that not onely at the present, when the mind is engaged and concern'd in, and for the business; but at leisure, suppose at night, when you recollect what you have done all the day; for then the mind is free to review, and revise
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56954:102"/>
her own actions. He that useth this, will find in himself other thoughts and conceptions then he can possibly imagine, and he will see the same difference as is betwixt looking into <hi>mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> water. Hence it will follow that <hi>much busines is a great impediment to him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to perfect his judgment; nemo occupatus bonam mentem invenit. Sen.</hi> An experienc'd person is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of engaging himself in many emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but a beginner must not; nor in any one busines that taketh up his whole time: for by that means indeed he may be well skilled in that one thing; but he cannot arrive at the <hi>largenes and comprehensivenes</hi> required to true <hi>Wisdom.</hi> Again, whatsoever conduceth to heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and, as I may say, to <hi>spiritualize,</hi> the Soul, is also advantageous to wisdom. And this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth so much (of the several parts of learning and sciences I have spoken before) as <hi>Devotion</hi> or <hi>Contemplation;</hi> which is a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>light</hi> immediately from the <hi>Sun;</hi> and a lifting and raising up the Soul to God; who of his infinite goodnes hath made the <hi>reward of his service</hi> in some sort the <hi>effect of it also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the first consideration a wise man fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon, is the great <hi>End of his Creation;</hi> what it is, and wherein it consists: the next is of the most <hi>proper means</hi> to that end: afterwards he weighs the <hi>difficulties and hinderances,</hi> he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rencounter in his obtaining that end. After which he weighs all particular occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, how they conduce to, or at least agree, with that end, and those means so chosen. But for these, I refer you to such Authors as have spoken expressly concerning them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of travelling into Forreign Countries.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE Advantages of <hi>Travel</hi> are, 1. to <hi>learn</hi> the Languages, Laws, Customes, and understand the Government, and interest, of other Nations. 2. To <hi>produce</hi> confident and comely behavior, to <hi>perfect</hi> conversation and discours. 3. To <hi>satisfy</hi> their minds with the actual beholding such rarities, wonders, and curiosities, as are heard or read of. It <hi>brings us</hi> out of the company of our Relations, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, and familiars; making us stand upon our guard, which renders the mind more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, vigorous, brisk, and spiritful. It <hi>shews us,</hi> by consideration of so many various humors, and manners, to look into and form our own; and by tasting perpetually the varieties of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be able to judg of what is good and better. And it is most useful <hi>for those, who</hi> by living at home, and domineering amongst ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, &amp;c. have got an habit of surlines, pride, insolence, or other resty and slovenly custom. As also <hi>for those, who</hi> are entangled with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting companions, friends, loves, servants. <hi>For those, who</hi> are seized upon with the vices of their own Country, such with us are Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rusticity, sowrnes in conversation, lazines, &amp;c. and then, every one must be sent into the place most proper to reform him; as <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:56954:103"/>
is not much used in <hi>France;</hi> less in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain. Debauchery</hi> with Women not so frequent in <hi>Germany, Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gaming</hi> is common every where, but less in <hi>Italy. Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling</hi> dangerous in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain. Prodigality</hi> is often helped by setting a certain allowance, in a place where he cannot be trusted, where he is necessitated to live within his compass; or in prison; or shamefully run away without paying his host. It is also profitable for all persons <hi>learned,</hi> inquisitive, and curious: who, by the conversation of learned Men, and use of Books unusual with us, and Libraries, may very much augment their knowledg, as well as their experience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I WOULD <hi>not</hi> advise any young man <hi>to go abroad without an Assistant</hi> or Governor, a <hi>Scholar:</hi> one able <hi>to instruct</hi> him in such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Arts, as are fitting for him to know; <hi>to chuse</hi> his companions (else a young man left to himself, not having to employ his time, must of necessity fall to debauchery, and evil company, who are alwaies ready to seize upon young straies;) <hi>to assist him</hi> in sicknes, or any other necessity; to <hi>advertise</hi> him of his fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures; <hi>to exact</hi> the performance of his studies, exercises, and emploiments; <hi>to husband</hi> his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance; to <hi>keep him</hi> company, and <hi>furnish</hi> him good discourse, and good example.</p>
               <p n="3">3. WHOEVER would have his Son <hi>molded</hi> upon the <hi>form</hi> of such a Nation, must send him thither young; that his tongue may be plied to their Language, and his whole carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age imbibe, by imitation, their manner and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56954:103"/>
fshion, before tincted with any other. But if that design be not regarded (as I conceive it not very convenient for any one to quit his own Country customs, [customs, I say, not vices]) then it is better to travel when they <hi>arrive at</hi> some <hi>judgment,</hi> to discern better from worse; when able to <hi>furnish discourse,</hi> and by that means enter gratefully into conversation. Whereas being sent young, and having no knowledg or experience, they cannot advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage themselves abroad, but are there in a kind of amazednes; variety of objects, which they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther understand, nor value, confounding, rather then edifying, them. And truly I conceive the cheif reason, why <hi>Travellers</hi> have so little (especially good) conversation of the natives, to be, because of the jealousy they have of young <hi>Travellers;</hi> that nothing is to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by their conversation worthy the trouble of their bad Language, impertinent discourse, silly questions (for such those demands seem to be, which concern things to them familiar and obvious) and frequent visits. Methinks therefore, it were better <hi>every one to be educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at home,</hi> to the subjection and obedience of his own Country Laws, and Customs; (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Laws and Government be subverted, as they lately were; and except there be some such Nation in the World, as admire all Laws and Customs but their own.) <hi>Etcocles</hi> would not give hostages to <hi>Antipater</hi> of the youth, but of grown Men. And the <hi>Persians,</hi> when wanting a King, they sent for some of the Royall Family, then hostages at Rome, were afterwards displeased at, and cut them off, as not agreeing with the manners and customs of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56954:104"/>
their Country. Besides 'tis better they should stay, till by instruction and study they have arrived to a capacity of employing their time profitably and delightfully by themselves; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being (as too many are) forced to seek divertisement with others: then leave their Country at that age, when they should be <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated</hi> and molded <hi>into the Laws</hi> of it. And this is the reason, why not knowing their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive duty,</hi> and living as strangers, <hi>licentiously,</hi> and not according to the best examples abroad; they bring home instead of solid virtue, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, fashions, grimaces,</hi> and at best a volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of talking non-sense, &amp;c. Yet some, perhaps, think them then well educated; and that <hi>forreign vanity</hi> is preferable to <hi>home-discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This is also the reason why they are forced, for passing their time, to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to such conversation as they can find; and good company being very rare and shy, but bad alwaies ready, and offering themselves, 'tis no wonder if they run into extravagant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, as well as evilnes of manners. Or if they escape these, then the <hi>Fencing, Dancing,</hi> and <hi>Language-Master</hi> catch them, from whom picking up some <hi>scraps</hi> and <hi>shreds</hi> of discourse, at home they vent them for <hi>laces</hi> and <hi>rubans.</hi> Or at best of all, they sow but <hi>gape-seed,</hi> which, if well husbanded, yeilds them a goodly crop of wonders in their own Country.</p>
               <p n="4">4. EXERCISES commonly learn'd in <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> are <hi>Dancing, Fencing, Riding,</hi> to which some add <hi>Vaulting,</hi> and anciently <hi>Swimming,</hi> (for which reason <hi>Suetonius</hi> takes notice of it as a strange thing, that <hi>C. Caligula,</hi> so good at other
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56954:104"/>
exercises, could not swim: He observes that <hi>Augustus</hi> instructed himself his grand-children to write and <hi>swim;</hi> Swimming also was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly taught at <hi>Athens) Music,</hi> and <hi>Designing.</hi> And these, I conceive, might as well, if not better, be learned in our own Country; were it not either for the sloth or opiniatrety of our Nation. The use of <hi>dancing</hi> and <hi>fencing</hi> is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, if not too much, known; <hi>riding</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him master of the noblest and usefullest of all Beasts; <hi>Vaulting</hi> makes the body active, but else is not of so great use as <hi>wrestling</hi> were, if in fashion; or <hi>swimming;</hi> which is both more healthful, and many times proves to be of great consequence and necessity. <hi>Music</hi> I advise not; since to acquire any considerable perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in it, takes up too much time; and to understand little of it, is neither graceful, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, nor durable. To thrum a <hi>Guitar</hi> to 2 or 3 <hi>Italian</hi> Ballad tunes, may be agreeable for once, but often practised is ridiculous. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides I do not remember to have seen any <hi>Gentleman,</hi> tho very diligent and curious abroad, to qualify himself with that skill, but when he came to any maturity, he wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it. <hi>Designing</hi> I advise to, but only as a <hi>parergon,</hi> not an emploiment. And the small <hi>Mathematics</hi> Strangers learn in <hi>France</hi> serve to little, besides getting mony to the Teacher.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rules</hi> in Travelling. 1. Be very <hi>careful with what company</hi> you associate upon the way in pension, lodgings, &amp;c. But make no such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity (except you have of a long time tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the person) as not to leave your self liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to come off when you please. <hi>Neither</hi> be ready to <hi>make</hi> or <hi>accept assignations</hi> of meetings,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56954:105"/>
at Taverns, &amp;c. Especially be not the first motioner. Much time is lost, ill acquaintance got, mony spent, and many mishaps come by it. Besides they beget and draw in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the most idle alwaies contriving to twist in another meeting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Suspect</hi> all <hi>extraordinary</hi> and groundless <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility</hi> of foreigners, as a design upon your purse; and what mony you lend upon the way to Strangers, count it given, not lent. Nor ever declare what mony or Jewels you have (of which notwithstanding you ought to have a reserve, not to be touched but upon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary occasions:) but alwaies make your self poorer then you are.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Make even</hi> with your host for pension, and all other demands, <hi>at the end of every month,</hi> and take his hand to an acquittance; for by that means you hinder all after-reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and they are wont, at your leaving them, to pick some quarrel, or seek some pretence upon you to get more of your mony. And so upon a journy, when you are not at an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, reckon with your Host after supper. And where you never mean to return, extend your liberality at your first coming, or occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally as you have need of them, and defer it not till your departure.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Injuries from Strangers,</hi> especially in their own Country, <hi>are easily,</hi> safely, and discreetly, <hi>put up;</hi> but never safely revenged, where they have more friends, and power, then your self. Especially <hi>beware</hi> of intrigues with Women: infinite quarrels and Tragedies have begun there.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>For health,</hi> without which you can do
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56954:105"/>
nothing. When you begin (especially a long Journy) for three or four of the first daies, or meals at least, <hi>abate a third of your ordinary eating,</hi> the like do also at your arrival to rest, tilll your body be somewhat accustomed to the alteration. In travelling, especially in hot weather, <hi>drink</hi> as little as you can; especially by the way, for that increaseth your thirst, heateth, and disposeth you to a feaver. Mix water with wine, but water alone to one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to thirst, makes him more thirsty.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you find your self indisposed, of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verish, <hi>throw</hi> in a glister, miss a meal or two, cover your self well in bed, that your body may transpire or sweat, or else let blood. But if it seems by your wearines, unquietnes, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed sleep, high pulse, pain, &amp;c. that it tends to a real sicknes, <hi>call the Physician betimes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Have with you a little <hi>Venice-treacle,</hi> or some such <hi>Antidote;</hi> that if you eat any bad meat or drink, go to bed presently after sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or find any thing heavy on your stomack, or be tired with a long, wet, or tedious Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, by taking a little of it, you may restore your self. <hi>Lucatellos</hi> balsom also (if well made) serves against ulcers, wounds, aches, galls, brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by falls, and like accidents.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If your occasions require you to voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in <hi>hot weather,</hi> be <hi>very careful</hi> to preserve your <hi>head</hi> from the heat of the Sun; be very abstemious in your diet, and take the best care you can, your body be open. Accidental heat also is best expelled by transpiration.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Drink not</hi> before you eat, for that quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth appetite; nor at any time without eating, especially no mornings drinks, and beware of

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of prudent chusing a calling, or state of life.</head>
               <p>UPON the discreet <hi>choice of our calling,</hi> or state of life, depends our whole content and felicity: for if we chuse that which is <hi>agreable to our inclinations and abilities,</hi> both of body and mind, we work cheerfully, our life is pleasant, and we are constant to our purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. But if, capable of better, we chuse <hi>a worse and lower,</hi> we espouse a continual vexation: if we aime at what is <hi>above our capacity,</hi> we des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond and despaire. Players fit their parts to their persons; and let us exercise our selves in what we are most fit for. And if necessity force us against our inclinations, let us use diligence to <hi>comply with it</hi> as hansomely as is possible: and at least avoid vice, rather then pursue things which are not given us.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:56954:106"/>
2. IN all our actions, the principal guide we have is <hi>the End;</hi> as in travelling the place whither we are to go directs the way. And since we have, by the law and condition of our Creation, one principle <hi>(reason)</hi> in us, which doth, or may and ought uniformely to produce all our operations, we may also have them all directed to the same scope and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We are indeed composed of body and soul; and the body is guided by sense; but the soul (the better part) doth, or ought to govern the body, and it self be governed by reason illustrated in Christians by Gods holy Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THEY who aime at nothing but <hi>satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their sense,</hi> are such as either, 1. <hi>never look before them,</hi> but live <hi>in diem,</hi> without care or prudence, passing their time in mirth and jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, without design or consideration, except to contrive that to morrow may be as this day; or to escape some present pressure and difficulty which interrupts their delights. Or 2. do indeed advise and propose an end, but such a <hi>one as</hi> is either <hi>not obtainable;</hi> or if ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, <hi>not satisfactory,</hi> universal, or durable. Such are <hi>pleasures, riches,</hi> and <hi>honours.</hi> Any, or all, of which to be made the principal and ultimate <hi>end</hi> of our actions, is great folly and madnes. For neither will they avail us in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and the calamitous parts of our life; whereto also they often engage us; and, in the prosperous, they are not in our power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them when we please; nor keep them when we have them; nor do they satisfy us, if we keep them. They grow tedious and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densom, subject us to cares, sorrows, envy,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56954:107"/>
and dangers: and there is somewhat <hi>better,</hi> which is not liable to these exceptions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. BEASTS do not deliberate, but work out of <hi>instinct</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> all of one kind the same way; (wherein they may be somewhat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, but not changed) <hi>without any general end</hi> or intention of their living or acting; tho they have some little particular ends of some of their actions. But <hi>deliberation</hi> is a considerate weighing of all reasons <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> such an end, and the means to obtain it. <hi>i. e.</hi> how a man shall employ those powers and faculties, which God hath given him, either by nature or his own acquisition, to that purpose, for which God hath given them. For there is <hi>one certain end,</hi> which all men may, and ought to propose as most agreeable and proper for their nature and condition.</p>
               <p n="5">5. THIS <hi>intention, which will</hi> sustain a man in all estates and conditions, <hi>which will</hi> have an influence upon his whole life and actions, <hi>which</hi> is a rock, whereon he may safely build in all conditions and accidents, is: <hi>To do as much good as he can,</hi> both to himself, and others. Which the holy Scripture calls <hi>glorifying God</hi> (a phrase demonstrating the reason why this is the universall end of our Nature) because that God created us all; and gave us our being and all that we have; and this not for our own sakes, for no rational and intelligent work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth so, but for his own sake: who is glorified when <hi>his works answer his intention.</hi> He being also the <hi>universal good</hi> of all creatures,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56954:107"/>
what ever good we do, is a corresponding to, and as it were an assisting, him; a propagation of his interest, and consequently a fulfilling of that end for which he made us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. THIS is performed severall waies, as 1. by <hi>serving him in his own house,</hi> being members of his family, <hi>i. e.</hi> Officers in his Church, or Ecclesiastical persons, whether active or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative. 2. By <hi>serving him in the Common-wealth,</hi> in actions of charity: and that, either as Magistrates, or private persons. In both which good is to be done by <hi>example, advice, counsel, commanding, governing, rewarding, punishing, liberality, assistance of</hi> the weak and poor against oppression, &amp;c. In all which the <hi>Magistrate</hi> hath greater opportunity and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to do good, then private persons. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these good actions also cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>reputation;</hi> and <hi>riches,</hi> if with due moderation and justice, <hi>to this purpose desired</hi> and employed, are very good. For, these being the measure of all things in the commerce and conversation of mankinde, tis impossible for him that deals amongst men, to be without them, and for him who is in an active life, and to do good, to be without a considerable proportion of them. And his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> (I do not say popularity, but the good opinion of wise and virtuous persons) every one is bound to preserve, and <hi>to provide thimgs honest in the sight of men also.</hi> So much <hi>pleasure</hi> also is to be allowed as is necessary to keep up the body in health and cheerful vigor; which the wise Creator also hath appointed, in that he hath joyned pleasure to natural actions.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:56954:108"/>
7. IN <hi>chusing a calling</hi> therefore (the fitnes whereof is only in order to our glorifying God, <hi>i. e.</hi> our own Salvation) consider</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>advantages</hi> or disadvantages to our end, or its contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>temtations</hi> we are likely to undergo and meet with.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What <hi>strength,</hi> assistance, or hopes we have to overcome them.</p>
               <p>But because it is not possible to judg of these but by <hi>experience,</hi> which the <hi>Deliberant</hi> is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed not to have, but in some lesser measure; it is therefore necessary for him, to ask advice first of God, then of wise, upright, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced persons. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. Those who have an <hi>excellent faculty,</hi> or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, to one thing above others, seem to be by <hi>God</hi> called to that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Those, who are by their Parents, or own choice, <hi>educated in one thing</hi> particularly, and find it agreeable to them, may safely acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esce, and be persuaded, that calling is from God; as may also those, who have as it were an <hi>hereditary calling,</hi> being born to riches, and honors, may safely acquiesce in it, I say, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they can overcome those temtations of offending God, which do usually accompany it. As all callings have some, and some very many more, and greater than <hi>others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Those, who upon any rational grounds embrace such a calling, wherein they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded they <hi>can serve God,</hi> and live charitably, and do good to their neighbors, may safely conclude that they are called by the ordinary providence of God; who is also the giver of reason to assist and govern us in those things,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56954:108"/>
which fall under its cognisance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some, also, God Almighty calleth <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily</hi> by his Prophets, Ministers, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inspirations, exciting to somewhat extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, either in spiritual, or secular emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Concerning</hi> whom we can give no rules.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Many men are <hi>not capable to chuse for themselves,</hi> being of weak judgments, unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, biassed with some vice or irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: these are to submit to the counsel of their friends; and the most disinteressed, and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est a kin, are the <hi>likeliest</hi> to give best counsel.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is in vain for him to ask advice that is <hi>not indifferent</hi> to all, or most of them; at least so much as to be without prejudice, or to refuse any proposed, and not to love or hate any so much, but to be ready to change his passions upon the information of better judgments. <hi>Unindifferent</hi> are those who are <hi>preingaged.</hi> As for married persons, it is in vain to consult about single life. For then, they can only deliberate how to glorify God in a married estate. And if an estate be <hi>ill chosen,</hi> but irremediably, accuse not God Almighty for the ill choice, but seek to amend it by more virtuous and pious living.</p>
               <p n="8">8. GOING to chuse, therefore, <hi>place your self as much as is possible in equilibrio;</hi> and resolve to chuse the best as near as your own discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (the assistance of Gods spirit implored) and the advice of friends, shall suggest unto you, <hi>The best,</hi> I say <hi>not simply,</hi> but the <hi>best for you;</hi> considering your parts, inclinations, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily health, and strength, exterior advantages, and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:56954:109"/>
And 1. consider <hi>that,</hi> tho no man is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged under guilt of sin to undertake the <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely best</hi> calling or estate; and that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath not so made man for eternals, that he hath no care for temporals; yet in <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and if he have a design of attaining Christian perfection, he ought to make choice of that which he conceives the better.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That</hi> as every man is to give an account of the calling <hi>wherein he is,</hi> and not of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so a man is rewarded that lives and <hi>doth better</hi> in a <hi>less perfect state,</hi> then he that doth <hi>less well</hi> in a <hi>more perfect;</hi> yet a more perfect state is to be preferr'd, which affords more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of doing well, or better.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That</hi> tho there is no lawful estate, wherein <hi>heroical</hi> virtues may not be exercised; yet these are much more easily and frequently practised in some then others.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That</hi> since contraries are so mingled in all our affairs; that <hi>nothing</hi> is <hi>so good,</hi> that it hath <hi>not some inconveniences</hi> joined with it; nor any so probable as that somewhat may not be said to the contrary; you are not to defer your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, till all difficulties be cleared, and you be able to answer all things to the contrary; but it sufficeth to embrace that which is most probable.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That,</hi> if your <hi>election</hi> be thus made, <hi>i. e.</hi> with indifferency, unpassionatenes, and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, seek not to change, but settle your self quietly in it: and make account that whatever you chuse, you <hi>will</hi> sometime or other <hi>repent of it, i. e.</hi> when you find the unexpected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences and hardships of your own, and the seeming ease and conveniences of another.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56954:109"/>
The sincerity of your choice needs not be doubted of, <hi>if you</hi> chuse purely for the love of God; <hi>if you</hi> would have advised your friend to the same course of life; and <hi>if you</hi> would be content, when God shall call you, to be <hi>found so doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. AN old man in <hi>Vitis</hi> P. P. being demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of one, what he should do, answered; our Works are not all of the same sort. <hi>Abraham</hi> was hospitable, God was with him. <hi>David</hi> was humble, God was with him, &amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what you find your Soul inclined unto, so as it be according to Godlines, that do. It is true that one calling hath more opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of glorifying God, and of glorifying him more, <hi>i. e.</hi> with nobler and sublimer actions. All men are not <hi>alike capable of those heights;</hi> and by him, who after due consideration, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conjectures that he shall do very well in an <hi>active,</hi> and but meanly in a <hi>contemplative,</hi> life, here the active doubtless is to be preferred.</p>
               <p n="10">10. IF you have made choice of an estate <hi>less advantageous,</hi> which you may change, be sure to <hi>advise well</hi> before you do so; for many times wearines &amp; inconstancy advise a quitting of that, wherein it is really better for you to continue.</p>
               <p n="11">11. THO there be no state, but may be <hi>more or less dangerous,</hi> or convenient for one then another; as where God gives greater strength and plentifuller grace there is less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from temtations; yet those states seem to be in themselves best, <hi>which</hi> are not subject to so many temtations; <hi>which</hi> have the fewer
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56954:110"/>
avocaments from Religion; <hi>which</hi> have <hi>more</hi> incentives to, and occasions for, piety; <hi>more</hi> good examples, <hi>more</hi> leisure for devotion, <hi>more</hi> severity towards our selves, <hi>more,</hi> and <hi>more he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical</hi> acts of virtues, <hi>which</hi> approach nearest to the life of our Lord, and <hi>which</hi> shew most gratitude towards Almighty God.</p>
               <p n="12">12. THO God supplieth <hi>grace sufficient</hi> to every one for his estate, and he that fails of his duty doth it by his own default; yet he, who <hi>casts himself</hi> into temtations, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise himself to be assisted by God. <hi>S. Paul</hi> adviseth younger Women <hi>i. e.</hi> such as will put themselves in frequent dangers or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of not living continently, rather to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Temtations</hi> are from company, health, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily strength, wealth, bad inclinations, as to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, covetousnes, opiniatrety, desire of liberty; opportunity of time, place, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="13">13. FROM the consideration of which, and such like, these <hi>rules</hi> may be taken notice of,</p>
               <p>A <hi>good natur'd</hi> facil man is not fit for such an emploiment, wherein he must necessarily converse frequently with evil persons.</p>
               <p>A <hi>melancholic</hi> person is not fit to undertake a profession of much study or solitarines.</p>
               <p>A <hi>timorous</hi> spirit is not fit for Magistracy.</p>
               <p>A <hi>covetous</hi> person is not to be a Merchant, or Banquier.</p>
               <p>A man of <hi>bodily strength and choler</hi> will not be a good Officer in War.</p>
               <p>The <hi>sleepy and drowsy</hi> are best employed in a calling, wherein is much bodily activeness.</p>
               <p>A <hi>rash</hi> man not to be entrusted with a great affair, especially in War.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:56954:110"/>
14. LET no man easily perswade himself; that, <hi>what ever his calling be, his thoughts will be different from the rest of mankind,</hi> that is <hi>in that calling;</hi> for all men are alike; have the same principles of thinking and acting, and the same way of deducing from, and acting by, them. Particularly let no man think; that <hi>Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will change him, to the better especially:</hi> look at his actions and conversation in his <hi>private life;</hi> such will he be also in his <hi>Authority.</hi> And therefore let him not upon such confidences ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily take upon him a calling, in which he sees in general great inconveniencies or dangers, to the preserving of his virtue, or innocence.</p>
               <p n="15">15. IF <hi>you be consulted</hi> concerning a person, either very inconstant, passionate, or vitions, give not your advice; it is in vain: for such will do only what shall please themselves.</p>
               <p>Never advise any one to a calling, which is much against his will, or inclination.</p>

I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with <hi>Civility,</hi> as being the first to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and practised; and tho many rules of it seem plain and obvious, such as are fit to be insinuated into the Practise of Children; yet are they not to be neglected, but to be neal'd into <hi>youth,</hi> that they may not through defect of them, miscarry in their <hi>age,</hi> as many great persons have done, who trusting to their <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> and <hi>severe virtue,</hi> have bin ruin'd for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of <hi>compliance</hi> and <hi>civility.</hi> For tho <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents</hi> are greater poysons and presenter death, yet more men are destroied by their <hi>irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in eating and drinking. And <hi>small wounds,</hi> if many, are mortal. To be <hi>couragious, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,</hi> and <hi>just</hi> are indeed much greater and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56954:111"/>
nobler then to be of an <hi>agreeable conversation:</hi> yet is this as useful, for it is in continual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, the other rarely and upon occasion: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides other virtues have need of somewhat to maintain and exercise them. <hi>Justice</hi> will have <hi>power, liberality, wealth,</hi> &amp;c. but this is set up with no other stock then a <hi>few pleasant looks, good words,</hi> and <hi>not-evil actions.</hi> All men are in some sort <hi>disparata;</hi> and even these, who are under the relations of superiority and inferio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet, those obligations being satisfied, as to all other matters, account themselves as <hi>equals.</hi> And tho laws <hi>punish not</hi> the resty and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, yet are they <hi>chastised</hi> by the loss of that good-will and freindlines which good-behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our gains; most men having greater aversenes to the <hi>incompliant</hi> then the <hi>vitious.</hi> Wherefore it is necessary for every one, that would bring his <hi>purposes to effect,</hi> (which cannot be done without making use of other mens abilities; and the greater the design, the more <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are needful; and those Instruments also not inanimate or necessitable, but spontaneous and free) to <hi>master the wills</hi> and powers of those he makes use of; to make them, I say, to work cheerfully and readily for him; which is by <hi>Civility</hi> to <hi>let</hi> or <hi>insinuate</hi> himself into their good liking, and <hi>voluntary assistance.</hi> For he who cares not to live void of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, renders himself offensive and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto others; consequently they comply not with him; they act for him, if at all, by force either of reward or punishment, and therefore no more, nor otherwise, then they are constrained. Thus, for want of <hi>civil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress,</hi> many <hi>men of parts</hi> and virtue become
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56954:112"/>
                  <hi>useless</hi> in their generation; but others by their surly and uncompliant humor, grow distastful in conversation, fall into contemt, whence follow affronts and quarrels. Some also are forc'd upon low and <hi>mean company,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bring a dishonor, not upon their <hi>persons</hi> only, but their <hi>Family</hi> and Parents (who are look'd upon, as not willing or able to give them decent Education) and their <hi>Country</hi> also, if they happen amongst Strangers, who are ready to censure hardly of that Nation, whose Gentry are so little civiliz'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. AGAIN, where there is <hi>much company,</hi> as in Cities, &amp;c. there is also great <hi>variety of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors</hi> and dispositions; and a greater care of <hi>wary conversation;</hi> as also where are persons of greater and <hi>more piercing spirits,</hi> or curiouser observers, as in <hi>Courts,</hi> or amongst <hi>Forreigners,</hi> who take particular notice of many things which continual practise makes us pass over. He who thinks to live contentedly or peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in these places without mortifying his own humor, and deposing his natural inclinations, is of a shallow capacity, or an evil nature. <hi>i. e.</hi> He is either of a savage, fierce, insolent dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; or of a stupid slothfulnes. Both of them fitter company for Beasts then Men, and for Deserts then Cities.</p>
               <p n="3">3. WHEREFORE, as <hi>Justice</hi> bridleth our coveteousnes, and <hi>constancy</hi> our natural timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnes, so doth <hi>civility</hi> our haughtines and presumtion: and <hi>as a good Christian,</hi> for the glory of God, <hi>mortifies</hi> all his own passions and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and <hi>puts on</hi> those, which are for his
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56954:112"/>
purpose, and according to his intention: Such I mean, as Religion and reason suggest: And as a <hi>good Courtier,</hi> for his interest <hi>complies</hi> with every one; alwaies <hi>gay,</hi> cheerful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisant, without any humor of his own, only borrowing that of the company. So in like maner, every <hi>civil person</hi> doth the same, so far at least as to avoid all offending those with whom he converseth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. FOR <hi>Civility</hi> consists in these things, 1. In <hi>not expressing</hi> by actions, or speeches <hi>any injury, disesteem, offence, or undervaluing</hi> of any other. 2. In <hi>being ready to do all good offices</hi> and <hi>ordinary kindness</hi> for another. And 3ly in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no injuries</hi> or <hi>offences</hi> from others. <hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>not resenting</hi> every word or action, which may (perhaps rationally) be interpreted to be <hi>disesteem</hi> or undervaluing. Indeed our <hi>reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is onely pretended in this case, (were it really in danger) yet is not of such consequence many times, as peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but we are ordinarily unjust and partial Judges of our own concerns, never looking upon our selves but with love and value. But however our patience is certainly a rewarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble virtue (but whether the correction of a misdoer will reuscire well, is a difficult que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion) and is that so much recommended by our Lord, of forgiving trespasers against us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. CIVILITY <hi>is not,</hi> therefore, <hi>punctuality of behaviour:</hi> I mean that which consists in certain <hi>modish</hi> and particular <hi>ceremonies</hi> and fashions, in clothes, gesture, mine, speech, or the like; <hi>is not</hi> using such discourses, words,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56954:113"/>
phrases, studies, opinions, games, &amp;c. as are in <hi>fashion</hi> in the <hi>Court;</hi> with Gallants, Ladies, &amp;c. This is a constrain'd <hi>formality,</hi> not <hi>civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> a complying with the <hi>times,</hi> not with <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi> and varieth with the age or season, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently according to the fancy of mechanic persons, in their several professions: whereas the <hi>rules of Civility,</hi> founded upon Prudence and Charity, are to perpetuity <hi>unchangeable.</hi> I speak not here of such <hi>ceremonies</hi> as are by <hi>duty</hi> required towards our superiors, either in gesture, speech, or other address. Those are not in our disposing to omit or alter; <hi>custom</hi> our Great Master hath imposed them, and that rationally, for the ease of the Magistrate, and to make his commands current, and we ought to obey without dispute or pleading. Nor of such as are used generally in conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof also I advise every one to be rather liberal and give some of his own, then retrench any of what is due. But of such as by particular persons (who either would seem modish and perfectly civil, or would hide their poverty of understanding and discretion under the vail and varnish of <hi>mode)</hi> studied and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Whereby themselves think to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate into the favor of those with whom they converse; but those imagine themselves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed as weak and easy, that are to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with such trifles; and (as some women) are thought to be taken with rubans and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies more then real decency.</p>
               <p n="6">6. COMPLIMENTS also are another thing, serve to a contrary end, and proceed from a different cause. <hi>Civility</hi> from <hi>sincerity</hi> and <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:56954:113"/>
these from <hi>duplicity,</hi> and <hi>deceit.</hi> That <hi>makes</hi> friends, these <hi>unmake</hi> and hinder them; that <hi>distinguisheth</hi> one man from another, these <hi>involve</hi> all in <hi>an equal adulation.</hi> They consist in <hi>prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> immoderately, and <hi>pretending</hi> greater love and friendship then either is deserved by, or intended to, him, to whom they are offered. He that useth them, beleiveth not himself, nor would have his Auditor believe his <hi>expressions;</hi> but I know not what greatness of affection: he is alwaies <hi>offering</hi> and promising, never <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming;</hi> asking pardon where there is no offence or necessity, but when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God and reason, he will dye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then demand it. These are <hi>imaginary</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; <hi>notional,</hi> impertinent, humiliations; a <hi>solemn non-sense;</hi> an abusing of language, and putting together many good words to signify nothing. The use of this traiterous discourse (if any be) is to <hi>hide a mans-self</hi> (as Juglers and Mountebanks) in a cloud of good words, that the Auditor may not discover more of him then himself pleaseth. Or as Trades-men keep you still in talk, lest you should too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly examine the wares they would put upon you. <hi>Officious lies</hi> they are, licensed by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, and like the unproportionable garments, are faults of the age. Neither is <hi>flattery; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> to, or accompanying, in <hi>vice,</hi> or <hi>error; consenting</hi> to any thing <hi>prejudicial</hi> to a third person; a <hi>permitting</hi> to offend, or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>sinning,</hi> or the like; any part of <hi>Civility.</hi> For this consists not but with <hi>severe Justice,</hi> real <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>solid Discretion.</hi>

7. AND therefore <hi>it,</hi> as all other virtues, <hi>requires</hi> an <hi>early initiation,</hi> and continual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise to arrive at a perfect habit of it. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns also Parents and Educators to see that the educated converse as much as may be, with his <hi>equals</hi> or superiors; not with servants or mean persons, lest he put on their manners, and playing <hi>Rex</hi> amongst them, he become apt to undervalue all others, and so become insolent. It behoves them also to give him <hi>no evil example</hi> by themselves, or others; but propose such Precedents, as they desire the young Man should copy. In <hi>France,</hi> Fathers are wont to carry their Children, when youths, with them to visit persons of Quality, to shew them how such demean themselves, and to procure them a convenient boldnes. Mothers also in <hi>Italy</hi> teach their little Children pieces of Dialogues or Plaies by heart; which they render and recite in their presence, and are taught by them graceful address in saluting, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. they also send their Children frequently in errands, and visits to their kindred or neighbors; teaching them what to say, what titles to give, what answers to make to the demands most likely to be asked, somewhat also to furnish discourse, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="8">8. THE <hi>young Man</hi> himself also, ought, as he grows in age, <hi>to observe</hi> the actions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, especially of his <hi>equals,</hi> and of such as are most reputed for civility; and <hi>to note</hi> what becomes or misbecomes them. Also, what is practised by <hi>most,</hi> by <hi>persons of higher quality</hi> and by persons <hi>of maturity</hi> and <hi>judgement.</hi> He must also <hi>watch over himself</hi> severely, and once a day,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56954:114"/>
at least, call himself to acount of his speeches and actions. And also <hi>procure some friend</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, advise, and admonish him of what is well, what ill, what might be better, done, or omitted. Lastly <hi>observe</hi> such rules as these that follow, some of which are framed for youth, others for such as are growing up, or arrived to some discretion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Do nothing which may justly <hi>scandalize virtuous persons;</hi> chiefly by any <hi>neglect of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> as by undecent behavior in Gods house, as seeking your ease, abandoning your self to laziness and lolling, gazing about you, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent changing postures, covering your face or head. Regulate therefore your self by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the best and most devout in the place you live. <hi>Use not</hi> commonly or unnecessarily <hi>the name of God,</hi> or <hi>of the Devil;</hi> not passages of <hi>holy Scripture;</hi> not mocking or profaning <hi>holy persons, things</hi> or <hi>actions:</hi> not only because these things are <hi>sinful,</hi> but <hi>undecent</hi> also; and practised only by persons of ill behavior, or mean condition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do nothing that may <hi>offend anothers sense</hi> or <hi>imagination.</hi> To strike or pinch a man, is a clowns salutation. No carion, or excrement, is to be shewed to your companion, for you know not how squeamish he is. <hi>Approach not</hi> your mouth so near in discoursing, as to offend or bedew any one with your breath, for all mens breaths are offensive. Be <hi>not nasty</hi> in your clothes, or about your body, in much sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (except in time of War or action) bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, biting, or cutting your nails, rubbing
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56954:115"/>
your teeth, picking your nose, or ears, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any parts of your body which are not usually uncovered, nor those more then needs. <hi>Sing not</hi> to your self, nor drum with your feet or fingers in company, as melancholic men do. <hi>Grind</hi> not, nor <hi>gnash</hi> your teeth, nor <hi>scrape</hi> or make any sound to offend or interrupt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not so much as lowd speaking, except where necessity. <hi>Spit, sneez, cough,</hi> &amp;c. from the company, and not loud, for decencies sake.</p>
               <p n="3">3. LET your <hi>look</hi> be <hi>pleasant,</hi> composed, modest, confident. <hi>Frowning</hi> is apprehended to be a sign of a <hi>cruel</hi> disposition, as is noted of <hi>Caracalla.</hi> When you discourse with any person, <hi>gaze not</hi> upon him, as if you were tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his picture. <hi>Nor fix your eyes</hi> constantly on any one object; for that betokens impudency, or at best, amazedness, or contemplation, as <hi>staring</hi> doth folly. <hi>Wandring</hi> and <hi>inconstant</hi> looks express madness, or unsetled thoughts; <hi>wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (if not a natural infirmity) is the action of light-headed persons, as winking with one eye (like Shooters) is of maliciousness and evil nature. A <hi>sharp</hi> and <hi>fierce look,</hi> is as one that is angry. To <hi>bite your lip</hi> is used in threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to thrust out the tongue, is scurrilous. To <hi>sink the head</hi> into the shoulders, is laziness; the head erect and backward, is interpreted pride and arrogance, as letting it fall on either side, hypocrisy. To go with <hi>folded arms,</hi> is sloth or melancholy; and in this, it is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral suggestion to keep the breast warm, and defend it from hypochondriac pain; to set them a kembow is arrogance, and to <hi>hang them</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:56954:115"/>
                  <hi>down,</hi> folly and lazines: to keep your hands in your pockets, or covered with your cloak, is a neglect of the company.</p>
               <p>A <hi>slow pace</hi> is proper to delicate and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate persons, an hasty one to mad men; strutting is affectation, wadling is for the sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and lazy, and in measure to dancers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Speak not through the nose,</hi> nor with any affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or unhansom gesture, wrying the mouth, swelling the cheeks, lisping, &amp;c. If you have not a pleasing pronunciation, recompense it with good matter; and when speaking, cough not, nor use any interruption, for so do <hi>lyers</hi> when they <hi>invent</hi> what to say. A little <hi>laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is permitted, moderate <hi>smiling</hi> commended.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THERE is a certain <hi>mine</hi> and <hi>motion of the body,</hi> and its parts, both in acting and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is very graceful and pleasing. <hi>Greg. Nazianz.</hi> foretold what a one <hi>Julian</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called the <hi>Apostate)</hi> would prove, when he saw his hasty, discomposed, and unseemly gestures. <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> discarded a Clerk, because of an undecent motion of his head, which he said went like a flail. On the contrary <hi>Cn. Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius,</hi> saith <hi>Tully, ad omnia summa natus habebat in voce splendorem, &amp; in motu summam dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> This consists; 1. in the <hi>proportion and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> betwixt every mans person and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as for a young man to be active and sprightly, not mimical and restless: a grave man slow and deliberate, not dull and slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish. 2. In <hi>confidence,</hi> opposed to sheepish bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes; when one knows not how to look, speak, or move, sor fear of doing amiss; but alwaies blusheth, and is not able to support
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56954:116"/>
an harsh word, a chiding, an angry look, without being altered. 3. In <hi>avoiding all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</hi> and singularity; for whatever is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Nature is best, and what contrary to it, alwaies distastful, and betraies vanity and indiscretion, that knows not to imitate the best. <hi>Nothing</hi> is <hi>graceful but</hi> what is <hi>our own.</hi> And therefore every one strives to work easily and freely, and with a seeming negligence, for such seems to proceed either from Nature, or an habit. But constrainedness undervalueth an action; as doth also seeming to do all with design and study. Yet, affected negligence is worst of all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. IN <hi>eating,</hi> at <hi>meals,</hi> the company is <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,</hi> if you eat with hands dirty, or unwash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after you have made water, or done any offensive action. If you hover over the plate or table, as an Hawk over her prey; if you handle others meat, be delicate, or take the best, or most, or formost, to your self. As the <hi>Indian,</hi> that seeing at the other end a dish that pleased him, leaped upon the table to fetch it. If you feed with both hands for fear of loosing time, or keep your knife alwaies in your hand, or with the point upward: if you dip your fingers, or any thing you have tasted, in the sawce, or make a noise in eating; cut or put into your mouth great morsels, or lick your fingers, or not wipe your mouth or spoon after eating.</p>
               <p>It is against health to <hi>swallow your meat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed,</hi> or greedily, or much, or much variety, or delicacies: and against civility to eat after others, to throw your bones or offal upon the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56954:116"/>
floor, to gnaw your bones, to handle dogs, &amp;c. at the table, to observe what and how o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eat, to dispraise or praise immoderately the meat, or smell to it; for if you suspect it let it alone, lest you offend others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Present not to</hi> others <hi>what your self have tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Drink not, nor talk with your mouth full, or unwiped, or glass full; nor put the cup too far into your mouth as Children do; nor drink greedily, or so long that you are forced (as Horses) to breath in your draught; nor blow into any ones cup, or upon his victuals, tosts, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Talk not at table any ungrateful or impertinent discourse,</hi> nor be angry with your servants, nor do any thing which may interrupt the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of the company. It is questioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be civil to talk much at meals, because that hindreth the intention of the table, and it is not easy to avoid all offensivenes, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in discouse about Divinity; the frequentest table-talk in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>England,</hi> Strangers tax us for drinking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we eat, against health; drinking many in the same cup; and many times the snuffs left by the former; for eating much, much flesh, sitting long at meals; not using forks but fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and the like.</p>
               <p n="6">6. IN <hi>Visitings</hi> is much more <hi>ceremony</hi> and civility observed in some places then others. The <hi>Italians,</hi> and of them the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Neapolitans</hi> are most punctual. The greatest cause hereof is the <hi>avoiding of misinterpretations,</hi> and quarrelling. This hath begotten an <hi>Art of ceremoniousnes,</hi> so full of subtilties and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilios,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56954:117"/>
that it is an emploiment to learn them. And therefore, tho in this <hi>Country</hi> of great <hi>freedom</hi> and little <hi>jealousy,</hi> where persons of quality are neither so apt to give, or take, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, they are <hi>unnecessary,</hi> or also <hi>unfitting;</hi> yet it may be fitting to know how to <hi>entertain</hi> a Stranger; or how we <hi>are entertained</hi> by him, or by any other that expecteth or practiseth this accuratenes of ceremony. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore set down the cheifest of their rules, for the most part out of the Book called <hi>Il Maestro di Camera,</hi> which is on purpose to instruct in those observances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Women</hi> are <hi>not</hi> usually <hi>visited in the morning;</hi> nor <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> or persons of business, on the hour or day of their dispatch or emploiment. Nor persons in the beginning of deep mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and if visited, it is not expected they should use the accustomed ceremonies. Nor sick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons till they can sit up in their beds, and put on their upper garments. Women also have alwaies the <hi>upper hand,</hi> even in their own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and are intreated not to stir out of the Chamber of entertainment.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>better to give too much honor</hi> to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>then too little;</hi> therefore better to carry himself as inferior to his equals, and equal to such as are not much inferiors. Inferiors also, if of parts, are to be better treated, for <hi>parts are equal to honors</hi> or wealth. The more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, the more honorably are inferiors, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals treated, (but superiors the less) as to your table, to your bed-chamber, or closet, to your self in bed, dressing, or retired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neerest the wall</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose because the cleanest) is the honorabler
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56954:117"/>
place; in <hi>Italy</hi> the right hand, if two; the middle place, if three, walk together; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause easiliest heard of both.</p>
               <p>To make <hi>signs to one to be covered,</hi> is superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority; so is to <hi>turn the back</hi> first at parting, to <hi>accompany</hi> the departed but a little way; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as your equall you wait upon to the utmost door or gate, the superior to his Coach or Horse.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Visiter ends the visit,</hi> but not in the midst of a discourse; nor is he to stay so long as the visited seems glad to receive him; but if he see his company much desired, he may come the oftner.</p>
               <p>Visits of congratulation and condoleance the sooner the better.</p>
               <p>The <hi>uppermost place of a table</hi> ought not to turn its back upon the greatest part of the room, nor to the door where the meat comes in; it should also have the window before, or at least on one side of, it.</p>
               <p>In making visits few things are observed; but in <hi>receiving visits</hi> many: as, entertaining a superior or equal, he ought to be so clothed as to go abroad; and drawing near to hasten his pace as if he would have gone further to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; to meet a superior also at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the stairs, to accompany him to his Coach. It being a general rule to accompany the departer one degree further then where you receive him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Equals</hi> (tho best received as you desire to be received by them) are commonly received at the top of the stairs; and the Gentlemen meet them at the bottom. It is alwaies obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the visiteds Gentlemen attend one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree at least further then the Patron.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:56954:118"/>
                  <hi>Inferiors</hi> are received according to their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, some in the <hi>Anti-camera,</hi> some three, some two, or one Chamber off, or at the Chamberdoor, or half the Chamber of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. Only it is better to use too much, then to little, courtesy.</p>
               <p>With <hi>Strangers,</hi> extraordinary civility and freedom may be used; because they come but seldom, stay not long, and have no emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with persons of your own Country. An eminent person not knowing how to entertain a Stranger, feigned indisposition, and received him in bed.</p>
               <p>If <hi>two</hi> send <hi>messages to</hi> have Audience of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment <hi>at the same time; to</hi> the latter the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron commonly answers, that A B. is Lord of himself and time, but that at the same time he expects such a one.</p>
               <p>If any <hi>one come to visit,</hi> whilst his superior is entertaining, ordinarily he is conducted to another room, where he is entertained by the Gentlemen; or if of lower rank, he staies in the <hi>Anti-camera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If an <hi>equal</hi> come to visit, whilst an equall is in the room, the Patron asks leave of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and leaving a Gentleman or two to keep him company goes to receive the new comer.</p>
               <p>To Persons of Quality, <hi>Audience is</hi> given with the <hi>Portiere</hi> (or hanging that covereth the door on the outside) down; public Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with it open; yet if then a Person of quality come, it is also let down. Likewise at their entrance and departure <hi>the whole door</hi> must be opened (all their doors being made dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:) it being an action of great superiority to give but half a door.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:56954:118"/>
                  <hi>Seats</hi> also ought to be set ready before the visitants enter; and chairs with arms are more honourable then those with backs only: and these then stools. The visitants or principal seat is to be set in such manner as it may look full upon the door of entrance, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the room; the Patrons with the back towards the door. If many visitants e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, their seats are to be set one besides ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or ordered along the wall which hath the foresaid conditions. If two, their seats are to be set so as to have the door on their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and that on the right hand of the door is the better place.</p>
               <p>The <hi>M. de C.</hi> may deliver a message of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment of a meaner person then the Visitant: but he must be more careful if a message of business, except from an equal, or that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire hast. But all messages from the Prince or Superior are instantly admitted, and no mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage must be whispered to the Patron in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with equals, but spoken aloud.</p>
               <p>If there be many visitants, and one <hi>depart</hi> before the rest, the Patron leaveth the rest and accompanieth the departer. And if whilst he is conducting an equal, another equal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; he entertains the new comer a while with the departer; then recommending him to some of his Gentlemen to conduct him to the place of entertainment, he accompanieth the departer, and then hasts to the other.</p>
               <p>When <hi>visitants</hi> are <hi>ready to depart,</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron maketh a noise with his foot or chair, that the Attendant may understand to lift up the Portiere; but <hi>he ought not to</hi> command him, or to <hi>do any thing which may shew supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority</hi>

               <p>If the visitants stay till it be dark, the <hi>M. di C.</hi> causeth to be lighted and set up in the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens station, a torch of white wax; and in the other Chambers, each two candles of white wax; and in the entertaining room two or more, as shall be necessary, which are to be brought in by the Gentlemen; also two or more in the <hi>Anti-camera</hi> must stand ready to be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be born by the Gentlemen before the visitant when he departeth; who yet are not to turn their backs absolutely upon him. At the Hall door must be ready torches to be carried in like manner before him by the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or Pages if there be any; four at least for an equal, six for a superior, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A Man <hi>meeting his equal,</hi> or not much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, makes his Coach stop; the worthiest stops last, and departs first. A man in coach meeting his equal on foot, lights out of his Coach, and when they part he walks on foot a while after; and then remounts. For an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, he alights not, except he have business with him.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Governor of a Place,</hi> through which his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual is to pass, sends to invite him before he enter his Jurisdiction; and if his invitation is accepted, he sends to meet him 9. or 10. miles, some of his Gentlemen in Coach; and so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as he draweth nearer; when near, the Governor goes to receive him in person; or if he please to honor him, under pretence of taking the Air, he may go abroad that way
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56954:119"/>
he comes, and so receive him as he pleaseth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Do nothing in a company where you design to shew civility, that resembles <hi>superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> nor usurp upon their rights, nor do any thing whereby any of them may think you do not love, prize, or respect them. As do not your own busines, command or chide your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; assume not all the talke to, or of, your self, family, wife, &amp;c. nor tell your dreams, when perhaps your best actions when waking are not worth the reciting; censure not nor contradict the rest; but cede to the major part.</p>
               <p>Desire not the highest place, nor be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom with impertinent debasing your self by refusing to go first, &amp;c. throwing the arms like a fencer, and spending time in being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to do what you desire.</p>
               <p>Some are dainty and nice, that take excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons if not saluted, &amp;c. in due order, mode, &amp;c. hence they become jealous, think themselves affronted, &amp;c. those mens conversation is a slavery; to be with them is to be in <hi>little-ease,</hi> and a man had as good handle <hi>Venice-Glasses.</hi> Let them, I beseech you, enjoy themselves by themselves, their conversation is a rope of sand, and no cement of love and kindnes can ty you to them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. THE beginning and end of <hi>Conversation</hi> with every one, is <hi>Salutation:</hi> nor must you break company, tho with intention to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn speedily, except you first ask their leave. The inferior salutes first out of duty; and so doth the visiter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:56954:120"/>
                  <hi>Modesty</hi> is more graceful then boldnes, <hi>bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> then bashfulnes, <hi>bashfulnes</hi> then impudence. Country people know not how to look, but think they do best when most extravagant.</p>
               <p>Endeavor <hi>not to partake of</hi> other mens <hi>secrets, i. e.</hi> either Letters, Books, Papers, Discourses, &amp;c. if any thing be given to another to read, take it not out of his hand, nor be hasty to see any curiosity <hi>the first;</hi> nor be curious to know what any one is doing or studying, or with whom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whisper not</hi> with any <hi>in company,</hi> for the rest suppose you talk of them; but if you have any private busines, take him aside after you have asked leave, and when none is discoursing: and when you discourse privately, eye no man of the Company.</p>
               <p>When you <hi>walk to and again,</hi> turn your face towards your superior; and if you meet a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior in a narrow way, stop, and press to make him more room, for it is an action of respect.</p>
               <p>Beware of <hi>Sullennes, melancholic,</hi> furious, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; as if you observed and censured what every one spoke or did. Tho silence in a studious person may be tolerated. And if all the Company laugh, do not you act the grave, nor be like a <hi>pump</hi> to yeild only what is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from you.</p>
               <p>Yet to be complaisant is not to eccho to what every one saith, or do whatever any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would have you; to make up a number, and be a cypher in conversation. To comply with all is worse then with none, as much as contemt is below hatred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pride, insolence,</hi> statelines, imperiousnes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grines,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56954:120"/>
are not signs or qualifications of a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> but the scandals of <hi>Conversation,</hi> and proceed from a spirit of presumtion and want of breeding, which conceives it self to be above, better, wiser, then others; and that he alone ought to be the rule, to which others ought to conform: that all others are wandring stars, himself only in the Ecliptic. The greatest <hi>Magnetismes</hi> in the World are <hi>Civility,</hi> conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself to the innocent humors, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, sometimes, of others; readines to do courtesies for all, speaking well of all behind their backs. And 2ly <hi>Affability,</hi> which is not only to be used in common and unconcerning speech, but upon all occasions. A man may deny a request, chide, reprehend, command, &amp;c. <hi>affably,</hi> with good words; nor is there any thing so harsh which may not be inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively represented. Consider, that the meanest person is able to do you both good and harm.</p>
               <p>Esteem the <hi>faults you commit</hi> against others to be <hi>great;</hi> those of others against you to be small.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer no man till he hath spoken,</hi> for those who are impatient to hear, are rash to censure: nor turn your back upon, nor correct, the speaker: depart not before he hath done, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him not by helping him out with what he seems to have forgot. Tell not what comes into your fancy in the midst of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers discourse, nor seem to know what he would say; if you think fitting to interpose, do it not without asking leave; else you hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the discourse to be understood, and make what is said to be misinterpreted; whence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unnecessary arguings, and confused tattles
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56954:121"/>
before the matter can be cleared. <hi>Say not,</hi> I knew this before, but accept what is said as new, and in good part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be not magisterial</hi> in your dictates; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend pertinaciously in ordinary discourse for <hi>your opinion,</hi> nor for a truth of small conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Declare your reasons; if they be not accepted, let them alone; assure your self that you are not obliged to convert the whole World. It is also an uncivil importunity to clash with every thing we dislike, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute every thing we think is false: to forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize upon all the foolery and non-sense we hear. Let us not contrast with the whole World, as if we were, <hi>universal reformers.</hi> In a controversy say not all you can, but what is necessary. Also if what you report is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived, <hi>do not swear it,</hi> nor use any imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon your self, <hi>nor lay wagers,</hi> nor take your self engaged to defend it, or that he, who beleives you not, affronts you. So neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the same things frequently over; if the company harken not to you, let them chuse; suppose it your own fault, who speak not what deserves their attention. If they understand you not, blame your self who either speak not clearly, or accommodate not your self to your Auditory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After</hi> a man hath told a <hi>story</hi> in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, <hi>ask not, what's the matter;</hi> for that shews that you contemned the speaker, and minded not what was spoken; besides you make him your <hi>inferior,</hi> to tell a tale as often as you are pleased to ask it.</p>
               <p>He that <hi>speaketh much, cannot speak all well.</hi> But indeed it is the dwarf-tree that bears the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56954:121"/>
first fruit, and the emtiest that makes the most sound. Besides it is an injury to the rest of the Company, who expect to be heard, every one in his turn. Yet better to speak much then nothing at all, except it be apprehended to be <hi>Discretion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you live in a place where the <hi>Language</hi> is spoken in an <hi>evil Dialect,</hi> do not affect to speak either purely, or badly, but as the best of that Dialect speak. And avoid all big and hard words; remember how the <hi>Lyon</hi> crushed the <hi>Frog,</hi> whom he saw so contemtible, after he had made so great a noise.</p>
               <p>All <hi>obscenity,</hi> whether in matter or words, <hi>proceeds from,</hi> and <hi>creates, evil manners;</hi> and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a Gentleman <hi>contemtible.</hi> But amongst clowns he is most accepted, <hi>i. e.</hi> is the greatest clown, that useth it most. The pains we take to be pleasing ought to be spent only upon things honorable and of good fame. The reason why some words are <hi>immodest,</hi> others signifying the same thing, not, is: because these represent the displeasing object at a distance, through ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>light,</hi> and covered with another <hi>notion;</hi> so that the offensivenes is not that which at first appears to the imagination; (so Toads and Vipers cause not that effect in us when seen a far off.) It appears sometimes under a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor,</hi> or some other translatitious expression; which is a <hi>corrective</hi> to the harshnes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasingnes of the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>same cautions</hi> prescribed in speaking, or greater, are to be observed <hi>in writing;</hi> the neglect of their pens hath ruined very many; and particularly the great Master of Civility, the Author of <hi>Galateo.</hi> For going to present

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Prudence.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE <hi>Prudence</hi> here spoken of, is not that <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the Philosophers; which, that we may live happily, <hi>would</hi> never have us experience sorrow, or trouble; <hi>would</hi> reduce us to speculation, abstinence from emploiment, and a life abstracted from common conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>That</hi> teacheth to menage action, public affairs and negotiation with others; <hi>this</hi> shews how to escape inconveniences, and sufferings, by withdrawing from busines, and living with, and to, our selves only; which that teacheth to avoid by discreetly governing, and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our actions. The Philosopher perswades us to <hi>chuse</hi> the <hi>perfectest, i. e.</hi> the most quiet, innocent, retired, manner of life; this <hi>Prudence</hi> to <hi>live most perfectly, i. e.</hi> with the least incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, or evil consequents, which may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb our happines, <hi>in a common</hi> or active <hi>life.</hi> The one adviseth temperance by <hi>abstaining</hi> from all Banquets, Feasts, &amp;c. this shews how to be <hi>abstemious, tho you come</hi> to them. The one tells us that the way to avoid danger, <hi>v. g.</hi> is never to go to Sea; this, since we are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56954:122"/>
would have us govern our selves, and steer our course in the best manner. Whether of these is better, I now dispute not; but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing a man to have already made choice of an active calling, then <hi>Prudence</hi> is of great force; <hi>to foresee</hi> all consequents, and avoid the bad; <hi>to act</hi> effectually, and the shortest way; <hi>to chuse</hi> the best means; <hi>to menage</hi> crosses and hardships; and to <hi>be content</hi> with what success God shall give.</p>
               <p n="2">2. SIGNS of a wise man are these; he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>hears</hi> then talks; <hi>beleives</hi> not easily: <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> seldom, and then not without great exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; <hi>deliberates</hi> as long as his matter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and when resolved, is constant, and changeth not without solid reason; therefore having deliberated, fears not to repent. He <hi>speaketh</hi> well of all; <hi>defendeth</hi> the fame of the absent; courteous, not flattering; readier to give then ask or receive; <hi>smiles</hi> rather then laughs; is moderately grave; <hi>honoreth</hi> his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors; <hi>attributeth</hi> the glory of good actions to his companions, rather then himself; <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves</hi> his friends, but doth no unworthy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their sake; is ready to <hi>assist</hi> and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure all, even the unknown; yet without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending others; <hi>considereth</hi> both events, that whatever happens, he may be like himself, neither exalted nor dejected; <hi>avoids</hi> anxiety, melancholy, and morosenes; what he doth, tho necessitated, yet doth it not as unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, but makes a virtue of necessity; <hi>is even</hi> in his carriage, true in his words, the same in shew and reality, and beleives so of others when he hath no reason to the contrary; he
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56954:123"/>
                  <hi>admires</hi> none, derides none, envies none, and despiseth none, not the most miserable: he <hi>delights</hi> in the conversation of wise and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons; <hi>profereth</hi> not his counsel, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he understands not well; is <hi>content</hi> with his condition: nor doth any thing through contention, emulation, or revenge, but <hi>strives</hi> to render good alwaies even for evil. He <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth</hi> to know so much, as to be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his own judgment, tho he do it not. <hi>Abi tu &amp; fac suniliter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A FOOL talks <hi>much,</hi> and <hi>little</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; is angry without cause; trusts any one; is restless and still changing place, troubleth himself with what doth not concern him; the more fool he is the more he understands other mens busines, his own the less, and therefore is <hi>alwaies</hi> ready to reprehend and advise, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to obey; he discerns not when <hi>flattered;</hi> but sensible enough to fancy himself <hi>abus'd.</hi> He desires without choice and discretion, and therefore is quickly weary of what he enjoies; he resolves without advice, and therefore sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly changeth, and that without reason. He is apt to refuse what he cannot avoid, desire what he cannot obtain, and repent what he cannot amend; he laments the past, is exalted with the present, and negligent of the future. The first degree of folly is to think himself wise, the second to proclaim it; and therefore he hath an answer ready to every question, and is never better by either counsel or affliction. As amongst wise men he is <hi>wisest</hi> that thinks he knows least, so amongst fools he is the <hi>greatest</hi> that thinks he knows most.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:56954:123"/>
4. PRUDENCE depends upon <hi>experience;</hi> without which no man, of ever so great capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, can any more arrive to be a wise man, then a fruit to maturity, without time. And <hi>experience</hi> is either of <hi>other men,</hi> which we see, read, or hear, or of <hi>our own</hi> affairs. This is the harsher Mistress; and happy is he that can learn of the other, and arrive to perfection, tho in his old age. Hence it is, that most men understand that only wherein they are most practised; as many know what is to be done, but neither how to go about it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor to direct others; such have <hi>much study, little experience.</hi> Many <hi>can advise</hi> well, but themselves <hi>cannot act.</hi> Many can menage a busines if not opposed; and many better if opposed: as many are not able to beat or chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, tho they know the prices; and many ignorant of the prices, yet bargain cunningly. For <hi>the rules of busines are the same,</hi> tho the subjects are divers; conversing much makes a man bold and confident; and engaging in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines fits for more busines; And therefore it is no wonder that many <hi>Citizens</hi> (Merchants es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially) prove wise-men, (and in the late Wars also excellent Soldiers) because much practised to treating, and negotiation. The like is also of <hi>Lawyers.</hi> But many of both these Professions, thereby accustomed to value small gains, contract such a <hi>narrownes of spirit,</hi> and tincture of interest, that it scarce ever leaves them. Nor do I perceive <hi>Lawyers</hi> fitter for state emploiment then <hi>Merchants;</hi> they having both particular Trades, and differing, as to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Government, no otherwise then an <hi>East India,</hi> or an <hi>Hamborough,</hi> Merchant, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56954:124"/>
to traffick. For tho the professing of Law may seem to intitle to somewhat more knowledge in governing (of which Laws are the rule) yet in effect it doth not; because their practise and study is about just and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just; about <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum;</hi> the petit iuterests and controversies of particular persons; not the Government of a Prince over his people; or his negotiations with his Neighbors; which depend upon different principles, seldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered by those who deale between private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Besides that the tying of Princes to the <hi>formalities of Courts,</hi> tediousness of Processes; and casting the Laws of Government into the mold of the Laws of private interest, must needs be great impediments unto it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. THIS <hi>Prudence,</hi> you see is quite different from <hi>cunning,</hi> the advantage of Fools, and wicked men, who mistake them for the same. For the <hi>Prudent</hi> mans aime is to <hi>secure himself,</hi> and interest, (the wisedom of the Serpent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to us by our Saviour;) to be in such a condition in all estates, as to be able justly, honourably, and openly, <hi>to make use of all opportunities,</hi> and occasions for his own advantage, toward the obtaining of the great end of his Creation. <hi>Cunning</hi> measures <hi>Justice</hi> by <hi>escaping punishment, right</hi> by <hi>law,</hi> and <hi>wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> by <hi>success,</hi> reputation by wealth or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the satisfaction of others by his own interest. A <hi>Prudent</hi> man deals so <hi>sincerely,</hi> that he fears not the examination of his actions or purposes; and is not afraid to have witnesses, if it were possible, of his thoughts. The <hi>crafty</hi> builds his House under ground, <hi>celat, tacet,</hi>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:56954:124"/>
                  <hi>dissimulat, insidiatur, praeripit hostium consilia,</hi> and in order to his own advantage he looks upon all other men as <hi>enemies.</hi> And to these purposes, he useth many <hi>artifices;</hi> as taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the <hi>person,</hi> if in necessity, intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in vice, fear of punishment, or discovery; if in danger, humor, passion, any weakness or ignorance: he also watcheth the <hi>time,</hi> if in mirth, drinking, sorrow; if inadvertent, if easy; he makes use also of his <hi>authority,</hi> repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and superiority, to <hi>impose</hi> upon inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. He pretends great kindness and affection in general expressions; or particular ambiguous ones; or such as he will not be obliged by; for he purposeth nothing; nor hath he, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intends to have, any friend. But his great engine is a <hi>smooth tongue,</hi> and a competent stock of <hi>Wit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. PERSONS <hi>passionate,</hi> fanciful, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, are wont to <hi>apprehend things strongly;</hi> and so apprehended to beleive, and affirm to others, and act accordingly thenselves: and if such men be of reputation or power, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do much harm. Very wise men also are oftentimes too resolute, and obstinate in their opinions; for being used to thinking, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>much</hi> of their object, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a short time they overlook the reasons, circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, probabilities, collect consequences, &amp;c. which actions familiarize the object to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and this renders the reasons of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary side, less probable. Even as our conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a man breeds some degree of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and friendship to him, tho the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self be not worth our acquaintance. Wherefore
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56954:125"/>
every <hi>Prudent</hi> man ought to be <hi>jealous</hi> and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>of himself,</hi> lest he run away too hastily with a likelyhood instead of truth; and abound too much in his own sense.</p>
               <p n="7">7. ALL <hi>estates are equall, i. e.</hi> Men may be happy in every state. For <hi>security</hi> is equal to <hi>splendor; health</hi> to <hi>pleasure,</hi> &amp;c. Every state al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hath its enemies, for <hi>Deus posuit duo &amp; duo, unum contra unum.</hi> A rich man because rich; the poor man hath as poor neighbours, or rich ones that gape after that small which he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: beware therefore how you <hi>offend</hi> any man, for the offended joins against you; and be sure you <hi>hate</hi> no man, tho you think him an evill or unjust person. Nor <hi>envy</hi> any one above you; you have enemies enough by your own state, make no more; but rather, procure as many friends as you can to uphold and strengthen you. Every <hi>man hath also an enemy within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi> he that is not choleric is covetous, is facil, I mean by Nature, for if he hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued these natural desires, 'tis otherwise. Nor can a choleric man say; I am to be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; 'tis natural to me; <hi>such a one</hi> is not so. For <hi>that such a one</hi> hath also his infirmity, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, which perhaps is harder to conquer then yours. Besides what is according to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is seldome perceived by us; a choleric man perceives not when he is angry, at least thinks it no great fault. Therefore it is <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to have an Adviser.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. ALL <hi>men,</hi> therefore <hi>are evil Judges of themselves,</hi> and think they do well many times when they sin, and commit small errors when
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56954:125"/>
they are guilty of crimes. It is also in our <hi>life,</hi> as in <hi>Arts</hi> and Sciences; the <hi>greater differences</hi> are <hi>easily discerned,</hi> but of the smaller moments onely the wise and skilful in the Art can judge. Many <hi>vices</hi> also, tho <hi>contrary,</hi> yet are <hi>like to virtues,</hi> the confines of both are the same; and the exact limits and boundaries difficultly fixed; as of pride and greatness of spirit; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Superstition; quickness and rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; cheerfulness and mirth; so of ambition and sufficiency; Government and Tyranny; liberty and licentiousness; subjection and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude; covetousness and frugality; and so of the rest. And yet <hi>Prudence</hi> chiefly consists in this very <hi>exactness of Judgement;</hi> to discern the one from the other; and give to every cause his proper actions and effects. It is therefore necessary for every one, that desires to be a wise man, to <hi>observe his own actions,</hi> and the original of them, <hi>his thoughts and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> with great care and circumspection; else he shall never arrive in any tolerable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the knowledge of what he doth well or ill. And lest all this diligence should be insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, as the partiality to himself will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly render it; it is very requisite for him to <hi>chuse a friend,</hi> or <hi>Monitor,</hi> who may with all freedom advertise him of his failings, and advise him remedies. Such a one, I mean, as is a discreet and virtuous person; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, one <hi>that</hi> thrusts not himself upon the acquaintance of great Persons; nor upon em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiments scandalous for opportunities of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice; <hi>that</hi> bridleth his tongue, and wit; <hi>that</hi> can converse with himself, and attends upon his own affaires whatever they be. Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:56954:126"/>
your self into a confidence with him; and desire him to observe your conversation, and seriously and friendly admonish you of what he thinks amiss; and let not his modesty rest till he condescend to you: for do not imagine that you <hi>live one day without faults</hi> or that those <hi>faults are undiscovered.</hi> Most men see that in another, which they do not in themselves. And he is happy, who in the whole space of his life can attain to a reasonable <hi>freedom from sins;</hi> and that with the help of <hi>old age</hi> also, that great dompter and mortifier of our lusts and passions. If he inform you, whether true or false, take it not <hi>patiently,</hi> but <hi>thankfully;</hi> for the advantage is the same (which is, to break the inordinate affection you bear towards your self,) and be sure to <hi>amend:</hi> thus you both get a friend, and perfect your self in wisedom and virtue. When you consider, that you must give account of your actions to your vigilant reprover; that other men see the same imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in you as he doth; and that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for a great man to enjoy the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of friendship, except he first disrobe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of those qualities, which render him sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to flattery, <hi>i. e.</hi> except he first cease to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himself. A good <hi>Confessor</hi> in Religion will supply much of such a Monitors work; tho the one doth it judicially, the other only in familiar conversation. And how much more worthy is such a one of entertainment, then those, who come to your table to make sawces, eat your meat, censure their neighbors, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and deride, you?</p>
               <p n="9">9. IF <hi>a friend tell you of a fault, imagine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:56954:126"/>
(which is most true) <hi>that he telleth you not the whole:</hi> for he desires your amendment, but is loath to offend you. And <hi>nunquam si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne querelâ aegra tanguntur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. THERE is little or no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>not deliberating</hi> and <hi>deliberating in passion;</hi> except that this is the worse, as engaging more, and more irrevocably in error. For he that being out of the way, is resolved to go on, straies the further.</p>
               <p n="11">11. THE <hi>fore-game,</hi> a wiseman plaies, is to <hi>foresee</hi> and <hi>avoid;</hi> but the <hi>aftergame</hi> is to <hi>carry himself</hi> with <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>indifferency.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cato</hi> falling into a <hi>calamity,</hi> not by his own fault, should not have rid himself of it by a <hi>greater wickednes;</hi> but by his constancy and generosity have shewed to the World, what a wise man should do in such a case.</p>
               <p n="12">12. ALL <hi>mens apprehensions naturally are alike:</hi> what one sees red, another sees not green; and Aloes is not better to one, and sweet to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and their <hi>first thoughts</hi> upon them <hi>are the same.</hi> And that one man is more learned, is not because he knows <hi>otherwise</hi> then another; but it is because he knows <hi>more consequences,</hi> and <hi>more propositions</hi> by his greater industry and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. The conceptions according <hi>to truth</hi> are alike and the same, but <hi>false</hi> are infinite; wherefore if you find one man single in his judgment, be wary of him; he either knows more then all others, or there is some ill prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in him.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:56954:127"/>
13. NO <hi>evil man but hath irregular passions;</hi> which passions are offensive to <hi>evil</hi> persons, more then to <hi>good;</hi> (for good men are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, complaisant, &amp;c.) Therefore one evil man agrees not with, nor loves to deal with, another.</p>
               <p n="14">14. MUCH of the trouble of this world proceeds from certain <hi>irregular humors</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,</hi> which many men indiscreetly espouse; and because they are innocent, they think them also prudent and rational. If other men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to repress them as inconvenient, &amp;c. 'tis ill taken, and with trouble, and disquiet; being these are not unlike to such as have <hi>antipathy</hi> to certain meats that exposeth them to need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less passions, and impertinent affliction.</p>
               <p n="15">15. WISEDOM <hi>is made to rule,</hi> and yet Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates generally are readier to make use of their <hi>power</hi> then <hi>wisdom;</hi> of their will then reason. Because it is easier, shorter, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies more with the humor of mankind. Yet the subjects prefer, and often expect, the other.</p>
               <p n="16">16. A GREAT General where ever he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, went continually considering the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the country; and casting with himself, what was to be done, if leading an army he should be assaulted there by an Enemy. By which means he was alwaies provided against surprises. The same care doth every wise man take by pondering all the cases of danger and difficulty which may or are likely to occur in his emploiment.</p>

17. EVERY <hi>man hath a tender place;</hi> which when touched by the hand of God, afflicts him, and he complains. And those, who are most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the World, have more tendernesses, as riches, family, reputation, bodily infirmities, &amp;c. Wherefore a <hi>wise man provides before hand a stock of patience;</hi> And fortifies the dangers by good considerations, and by taking off his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and passions from them.</p>
               <p n="18">18. THE <hi>things of this World seem greater at distance;</hi> the things of <hi>the other World greater near hand.</hi> Because those are fully known; and comprehended alwaies with passions of love, fear, &amp;c. For they enter in by the senses; which, being <hi>natural,</hi> and not <hi>free,</hi> Agents, work <hi>ad ultimum virium,</hi> and entertain their object as much as they can. Besides, the objects are themselves clothed with many <hi>circumstances, pomps,</hi> and <hi>shews;</hi> which make them <hi>seem</hi> great and taking: and without these they would be naked, and nothing. But <hi>spiritual things</hi> move only the Soul and spirit; which receives not without arguing and disputing, <hi>i. e.</hi> without something of truth, and rejecting appearances. Wherefore a <hi>wise man is wary of the things of this World,</hi> and admits them not confidently.</p>
               <p n="19">19. CREATURAe <hi>Dei in odium factae sunt, &amp; in tentationem animae hominum, &amp; in muscipulam pedibus insipientium.</hi> For that which is the occasion to wise and virtuous men of obtaining and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, is by their ignorance turned by fools to their disadvantage. Indeed all things, even wise counsel, are by fools made either instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or testimonies of their folly.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of Conversation and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</head>
               <p n="1">1. CONVERSATION <hi>casual</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>voluntary</hi> with few, <hi>of busines</hi> to be denied to none. Have <hi>many</hi> acquaintance, <hi>one</hi> friend, and <hi>no</hi> enemy.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>keep company to spend their time,</hi> and saunter away their age; such care not much with whom they converse; nor is their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany either grateful, or beneficial.</p>
               <p>Others <hi>for pleasure and divertisement,</hi> to laugh and make themselves merry, and so pass their time.</p>
               <p>Others <hi>for interest;</hi> and that either honestly, or deceitfully, as by gaming, debauching, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoring, overreaching, flattering, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. GREAT <hi>care is to be taken</hi> in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, for we must do as the Ancients feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their <hi>lamiae,</hi> that within dores wore their eyes in their girdles but going abroad put them in their heads; but still greater care is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site in <hi>choice of such companions,</hi> with whom a man is to converse <hi>much,</hi> or a long time, or to <hi>trust</hi> with busines of consequence. As the <hi>Italians</hi> say; <hi>measure it a hundred times, before you cut it once;</hi> at first standing upon your guard, till you discover their Inclinations. And</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Avoid,</hi> as much as you can, <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:56954:128"/>
                  <hi>of all vitious persons</hi> whatsoever; for no vice is alone, and all are infectious.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Swearers, prophane,</hi> and <hi>blasphemers;</hi> lest Almighty God lay to your charge the neglect of his interest, and honor, in your presence uncontrolledly affronted; whilst you are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to resent and vindicate every small offence done to your self.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Hectors,</hi> and those brutish persons; who either for gain, or satisfaction of their bestial arrogance, care not whom they debauch or affront. Insolent Children of Hell, ruiners of so many persons and families.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Scoffers;</hi> who put their own faults in the back end of the wallet, but discover all they know of others. With such no peace is durable.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>a person scandalous</hi> either for Profession, or manners; for you run his hazzard, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouse his disreputation.</p>
               <p>Never expect any assistance or consolation in your necessities from drinking companions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. AVOID also consorting with those <hi>who are much superior,</hi> or <hi>much inserior,</hi> to you: Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, not only in degree and external quality, but especially in parts. <hi>Tanti eris aliis, quanti tibi fueris.</hi> Your own thoughts and designs will be such as your companions are; and low fortunes breed many times degenerous purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. He that makes himself an Asse, 'tis fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others should ride him. And it is a very mean ambition to be the best of his company.</p>
               <p>With <hi>open,</hi> upright, plain dispositions as also with the <hi>cheerful</hi> and facetious, there is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in conversation; except where they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle too boldly with other mens lives; but theirs is <hi>Satyre,</hi> not <hi>calumny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:56954:129"/>
With <hi>resty,</hi> froward, ill natur'd humors, who are hard to please, and think it grandez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za to be harsh and parsimonious of good words, and supercilious towards their equals, few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse who intend not to gain by them.</p>
               <p>From all <hi>good natur'd</hi> persons, women, and drink, keep your secrets. And with such as are wholly bent upon their <hi>own interest,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours not upon what concerns their interest.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THEY who pretend to <hi>cunning</hi> observe, and make much of a <hi>rule,</hi> which I think it is not amiss to know, to beware of, and fortify against, but not to practise, it; which is, to observe every mans imperfection, (for few there are but have such a one) and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to apply themselves. As for example</p>
               <p n="1">1. With such as are swelled with <hi>conceit of their Nobility or Wealth,</hi> if they have busines, they give them respect enough; if they have not, yet they pay them with their own coin; no matter if they deceive themselves with the opinion that they are honored according to their merit or desire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All <hi>humorous persons</hi> are weak, and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to themselves, that they stray out of the plain way of the reason of Mankind; for it is discretion and judgment that corrects out irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular fancies, and (where virtue or vice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene not) conforms us to the common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms. Wherefore he, that will take the pains to comply with, and seem to justify, their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, rules them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such as having imposed upon themselves certain <hi>Laws of ceremonies,</hi> &amp;c. would also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige others to the same; (which proceeds
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56954:129"/>
many times from Melancholy and not pride) their weakness is manifest.</p>
               <p n="4">4. With <hi>morose persons,</hi> they deal freely, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, and familiarly; that they may think they see through their designs, and so they are stricken in the right vein.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Those who are curious to <hi>pry into other mens matters,</hi> are commonly malicious; no friendship with them, as neither with a proud, nor any angry, person.</p>
               <p n="6">6. With such as are <hi>in disgrace with Superiors;</hi> they converse not much, and are wary how they offer them help, &amp;c. for they fasten as men drowning upon any shew of assistance.</p>
               <p n="7">7. With such as are <hi>in grace with the Prince,</hi> they keep good correspondence, and seek their favor; and tho mean persons, yet they des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise them not, for they are chosen by his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But they do as they, who in a dark night follow him that hath a torch, tho a rogue, or a beggar.</p>
               <p n="4">4. GIVE <hi>no man just cause of offence;</hi> nor resent too vively injuries towards your self. But if after your care to avoid quarrelling, you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen upon such brutes, as either to try your mettal, or out of a bestial love of injuriousnes, (for such <hi>Hectors</hi> this age hath brought forth in greater plenty, then any other I ever read of) the best way is to resent it briskly; and <hi>threaten</hi> seriously, at least; if you do not <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stize,</hi> the insolency, that makes <hi>injuring a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chuse therefore the conversation rather of <hi>ancient men,</hi> for their testimony is of greater force; of such persons as are <hi>famed for virtue</hi>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:56954:130"/>
and wisdom; (for something is alwaies to be learned by them) and such there are many, but they offer not themselves, but expect to be sought out, and admit not every applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without choice.</p>
               <p>So much for <hi>Conversation,</hi> it follows of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Men are commonly judged by their <hi>Discourse,</hi> and therefore it is necessary for a wise man to regulate that, almost in the first place. <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> is either concerning. 1. <hi>Raillery and mirth. 2. Other mens lives and actions. 3. Occasional, as History, News, &amp;c. 4. Erudition and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> or 5. <hi>Business and interest of self or friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. THOSE, who take pleasure in <hi>exposing others to contemt</hi> and <hi>derision,</hi> either by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their actions, or imperfections, or by jee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and mocking them, avoid, as you would the heels of an Horse, that kicks every one he can reach: if you cannot, take the part of the abused; blame the action, spare the person; or if the person be known, excuse the action; if neither can be done, praise the person for some other good action or quality; so have you an <hi>Antidote</hi> against the <hi>poyson.</hi> Indeed there is no greater enemy to Peace and Charity then the <hi>Railleur.</hi> For, as ordinarily it is the <hi>sooty oven</hi> that mocks the <hi>black chimney;</hi> so one <hi>jeer</hi> seldome goes forth, but it returns with its <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual;</hi> and they together beget a <hi>quarrel.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, to abuse <hi>inferiors</hi> argues a mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temtible spirit; <hi>Superiors,</hi> is dangerous; and a <hi>word</hi> often provokes them more then an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. To abuse <hi>a friend</hi> is to lose him; a <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> to lose your self in his and the Worlds
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56954:130"/>
esteem. <hi>Those</hi> mocks are most resented which touch a mans <hi>reputation,</hi> chiefly that of <hi>wit</hi> or <hi>discretion;</hi> for of <hi>that</hi> even fools are chary; and every one rather confesseth his forgetfulness, then ignorance. next <hi>those which</hi> are for <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> actions, rather then in <hi>general,</hi> for they seem to have more of <hi>truth,</hi> these of <hi>wit; which</hi> are of some secret imperfection; <hi>which</hi> are of that wherein a man prides himself. Since <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis I.</hi> time (who giving <hi>Charles V.</hi> the <hi>lie,</hi> and challenging him to a duel, was refused) the <hi>lye</hi> hath been counted a great affront; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exaggerations are made of that abuse. But had not that King (perhaps in justification of his own rashness) said, that he was not a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that would take the <hi>lye;</hi> I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive that would have deserved a severer chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement then other imputations; I speak in conversation, for Laws take no more notice of that then others.</p>
               <p>Yet it seems, to condemn all <hi>raillery</hi> is to tether the <hi>wits;</hi> and therefore if preserved in a mediocrity, it might be allowed. For it makes men stand better upon their guard, when they know that they are likely to hear again of their actions; besides it inureth them to bear harsh words, and bridle their passions. But to railly hansomely is very difficult, for good jests are to bite like <hi>Lambs,</hi> not like <hi>Dogs,</hi> tickle, not wound. And therefore 'tis requisite to have a <hi>third person</hi> of Discretion, to stroak over the severer nips, and throw dust upon them, when being heated they begin to sting one another. Also with <hi>small miscarriages</hi> and misfortunes, and such as happen without the parties fault, &amp;c. you may be the bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56954:131"/>
and with such as bring no shame with them, and such wherein many are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>jeerer</hi> also must be content to tast of his own broth; and the expert in this trade are wont to do; as he, who having in his youth taken great liberty to railly upon marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed persons, in his declining age took a Wife, where any one might have had her for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and the first entertainment of his friends was the discourse of his own marriage, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all that could be said. In sum, jeers are only then good, <hi>when</hi> ex tempore; <hi>when</hi> they seem to proceed from wit, not <hi>anger</hi> or <hi>malice; when</hi> they are intended for mirth and pastime not calumny; <hi>when</hi> you are pleasant with his error or mistake, not his shame; and seldom please at second hand. But because these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are difficultly known; because many persons are very captious and hasty; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause at best it argues not a solid, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal <hi>wit,</hi> but a peculiar dexterity and promti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which is frequently accompanied with want of good Invention as well as Judgment; a Discreet person will not much engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in it, nor render himself a fool to make others laugh; but after he hath tried 3 or 4 times and finds not himself fit for it, let him never endeavor it more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A KIN to the Railleurs are the <hi>Drolls,</hi> who turn all to <hi>Ridiculousnes.</hi> Their censure see in <hi>Sen.</hi> ep. 29. <hi>Marcellinum nondum despero; etiamnum servari potest, sed si cito porrigatur illi manus. Est quidem periculum ne porrigentem tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat. Magna in illo ingenii vis, sed tendentis in pravum. Faciet; quod solet; advocabit illas face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias,</hi>

                  <hi>quae risum evocare lugentibus possunt, &amp; in se primum, deinde in nos jocabitur, &amp;c. Christians</hi> have greater arguments against this <hi>Drollery; that</hi> it grieves Gods holy spirit, and is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that seriousnes and consideration requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to Religion. <hi>That</hi> there is nothing so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred or prudent, which by the petulancy of wit may not be made ridiculous, consequently contemtible, fit to be neglected and abolished. <hi>Virgil</hi> we have seen publicly, and even the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writings we heard to have been, <hi>travesty,</hi> by those who spare neither their Souls nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, to prove themselves Buffoons; and shew their abilities and ingenuity in folly. And this indeed is the great engine charged against heaven, the only and trusty weapon wherewith dirty potsheards (Disciples of <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apostate, Porphirius, Epicurus,</hi> and the rest of that brutish heard) bark and grin against a Deity. When all true reason, and sober consideration as well as the other Creatures ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify their Maker, yea when even the Dogs revenged him upon <hi>Lucian</hi> the great Professor of scurrility and scoffing as well as Epicurism and irreligion. But besides this disposition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a laschety and levity unbefitting any person of quality and emploiment; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth the same inclinations both in the <hi>Drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> and the <hi>Auditors.</hi> For as a wit used to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifying is ready to put all its thoughts into rime; or a Mathematician is presently redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all his fancies to somewhat in those Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; every one casting his thoughts into that mold whereunto they are accustomed: So do <hi>Drolls</hi> reject all serious notions, and accept and fix upon the light and emty. And therefore
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56954:132"/>
we see that when such persons aim at any thing grave and serious, it misbecometh them, as done out of order and season. Thus doth <hi>mirth</hi> pleasingly by little and little steal away the judgment, rendring it vain, studious of, and delighting in, that which wise men avoid, <hi>laughter.</hi> And these men, whilst they think to fool others, become themselves really, what others are in their imagination.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IN <hi>Discourse</hi> concerning <hi>other persons</hi> (fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar amongst Women) <hi>Back-biting,</hi> and <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny</hi> is most frequent: because all men had rather hear evil of another then good. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thinking thereby to justify their own faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness; at best indulging their self-love, which is grounded upon a too high estimation of themselves, and too low of others.</p>
               <p>This <hi>evil speaking</hi> is very frequently used by many, who pretend to <hi>extraordinary Godliness;</hi> whose bitings are also more dangerous, and venemous with those persons, who mistake their <hi>formality</hi> for <hi>seriousnes,</hi> and their <hi>gravity,</hi> for <hi>reality,</hi> in Religion. But even in <hi>ordinary conversation</hi> men are wont also to defame their neighbours open-fac'd, without any ceremony, design, or remorse. From both these sorts of people, especially the former, turn away, as much as you can; but be sure to be none of them; nor partake with them in their <hi>calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations.</hi> Consider what you say of others, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers say of you. Before you calumniate, think, am not I the same? or as bad? Take heed of doing that, which may hurt, but cannot do good; for 'tis madness to make enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause; and it is better to suppress, then
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56954:132"/>
vent and satisfy, a piece of wit or a foolish passion. The great rule is, <hi>Nothing but truth before the face, and nothing but good behind the back.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beware also of <hi>censuring Nations,</hi> Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or States of Men, as well as particular persons; for there is no Nation or condition, wherein are not many good; and none so good, wherein are not many bad.</p>
               <p>'Tis also a great honor and wisdom <hi>to pass by the back-bitings of others against your self. Charles the 7th</hi> of <hi>France</hi> demanded of one, much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied by him, and on whom he had bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many favors, what thing in the world could alienate his mind from, and bring him in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slike with, his Prince? the <hi>Gentleman</hi> answer'd, An affront. This person seems to have bin very sensible indeed, but whether his discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had merited the favor of his Prince I much doubt. Certainly the behavior of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> was much more generous; who, when one told him, that such a one affronted him, answered; it may be so, but I will not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted. <hi>Augustus</hi> advised <hi>Tiberius</hi> not to be offended with peoples <hi>speaking ill</hi> of them; it sufficeth, saith he, that we can secure our selves from their <hi>doing</hi> us <hi>harm.</hi> When one said, he was a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> he answered, were I so, he durst not have said it. To one calling him <hi>Dwarf,</hi> well, said he, then I will get higher shoes. <hi>P. Bernard,</hi> when one bid him get out like a dirty Priest, replied, you are mistaken, I came in a Coach. And truly since all these evil tongues are conquered by silence, one would think the victory easy; did not experience shew us, that the great remedy against burst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is giving vent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:56954:133"/>
There is <hi>no reason that the effect, which may proceed from divers causes, should be attributed to one. v. g.</hi> an action of seeming disrespect may either come <hi>from</hi> an intention to affront, <hi>from</hi> negligence, <hi>from</hi> having some other busines in his thoughts, &amp;c. interpret not therefore such actions as <hi>affronts;</hi> and the rather, because it is our duty to take every thing by the <hi>best handle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. THE most innocent, grateful, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Discourse, is <hi>telling Stories;</hi> and modern rather then ancient. Some are so well stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this trade as to be able to answer any question, or parallel any case by a Story; which is (if well done) a very great perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of eloquence and judgment. And in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Stories avoid too often <hi>said he, and said I, hear you me, mark me,</hi> &amp;c. be perfect also, that you need not recant, stammer, or repeat things said before; be not tedious in impertinent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, nor make your own glory the chiefest concern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tell no lye</hi> in your discourse; especially not <hi>Gasconades,</hi> and improbable <hi>Rhodomontades,</hi> wherein some, out of weaknes and lowness of spirit and parts, take as much pleasure as others in drinking when not thirsty, and think they then overwit the company. Be not <hi>hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and <hi>extravagant,</hi> especially in praising and dispraising; for the <hi>wit takes away the credit;</hi> whereas the end of speech was first to make us <hi>understood,</hi> then <hi>beleived.</hi> And if you be <hi>convinced</hi> of an error, for truths sake acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it, and change your opinion; for this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity is greater, because rarer.</hi> And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:56954:133"/>
                  <hi>One chance</hi> falling out, as the <hi>Astrologues</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnosticate, gets them <hi>reputation;</hi> and their thousand lyes are not taken notice of; but to a <hi>wise man one lye</hi> doth more <hi>disgrace,</hi> then thousand <hi>truths</hi> can <hi>recover.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>news</hi> comes from an <hi>uncertain Author,</hi> tho probable and expected, yet suspend your beleif; because men easily report what they desire or expect; but rather give heed to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>extravagant</hi> and <hi>unexpected Relations,</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likelier to be invented. And when you tell news, engage not for the truth of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. IN your discourse <hi>rational</hi> or <hi>of erudition,</hi> skip not from one subject to another; as do <hi>Fanatics,</hi> and other ignorant <hi>Sciolists,</hi> who are never at ease till they have vented all they think themselves to know above other men. Neither maintain an argument <hi>with ignorant,</hi> nor contradictive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; nor think that you are bound to convert or instruct the whole World; least of all <hi>with vain drolls,</hi> who make your seriousnes their sport. Be content to satisfy with <hi>reason,</hi> not (especially your own) <hi>authority</hi> (a refuge many fly unto when worsted, if they know there is no exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Books) such as are capable and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
               <p>In reasoning, the most excellent way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the best able is certain to carry the cause, and which will bring the controversy to a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy determination, is by <hi>asking questions,</hi> and <hi>proceeding</hi> still <hi>upon the adversaries concessions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which he cannot without shame retract; (by Syllogisms is more Pedantic.) This is <hi>Plato</hi>'s manner of discoursing.</p>

                  <hi>Pedantry</hi> is a vice in all Professions, it self
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56954:134"/>
no Profession. For a <hi>School-master</hi> is not <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> a <hi>Pedant;</hi> but he only <hi>who</hi> importunately, impertinently, and with great formality, <hi>shews</hi> his learning in scraps of <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek; or troubles</hi> himself with knowledg of little use or value; <hi>or values</hi> himself above his deserts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of something he knows (as he conceives) more then ordinary; <hi>or despiseth</hi> others not skilled in his impertinencies; <hi>or censures</hi> all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and persons confidently without reason. And whoever doth thus, be he Divine, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, Statesman, Doctor, or Professor, he is a <hi>Pedant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do not in <hi>ordinary company</hi> treat of matters too <hi>subtil</hi> and curious, nor too <hi>vile</hi> and mean; nor of things unseasonable, as of Religion in mixed, or young company, or at table; but in all Discourse have an intention to better your self and others. Which that you may do, <hi>contrive,</hi> (as much as you can) before hand <hi>of what to discourse;</hi> and lay your scene, which afterwards you may menage as you please.</p>
               <p>A man may <hi>judiciously discourse, when</hi> either he knows the subject very well; or <hi>when</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to learn (a submission and ingenuity very grateful in company) or <hi>when</hi> necessitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to discourse, and <hi>then</hi> he must do it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly and doubtingly, unless he very well know his Auditory. Cautious also must he be who discourseth of that he understands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst persons of that Profession; an affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that more Scholars then wisemen are guilty of; I mean to discourse with every man in his own faculty; except it be by asking questions, and seeming to learn.</p>
               <p>You may freely and safely discourse of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

               <p>
                  <hi>Discourse,</hi> tho amongst learned men, <hi>laies no grounds of Science,</hi> but supposeth them, and therefore <hi>study</hi> is necessary; without which who so adventures amongst Scholars, is like a Lady, that hath excellent Medicines, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knows whereof they are made, nor how to apply them effectually. Have a care also that your <hi>income exceed your expences, i. e.</hi> that you hear and read more then you speak: for he that spends out of the stock of wit and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is quickly bankerupted; but knowledg and learning continually improve by discourse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cunning discoursers</hi> to avoid baffling are wont at first to <hi>lay down a proposition easily defensible,</hi> to which they may retreat in case of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but defend the other out works also as long as they can.</p>
               <p>Mens <hi>wits</hi> and apprehensions are <hi>infinitely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;</hi> nor is there any opinion so extravagant, which hath not some followers and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who fit their hypotheses to it.

               <p>Every <hi>man makes himself the measure of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> for truth and falshood, wisdom and folly. learning and ignorance, and the like. And who is able to denudate himself of this false opinion, or prejudice at least to truth?</p>
               <p>But from hence it proceeds that we esteem
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56954:135"/>
him knowing that knows more or as much, and him ignorant, that knows less, then our selves. Him also virtuous that is according to our sentiment and degree. Also that all men are more ready to blame anothers errors, then praise his virtues. And that a man knowing what another doth not, and being ignorant of what another knows, yet knows not his own ignorance; but consequently values himself and despiseth the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To man alone</hi> (not beasts nor Angels) hath nature given <hi>a nauseousnes of the present.</hi> The best things in the world if not accompanied with variety, become distastful. And nothing sooner then <hi>Discourse:</hi> which is so much care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullier to be menaged, as the eare is sooner cloy'd then the eie.

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Concerning Business.</head>
               <p>A <hi>Doctor</hi> being intreated by his Nephew to give some rules for guiding and securing himself in <hi>negotiation,</hi> and <hi>contracts;</hi> after long study told him, he could give him but one; which was, <hi>alwaies to have to do with virtuous persons.</hi> But for many reasons this rule, tho a perfect one, is hard to be practised; and therefore I beseech you be content with such imperfect ones, as my reading or experience can furnish.</p>
               <p>If any one tell you, <hi>that</hi> it is to no purpose to think long upon any matter; <hi>that</hi> they are only wise men who can dispatch business <hi>ex tempore; that</hi> consulting is but a dull formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and <hi>that</hi> a man sees as far into a thing at first, as by much consideration; say boldly that man is <hi>a fool:</hi> the more you think, the more and clearer you shall understand. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Men of <hi>most leisure</hi> do business the best; and those who have much business must have much pardon. <hi>Therefore</hi> men <hi>used to business</hi> do it better; because they have thought of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either in the same, or a like, case.</p>
               <p>A <hi>prudent Man doth no business rashly, i. e.</hi> without reason and advice; and he advis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth also as long as he can; and that first with his own thoughts: which being not sufficient, he takes in also the assistance of other mens counsel; and heareth others, tho he follow
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56954:136"/>
perhaps his own. Most men advise for their own interest, and therefore happy is he who hath a <hi>friend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To order your thoughts well in <hi>Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> endeavor to <hi>put your business into an History,</hi> considering what is to be done or said first, what afterwards. For the hindrance of prudent resolutions is the confusion and disorder of thoughts; which by this method is cleared: by it also you shall quickly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver where the difficulty is, and know when you have done. It is also very convenient to <hi>write down</hi> your reasons <hi>pro &amp; con</hi> in delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the mind by this means, is freed both from the confusion, and burden of those arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Give not your advice or opinion before asked;</hi> for that is to upbraid the others ignorance: <hi>nor</hi> attribute ill success to the neglect of your councel; <hi>nor</hi> be angry if your advice be not followed. <hi>Neither</hi> accustom your self to find fault with others actions, except vitious; for <hi>you are not bound to weed other mens Gardens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be <hi>not too eager in counselling others;</hi> for the <hi>evil success</hi> (which happens frequently to good advice) will be <hi>laid to your charge,</hi> and <hi>sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> shall you be <hi>thanked for the good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It happeneth frequently to men that are wise by <hi>experience,</hi> and not <hi>learning,</hi> that they cannot give a <hi>reason</hi> of their opinion and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, tho it be really the best: (as a meer mechanicall workman knows there is a fault in the work, (tho he cannot tell punctually what it is.) <hi>Despise not such mens opinions for their want of Discourse,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Deliberations where there is reason on both</hi>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:56954:136"/>
                  <hi>sides</hi> and that a man hath resolved one way, he commonly thinks that he hath chosen the worse, because then he onely considers the reasons of the contrary part; which represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by themselves (the other after resolution being no more considered) seem greater and of more consequence then they are.</p>
               <p>There is one great <hi>perfection</hi> in doing <hi>busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> which is, That tho you set your mind and thoughts upon business, <hi>yet do not engage your affections,</hi> at least deeply, in it. For thus shall you both have your understanding clear at all times; and not be disturbed if you mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry; which you must make account will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happen unto you. Besides precipitiousness, impatience, or not staying to take the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and time your business, is frequently the ruine of many noble designs; and <hi>all pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> whatsoever deteriorates your negotiation; if your reason will not bring you to this indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, experience will. <hi>A l'adventure tout vient à point à qui peut attendre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In treating about business you understand, you have an advantage to <hi>propose first;</hi> in what you understand not, 'tis best to <hi>receive proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> And if you have a doubtful cause, an inconstant adversary, or find him disposed to comply with your desire, defer not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch.</p>
               <p>In business (except buying and selling) you shall find <hi>very few persons speak to the purpose;</hi> therefore let every man talk his fill: rather then interrupt, provoke him to speak; for he will blurt out many things to your advantage: some out of ignorance and inexperience; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on purpose standing on circumstances
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56954:137"/>
and things of small consequence. Women commonly (as weakest) are most extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant; and at an end, or the midst, of their Story must drop a tear; for being themselves compassionate, they think others are so too; and that is their interest.</p>
               <p>The <hi>difficulty of dispatch</hi> is not from the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness it self, wherein a man may easily see what is necessary, or fittest to be done: but it is in <hi>perswading your interest;</hi> in <hi>communicating</hi> so much and no more then concerns you; <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> such reasons only, as are proper for your matter; in <hi>applying</hi> them to every ones under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, inclination, and at a fit time; and in <hi>taking off</hi> the opposition of Adversaries. For there is no interest that hath not its contrary, and sometimes also so forcible a one, as is to be conquered onely with mony; which is a sword that cuts even a Gordian knot.</p>
               <p>All things concernning the <hi>menagery of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires</hi> are reduced to these heads.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The ground or occasion.</item>
                  <item>2. The end to be brought about.</item>
                  <item>3. The reasons whereupon the affair is grounded.</item>
                  <item>4. The difficulties likely to be encountred</item>
                  <item>5. The answers which may be made to the reasons.</item>
                  <item>6. And the replies to them.</item>
                  <item>7. The advantage of the affaire to the other party.</item>
                  <item>8. Examples of like cases.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But alwaies be sure to remove the principal obstacle.</p>
               <p>Some men are <hi>apt to beleive</hi> what they hope for, or desire; others are <hi>never secure,</hi> till
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56954:137"/>
they see and enjoy. And this doubtless is the better; because it encreaseth diligence, good success, and less affliction. Wherefore of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things, imagine and provide for the worst; tho of actions dubious of other persons you conceive the best.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fear</hi> is a necessary passion, and <hi>hath a great share in all our affairs.</hi> The great and general defect being negligence, laschety, and love of ease; fear discuseth these. He that is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual apprehension of evil watcheth to avoid, prepareth to rencounter, and is cautious not to give admittance to, danger; but endeavors to secure his condition, and remove further from evil. In things of <hi>the other world</hi> men are more apt to hope, because they have not so clear an apprehension, nor so firm a beleif, or not so frequent consideration concerning them; but in matters <hi>of this world</hi> more apt to fear; for all mens hopes frequently fail, their fears seldom. Besides the loss of what we enjoy goes nearer and is more sensible to us, then the future good may advantage; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in treating with most men you know the best Topic. And seldom is it seen but that fear also gets the better of love, and therefore good Magistrates trust not only to love, but will in some degree be feared also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secrecy</hi> and <hi>reservednes</hi> is of infinite use; for, besides that such are not easily prevented and interrupted, men are still commenting and in suspense about every motion of theirs; which gets great reputation. Besides suddain things do more amaze, and confound, then things foreseen or expected. But you need not put your self to the trouble of <hi>secrecy,</hi> where you fear no opposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:56954:138"/>
Many time; also your <hi>secrecy</hi> is to be conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nor is an inquirer into the business you would hide rudely to be denied (for that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times breeds jealousies, &amp;c.) but by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and courteous dissimulation to be fenced withal, and his thoughts dextrously avoided rather then forcibly returned upon him. He that is a good Practitioner in this trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes often-times Master of his thoughts that came to sist him.</p>
               <p>Beware of <hi>trusting to your fortune;</hi> for most men are fortunate <hi>for a time,</hi> and <hi>in some things</hi> only: nor is he fortunate, who hath a good occasion offered to him, for it is Prudence to take hold of, and use, it; but he that hath it <hi>presented twice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Think <hi>not such as these to be good consequences.</hi> He is a good man, therefore doth nothing ill: he is a bad man, therefore doth nothing well. He is a wise man, therefore doth nothing foolishly, &amp;c. Consider this well and stand upon your guard. For <hi>every one hath errors,</hi> from whence sometimes greater, other times lesser, mischeifs arise: happy are they, whose errors happen to be in small matters, and which come betimes, and are remediable.</p>
               <p>He that <hi>doubts not,</hi> knows either all things, or nothing. And he that imagines never to commit an error, his next pretence must be to Divinity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>things</hi> of <hi>this World never stand in one stay,</hi> but are alwaies moving their own way; and if we perceive not their alteration, it is because our age is shorter then theirs. This observation is of importance to many purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>v. g. virtue and vice, wisdom and folly, are</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:56954:138"/>
                  <hi>but good and bad, prosperous and adverse, in the seed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we read in Histories the great chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Government, we much wonder at them, and are apt to pitty the sufferers. But Providence hath so ordered, that <hi>great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> ordinarily <hi>happen by little and little;</hi> so that both reason and nature either accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to them, or have time to escape, and provide other waies.</p>
               <p>He that <hi>entreth into danger without considering</hi> it, <hi>is a beast;</hi> he only is <hi>valiant,</hi> who <hi>knowing</hi> the danger, <hi>embraceth</hi> it cheerfully, whether out of necessity or honor. Yea, tho he knows and supposeth that all dangers have not their effects; but that <hi>some</hi> are prevented by industry, <hi>some</hi> by courage and prudence, and <hi>some fortune</hi> and the course of things (Gods Providence) casts of.</p>
               <p>Dealing with Merchants and men of busines and virtue cut of ceremonies; and <hi>declare the busines at length</hi> rather then too-short; for this is apt to raise mistakes; besides a man is not alwaies in disposition or ability to fathom the depth of an affair with a short cord.</p>
               <p>When you have <hi>extorted from a person what he obstinately denied,</hi> you need not doubt, but at the same time also to obtain another he would not willingly grant. For when a man is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as it were, to let go his hold of what he most firmly grasped, he unbends his hand, and abandons whatever it contained. <hi>Commota se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel &amp; excussa mens [à stabilitate suâ] ei servit à quo impellitur.</hi> Thus the Parliament propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the King, together with the bill of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> (which he was
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56954:139"/>
formerly resolved not to grant) a bill for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating the Parliament, which, tho of far greater consequence, he scrupled not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deser,</hi> as long as you can, <hi>the doing of a thing against your mind,</hi> rather then give a positive denial; for <hi>accidents</hi> many times divert the design, and deliver you from that strait, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a refusal may deeplier engage you.</p>
               <p>Never dispatch an evil and difficult busines so absolutely, but that (if possible) you leave place to undertake and introduce it again. Time and opportunity alter many things, and make that pass smoothly which formerly would have bin refused, had not your dexterity left open the door for a new treaty.</p>
               <p>All men naturally avoid persons inquisitive into other mens affairs; for such commonly are lavish of their intelligence, and thereby breed quarrels and spread animosities: besides that themselves are apt to envy and malign others, that being the concern which breeds their inquisitivenes.</p>
               <p>The reason, why <hi>things conform not to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral desire</hi> and expectation of the World, is, because they who give <hi>beginning</hi> and ending to busines are but <hi>few,</hi> and <hi>many</hi> are those who desire and <hi>expect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is often to blame, who <hi>neglects a present good for fear of a future evil,</hi> except it be nigh at hand, and in a manner certain. So is he who strives to avoid all difficulties; for more things affright, then hurt, us. And there are many changes in this World. <hi>Di cosa nasce cosa.</hi> And in judgments of the future we see wise men frequently mistaken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poor, meanpeople,</hi> and <hi>wranglers,</hi> &amp;c. conclude
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56954:139"/>
not any treaty, nor offer all they mean to give, till they be forced, <hi>i. e.</hi> till they see the treaty ready to break up; and they think that they get a considerable advantage by such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines, and importunity; as indeed they do, if they deal with <hi>ingenuous</hi> persons. So petty Tradesmen love to call their customers back.</p>
               <p>Since grateful and virtuous persons are so rare, <hi>value the service of such as are joined with you in the same interest</hi> or danger; and you may more reasonably expect to be assisted by him, that <hi>hopes</hi> to get by you, then by him, who hath already <hi>received</hi> favors from you. And remember that <hi>a Crown in your purse doth you more honor then ten spent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When in consultations there are <hi>contrariety of opinions, seldom is the best chosen;</hi> and the <hi>more</hi> persons argue, the <hi>further</hi> they are from agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the love of their own opinion insinuating it self by little and little with their reason. Wherefore, <hi>sometimes</hi> the most importunate prevails, <hi>sometimes</hi> he that finds out a <hi>medium; not that</hi> this expedient is alwaies the best; <hi>but that</hi> persons in heat of dispute, cannot easily pass over, or fully consent, to a contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thrust not your self to be Moderator or Umpire in Controversies,</hi> till required; and then 'tis better to exaggerate the <hi>mischeifs</hi> of disagreement, then <hi>benefits</hi> of concord; for <hi>fear is stronger then love.</hi> Many are wont alwaies to take the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries part. But it is a very hard thing to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile men at first, their passions being high, and animosities great. But after they are reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wearied with Law, or other inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 'tis not difficult to find out a <hi>medium,</hi> which may <hi>save</hi> both their <hi>honors;</hi> which is
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56954:140"/>
that both commonly desire. A worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman being to reconcile two persons, first made them swear both to stand to his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and 2ly that neither of them should reveal upon what terms they were reconciled.</p>
               <p>Every man is more <hi>apt to love, cherish, and trust in him, on whom he hath already bestowed most courtesies;</hi> esteeming him as his creature; [This is the cause of the great love of Parents toward their Children:] and he, that loveth, and doth favors, obligeth, and submitteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the receiver; so that for fear of losing what he hath already bestowed, he must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow more. Wherefore if you seek the favor of a great person, <hi>accept courtesies</hi> from <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>not from others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that would <hi>perswade great men,</hi> let him first begin with the <hi>weakest;</hi> by probable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, good words, and humble carriage he shall obtain their friendship; and by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (tho but fools) draw in the wiser.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mean wits</hi> alwaies <hi>distrust subtil arguments,</hi> and Logical heads: and great men, for the most part, are of an <hi>inartificial</hi> understanding, and therefore by seemingly naked truth, and plainness, are brought to your opinion.</p>
               <p>In <hi>great Councils</hi> and meetings there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies some <hi>leading men,</hi> whom if you gain, your business is done.</p>
               <p>Amongst <hi>Multitudes, one</hi> adversary can <hi>do more harm,</hi> then <hi>many</hi> friends can <hi>do good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are some who are <hi>children even in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture age;</hi> and of them a man must not say, they are 40. years old, therefore they will do as men of 40. years old. But concerning those and all such <hi>Heteroclites,</hi> look at their present
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56954:140"/>
customs, and menagery of their private affairs. For if you see an aged man <hi>vehement,</hi> suddain in his resolutions, following the <hi>impetus</hi> of his passions; hold that man for a <hi>child;</hi> not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with reason, unconstant; to day resolving without consideration, and in the same manner reversing it to morrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nothing is well done, or said, in passion;</hi> tho there may be just cause of being passionate; but less or more all passion according to the degree of it hinders reason and deliberation. But beware instead of passion you fall not into <hi>slyness</hi> and <hi>cunning:</hi> for these two, passion and cunning, do many times shoulder out one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and generally people without passion are look'd upon as sly and crafty: which of the two is worse, there being more of the <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> in it. It is good therefore sometimes to seem passionate, if you be not so.</p>
               <p>In all treating with other persons try first what may be done by fair means, good words, hopes of gratitude, &amp;c. before you come to power or passion. And let power either of your self or the law be the last.</p>
               <p>When you <hi>consult with a friend about any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,</hi> be not <hi>hasty</hi> to receive a present answer; but give him time to consider; for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and first conceptions of all men are much what the same: at least his <hi>extempore</hi> is not equal to your <hi>premeditated. Physicians</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> answer out of their <hi>trade,</hi> and, as they pretend, by certain rules and cases very like, if not the same, with yours; but it seldom falls out, that the same case in dispatch of business falls out twice; or if it do, yet it is clothed with such various and differing circumstances
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56954:141"/>
(according to which a wise man frames his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) that it is very difficult to give judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The manner is when you <hi>propose a thing</hi> which you are afraid; <hi>will hardly be accepted,</hi> or grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; propose it by <hi>parcels;</hi> that one piece be <hi>digested,</hi> before the other be <hi>swallowed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is better to be near to, and serve, a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal,</hi> then a <hi>thrifty</hi> and <hi>parsimonious, Prince;</hi> tho for the publick this is more advantagious. For the <hi>prodigal</hi> is forced to use divers oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, &amp;c. and more <hi>suffer</hi> by his profuseness then are <hi>benefited</hi> by it; and they commonly are most benefited by it, who least deserve it.</p>
               <p>It seems that <hi>Princes are more free,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of their own will, then other men; but it is contrary in such as govern prudently: for they are necessitated <hi>to act</hi> with infinite cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness and consideration; frequently <hi>to court</hi> even mean persons; and <hi>swallow</hi> many a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pill at their hands. Wherefore <hi>pardon your Prince</hi> if he do not all things exactly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the precise rule of wisedom.</p>
               <p>He, that having bin the means to <hi>advance</hi> another to high degree, thinks to <hi>govern</hi> him, <hi>cancels</hi> his own courtesy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> you find that any <hi>one hath spoken ill of you to your Patron, take no notice</hi> of it; nor be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to vindicate your self; but continue your emploiment without complaining; and <hi>your innocency will</hi> both <hi>appear,</hi> and <hi>prevail</hi> at last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Great enterprises</hi> are <hi>not to be relinquished, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot reconcile all difficulties;</hi> for were all things <hi>easy,</hi> they were not <hi>great;</hi> and could all objections, <hi>i. e.</hi> difficulties be solved, little were left to your courage or discretion. Some
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56954:141"/>
things <hi>Gods providence,</hi> and the course of things render easy; and others are difficult only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>we see not through them</hi> at present.</p>
               <p>The <hi>more you</hi> come <hi>into favor,</hi> the <hi>less ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Cabals</hi> and Juntos, to avoid suspition. Nor converse much with the ordinary servants; for so they will respect you the more. Yet, lest you be hated, be courteous in your salutes, discourses, offers of service, but especially in giving them reasons in your discourse: for then they think you do not despise them. But <hi>if they hate you for any good service done to your Patron,</hi> sell it him dear; that he may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to protect you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Patron really loves a servant wiser then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> let him pretend what he pleaseth; and therefore if you be a person of understanding, covet <hi>not to be too near him,</hi> as of his bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, &amp;c. for Patrons are not pleased that such persons should pry too nearly into their actions and inclinations. Wise men, when they have auy way come in competition with their <hi>Prince,</hi> have alwaies ceded.</p>
               <p>Yet it is <hi>better to be feared and hated,</hi> then <hi>despised.</hi> Wherefore chuse rather to be a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere searcher into, and censurer of, actions; then to be undervalued for taking no notice of them.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Spies</hi> abound in a Court, <hi>discourse in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals;</hi> and give them no cause to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves discovered by you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neutrality</hi> makes the <hi>slowest,</hi> but <hi>surest,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress: for the neuter is connived at through the others mutuall envying.</p>
               <p>A <hi>weak Patron</hi> is <hi>easily gained,</hi> but no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable advantage of honor, or profit, can
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56954:142"/>
be got by him; a <hi>wise Master</hi> is <hi>jealous,</hi> easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost, and then never recovered. If your Master have any near kindred, keep fair with all, for they will certainly prevail; and stick to the best beloved.</p>
               <p>If you light upon a Master that is <hi>inquisitive</hi> after your words and actions, know, that he intends to keep you under. Pray to God not to light upon a <hi>cunning Master;</hi> for either you shall be ruin'd by him; or at best tired with standing upon your guard. In this case make shew not to perceive his subtilty, but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his ingenuity. <hi>Sic ars deluditur arte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If your Patron, by discourse, or actions, endeavors to <hi>conceal any of his vices;</hi> be sure he holds that <hi>dear,</hi> is <hi>deeply engaged</hi> in it, and would enjoy it <hi>without a rival.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To avoid <hi>envy,</hi> affect <hi>not expence</hi> and osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but mind <hi>reality.</hi> For be sure that way, accounted so honourable, leads streight to destruction.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of Servants.</head>
               <p>SINCE <hi>Slavery</hi> was banished Christendom, a <hi>Servant</hi> is no other, then one <hi>hired to</hi> such <hi>emploiment;</hi> and under such terms, as if well observed, the <hi>difference</hi> is <hi>not great</hi> between the condition of the <hi>Master</hi> and the <hi>Servant.</hi> For none can compel another to serve him against his will; nor can I contract with him for his <hi>service,</hi> but at the same time he will bargain with me for his <hi>salary.</hi> I <hi>take</hi> him under my roof, I <hi>make provision</hi> for his sustenance, I <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> him from his enemies; as well as from hunger, cold, and diseases. And what doth he for this? he serveth me? no, he serveth himself. The same labor, he would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go in his own house to maintain himself, and perhaps with great <hi>anxiety,</hi> he doth in mine with <hi>pleasure.</hi> So that now <hi>service</hi> is nothing but a <hi>compact betwixt the rich and the poor,</hi> for their mutual advantage.</p>
               <p>And <hi>to</hi> demand or <hi>imagine,</hi> that <hi>a servant</hi> should <hi>quit</hi> his <hi>own interest,</hi> profit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to procure his Masters, is a folly no considering man will be guilty of.</p>
               <p>Therefore let the <hi>Master command</hi> according to <hi>reason</hi> and sweetness; not so imperiously, or with such opprobrious language as may justly discontent or chase away a <hi>Servant.</hi> If he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey with cheerfulness, and affection, he may at length perhaps make his Masters interest his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:56954:143"/>
If you pay him not his wages, he will pay himself.</p>
               <p>In controversies, let the Master sometimes <hi>cede to his servant,</hi> to keep his mettal in breath; and not too severe, if the faults be small, or committed for want of Judgment, or through a little itch of liberty. Let the Master be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>blind,</hi> and the servant <hi>deaf.</hi> But <hi>faults of malice,</hi> or impiety are not to be pardoned. <hi>The first</hi> such fault is the Servants; <hi>the second</hi> divided between Master and Servant; <hi>the third,</hi> wholly the Masters. <hi>Correct</hi> him not before Strangers, but if correction amend him not, rid your hands of him; both for his sake, your own, and the scandal of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rich men</hi> are inclined to <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>contemt</hi> of others; for having wealth, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all things in the great Market of this World, they are apt to become insolent, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant, impatient of disobedience, denial, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, or advice. And because <hi>ostentation of happiness is one part of it;</hi> therefore are rich men <hi>vain glorious,</hi> desirous to be observed, and to live splendidly. And men newly enriched, and without their own industry more vain then they, who are born so, or have by industry acquired great estates. <hi>Men in power</hi> also are more honorable, gallant, generous, and less vain then the rich.</p>
               <p>Also because <hi>great estates</hi> are commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired with <hi>little,</hi> and <hi>small ones</hi> not without <hi>great,</hi> labor; therefore are rich men apt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt themselves as either above others, in parts, or the favor of God, both which are very great and dangerous <hi>errors,</hi> but difficultly to be eradicated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:56954:143"/>
Let them not, therefore, mistake <hi>morosity</hi> for <hi>grandeur,</hi> and passion for greatness. It is better to subdue your Servants <hi>reason,</hi> as well as his <hi>strength</hi> and diligence.</p>
               <p>And those, <hi>who betake</hi> themselves <hi>to the rich,</hi> are to <hi>comport with</hi> their <hi>follies,</hi> impertinencies, and contumelies; and to <hi>conceale</hi> them. It is better they should <hi>love</hi> their Masters, but <hi>by no means hate them;</hi> or speak evil of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backs. Not <hi>dispute</hi> their Masters judgment; not <hi>vy wit,</hi> taunt or rally, with them; not use familiarity without leave; but to put on <hi>patience,</hi> when they put on a <hi>livery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To admonish and reprehend is not an action of an Inferior; and an <hi>affectionate disrespect ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth not so much by its sincerity,</hi> as <hi>it provokes by its ill example;</hi> wherefore when you advise your Superior, do it so, as it may be accepted. And let not the Master refuse to <hi>hear</hi> the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Servant, tho he <hi>follow it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No man</hi> ever <hi>miscaried through excess of respect;</hi> or was disgraced for retaining a constant and proportionate sense of his Patrons grandeur. Yet Patrons love not sullen, melancholic, austere, grave, or silent, Servants.</p>
               <p>A Master ought <hi>not</hi> to <hi>divertise himself with</hi> his <hi>Inferiors,</hi> nor make his Servants privy to his infirmities and failures; but if he do, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant must not presume, nor heighten himself for it. But let him be secret, and faithful to him.</p>
               <p>Let the Servant also know, that <hi>it is harder to menage well his Masters affairs then his own;</hi> let him therefore be more careful. For he hath more temtations to negligence and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honesty. Besides his Masters business is not
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56954:144"/>
alwaies to be menaged the <hi>best way;</hi> but that he <hi>likes best.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Put your Servants to <hi>emploiments proper for their condition,</hi> years, capacities, &amp;c. but never upon <hi>unnecessary trouble;</hi> for that is to <hi>abuse,</hi> not <hi>use,</hi> a Servant, and will cause them to hate you.</p>
               <p>Those Servants justly expect to be <hi>rewarded extraordinarily,</hi> whose industry and diligence seem to merit it. (For <hi>gratitude being the least of virtues, ingratitude is the most infamous of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> especially in a great person:) and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding is so to be done, as the other servants do not resent it. That therefore is best done after some <hi>signal service.</hi> But beware of equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all your Servants in your gifts, or rewards: for the discreeter and <hi>Superior</hi> hold it an affront to be equalled with the rest; and the <hi>Inferior</hi> made proud: but none more obliged then they, who catch mony thrown about in a solemnity, to render thanks to the Donor. Some there are, who defer their rewards till some festival, as <hi>Christmas,</hi> or <hi>Easter:</hi> But then the <hi>day</hi> is thanked, <hi>not</hi> the <hi>giver;</hi> and after you are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to it, 'tis expected as <hi>due,</hi> and part of wages, not <hi>kindness</hi> and bounty.</p>
               <p>It is better to be somewhat <hi>sparing</hi> then <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to a good Servant;</hi> for as he grows full, he inclines either to be idle, or to leave you. And his murmuring you may govern by a seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reward.</p>
               <p>It seldom happens that a <hi>reconciliation</hi> of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and Servant is <hi>sincere;</hi> therefore return not to a service, whence you have been ejected.</p>
               <p>In places which concern mony, employ not your <hi>kindred;</hi> nor use them as your Servants;
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56954:144"/>
for they will presume upon their condition, and you cannot with reputation break with them. And truly, if you be a single person, I cannot forbear to recommend to you a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a great Prelate; that a <hi>Courtier at Rome ought to have 1000. Ducats rent, 2000. in his purse,</hi> and be 1000. miles from his kindred.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of giving, receiving, and promising.</head>
               <p>IT is <hi>uncivil</hi> and unfitting for <hi>a man to oblige</hi> another <hi>to keep a promise disadvantagious</hi> to him; or one made in mirth, passion, hast, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisedly, in civility, or compliment, or one obsolete; as also not to admit of a reasonable excuse for the failure of a promise.</p>
               <p>It becometh <hi>every man</hi> to <hi>promise nothing but what he intends to perform:</hi> yet many, tho justly denied, are much displeased; for all men govern not themselves by reason. Insomuch that if a person desire to engage your indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors in his business, if you shew him the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, tho you promise your assistance, he commonly takes it for a denial, or a sign that you intend not seriously to befriend him. For these and such like reasons, the fashion now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies is, to <hi>give good hopes to all suiters,</hi> and <hi>to promise very freely</hi> and largely. And they find thereby great advantage (as they think) for carrying on business. The performance is
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56954:145"/>
                  <hi>sometimes</hi> hindred by unexpected casualities; <hi>sometimes</hi> a good and plausible excuse goes a great way; <hi>sometimes</hi> the party suffers himself to be wheedled with good words. Yet 'tis so <hi>ignoble</hi> and dishonorable a thing for a man <hi>to be worse then his word,</hi> that it never ought to be done. But this may he do; he may enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all suiters with general or conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and fair words: and tho all men ought to look at effects, and not words; yet have good words a wonderful power (take heed of being fool'd by them) I suppose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every one values himself, and his merits, at more then he is worth; and he is offended when that price is not set upon him, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thinks to deserve.</p>
               <p>At Court they are wont to promise and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer service largely, especially to those, who are not likely to make use of them; but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ordinary conversants they are more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, because better known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grant a Courtesy</hi> (if you intend it) <hi>without much asking,</hi> for that doubles it. To keep long in suspense is churlish, and by long expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the passion to the favor dies, and the courtesy is not esteemed, nor thanks heartily given for it. <hi>Monsignior Pamfilio</hi> (afterwards <hi>Innocent X.)</hi> in his Nunciature in <hi>France,</hi> and ever after was called <hi>Monsignior-non-si-puo.</hi> From his frequent use of that answer to Suitors. Do your favors <hi>cheerfully,</hi> not as if they slipt through your fingers, or were stollen or wrested from you. And do them <hi>readily,</hi> for the intreater submits himself to the intreated; his modesty therefore must be considered. <hi>Non è cosa piu cara, che quella, che con priegh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> si compra.</hi> Do
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56954:145"/>
them also without considering whether they be <hi>lost,</hi> or likely to be <hi>recompensed;</hi> for a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous and generous person looks not to receive as much again; for that is the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy of <hi>Tradesmen.</hi> Be not as the Barbarous King of <hi>Madagascar</hi> that demanded more for the cowes <hi>he gave,</hi> then his subjects for those <hi>they sold;</hi> for he said, that his good will and kindness was to be recompensed. And if you deny, do it with good words; as if you were sorry you could not pleasure him.</p>
               <p>Be <hi>not niggardly of that which costs you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> as Counsel, <hi>Countenance,</hi> and the like. But beware of being <hi>security;</hi> rather offer to lend mony of your own upon others bond.</p>
               <p>And by no means sell your Ceremonies, nor pay your creditors, friends, and servants with good words, looks, and smoak.</p>
               <p>After a courtesy done, <hi>if you upbraid it, you lose it;</hi> one principal end of giving being to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the receiver to your self and interest. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too much undervalue, nor extol your gift; but rather diminish, and excuse, when you give: seeming pleas'd so small a matter stood in such stead, and was so well placed, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; that you shall be ready to do greater service upon occasion; but when you receive a favor, rather augment it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He is not ungrateful, who cannot, but who will not, repay; will not</hi> through malignity and evil disposition. Wherefore a generous spirit is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, when the receiver declares his acceptance of the courtesy, and acknowledgeth the favor and honor; for that shews he hath a good mind to be grateful; if he were able.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After a courtesy received, be not in hast to return</hi>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:56954:146"/>
                  <hi>another;</hi> for that shews you are not willing to be beholden, nor return a much greater, for that seems to reproach the smalness of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>Those <hi>who</hi> willingly <hi>alwaies receive and never give,</hi> or those who would alwaies give and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive, (of which melancholic generous humor some few there are) are not much esteemed in conversation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Towards</hi> other mens <hi>Servants the custom of the Country is to be followed.</hi> In many places the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster takes it ill if his Servant be considerably rewarded for what himself gives. But it is not so with us; where to lodg at a friends house is dearer, besides the inconvenience, then at a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Inne; and where what a friend sends, is perhaps a <hi>present,</hi> but not a <hi>gift;</hi> when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver paies double, <hi>the value</hi> to the Messenger, and <hi>an acknowledgment</hi> to the sender. However in all places in entertainment, great care is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>the Servants be pleased,</hi> for the tongues of idle persons are loos-hung.</p>
               <p>If you desire a courtesy from one beholding to you, 'tis ingenuous <hi>not to put him in mind of it;</hi> least he think you tax him of ingratitude.</p>
               <p>A <hi>favor done to a man sinking,</hi> or in any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>is</hi> alwaies very <hi>obliging;</hi> both because it te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies <hi>sincerity</hi> without expectation of a return, and a <hi>good opinion</hi> of the receiver; to whom the giver <hi>needs</hi> not to be <hi>favorable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Most <hi>men do more for interest</hi> either of gain, or friends, <hi>then reason.</hi> More for <hi>favor,</hi> then <hi>obligation.</hi> But mony, if well and discreetly applyed, seldom fails of its effect.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of Prudence in acquiring emploiment, and preferment.</head>
               <p n="1">1. PRESUPPOSING, that a person, out of a good and sincere intention to serve his Prince and Country, desires to employ himself, or be employed, in such a condition; it is necessary, first, that he <hi>avoid such hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran ces which are contrary to,</hi> and destructive of, <hi>his design.</hi> 2ly That he <hi>use proper means to the compassing it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. HINDRANCES are, 1. <hi>Pride,</hi> which renders him intolerable to him that should raise him; and tho to avoid this, such men as are most insolent toward their Inferiors, are most supple (even to baseness) towards their Superiors, yet is it very <hi>difficult to conceale this vice</hi> from any considering person; even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one of these actions betrayeth the other, both proceeding from the same lowness and <hi>vileness of spirit.</hi> Where it is, it renders its owner impatient of advice, admonition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, even in <hi>his own</hi> affairs; by which he becomes a prey to flatterers, despised of all good men, odious to all upon whose dues and interests he usurps, and unfit to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. 2. <hi>Anger,</hi> for what Prince desires to be served by, or chuse instruments out of, <hi>Bedlam?</hi> and if prudence consist in much <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation;</hi>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:56954:147"/>
                  <hi>precipitiousness,</hi> the daughter of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> is incompatible with it. If it be said that angry men are <hi>good natur'd;</hi> yet what discreet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son will suffer such, and so many, <hi>impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> to enjoy now and then a <hi>little good nature, i. e.</hi> so many storms to have sometimes fair weather? Who will be content to stay for a little reason, till the <hi>choler</hi> be scum'd, and the boiling ceased? <hi>Two to one in all things against the angry man, was a saying of Cardinal Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</hi> 3. So <hi>following good companions</hi> or intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and <hi>lewd Women,</hi> discover secrets, render a man contemtible, and unuseful; for besides that strong Drinks and Tobacco fill the head with imaginations, hot headedness, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, &amp;c. when a man should hast to his emploiment, he must go to sleep, or to his Mistress. 4. He that is by nature <hi>lazy</hi> and <hi>slothfull</hi> ought not to intermeddle with public affairs; for tho in quiet and dull times he may serve well enough to pursue <hi>formalities;</hi> yet when any activeness, he fills up the room of a better person. 5. <hi>Covetousness</hi> is not so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimental, as <hi>Liberality</hi> and bounty discreetly placed, are advantagious. But 6. there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worse then an <hi>unbridled toung.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. HE that would serve <hi>God</hi> as well as his <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>save his Soul</hi> as well as <hi>make his fortune,</hi> must beware of such temtations as are most frequent in that sort of life. Such are <hi>Ambition, i. e.</hi> desiring advancement for an evill end, or more then he deserves, or at unseasonable times, or too eagerly, or for his own private advantage, and not to serve the public. <hi>Envy at others preserment;</hi> with all the consequents of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56954:147"/>
it, hatred, detraction, faction, partiality and the like. <hi>Adulation</hi> or complacency with the Prince, or other great person in vitious, or unfitting, courses. And the like.</p>
               <p n="4">4. IT is <hi>impossible to be preferr'd if not known,</hi> and so <hi>known</hi> as <hi>approved</hi> also: and no man can reasonably be offended for being passed by, and neglected, if he use not rational means to make himself accepted. Such means are of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sorts. As</p>
               <p>1. By <hi>merit;</hi> and that either by ordinary, or extraordinary, good service. 2. By <hi>friends,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing introduced or recommended by such as are in favor and reputation with the Prince. 3. By <hi>fear and terror,</hi> being so considerable as that the Prince is glad for his own security to employ him. 4. By <hi>flattery</hi> and evil insinuations into the Princes affections.</p>
               <p n="5">5. HE that hath no other Introduction must <hi>shew himself diligently;</hi> that the Prince (who observeth more then he seemeth to do) may take notice of him; besides, there falls out fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occasions of employing <hi>him, that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;</hi> and a <hi>constant attendance,</hi> tho volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, is a <hi>kind of service.</hi> And, he that loseth a beginning tho not so considerable, loseth an introduction to greater matters.</p>
               <p n="6">6. THERE are <hi>few of whose merits the Prince can</hi> be a just and accurate <hi>Judg;</hi> because he is not witness to all the circumstances, &amp;c. of their actions. Besides to know a man, requires much familiarity with, and observation of, him. But such precise knowledg is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56954:148"/>
and a Prince may, with but a reasonable observation, discern a <hi>wise man</hi> from a <hi>fool,</hi> and a <hi>virtuous man</hi> from <hi>one</hi> inclined to <hi>those vices,</hi> which render him unfit for service. But if a Prince be forc'd to see only with others eyes, and hear with others ears, he had need to be very wary; for those are very <hi>seldom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> toward the person recommended; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form more frequently for their own interest, then the Princes. Wherefore a wise man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leives little, but keeps himself in suspense till the truth be manifest.</p>
               <p>He that is <hi>chosen by the Judgment of his Prince,</hi> and not by the recommendation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, hath a great advantage; for if he prove well, the Prince is inwardly proud of his choice; and will certainly employ him further; for he looks upon him as his <hi>creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wise</hi> and subtil <hi>Princes seldom</hi> prize or <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> a <hi>man wiser then themselves,</hi> except in some case of great necessity. They are also commonly very wary of employing such as are recommended by public fame; except it be in smaller matters.</p>
               <p>Consider therefore, what <hi>emploiment you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive most suitable</hi> to your <hi>Genius</hi> and condition, <hi>v. g.</hi> whether War or Peace; Sea or Land-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; action or advice; governing; or finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and providing mony or necessaries. And endeavor to render your self <hi>very able</hi> in that; tho it is fitting also you should not neglect other matters. Also disrobe your self (as much as you can) of all particular interest; and at least prefer in your designs the advantage of your Prince and the public.</p>
               <p>A small <hi>emploiment in youth,</hi> or betimes, is
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56954:148"/>
much more to be valued then a great one in old age; for <hi>Di cosa nasce cosa.</hi> One business twists in another. And suffer not your self (as much as is possible) to be out of possession of doing somewhat. If you be, yet by continual presentation of your self, let it be known that you stay there ready to be hired.</p>
               <p>It is good sometimes to <hi>sue for an emploiment, tho you be sure to miss it.</hi> For by that means, you shew your self to imagine that you have some pretences to be considered. And your Superior, having once denied you, will be more ready to pleasure you another time, for fear of discontenting you; especially if you be a man of parts. But by no means put in for every thing, for that discovers your <hi>Ambition;</hi> and a conceit of your self, that you are fit for every thing.</p>
               <p>You <hi>cannot be Master of what emploiment you please;</hi> but your commendation must be, <hi>well</hi> to <hi>perform that you are</hi> actually <hi>possess'd of.</hi> In a <hi>Comedy,</hi> he that acts a <hi>Slave</hi> well, deserves as much as he that personates a <hi>King.</hi> 'Tis a comfortable hearing, <hi>friend come up higher.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuse or contemn any reward or gratuity, how small soever, your Prince bestows upon you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Design not upon what is not in your power.</hi> And remember that being to deal with other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, you must drive the nail which way it will go. Therefore be as indifferent as is possible. Your future gains also not being in your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, spend not upon the hopes of them: and remember, that expectation is alwaies greater then the reality.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:56954:149"/>
7. HE is happy that hath an opportunity given him to shew <hi>signally his prudence and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty. Sejanus,</hi> by one action, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generous or fortunate, of saving <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s life with the hazzard of his own, obtained that reputation, that he governed the whole Empire; and had almost settled it upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; through the great confidence <hi>Tiberius,</hi> otherwise a very jealous Prince, had in him. But these cases fall out seldom, and by the immediate Providence (as I may say) of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God,</p>
               <p>If you chance to do any <hi>great action,</hi> be sure to give the <hi>glory</hi> of it to the <hi>Prince;</hi> as indeed he, in some sort, deserves it: for you follow his <hi>commands,</hi> or <hi>instructions.</hi> Besides the <hi>means,</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> of all such are his only; and it was performed under his <hi>authority.</hi> Seem not to be willing to draw all businesses to your self; nor keep too great grandeur in house, followers, &amp;c. for that gives ombrage to the Prince; as great titles are offensive to the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-subjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Extraordinary service,</hi> if many ingaged in it, is counted a <hi>piece of duty,</hi> and seldom rewarded. Either because the Prince, pretending that he cannot gratify <hi>all,</hi> to avoid murmuring and emulation, will reward <hi>none.</hi> Or because those about him, if many others be to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are likely to find the less share for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>It was a saying of <hi>Antigonus; first get power then good will.</hi> Power is ability of parts, wealth, friends, emploiment; then good will and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation by courtesy, civility, and other acts of prudent conversation; as also by drawing
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56954:149"/>
others by your interest. For you may then engage many unto you, and spread your roots and fibres a great way: especially if by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Justice and bounty, you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured you a veneration amongst virtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. For by this they are assured, that they may securely lean upon you, and run your hazzards.</p>
               <p>And it is more desirable <hi>to be loved</hi> then <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored:</hi> this indeed is more splendid, but that is more safe; this is greater, that better; this is in the imagination, that in the heart, of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; from that proceeds peace with others, tranquillity in his condition, and a compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in his own mind. Yet is love harder to obtain, requires a greater time, the acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it is subject to many difficulties, which honor is not; and therefore make much of honor; which also carrieth a tincture of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with it. Only remember what a great General said. I desire to honor my life not by other mens opinions, but my own actions.</p>
               <p n="8">8. BECAUSE more men are <hi>drawn,</hi> then <hi>heaved,</hi> up. And that amongst ingenious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons there is alwaies <hi>emulation,</hi> and amongst <hi>rivals</hi> (and for all preferments such there are) <hi>envyings</hi> also; which are great rubs; and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly surmounted or removed; endeavor to make a friend; who may give an <hi>Antidote</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their <hi>poyson;</hi> and by lending his hand raise you in spight of all the weight and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures they can hang upon you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friends are not easily made,</hi> and still more difficulty amongst great persons; both because they have fewer equals, and amongst such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56954:150"/>
emulation is frequenter then friendship; yet are they not so rare, but they may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd. For long, especially youthful, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; kindred and relation; sympathy in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; partaking in a common danger; or such like, do reconcile friendship, but not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently: nor are these means in every mans power, they are obligations by which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence only tyes men together. But there are others also which are more ordinary; for you <hi>insinuate</hi> your self <hi>into the affection</hi> even <hi>of a great person,</hi> if you can shew him, that you are able to strengthen, assist, and confirm him, in his estate; and be able by your parts, or other way, to recompense the favors you expect from him. But <hi>mony</hi> discreetly applied is a plaister that unites and soders all affections: nor is there any <hi>Heart,</hi> as well as not any <hi>Castle,</hi> that can resist its battery, if rightly placed.</p>
               <p>To <hi>desire wealth</hi> for its own sake, is low, sordid, and proper only for them, who make the obtaining it their Profession: but to desire it moderately, in order to do more good, is unblamable. Even <hi>Reputation</hi> it self is acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and sustained by discreetly keeping and spending; so that it also is in a manner sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to wealth.</p>
               <p>We <hi>seldom</hi> see that <hi>wealth increaseth in a family for three generations</hi> together: perhaps because that he, who comes into a plentiful fortune, having no occasion to employ his parts and industry, grows lazy, and negligent, or at best betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to some other affairs; or perhaps, because men not knowing the difficulty in obtaining it value it not much; but rather look after the splendor of the World, whereunto rich men
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56954:150"/>
commonly engage and enter their Children; and for that reason live at the height of the reputation of their estate.</p>
               <p>The Prudence to obtain wealth is generally conceived to be <hi>cutting off superfluous</hi> or unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <hi>expences:</hi> but that is not all; for there is also required good menagery, or making your penny go further then another mans. But in this, Caution must be used, for many have bin ruined by buying good pennyworths.</p>
               <p>In <hi>making friends by mony</hi> Prudence also is required, lest you lose <hi>that</hi> also. For it is best used upon an <hi>exigent; occasionally</hi> rather then <hi>frequently;</hi> and <hi>actually</hi> rather then <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly;</hi> like a <hi>wedg,</hi> not like a <hi>saw.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many can hurt who cannot profit.</hi> And the ill tongue of an <hi>Inferior</hi> many times harms more then that of an <hi>Equal;</hi> for it is easilier beleived, because less suspected. Therefore endeavor to keep a fair reputation with all persons; with Superiors humble and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, not low and flattering; with equals grave, not morose; with inferiors courteous and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoken, not sullen or imperious. Considering, that no man is willing to own him, that is out of fashion, as I may say, out of the good opinion of the World.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>more dangerous to offend Sejanus</hi> then <hi>Tiberius.</hi> For all men raised from low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are more jealous of affronts and contemts; which a natural and generous Superior is not: who interprets nothing to be contemt but what is <hi>meerly</hi> so, or done on purpose to affront; and nothing to be so, but what cannot well be construed otherwise. To such therefore, as <hi>Sejanus,</hi> you must carry your self so, as not to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:56954:151"/>
be hated by him; for you will find it hard to please both the Patron and him. Besides you know not how long he will last; and it goes hard with a man of understanding and spirit, that <hi>his good must depend upon two, and his ill upon one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you <hi>cannot be reconciled to a favorite, be</hi> sure to <hi>tell your Patron that he is your enemy;</hi> so his ill offices cannot hurt you.</p>
               <p>It is unpardonable <hi>folly to quarrel with them, who are</hi> much <hi>your Superiors;</hi> for the thred breaks where it is weakest.</p>
               <p>If you be so ill satisfied of any person, that you think not fit to pardon or bear with him any longer, yet let him not know so much; for the time may come when you shall have need of him. And if you resolve to chastise him, discover it not, lest you be prevented. But this is not to be used but in extremity, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards persons incorrigible. For, according to the rules of our most holy Faith, 'tis infinitely better not to revenge at all, but to pass by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; then which no man can shew greater wisedome. And this is not very difficult if you stifle quarrels in the beginning. But there are some so wicked dispositions, that nothing works upon them but fear; and he that lets them go unpunished, encourageth them in their evil courses.</p>
               <p>Whether you expect emploiment and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, or chuse a private life, if you have any thing to lose, <hi>Endeavovr to be in Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with your Prince</hi> and Superior: and trust not to your innocency, or wary living. For besides, that he cannot want an occasion some time or other to punish you, you know not
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:56954:151"/>
what may happen, wherein you shall stand in need of him.</p>
               <p>Much less presume, that <hi>your manners are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discovered,</hi> or to commit any fault upon hopes of secrecy; for a good Judge will so entangle and hamper you, that you cannot escape. And if you be once suspected, more suspicions will be continually suggested against you. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to have much suspicion and little proof makes against you, for it is a sign that you are more dangerous.</p>
               <p>No <hi>man can stand alwaies upon his guard,</hi> but sometimes he will faile and mistake; happy he whose errors are in small matters, that he need not great applications and much endeavor to get himself off the shallow. Nor can a man on a suddain foresee the depth of a question, or the consequences of an action. Therefore when you doubt, or see not clearly, be wary, and take time. Many times small mistakes produce great evil effects; and great mistakes sometimes none at all; wherefore contemn no danger, how little soever it seem to threaten. Be vigilant; <hi>Cavendi nulla est dimittenda occasio.</hi> It is much better to do so, then be beholding to your friend to fetch you off; for that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted equal to, if not greater then, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable benefit.</p>
               <p>Give not much heed to those, who would perswade you to quit your emploiment; or pretend themselves to be weary of business; have they not a mind to succede you? or are they not like the <hi>Fox,</hi> that having lost his own tail, would perswade all the rest to cut off theirs?</p>

9. 'TIS not an unusual way to obtain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment to shew a mans-self so considerable as to <hi>fright his Prince</hi> into compliance. In reason this should be an ill means, but experience shewes, that under lasch Superiors, or such as are under-hatches, it many times thrives well enough. Upon the same grounds proceed also those, who endeavor to make themselves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to their Prince; and so rivet themselves into his business, that they cannot be drawn out without tearing the piece.</p>
               <p>But of such the <hi>Prince is</hi> alwaies <hi>jealous;</hi> and will at some time or other <hi>emancipate</hi> himself. He therefore that takes this course walkes upon a precipice, and the further he goes the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is his ruine likely to be. The Count of <hi>S. Paul</hi> took his measures upon these grounds in <hi>Lewis X I.</hi> time. But he had to do with a Prince of extraordinary parts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>people</hi> (upon whose recommendation many persons think to raise themselves) <hi>guide not themselves by reason,</hi> but chance; therefore he is not wise that strives to make himself their favorite, or forceth himself to gain their affection. For they will never do the like for him again, nor forgo the least of their profit for his greatest benefit. On the contrary, the Nature of the people and of all mean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, is, alwaies to <hi>value themselves,</hi> as if all men were obliged to augment and better their degree: 'tis best therefore to deny them at first, when their desires are modest. For if you once grant, you must never after refuse, lest your former courtesy be lost; and to think to satisfy them is to give drink to an Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic. Yet, if occasion offer it self to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:56954:152"/>
by them; or if your virtue and good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions have procured their favor, neglect it not. For a <hi>general plausibility</hi> may stand you in great stead; besides that, it may be very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious by your good menagement to your Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Popularity</hi> is one of the lowest and meanest sorts of <hi>Ambition;</hi> a refuge commonly of those who envy such as have prevented them in the lawful acquiring advancement by the favor of their superiors. And the thoughts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being meaner and lower then theirs, they are forced to do and say many things contrary to their own judgments and inclinations. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the people, being necessitous, measure all things by advantage, so that their favor is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable, and seldom any other then breath and air, except Religion be in the case.</p>
               <p>If you arrive to any power, be very <hi>wary how you tamper to change governments</hi> (which is usually the refuge of necessitous persons.) For not being able to perform it your self, you must of necessity trust your cause and person to many foolish and open persons. Yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more frequently ruins such designs then too much caution for security. For that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires longer time; and employs more persons about the principal business; and is subject to many more accidents.</p>
               <p>In <hi>court</hi> have many <hi>acquaintances,</hi> but make a <hi>friend</hi> for advice and consultation <hi>out of Court,</hi> and one that is not likely to have any interest in your Patron.</p>
               <p n="10">10. THE service of a Prince is procuring that his <hi>will and intentions be fulfilled:</hi> for no
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56954:153"/>
man esteems that (be it never so good) that is not according to his own desires. Such there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as his desires are, such must they be whom he employs: for they are looked upon as only the Instruments for his compassing and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about his purposes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore they, who seem most zealous to perform the Princes will in all things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deliberation, or interposing their own judgement concerning the lawfulness or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of them, seem to be in the plainest road to preferment. Yet divers of the wisest Princes have made even <hi>that,</hi> the criterion to exclude men from their favour; and retain such, as upon tryal were found constantly virtuous.</p>
               <p>Princes usually more esteem one that is <hi>Phil-Alexandros,</hi> then one that is <hi>Philo-Basileus,</hi> that is, more one, that loves his person, then his state and condition, then his Nation, then the public; tho this is indeed the more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and the other more easily counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited. But in reality <hi>Princes have very few,</hi> if any, <hi>friends</hi> to their persons; for they have no equals, nor familiars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for indeed few wise men will expose themselves to so much hazzard, nor set themselves as pales against the wind, but for their own advantage. Besides they know that if any difficulty happen, it is reasonable they should be deserted. Wherefore they ought to make much of those, who are truly <hi>Philo-Basiless,</hi> for there are too few of them, who are <hi>sincerely</hi> even <hi>so affected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an action of very great Prudence to <hi>carry even between adulation and sowreness.</hi> Neither to be as the <hi>Cook,</hi> that aimes onely at pleasure;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:56954:153"/>
nor as the <hi>Physician,</hi> who intends only health; but to mingle and ajust them together. Whilst we retain <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>friendship,</hi> not to scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>interest</hi> is a difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Yet not impossible, for <hi>M. Lepidus</hi> kept to the end his authority with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> a very jealous Prince, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> observes.</p>
               <p>Flattery and obsequiousnes is a more quick and ready way to advancement, then either durable or laudable. For when discovered to be such, it is contemtible, and afterwards odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. It is but lead that bends and plies every way; nor is he a man either of virtue or cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that can condescend to make himself <hi>universal Minister</hi> to any one. Consequently he is neither faithful in his emploiment, when he eyes a greater reward; nor constant to him, when he spies danger.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>flatterers</hi> there are two sorts 1. <hi>Bouffons,</hi> whose cheif insinuation is to eat and be cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Who like the <hi>Ape,</hi> finding himself nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fit to carry burdens as the <hi>Asse,</hi> nor to keep the house, as the <hi>Dog,</hi> betakes himself to make sport. These are easily discovered, and their worst is not very dangerous. 2. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort are more <hi>subtil,</hi> gentile, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous; whose designs are to <hi>intrigue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into business;</hi> to make fortunes, and get estates, or perhaps honors, by universal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance. These, by observing the actions and discourses of their <hi>pretended Patron,</hi> discover his inclination, as <hi>Hunters</hi> do the haunts of wild Beasts, that they may easilier intrap them. It is their interest he should be <hi>vitious,</hi> careless, irregular, and extravagant; for by that means, they can more <hi>easily withdraw</hi> him from all
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56954:154"/>
                  <hi>virtuous persons,</hi> and ingross him to themselves: who have no other way to ingratiate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but their ready compliance with all his desires. This they endeavor should pass for <hi>affection</hi> to his person; and they represent all other <hi>advisers,</hi> either as contemners of him; or at best as morose and of evil humor.</p>
               <p>Therefore they <hi>pretend to Idolize him;</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his counsels and commands as <hi>Oracles;</hi> not <hi>to converse</hi> with those he suspects; <hi>to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh</hi> against his enemies; <hi>to make</hi> him the head of their own Counsels; and themselves to be even in their particular affairs ruled by him; <hi>to take</hi> great content in serving him; <hi>to praise</hi> him immoderately before those who will be sure to inform him of it; to exaggerate every small favor received from him; and to dissemble the injuries.</p>
               <p>They also are careful to new-name all his vices. Covetousnes they call Providence; jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy, circumspection; Prodigality is generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, &amp;c. Then they compare him with others either of a contrary vice, if the man be hated; or of the same, if in any reputation. They feign also in themselves the same inclinations, sympathy, sentiments with their Patron. And often undervalue themselves in respect of him. They are also apt to praise him for what he hath not done, or extravagantly for what he hath done, glosing and varnishing all miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, &amp;c. and few there are who are not taken even with this one bait. For who is he that values not himself above his deserts, and thinks not all is his due which is given? In reality, the refusing or accepting of praise ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally and discreetly, is as great a trial of a
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:56954:154"/>
wise man, as the cupel is of silver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Master esteems a Servant, of whom he hath no need;</hi> and that either for his abilities (of which few Masters can judg) or because he knows his secrets; this then being the easilier and securer, is that way, which flatterers, and all those who endeavor to make themselves great by unlawful means, chuse to walk in. And of all secrets, they most desire to be privy to his vices, for by that means he becomes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to them.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Doing ill Offices</hi> these flatterers observe, 1. to do them seldom. 2. To tolerate, if not confirm, the praises of him they design upon; lest they be suspected to have done it out of malice. 3. To pretend no small or inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable occasion, nor their own concerns, but a public one only, and in defence of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors. 4. To dispose their words so, as they may seem casual and unpremeditated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artis est celare Artem;</hi> they endeavor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by all means to be accounted sincere and upright persons; for they see that the fame of being crafty and subtil (which is the great skill they really pretend to) much retards, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes their businesses. In general conversation therefore none more open and free; none seeming by their discourse more noble and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous. But their confidence is in simulation and duplicity; which, because of other mens evil dealing, they pretend is necessary.</p>
               <p>They often pretend, and endeavor, to be <hi>in esteem with the Clergy;</hi> especially those who make shew of greatest severity, and holines. And of so great force is the shew of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that even an hypocrite is feared and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:56954:155"/>
Hereby also they have considerable advantages; that they can decry all vices, even those themselves are guilty of; and can safely asperse those whom they hate or fear; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy are they, that fall into their hands.</p>
               <p n="11">11. PRINCES, when they have denied a favor, to one that importunately sues for it, <hi>are apt to suspect that such a one hates them</hi> for the denial: and therefore afterward look not well upon that person. Wherefore <hi>be not too earnest</hi> in your requests. And if your misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune be to be denied, be sure not to shew such resentment, as he may suspect you intend him any harm. Rather seem to be content with any slender shew of reason he gives you; so you may obtain, if not this, yet some other favor.</p>
               <p>But if you perceive his mind to be alienated from you, retire betimes; for a man falling is by every one thrust downwards. Besides all the miscarriages and errors will be surely laid upon your shouldiers, notwithstanding all your innocency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Do violence to your self rather then not conceal or dissemble the injuries done you by your Prince</hi> or Patron. For should you declare your self unsatisfied, so far would he be from compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onating, or making amends, to, you; that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the least occasion he will hate you.</p>
