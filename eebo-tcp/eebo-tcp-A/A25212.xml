            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Received yours, which brought along with it, both its own welcome, the assurance of your restered health, and continued Love, and also my own entertainment, <hi>The serious and Compassionate Inquirie.</hi> I have now perused it with as much <hi>seriousness</hi> as't was written, and return'd it with mere <hi>clemency</hi> then it deserves; and must confess my self cast down so much the lower by my disappointments upon the Reading it by how much the flattering title had rais'd me higher to expect from thence mere healing counsels. I have read of a Polish Embassador in <hi>Queen Hizabeths</hi> dayes, who at his landing whisper'd it abroad that his Embassy was Peace, but when admitted to his Audience, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a war: Her Majesty with invincible patience attended the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up of his long-winded Oration, and then cries out <hi>Heu quam decepta fui, Legatum expectavi, Heraldum accepi!</hi> I expected a Dove with an Olive branch in his mouth, and I tread upon a snake, with a menacing sting in his Tail! Iust such another treat has your <hi>Inquirer</hi> given me. The <hi>Title</hi> raised me on tip-tocs to see at length that famous <hi>weapon-salve;</hi> which might consolidate the Churches bleeding wounds, but the Book presents me with <hi>a weapon ready drawn</hi> to render them more wide, and more incurable. You see, <hi>Real passion,</hi> will not long conceal it self under <hi>feigned compassion,</hi> Nemo diu egit Hypocritam!

            </p>
            <p>It's come in fashion again I perceive to Lard lean discourses with grave sentences, and therefore that you may not think I am cap't, let me remember you of <hi>Seneca. Infeliciter aegrotat, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And therefore your great Pretenders might do well to forbear their slighter Applications, which do but exasperate the Humour, for the more we tamper with improper Means, the less success must we expect from those that are proper, and proportionable.</p>

            <p>You might perhaps please your self with a thought, That the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorick of this Discourse would proselyte one of whose intellectuals you had just cause to think nothing but mean, and Contemptible.

An <hi>Epicurean,</hi> can nuzzle in <hi>the same straw,</hi> with a swine of his <hi>own stye:</hi> and truly it was well thought on; <hi>saevis inter se convenit ursis.</hi> But Christianity enlarges our love to a greater Latitude, it raises our affections to a Nobler pitch, cordially to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace with the best Armes of Good will whoever are <hi>Dignified with the Image of Christ,</hi> though not <hi>Distinguisht with our own super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,</hi> nor express the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>It's true, we cannot without Abhorrence, and Recoil of Spirit behold those Monstrous births, which nature (ever designing regularly, yet through the ineptitude of her tools and Matter, miscarrying in her operations) does sometimes affright the world with; Nor can we bear those prodigious heresies, and uncouth blasphemies, the <hi>by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blows</hi> of depraved nature, begotten by a <hi>Corrupt Head,</hi> upon <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Heart,</hi> yet even towards <hi>these,</hi> we ought not to be more monstrous in our behaviour, then they are in their Nature; <hi>One sin</hi> will never heal <hi>another.</hi> Rigorous impositions, will never Cure froward sentiments; It was <hi>A B. of Hereford's</hi> prescription to cut of the <hi>Head,</hi> because it <hi>Aked;</hi> As <hi>some Divisions, and errours</hi> are <hi>the works of the flesh,</hi> proceeding from pride and passion, nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by discontent or other unruly lust, so are some <hi>magnified Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> for those distempers, which smell as strong, and sav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

not very <hi>gingerly,</hi> like the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> it will moulder into dust, and the <hi>latter</hi> is so dangerous, that it concerns him to handle it gently, lest it prick his fingers. And 1. for the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; If <hi>the presence of the British Bishops at the Council of</hi> Arles, be his best proof, it must proceed thus. <hi>The British Bishops were present at the Council.</hi> Their <hi>presence</hi> must presume their <hi>subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to the Articles;</hi> Their <hi>subscription</hi> must imply <hi>a virtual, and implicit consent</hi> of the <hi>British Clergy;</hi> and then the <hi>consent of the Clergy</hi> must involve <hi>the Approbation of all the Churches:</hi> And lastly, <hi>the Churches Approbation of the Articles</hi> must infer, that they practised their <hi>Creed,</hi> and that their Lives were so eminent for Holiness, that they <hi>did as it were shine with some Rayes, or Beams of Divinity.</hi> And here is a Teame of connected inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that if one fails, the conclusion will be left in the Mire. And therefore he has another proof to help it out at a standing pull: <hi>At the Time of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council,</hi> Britain <hi>was accounted one of the Six Diocesses of the Western Empire.</hi> And then no Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creature can desire clearer demonstration, that they were eximiously Holy; for if they were of any Diocess, <hi>first, or sixth,</hi> it makes no great matter, provided it be but of the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Empire,</hi> it will infallibly conclude their Piety; though it had been more clear in my mind, had it been <hi>a Diocess</hi> not of the Empire only, but <hi>the Church.</hi> And then 2. for <hi>the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> that seems very perilous; for if the <hi>presence of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Bishops at the Council at</hi> Arles implies their <hi>Subscription,</hi> and that <hi>Subscription</hi> the <hi>consent of the Clergy,</hi> the <hi>Clergies consent</hi> the <hi>Approbation of the People;</hi> and that infers their <hi>Holiness:</hi> Then (say some) the <hi>Presence of the</hi> English <hi>Divines at the Synod of</hi> Dort, and their <hi>Subscription to the Articles,</hi> will imply the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Clergy,</hi> and the <hi>consent of the Clergy</hi> the <hi>Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the</hi> English <hi>Church;</hi> and there's no remedy for it that I can see. If the presence of <hi>the one</hi> will evince the Kingdoms <hi>Sanctity;</hi> the <hi>Presence, and Subscription of the other</hi> will much stronger evince <hi>the Kingdoms Orthodoxy:</hi> For <hi>Subscription</hi> is a <hi>good step</hi> beyond <hi>bare Presence,</hi> and so our <hi>Premises are stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> And <hi>Sanctity</hi> is a <hi>good step</hi> beyond Truth in <hi>the Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and so our <hi>Conclusion</hi> is <hi>more modest.</hi>

            <p>Well, but yet <hi>the Universal Pastor observed the Sheep of</hi> England <hi>to bear such good Fleeces, and so patiently to submit to the Shearer, that he kept a Vigilant Eye over his Flocks, and his Vigilancy was Rewarded with the Golden Fleece.</hi> This indeed quite shames the present Age, and dazles our Eyes with the Lustre of those Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Times.

            <p>And surely were men but ingenuous to confess a known truth, they could have no cause to reproach <hi>the present piety of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Sheep upon</hi> that Account.

               </gap>allop not too fast, and ride us quite out of Breath: And the Glories of our English Reformation were as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It was the most orderly, not brought in with Tumult, and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as most changes are.</hi> Let God alone have the glory of so great a mercy! And such was this; though indeed the Excellency of a Reformation, lies <hi>not only,</hi> or <hi>chiefly</hi> in the <hi>still and silent manner</hi> of its Introduction, but in its Harmony with the Primitive Rule of Reformation, which is to Reduce all things to their Divine Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns and Originals: <hi>Peace</hi> is mainly valuable for <hi>purity;</hi> And the freedom from noises of Axes and Hammers in the building of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, was, that they might more severely attend to their Archetype. Where God gives Reformers <hi>more peace,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from them <hi>more purity;</hi> And if they may work <hi>the safer;</hi> he expects they should work <hi>the better:</hi> It were great ingratitude to Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> if we should account our Gospel cheap, because it came to us so: And as much vanity to boast how our Ancestors got it, unless we can produce it as pure as they left it to us peaceable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It was the most Moderate, and Temperate.</hi> Moderation is a virtue very much commended by those who never intend to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise it. As an old griping Usurer commends his Coin so highly, and loves it so dearly that he will not part with one penny. The Reformation might be Moderate in a two sold Acceptation; either first, moderate in our <hi>departure</hi> from Error and Corruption; or secondly, Moderate, and Temperate in our <hi>approaching</hi> to the word of God: Now to resolve to be moderately reformed either of these ways, ought not to be Recorded amongst the Glories of a Church: There are few that would be moderately Rich, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately great; they fear no excess that way; all the danger is, least we should be too immoderate, and unreasonable in obeying Christs Commandments, and conforming to the Aposto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>cal Churches, The measure of our love to Christ, is to love him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out measure; The degree of our Obedience is to obey in the highest Degree, and the Bounds of our Conformity to the Gospel, to set our selves no Bounds but what Christ has set us; Gods Praise can suffer no <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> his Love need fear no <hi>Paroxysme:</hi> As he that presumes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e has <hi>Grace enough,</hi> may do well to question whether he has <hi>any Grace;</hi> so he that is so confident he is <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med enough,</hi> shall tempt others to suspect he is very <hi>little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:</hi> There's more danger of being <hi>Lukewarm</hi> in Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, than <hi>Scalding hot;</hi> and though it be easie to be <hi>over righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> in imposing our own Inventions, it will be impossible
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52034:14"/>
to be so in imitating Gods Prescriptions: But amongst all the kinds of Moderation that were in the Reformation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one small quantity more of <hi>Moderation towards their Brethren</hi> would have sweetned all; and yet they say that wanted not at first, but is since much decayed. But the Moderation of the first Reformers appears.</p>
            <p>§ 1. In that <hi>they did not purge out the good, because it had been formerly abused, as the Humour of some is.</hi> This indeed argued their singular prudence, and discerning Spirit: But yet there are some things <hi>not evil in themselves,</hi> but made so by abuse, which without imputation of Humorists they might have purged out. And this was <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> Humour, (if it must be so called) who made the Brazen Serpent a <hi>Nchushtan;</hi> and scarcely that, when once it had been abus'd to Idolatry, which yet had more to plead for it self, than those <hi>Good Things,</hi> of which our Enquirer is <hi>so Tender.</hi> I mean the Signature of an old <hi>Ius Divinum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever is <hi>good in it self,</hi> or made so <hi>by Divine positive Law,</hi> and shall afterwards be abused to <hi>superstitious</hi> ends and uses, we must take some pains to scowr off the filth, and file away the rust, and to wash away the soil that it has contracted, and to vindicate it to its Native Beauty, and Integrity; but for <hi>the Inventions of Men,</hi> I know no such service we owe them, to lie always scrub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Whatsoever is taken up at the Injunction of Man, when it is drawn into Superstition, comes under the Compass of the Brazen Serpent, and is to be Abolished.</hi> And the Catholick Moderator, who was a greater Friend to <hi>Moderation,</hi> than <hi>Reformation,</hi> was partly of this <hi>Humour</hi> too: <hi>When the occasion of a Humane Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> is like the endless labour of weeding Ivy out of an old rotten Wall, the only way is to dig down the Wall it self: Nay the great Legislator of the <hi>Iews,</hi> commanded them utterly to abolish all the Instruments, and Utensils of Idolatry, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>§ 2. Another Specimen of their Moderation is: <hi>That they did not Abolish a Venerable Order, or Office in the Church, for the ill manners of them that bore it.</hi> What <hi>Venerable Order, or Office</hi> this should be, because he is not so open-hearted as to acquaint us, I have something else to do with my Conjectures than to throw'em away upon such desperate uncertainties: If it was <hi>an Order</hi> of Christs Institution, <hi>the ill manners of those that bore it,</hi> might well warrant the thrusting <hi>them</hi> out of the <hi>Office,</hi> but not the <hi>Office</hi> out of the <hi>Church:</hi> But if it could not justly plead <hi>his Authority,</hi> no <hi>pretense of Usefulness</hi> to some Imaginary Ends of I know not what Unity, and Order, will conciliate to it the Honourable Epithete of <hi>Venerable,</hi> or secure its station in the Church of Christ: As Christ, the only Law-giver of his Church has made abundant provision of <hi>Offices and Ordinances</hi> in his Church, to suit and Answer <hi>all the Necessities</hi> of Believers; so of <hi>Officers</hi> too, to discharge those <hi>Offices,</hi> and administer those <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and there is no need of Mens over-officiousness to supply his pretended defects either in the one kind, or in the other.

            <p>When therefore I hear these Popular Harangues: <hi>How happy this Church and Nation was in</hi> Edw.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52034:17"/>
the Glorious Pattern of Peace, and Concord; and so shall continue till the next occasion those Men have to reproach the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then <hi>Edw.</hi> VI. days shall be <hi>an Infelicity</hi> again, and as great a prejudice to Religion as ever. So easie it is for a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Orator with his orient Colours, to fill up the wrinkles of a furrow'd Face, and again to deform the most Beauteous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, just as it pleases Master Painter.</p>
            <p>The total summe of all, is thus much. The Primitive times were Glorious for Piety; in <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi>'s days, and those of Popery, there was a great deal of <hi>Sincere Devotion;</hi> In the beginning of the Reformation, affairs were in an excellent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, but <hi>now</hi> all's degenerated, and a Lukewarm Neutrality, and Lazy Indifferency, has over-spread the Face, and crept over the Heart of Religion. And what should be the matter? What is the Reason of this sad change? Why!. Men are not so fond of Ceremonies as they used to be, and People have resolved against the building of Churches, and endowing them.</p>
            <p>But let us hear him <hi>Lament the change.</hi> All <hi>Zeal</hi> then, <hi>cold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency</hi> now. Then all <hi>Harmony,</hi> now all <hi>Discord. Then the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the Church was so venerable, that to be cast out by Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, was as dreadful as to be Thunder-smitten: But now it's become a matter of some Mens Ambition to be cast out. Then few, or none, but frequented the Church; now the Church is become the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle, and the Cinventicle the Church, as to frequency. Then the Liturgie, and publick Prayers were counted a principal part of Gods Worship; now they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> nothing without a Sermon. Then there were few things that were scrupled; but now its become the great point of Sanctity to scruple every thing.</hi> It will be time for me, and the Reader, to take our leave of this learned Introduction, when we have observed, and returned a few things. 1. That the true Reason why there is <hi>more Discord now,</hi> than at that time, is, because there are <hi>more difficult terms of Peace, and Concord.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things were then <hi>in use,</hi> which were not <hi>imposed:</hi> Many were permitted to discharge their Ministerial Functions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out subscription to <hi>the new terms,</hi> and conditions of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: It was pretty well in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, before <hi>A. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Whitguift</hi> could strain Conformity to it's height; and yet they are now screwed much higher. Restore <hi>Indifferent things</hi> to their <hi>Ancient Liberty,</hi> and we shall soon arrive at our <hi>Ancient Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> 2. That Excommunication has so much lost its former Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon the Conscience, and become so like a <hi>Brutum Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> is to be imputed to these Reasons. 1. Because that Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt is darted out for meer trifles, some have been delivered over to Satan for a Groat; Now it's a sure Maxime. That <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will bring a Law sooner into disuse, and contempt, than the Disproportion of the penalty to the Offence:</hi> It will be difficult to perswade weak understandings, that that can be of God which has but <hi>one sort</hi> of punishment for <hi>all sorts of Crimes,</hi> and the same Rigour for <hi>Vertues,</hi> as for <hi>Vices:</hi> To be delivered up for <hi>a Penny,</hi> exposes to the same inconvenience as if it were <hi>a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52034:17"/>
Pound;</hi> and it shall fare as ill with him that scruples at <hi>a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> as with him that commits Whoredom; and some say, <hi>the former</hi> has more evil in it than the <hi>latter,</hi> though you throw in Drunkenness, Swearing, and half a dozen more such into the reckoning. 2. It has been made an Engine, to gratifie some Mens Passions, and exonerate their Spleen upon the Innocent; and nothing renders <hi>Iupiters Thunder</hi> more despicable, than when the wretched <hi>Salmoneus</hi> shall dare to imitate it. 3. It has been so frequently practised in pecuniary matters, that Men dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it not to be a Spiritual Weapon; Money has been a Lock to shut Men out of Heaven, and a Key to let them in again. 4. They that have been ejected by that <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> find no evil consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their ejected state. In the Primitive times it was therefore terrible, because Christ abbetted his own Ordinance, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred for his own Spiritual Ends, in his own Regular way; but now Men dare not trust Christ with his own Work, but have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his vengeance with a <hi>Significavit,</hi> a Writ <hi>de Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Capiendo,</hi> delivering Men over to the Sheriff, whom thereby they call the Devil by craft, but otherwise the Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Person <hi>cats his Bread, and drinks his Wine with a Chearful Heart, because the Lord has accepted him.</hi> 3. That so few frequent the Church, is, because they have either been scoffed, or railed, or beaten out of doors, or barred out by Conditions, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting with Scripture Rule, and Warrant Men know that Christ must be their Judge; to him they must give an account of their Souls, and Worship, in the Great Day; and therefore they are willing to Worship God according to his Will revealed in his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Word, unless any can give them Counter-security to save harmless, and indemnifie them before his dreadful Tribunal; And if they must suffer for such resolved adherence to a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prure Religion, they have only this humbly to reply. <hi>Daveniam Imperator, Tu Carcerem, Ille Gehennam.

                  <p>A Sober Enquiry into the Apocryphal Causes of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity, pretended by the serious Enquirer: St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin,</hi> and the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> Vindicated; the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Cleared.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter a very short Epistle, (or to speak Canonically, that which stands <hi>instead of the Epistle)</hi> to <hi>very little,</hi> and a tedious Introduction to <hi>much less purpose,</hi> the Enquirer falls full drive upon <hi>the Causes of the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the</hi> English <hi>Reformed Church.</hi> In imitation of the <hi>French</hi> Embassadors Musicians, who would needs give the Grand Seignior <hi>a fit of Mirth;</hi> but were so cruelly tedious <hi>in tuning their Fiddles,</hi> that the Sultans Patience was quite worn out, and he could not be perswaded to hear the <hi>first Lesson.</hi>

               <p>Now the Causes are either <hi>Apocryphal, and pretended,</hi> or <hi>Canonical, and Real;</hi> and it's a wonder to me, when his Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was once broached, that he did not feign this for <hi>another Cause</hi> of separation, that such Heterogeneous Causes should be bound up together <hi>in the same Volume, and Covers.</hi>

1. The very first of these pretended Causes, is <hi>some Blame they lay upon the Doctrine of the Church, and the main (if not the only) thing excepted against in this kind is, That the Thirty Nine Articles are not so punctual in defining the Five Points debated in the Synod of</hi> Dort <hi>as they could wish.</hi> Just as your <hi>common Hackney Versifiers,</hi> or <hi>Water Poets,</hi> make one Verse for <hi>the Reason,</hi> and the other for the Rhime sake, so was <hi>this Objection</hi> mounted against the Doctrine of the Church for the sake of his <hi>precious Answers,</hi> wherein he will <hi>find or make</hi> as handsom an occasion, as impertinency will admit to vilifie St. <hi>Austin, and the Synod of</hi> Dort.</p>
               <p>It will be extreamly difficult to give our Enquirer a satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Answer in this Point. Shall we say, This is not <hi>the main thing</hi> in the Articles <hi>excepted against by Dissenters?</hi> He will readily Reply, However then you t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Then it seems you consess this to be <hi>one,</hi> though not <hi>the only thing</hi> you Boggle at: Really if I know how to content him I would do it; and the best expedient that offers it self at present is this Answer. 1. That the Church has <hi>other Doctrines,</hi> not contained in the 39 <hi>Articles,</hi> imposed on the Faith of <hi>Subscribers;</hi> and perhaps the scruple may lie against <hi>them.</hi> 2. That the 39 <hi>Articles</hi> contain <hi>other Doctrines</hi> besides those <hi>relating to the five Points debated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the Synod of</hi> Dort, as that of <hi>Art 20. The Church hath power to decree Rites, or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> And that of <hi>Art. 34. Every Particular, or National Church hath Authority to Ordain, Change and Abolish Ceremonies or Rites of the Church ordained only by Mans Authority,</hi> And what now if the quarrel should lie against <hi>one of those.</hi> And I am the rather induced to suspect they may hesitate in these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, because I have heard some of them privately Speak, and seen others publickly Print, that though they can <hi>practise</hi> such things, which being in their own Natures indifferent, remain under all their concurrent Circumstances lawful; yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find where the Church has any Commission to impose them: They can assert, and use their <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> and yet cannot subscribe to <hi>the Doctrine of the Churches Power</hi> to take it <hi>away.</hi> 3. That the most rigid Calvinists do not scruple Subscription to the Articles, so far as they relate to the Quinquarticular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies; and for a clear experiment herein, for once let the Church make <hi>those Articles only,</hi> the <hi>single Rail about the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Table,</hi> and we shall soon see such Multitudes of Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters crowd into the Constitution, that she will hardly find two Benefices a piece for them.</p>
               <p>It's my greater admiration, that they who deny <hi>Particular Election, Original sin,</hi> the interest of Christs death in <hi>Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling God to us;</hi> that they who assert <hi>Iustification by our own Works, Freewill,</hi> &amp;c. can subscribe them; and indeed it seems they swallow'd them with some Reluctancy, and are now reaching and straining, with many a sowr face, to Degorge, not the <hi>Bait
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52034:19"/>
of the Benefice,</hi> which is infinitely <hi>sweet;</hi> but <hi>the Hook of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi> which is unmereifully <hi>sharp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This pretended Pretence then might safely have been forborn, but that the Lapwing thinks it advisable to raise a huge cry, <hi>where 'tis not,</hi> that we may not search where <hi>really it is;</hi> to make a clampering about the Non causes, to divert our Fnquirers from the true and proper causes of Non-consormity: Like the ingenious policy of the Thief, that being arraigned for <hi>a Horse,</hi> freely confessed the stealing of <hi>a Bridle,</hi> but prudently conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was upon <hi>the Horses Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (says our Enquirer) <hi>though this neither needs nor deserves an Answer, yet I stall reply Two things to it:</hi> That is, he will give us <hi>Two needless Answers</hi> to <hi>One needless Objection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The summe of the former needless Answer is thus much. <hi>Common Arts, and Sciences, which depend upon Humane Wit, and Invention, are capable of daily improvements; but Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty depending solely upon Divine Revelation, can admit of no new discoveries. The busie Wit of Man way perplex, but it can never bring to light any New Thing; for if we admit of any New Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we lose the Old, and our Religion together; we accuse our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and his Aposiles, as if they had not sufficiently revealed Gods Mind to the World, and we incur St.</hi> Paul's <hi>Anathema which he denounces against him, (whosoever it shall be, nay if an Angel from Heaven) that shall Preach any other Doctrine than what had been received.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Enquirer may call this <hi>a Needless Answer,</hi> (sor who shall hinder him from calling <hi>his own</hi> what he pleases) but I assure him it contains a great deal of Needful Truth, which had he like a good Husband improved, the rest of his Book had been more needless than this Answer: <hi>Needless</hi> we consess it to be as to <hi>the Objection,</hi> which was it self <hi>needless,</hi> but not so for his own <hi>Confutation;</hi> for thus the Dissenters will come over him: <hi>If neither Time nor the Wit of Man can make any New discoveries in Christianity;</hi> then the Pope, who like another <hi>Columbus,</hi> or <hi>Americus,</hi> has made Great and New discoveries in the <hi>Terra Incognita</hi> of Tradition and Ceremonies, must either be a God, or a Devil. That the Liturgy was <hi>a principal part of Gods Worship,</hi> he has told us in the Introduction, that it was discovered from the beginning, and not by later Adventurers, he will be sore put to it to prove, for all <hi>the Musty Fragments</hi> of St. <hi>Iames's Liturgy:</hi> That it was not part of the Wisdom of Christ, or his Apostles, we are well enough satisfied: That there was Wit and Invention in it, we confess, all the Question is, whose Wit should have the glory of the Invention. Again! <hi>If to admit New Revelations be to lose the Old, and our Religion together:</hi> Let us make a short Quaery upon't, whether <hi>to admit of New Ordinances, and Constitutions, be not to lose the Old, and our Religion together?</hi> That is, whether Gospel Institutions be not exclusive of new ones, as well as Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Revelations? and why we may not expect a new <hi>Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> as well as a new <hi>Mandamus?</hi> New Revelations as well as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52034:19"/>
New Injunctions? <hi>A New Prophet</hi> of the Church seems to me as necessary as <hi>a New King</hi> over the Church, and <hi>a New High-Priest</hi> as needful as either: And I proceed upon this Principle, that <hi>the Law</hi> of Christ was as perfect as <hi>his Discoveries:</hi> He has told us as fully, and clearly what we should <hi>do,</hi> as what we should <hi>believe:</hi> He that may invade <hi>the Royal Office,</hi> upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence there are <hi>not Laws enough</hi> for the Government of the Church, may with equal appearance of Reason invade the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Office too, upon pretence there are <hi>not Revelations now</hi> for its instruction: And therefore the vigilant universal Pastor has found it as necessery to supply <hi>the defect of Revelations,</hi> by <hi>his own Traditions,</hi> as the nakedness <hi>of Worship</hi> by <hi>decent Ceremonies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As Jesus Christ vindicated <hi>the Moral Law</hi> from the false Glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Scribes and Pharisees, so he superadded <hi>a Ceremoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>l Law,</hi> depending meerly upon his own fulness of Power, and Authority; now what right any can pretend, to <hi>add new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars to his Ceremonial Law,</hi> which they may not also pretend, to add to his <hi>Meral Law,</hi> I cannot Divine: And therefore one of our Enquirers great Friends, who had his Eyes in his Head, and saw farther into these matters than his poor Neighbours, was constrained to assert a power that had lain dormant somewhere of adding <hi>New Particulars to the Divine Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But further; <hi>If New Revelations do accuse our Saviour, and his Apostles, as if they had not sufficiently revealed Gods Mind to the World:</hi> Then new ways of teaching Gods Mind, new invented Symbolical Ceremonies will accuse him, and them of the same culpable failure in not discharging those Offices, committed by God to a Mediator, and by him to his Apostles.</p>
               <p>And in short; <hi>If we incur St.</hi> Paul's <hi>Anathema, which he denounces against him that shall Preach any other Doctrine, than what he has received:</hi> Then they will do well to get out of the way of that Curse who Preach this Doctrine, The <hi>Church has power to decree Rites, and Ceremonies:</hi> Unless they be sure they have received it from Christ, for its but ill venturing to stand in the way of an Angel with a drawn Sword; more terrible than which is one of the Scriptures Anathema's: Some will ask where, and when, and from whom the Church <hi>received that Doctrine</hi> which some Preach, <hi>viz. A Power to impose Mystical, and Symbolical Ceremonies, as the Terms of Communion</hi> with a Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> but I shall only say, that our compassionate Enquirer will need a most compassionate Reader, upon these Two Accounts: First, that he makes <hi>an Objection</hi> for Dissenters, which is their Answer: And Secondly, that he gives <hi>an Answer</hi> to <hi>that Objection,</hi> which is their <hi>very Objection;</hi> but yet we have not heard the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Consequence</hi> (says he) <hi>of these Premises is; That the elder any Doctrine of Christianity can be proved to be, it must needs be truer; and he that talks of a more clear Light of the latter Times, and clearer discoveries in Religion, talks as idly as he that should affirm he could discern things better at a miles distance, than a Man
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52034:20"/>
that hath as good an Eye as himself, and yet stood close by the Object.</hi> This is that <hi>Needless Conclus on</hi> drawn out of his <hi>Needless Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> and having discovered the weakness of <hi>the former,</hi> I might leave him at his leasure to deny <hi>his own Conclusion;</hi> but yet I shall give him some Items about that also. And 1. It's a crude uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted No. ion, that <hi>the elder any Doctrine of Christianity is, the truer it is:</hi> For it was a Truth <hi>that Christ was Born,</hi> before it was that <hi>he was Crucified:</hi> and yet the former Article, that he was <hi>Born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, is no truer, than that <hi>he was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, Dead, and Buried:</hi> The Truth of the Doctrine depends not upon it. <hi>Antiquity or Seniority,</hi> but upon <hi>the infallibility of the Revealer,</hi> quo ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>os, and upon <hi>the close connexion of the Terms,</hi> in it self, whether a Truth was revealed by Christ, or his Apostles immediately inspired, all are of equal Truth in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and equal Authority as to us; that is, the lateness of the Revelation will breed no difference. 2. The Enquirer might have informed himself; that there is a double Light, <hi>an Objective,</hi> and <hi>Subjective Light:</hi> The former is the discovery of <hi>the Thing it self,</hi> the latter is <hi>the enlightning of the Faculty:</hi> It's true there is, there can be no <hi>New Objective</hi> Light rationally expected: In this sense all <hi>New Lights</hi> are but <hi>Old Darknesses;</hi> but yet there may be <hi>more Subjective Light,</hi> or a greater discovery made to us of what God has discovered in his Word: The Papists lock'd up our Bibles in the Latin Tongue, and kept the Key of Knowledge in their Pockets: God by his Gracious Providence in the Resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; has taken off the Embargo, and restraint that was upon Knowledge, and great Light is sprung in amongst us, we say not God has put more Books, or Chapters, or Verses into the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but that he has given us more light in our Minds; he has not Revealed <hi>New Truths,</hi> but given us advantage <hi>to discover the Old,</hi> Thus the Learned <hi>Stillingf.</hi> somewhere expresses himself. <hi>The common way of the Spirits illuminating the Minds of Believers, is by enlightning the Faculty, not by proposition of New Objects:</hi> A Man then may <hi>talk of more Light in these latter Times,</hi> and yet <hi>not talk idly;</hi> if by <hi>more Light</hi> he intends no more than a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer understanding of Gods Mind, and Will revealed in his Word; and a Man may <hi>talk of more Light in these latter Times,</hi> and <hi>talk very idly;</hi> If thereby he means, <hi>more Revelations</hi> of Gods Mind and Will to supply the defects of the Scripture; but yet none <hi>talk so idly,</hi> as the Rhetorical Men, whose Premises speak against <hi>New Objective Light,</hi> and their conclusion against <hi>New Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Light.</hi> If Subjective Light be <hi>not capable of growth,</hi> if it does not <hi>recipere magis &amp; minus:</hi> Let him give me a Reason why the Churches Articles of 1571. do clear up the Doctrine more darkly, and imperfectly laid down in the days of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. Refined Silver is more clear, than the same Mettal in the Oare, and yet there is no more Mettal. But if it be capable of growth, and increase; what an idle flourish is his Similitude of <hi>a Mans seeing better at a distance, than he that stands close by the Object:</hi> For if we have got no <hi>surther Light</hi> into the Scriptures by all the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52034:20"/>
Advantages which Merciful Providence has surnish'd us with above <hi>the darker Times of Popery,</hi> they were very ill bestowed upon us; and he that would repay him in his own Coyn might tell him; That a Man may possibly stand <hi>too near the Object,</hi> as wel as <hi>too far off;</hi> and <hi>a Dwarf upon a Gyants Shoulders may see further than the Gyant himself.</hi>

               <p>What he has hitherto philosophiz'd upon, has been little to our Edification; nor had we been troubled with <hi>this first Messe,</hi> but for the sake of that which is now to be served up in <hi>the second Course;</hi> and that is, a piece of Revenge that he will take upon St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">¶ 1. And first, here's a heavy charge drawn up against <hi>one Augustin,</hi> of whom I presume the Reader may have heard at one time or other some mention made. Now this <hi>Augustin</hi> (or rather <hi>Austin;</hi> for his Name, as well as his Fame suffers a Syncope) has been formerly a person in great danger of incurring that Curse denounced against those <hi>of whom all Men speak well,</hi> till of late some Charitable Divines, loath to let a Poor Man lie in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory from Age to Age, when a few bad words would release him, took some pity on him: And one of his best Friends in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this <hi>Compassionate Enquirer,</hi> who informs us, <hi>That no Father, or Writer Greek or Latin before this</hi> Austins <hi>time agreed in Doctrine with the Synod of</hi> Dort, <hi>which is so notoriously plain that it cannot be deny'd. And if he agrees therewith, yet it's certain, that in so doing he disagrees as much with himself as with us of our Church: That he was indeed a Devout Man, but his Piety was far more commendable than his Reason, and that being hard put to it, by the</hi> Manichees, <hi>on the one hand, and the</hi> Pelagians <hi>on the other, he was not able to extricate himself; and that he was rather forced into his opinion, than made choice of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that shall thus confidently dare to censure that worthy Father, must be presumed to have read over his Voluminous Writings, with all those of <hi>the Ancient Writers before him,</hi> both <hi>Greek and Latin,</hi> to a Man, to a Sentence, which might suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently have proclaimed his Learning, and recommended him to a Patron, (one would think) though he had never reproached that Father himself: Many a poor Hungry Man have I known in my little time, that has scribled one piece after another railing at the Pope, which yet never turned to such Account, as half a score Lines smartly penn'd against <hi>this great Sinner</hi> Austin. And yet sor all these Insinuations of Industry in Reading, and Acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teness of piercing Wit, in hunting and tracing <hi>the Poor Man</hi> through all the windings, and turnings of his self-perplexing Contradictions; it's our meer good Nature if we will believe, that ever he saw any more than <hi>the back side</hi> of St. <hi>Austins</hi> Works; for indeed all this may be no more than an ingenious Pataphrase of their great <hi>Grotius,</hi> who thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>But this wonderful maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Original Sin,</hi> (Austin) <hi>could set none of all these Things; being a Person not at all exercised in the H.

               <p>§ 1. One Branch of the Charge is; That he was a Novelist in the weightiest Points of Religion. <hi>No one Father, or Writer, Greek, or Latin, before his time agreed with him.</hi> A deo non cum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oribus posse conciliari: <hi>And this is so plain, that it needs no Proof;</hi> further than the bare say-so of <hi>Grotius) nor can it be denied.</hi> There's your Charge! There's your Evidence! These are indeed <hi>Big words,</hi> utter'd with that confidence which Men commonly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, that would be believed in an unproved falshood; for I will suppose <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis,</hi> that <hi>Malleus Haeroticorum,</hi> to have understood the Sentiments of former Ages, as well as this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer, or <hi>Hugh Grotius.</hi> Now he tells us <hi>Cap. 34. adversus haeretic.</hi> Quis unquam ante Prophanum illum <hi>Pelagium</hi> tantam virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Liberi praesumpsit Arbitrii, ut hoc in bonis Rebus per Actus singulos adjuvandum, necessariam Dei gratiam non pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taret?

And who before his monstrous Schollar</hi>  Coelestius, <hi>ever denied that all Mankind stood guilty of</hi> Adams <hi>Apostacy from God?</hi> When <hi>Irenaus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> had excellently discoursed of Original sin: How that we were wounded <hi>Antiqua Serpentis Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gä,</hi> with the <hi>Old Blow of the Devil,</hi> And how that Adstrictum est Humanum genus Morti per Virginem, <hi>viz.</hi> Evam. <hi>That all Mankind was bound over to Death by the Transgression of</hi> Eve: And Protoplasti peccato, vinculis alligati eramus. <hi>We were all bound in Chains of guilt by the sin of</hi> Adam <hi>the Protoplast.</hi> St. <hi>Austin</hi> made use of this Testimony, <hi>Lib. 1, Cap. 2. contra Iul.</hi>

                  <hi>Do you not Observe</hi> (says <hi>Austin) what that Ancient Man of God thinks of that old Blow given us by the Devil? What his Iudgment is, concerning the likeness of sinful Flesh,</hi> (Christ Incarnate) <hi>by which the Wound of the Serpent in our sinful Flesh is healed? And what his opinion is touching the sin of the Protoplast, by which we are all guilty?</hi> And <hi>Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus, Lib.</hi> 4. agrees exactly with him <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I shall give the Reader no further trouble in this matter; <hi>The Greek and Latin Fathers</hi> were either of <hi>Austins,</hi> or <hi>Pelagius</hi> his mind, if they were of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his opinion, then he has at once Canoniz'd them for <hi>Orthodox Pelagians;</hi> but if they were not of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Mind. (for I know no <hi>Medium)</hi> they were of <hi>Austins,</hi> and by consequence of the same Judgment with the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Hierome</hi> indeed says expresly, <hi>That before that Southern
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52034:22"/>
Devil</hi> (he means <hi>Arius) appeared in the World, the Ancients spake many things in the simplicity of their Hearts, and not so advisedly, which might give some Advantage to the Heretick;</hi> And <hi>Austin</hi> will confess. That <hi>Ante Mota Certamina</hi> Pelagiana, the Fathers seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to speak favourably of <hi>Free-will;</hi> but afterwards <hi>multo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiores, vigilantioresque facti sunt,</hi> they began to <hi>bestir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and watch over their words a little better:</hi> Now as it would be a severe Charge upon all the Primo-primitive Fathers, that they were <hi>Arians,</hi> because a suspicious word at sometimes drop'd from their Mouths, or Pens, so would it be a rash, and ignorant Censure of them, that they were all <hi>Pelagians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some odd expressions fell from them, which may seem to favour Pelagianisme: And therefore I am in hope, since <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> is risen from the Dead, this sleepy Age will awake, and give him no ground by unwary Expressions; at least we expect thus much, that Non-conformists may not be ruined, because they are no wiser than <hi>Austin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. A second Branch of the Charge is, That St. <hi>Austin Agrees not with himself.</hi> A pitiful sorry self-inconsistent Scribler he was it seems, that could not make his matters hang together: One that caper'd backwards, and forwards, that it was the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest thing in the world to trip up his heels, such a Novice was this <hi>Austin;</hi> all which I could easily believe, when it shall be proved, that he wrote <hi>the first and second Part of the serious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</hi> Really, that Man must have amassed a vast stock of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that shall hope with one puff of contemptuous Breath to blow away that fair heap of Repute that that Fathers Name has gathered in so many Centuries; and he must have an over-ween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceit of his own Rhetorick, that can presume to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade this Learned Age, that he was so insignificant a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, so great a Trifler: The Papists with incredible zeal have struggled for him; the Protestants have tooth and nail wrestled to draw him into their Tents; all parties have ambitiously court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his suffrage; at last comes one <hi>Hugh Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ot,</hi> and our Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and they cashier him as an inconsiderable fellow not worth the whistling.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Luther</hi> had this great Stone thrown at his Head by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine:</hi> And the Learned Dr. Field thus puts by the Blow. On the Church <hi>Book. 3. Ch. 42. Luther</hi> (says he) <hi>was as worthy a Divine as the World had any in those Times, or in many Ages before, and that for clearing sundry Points of greatest moment in our Christian Profession, much obscured, and entangled before with the intricate disputes of the Schoolmen, all succeeding Ages shall be bound to Honour his Happy Memory: That herein he proceeded by degrees, and in his latter Writings disliked that which in his former he did approve, is not so strange a thing. Did not</hi> Austin, <hi>the greatest of all the Fathers, and the worthiest Divine the Church of God ever had since the Apostles time, write a whole Book of Retractations? Did we not carefully observe what things he wrote whilst a Presbyter, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52034:22"/>
what when made a Bishop? What before he enter'd into the Conflict with</hi> Pelagius, <hi>and what afterwards? Did he not formerly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the Election of those that were chosen to Eternal Life, to the fore-sight of Faith, which afterwards he disclaimed as a meer</hi> Pelagian <hi>conceit?</hi> And would it not vex a Man of our Enquirers Humour, that <hi>Austin the Presbyter</hi> should be more Orthodox, than <hi>Austin the Bishop?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Truth is, St. <hi>Austin</hi> disagrees no more with himself, than it became a <hi>Wise Man,</hi> who by long studying the Scriptures, and the Primitive Fathers, had gained a more concocted, and well digested Knowledge of Religion; his Retractations were never laid in his Dish, but interwoven amongst those Excellencies which Crowned his Learned Head, before Now. A piece of such self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial it was, that a proud heart could not bear, unless more politick Considerations turned the scale; This last Age has few Instances of such an Ingenuity as will confess it self <hi>Truths Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi> though it abounds with too many that <hi>surrender themselves Captives</hi> to base Lusts, and worldly Interest: Their own <hi>Grotius</hi> professes he was <hi>progressive,</hi> and <hi>very prone to dislike what a little before he was well pleased with,</hi> and the Reasons of his Change were evident to all the World.</p>
               <p>§ 3. A third Branch of this Charge is, <hi>That St.</hi> Austin <hi>disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the Church of</hi> England. There are indeed a knot of Gentlemen, that <hi>in spight of Right and Truth,</hi> are resolved to be the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and with these St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and the Ancient Fathers have no very good correspondence, nor are they ambitious of it: But that the Ancient Church of <hi>England</hi> had very high thoughts of <hi>Austins</hi> Judgment, is from hence evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that she quotes his opinion in one at least of the Articles of her Faith, and justifies her Authority from his Doctrine, <hi>Art.</hi> 29. But yet if the Church should be a weary of him, (as I am confident she never will) and has no further service to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, 'tis but transmitting him with Letters of safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct into <hi>Holland,</hi> where the Divines of the Synod of <hi>Dort's</hi> perswasion will give him better Quarter, and a most Cordial welcome, and there's no harm done.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Another Branch of this tedious Charge is, <hi>That he was a Devout Good Man, but whose Piety was far more commendable than his Reason.</hi> Fuit utilis ad monita danda piae vitae, ad Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturas interpretandas satis infoelix: That is, <hi>The Man was a well meaning Zealot!</hi> One that according to his dim light meant honestly, but he never had wit enough to write <hi>Obscaene Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon the Canticles;</hi> he poor Man was little versed in <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creons</hi> Ribaldry, nor had much studied <hi>Ovid de Arte Amaendi,</hi> he was a meer stranger to <hi>Catullus,</hi> and <hi>Martial;</hi> and therefore must needs be <hi>Satis,</hi> nay <hi>Nimis ad interpretandas Scripturas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>lix.</hi> The most wretched unhappy Creature that ever bungled at a Text of Scripture. It was never my unhappiness but once to hear the learned <hi>A. B. Usher</hi> reproach'd, and it was by a Grave
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52034:23"/>
divine of the same Temper, and upon the same Account: That <hi>the Primate was indeed an Honest Man, but one of no depth of Iudgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We need not search far for a Reason, why these Men cry down <hi>Austins Reason:</hi> In short, 'tis but to be reveng'd on him for crying down <hi>theirs;</hi> for there's a certain Maleporrsaway thing, as blind as a Beetle, and as giddy as a Goose, which they have Nick-named Reason, and this <hi>Austin</hi> decries with some seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Thus the Learned <hi>Iuell</hi> against <hi>Harding, Art. 4. Diris.</hi> 17. observes, That <hi>Austin</hi> speaking of the Scripture judging Mysteries, by Reason, faith thus. Haec consuetudo periculosa est, per Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturas Divinas enim multo tutius Ambulatur: <hi>And again,</hi> 
                  <q>Si Ratio contra Divinarum Scripturarum authoritatem redditur, quamvis acuta sit, fallit verisimilitudine, vera enim esse non potest. </q>
                  <hi>If Reason be brought against the Authority of the Scriptures, though it may seem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>xte, and witty, yet 'tis but fallacious under the shadow of Truth, for 'tis impossible it should be True.</hi>  And for this he quotes, <hi>Ad Marc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But that our <hi>Austin</hi> was no such <hi>Shallow-brain'd-fellow,</hi> no such <hi>half-witted-piece,</hi> as those Divines judge it their Interest to represent him. I shall call in the Testimony of <hi>Ierome,</hi> one whose Learning, and Judgment may at least counterballance those of <hi>the Enquirer. I have always</hi> (says he to <hi>Austin) Reverenced thy Holiness! Increase in Vertue! Thou art Famous through the World: Catholicks Reverence thee as the Re-builder of the Ancient Faith;</hi> And I promise you he must be no Blockhead, that shall be able to Redintegrate the Ruinous Doctrine of the Christian Church: But I shall knock all dead with an <hi>infallible,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>irrefragable</hi> Testimony; 'tis no less I assure you than that of <hi>Coelestinus Bishop of</hi> Rome: <hi>We have always accounted</hi> Austin <hi>a Man of Holy Memory, for his Life, and Merits of our Communion, whom we have long since remembred to have been of so great Knowledge, that he was amongst the best Masters.</hi> It would be impertinent to tell you, how <hi>Panlinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nela,</hi> calls him <hi>the great Light set upon the Candlestick of the Church;</hi> or how <hi>Prosper</hi> gives him the Character of <hi>a very sharp Wit, clear in his Disputations, Catholick in his Expositions of the Faith:</hi> But to what purpose should we control him with inferior Evidences after that of <hi>a Pope?</hi> or to what end Subpoena our little Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses after these Grandees? For surely he that will break <hi>Austins Pate,</hi> will not fear to dash out <hi>Prospers Brains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 5. Another Branch of this endless Indictment is; <hi>That being hard put to it by the</hi> Manichees <hi>on the one hand, and the</hi> Pelagians <hi>on the other, he was not able to extricate himself. Se in illas Amba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges induxit, ut non invenerit qua se extricaret.</hi> You see, I hope, that if ever we should want an able Head to translate <hi>Grotius</hi> into <hi>English,</hi> our <hi>Enquirer</hi> is the Man: Never was poor Man so bewildred, so sadly intangled in the Bryers, as

                     </gap>an fatal Necessity,</hi> and the <hi>Pelagian Contingency;</hi> one while he's just a splitting upon <hi>the Seylla of Free-will,</hi> and whilst he goes a Point or two too near the wind, he's ready to be swallow'd up of the desperate Gulf of <hi>Stoical Necessity.</hi> I shall say no more; let the Reader seriously peruse St. <hi>Austins Works,</hi> and when he has done, study <hi>this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers Volumes,</hi> and by that time he may be satisfied, whether all his Rhetorick, and Confidence, will make him a competent Judge of St. <hi>Austins</hi> Learning.</p>
               <p>§ 6. His Conclusion of his Charge is; <hi>That he was rather forced into his Opinions, than made choice of them.</hi> H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

'Tis as if we should conclude; That Men become <hi>Enemies,</hi> because they have <hi>shed one anothers Blood;</hi> whereas most think they wound, and shed one anothers Blood, because they were <hi>first Enemies:</hi> It was the Zeal of this Learned, and Holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for the cause of God that put him upon Study; that drew him out in the open Field against the open Enemies of the Grace of God, who might otherwise have slept secure in a whole skin; Dispute cleared up Truths to him, but he was not forced from any, or into any, I shall conclude this Head, with that of <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> another famous Champion in the same Cause with <hi>Austin.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I must here remember him of his own discourse in the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; and desire to know whether he abide by that Doctrine he once Preach'd to us; <hi>That the Presence of the</hi> British <hi>Bishops in the Council of</hi> Arles, was good proof of <hi>the Nations Piety.</hi> Let him show how that Proof proceeds, and its very probable we shall be in a fair way to show him how the Presence of <hi>the English Delegates</hi> at the <hi>Synod of</hi> Dort, might imply, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> did compromise with it in the Points now in Question.</p>
               <p>I confess I do not well understand the Mystery of one company of Mens making a Faith for another; but yet I may plead from an equality of Reason, that if the Non-conformists are bound up by the Decrees of a Convocation at <hi>London,</hi> where they have <hi>no representatives,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> may be as well bound up by the Decrees of <hi>Dort,</hi> where she had <hi>her representatives.</hi> If it be said that this Church had <hi>no equal Number</hi> at <hi>Dort</hi> to make a full representation of her Body; it may be answer'd; that in the Convocation 1571. there was <hi>no such equal representation</hi> of the Clergy, nor any at all of <hi>the People,</hi> who have Souls to save, and Consciences to Account for, and ought not to be concluded in matters of Faith, by what <hi>a Couple of Clerks</hi> shall agree to, who are only chosen by the Parochial Ministers: I never saw a good Argument to this day, to prove, that the people ought to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that their Ministers Believe, or that the Ministers are bound to hold all that their <hi>Representatives</hi> shall subscribe, seeing it cannot be supposed that they give them <hi>so large a Commission;</hi> and if they should, it were actually void, because they give away <hi>their Consciences,</hi> which are none of <hi>their own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How things are now I know not well, but in former times a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation had been judged <hi>no equal representation,</hi> either of the inferior Clergy, or the Body of the People. In the lower house of Convocation, there have been in some Diocesses, one Dean, one Clerk for the Cathedral, three or four Archdeacons; and for the inferior Clergy of the whole Diocess, only Two Clerks to Counterballance all the rest. So that all things must of necessity be concluded according to the Temper and Interest of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals, and that I think was <hi>no equal representation;</hi> but these things are inconsiderable.

That Act of God which <hi>our Enquirer,</hi> for the greater Grace will call <hi>a Decree to damn the far greatest part of Mankind,</hi> the Synod calls <hi>a Reliction of some Men,</hi> or a <hi>Decree to pass by some Men. Quosdam Homines decrevit Relinquere.</hi> 2. They say not that God Decrees to damn Men <hi>absolutely;</hi> but, Propter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitatem, &amp; caetera omnia peccata damnare, <hi>to damn Men for their Infidelity, and all their other sins;</hi> which is neither inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, nor cruelty. 3. They say indeed that God Decrees <hi>to leave some Men in the common Misery,</hi> but withal tis such as <hi>whereunto they have thrown themselves through their own fault.</hi> In communi miseriâ, in quam se suâ Culpâ praecipitarunt. 4. They say this is <hi>an Act of Iustice in God</hi> to leave them to lie in that common mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, into which they had plunged temselves, it is <hi>Iustissimo Beneplacito.</hi> So that all the difficulty will be to resolve, 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>an Act of Cruelty</hi> in God to leave Man as he found him <hi>in Massá corruptá; &amp; damnabili?</hi> And 2. Whether it be <hi>an Act of Injustice</hi> in God to damn Men for <hi>their unbelief, and other sins.</hi> If neither of these; it will be no difficult province to make it out, How God may be <hi>just in damning Men for their sin,</hi> and yet <hi>not cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>I am aware that this whole Controversie at last must empty it self into that of <hi>Original sin.</hi> And a difficulty it is that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>strong Heads</hi> to prove, that will not bring <hi>humble Faith</hi> to believe, how Men have <hi>plunged themselves into the common Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> wherein God leaves <hi>those some,</hi> by their own default, <hi>Culpâ suâ:</hi> But the Church of <hi>England</hi> will be responsible for this difficulty, who determines in her Ninth Article, <hi>That in every Person born into the World it deserveth Gods wrath and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The pretence for this odious Imputation, is nothing but <hi>a Fancy,</hi> which forsooth these great Masters of Wit have agreed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52034:25"/>
to call <hi>Reason,</hi> That that which would be <hi>Cruelty, and Injustice in Man,</hi> must presently be so <hi>in God:</hi> As thus, Because it would be <hi>Cruelty,</hi> and <hi>Inhumanity in me</hi> to see <hi>my Enemy</hi> (or if it were but <hi>his Oxe or his Asse)</hi> lie in a Ditch ready to perish, and not to put forth a helping hand to pluck him out, that therefore it must be <hi>Cruelty in God,</hi> to see a sinner lie under sin, and its present Consequents, and not to deliver him from that state: Whereas we might consider that God has tyed us by the Laws of Charity and Interest to such Assistance; because we may possibly call for the same Assistance from others in our Miseries; but God is not so bound up, having once set his Creature on his legs, to raise him up as oft as he shall please to fall.</p>
               <p>The vanity of this Reasoning wil more easily appear, if we take the pains (a little pains will do it) to put, and consider this Case. <hi>Scelus qui non prohibet cum potest jubes;</hi> 'tis <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Maxime, and owned by all; That every Man is bound to prevent, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the wickedness he possibly, and lawfully can; now if we will <hi>Measure God by this Rule,</hi> we must conclude, that God is <hi>unjust and cruel,</hi> if he hinders not all the evil in the World, which he can possibly, and lawfully prevent: Nay, put the Case as favourably as you can, That God is bound to prevent all the wickedness of Mankind, as far as he can by <hi>Moral means,</hi> not exerting any Physical Influence upon his Creature, to impede its vitious propensities, yet this will not excuse him from <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent injustice and cruelty,</hi> if <hi>our Obligations</hi> must be made the <hi>Rule and Measure</hi> of his: For he has not in many places of the World sent them so much as <hi>the Preaching of the Gospel,</hi> nor help'd them to <hi>the best Arguments</hi> against disobedience, nor propounded to them the <hi>strongest Motives</hi> to obedience.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Remonstrants</hi> I perceive would gladly fasten this upon the <hi>Contra Remonstrants,</hi> that there is the same Reason, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between <hi>foreseen Faith, and Election,</hi> and <hi>foreseen infidelity and disobedience,</hi> and <hi>Reprobation.</hi> So Ames Coron. p. 27. <hi>Parilitatem quandam inferre c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So also that Divine Regenerating Grace, works not in Men, as if they were Stocks, or Blocks, not takes away the Will, and its Essential Properties; or compels it by force against its will, but spiritually quickens it, heals it, corrects it, and gently, but yet powerfully inclines it.</hi>  Hence it is clear, that this Synod were satisfied that God in the work of Conversion deals not with Men, as if they were <hi>Stocks,</hi> (and the same you may imagine of <hi>Stones)</hi> but the Question then will be, whether upon this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, they knew how <hi>to keep Man Humble:</hi> Man indeed is a very proud Creature, and it may exercise the skill of the wisest how <hi>to keep him Humble</hi> upon <hi>the best Principles;</hi> but of all that have undertaken this hard task, I most admire at their want of skill, that <hi>know not how to keep Man Humble unless they knock him ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I conclude then, that he must be very immodest, that can entertain a thought so unworthy the Learning, Religion, and sincetity of our first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, which were their greatest Ornaments, as they were of their Times, and the Articles the greatest glory of them both.</p>
               <p>I know it's an easie matter to draw up a Proposition so dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, that the greatest Dissenters may subscribe it; but what is the advantage of such dawbing Policy? Peace or Unity of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Some Men indeed have got a Worm in their Pates, and they fancy this an expedient for these ends, but there's no such matter; for the Subscribers in this Case do not bow their jugd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Articles, but gently bend the Articles to their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It's not the Bank that moves to the Boat, but the Boat that moves to the Bank, and each Party thinks it self the stronger, because it can draw in the obsequious Articles to abet their opinioons</p>

               <p>And when he intimates that they were only <hi>some few Divines</hi> of this Church that used this expedient, we know well, that till the appearance of the late <hi>A. B. Laud,</hi> the generality of this Church were of the <hi>Dort</hi> perswasion; Arminianism has been

But all this, as I observ'd, was brought in to vilifie <hi>the Synod of</hi> Dort; and that eminently Learned and Holy Person St. <hi>Austin,</hi> whose Credit whilst the <hi>Enquirer</hi> would wound, he shall but like <hi>the Viper in the Fable, Break his own Teeth, and never hurt the impregnable Steel.</hi>

               <p>In the beginning of the Reformation, Ceremonies were retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to win upon the people who were then generally Papists, and doted upon old usages, and not as the necessary conditions of Communion; They were retained, not to shut out of Dores the Protestants, which is their present use, but to invite in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists, which was their Original end, but there's nothing more common, then for Institutions to degenerate; and be perverted from the first Reasons of their usage, and yet still to plead <hi>the Credit of their Originals:</hi> Thus <hi>Indulgences, and Remission of sins</hi>

were first granted to all that would engage in the <hi>Holy War,</hi> to recover the Sepulchre of Christ out of the hands of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> but in process of time they were dispensed to them who would massacre the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and <hi>Albigenses,</hi> and such as could not obey the Tyranny of the <hi>Romish</hi> saction: Thus was <hi>the Inquisition</hi> first set up to discover the <hi>Hypocritical Moors in</hi> Spain, but the edge of it since turned against the Protestants. And thus were the Ceremonies perverted, at first made <hi>a Key to let in</hi> the Papists, and now made <hi>a Lock to shut out</hi> Protestants. What a glorious work must it then be to abolish those Engines, that seeing they are become <hi>weak to do Good,</hi> they may be rendred as <hi>impotent to do mischief:</hi> Imitating herein <hi>the Apostle;</hi> who once circumcised <hi>Timothy</hi> to gain <hi>the weak Iews,</hi> yet stoutly refused to Circumcise <hi>Titus,</hi> least he should stumble <hi>the weak Gentiles.</hi> 3.

and that Non-conformity has run a line parallel with the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reformation to this day.</p>
               <p>But (says our <hi>Enquirer) The main quarrel is, that we are not Always Reforming.</hi> No that's not the main, nor any Quarrel that Dissenters have with them: Let but Reformation be made <hi>in what is necessary,</hi> and <hi>as often as is necessary,</hi> and I know none disposed to Quarrel: It were better never to be sick, than to have a Remedy; yet upon supposition of a Disease, in my mind there's nothing like <hi>an approved Medicine.</hi> It's more desirable not to make Shipwrack, than to escape by a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Some Men hate Reformation as the Bear hates the Stake. They pretend, that <hi>the Reformation of the Church will discompose the State:</hi> But the best way to preserve <hi>the Iron,</hi> is to scowr away <hi>the Rust:</hi> A dirty Face may be Wash'd, and yet the skin never rub'd off; and the <hi>House swept,</hi> and never thrown out of the Windows: They plead again, That <hi>no Reformation can be made, but what will notably diminish the Revenues, Grandeur, and Credit of the Church.</hi> And this Objection has more real weight in it than all the rest.

His second Answer is, <hi>All is not to be esteemed Popery that is held by the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>we are not to depart further from her, then she has departed from the Truth, and those things wherein they Agree, are such (and no other) as were generally received by All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiaen Churches, and by the</hi> Roman <hi>before it lay under any i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As all is not to be accounted <hi>Popery</hi> which is held by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> so neither is all to be accounted <hi>Schism</hi> which hot men in their passions and prejudices will call so. Let that be now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Popery, which in the beginning of the Reformation, by the most eminent Divines of this Nation, was so accounted, and he will hear no more I presume of that Argument. 2. I would be satisfied whether <hi>Rome</hi> departed from the Truth, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and Complexion of the Evangelical Worship, when she loaded the Church with such multitudes of unnecessary Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and Superstitions; If not, why did the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> depart from her <hi>in Any?</hi> if so; why did she not depart <hi>in All?</hi> 3. Why should we be so tender of departing from an Abominable Strumpet? were it not more Christian to say, we will depart from the Reformed Churches abroad, no further then they have departed from the Truth, and then the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be ingenuously strong, rather to part with Ceremonies that we may Syncretize with Protestants, then retain them that we may hold fair Quarter with Papists. 4. It cannot be made appear, that those things wherein the Agreement yet abides, were generally received by all Christian Churches: Kneeling at the Sacrament was not received in the Church, till <hi>Rome</hi> came under an ill, and most odious <hi>Character,</hi> Many Centuries after the Apostles knew it not, and when it was first entertain'd, it was accommodated to the grand Idol of Transubstantiation.</p>
               <p>But our <hi>Enquirer</hi> has a mind to be Resolved in a few Questions for his own private satisfaction.</p>
               <p>1. Qu. <hi>If there be such a dangerous affinity between the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and the</hi> Romish, <hi>how came it to pass that the blessed Instruments of our Reformation, A. B.</hi> Cranmer, <hi>and others, laid down their lives in Testimony to this against that.</hi> I meddle nor with his <hi>dangerous Affinities, nor C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nsanguinities,</hi> nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52034:31"/>
they come within the Prohibited Degrees or no; what I am concern'd in, is his argument, which may receive this short Answer. They laid down their lives in testimony against those Errours wherein they <hi>differ'd,</hi> and not against those wherein they might be <hi>agreed:</hi> They might possibly agree <hi>in many,</hi> and yet differ in so many as might cost them their Lives: There was <hi>difference</hi> enough to justifie their <hi>opposition;</hi> and yet there might be <hi>Agreement enough</hi> to justifie a modest complaint.</p>
               <p>I once heard a person upon his Arraignment for Burglary plead strongly, that he had served his Majesty faithfully in his Wars; the judge I remember took him up somewhat too short: Friend! you are not Indicted for your <hi>Loyalty,</hi> but for <hi>breaking a House:</hi> The Non-conformist agree with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in more, and more material points, then <hi>England</hi> can be supposed to Agree with <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet all his smooth and oylie Oratory, will not perswade the Dissenters that they suffer not from their Brethren.</p>
               <p>The difference between the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> is very considerable, it is <hi>Essential,</hi> it constitutes them two distinct Societies, and such as cannot Coalesce without funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental alterations in <hi>the one,</hi> and yet there might possibly remain some things, which might speak too near an Approach.</p>
               <p>I should be loath to be misunderstood; and do question more my own infelicity to cloath my Conceptions with apposite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, then the Acuteness of the Reader, and therefore I shall give him this general Advertisement to prevent mistakes. I am not concerned to Assert, that this Church Approaches too near that of <hi>Rome,</hi> but modestly examining whether the <hi>Enquirer</hi> has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>roved his Negative, that she does not; and <hi>therefore</hi> does not, because <hi>Cranmer, Ridley,</hi> &amp;c. laid down their lives in Testimony against <hi>Romish</hi> Corruptions. I deny not <hi>the Consequent,</hi> but <hi>the Consequence;</hi> Not that this Church maintains a due distance from <hi>Rome;</hi> but that it appears true upon <hi>this Reason,</hi> because the bloody Papists put many of her Ancient Fathers, and Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Children to death, of whose weakness I am the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, being assured by good History, That they have most barbarously persecuted and murdered those who differ'd from them <hi>in some single Point,</hi> whilst they held communion with them <hi>in all the rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> (I say it again) is departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> but yet it may be true, § 1. That some amongst us have laid such foundations, as being regularly, and proportionably advanc'd in their superstructures, will either re-introduce that Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or condemn <hi>Cranmers</hi> separation.

No, no, (says he) <hi>They are commanded so to do by the Head of their Church:</hi> There's the Reason; then what needed all this stir; <hi>The command of a Superiour will hallow, or at least excuse an erroneous Action.</hi> As <hi>a Transcendent</hi> in our Church speaks; and if this Doctrine would but pass, we should have a sweet time on't: Our <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours must impose, and judge what's Indifferent and Decent;</hi> and we have the easiest life in the world, nothing but to <hi>wink hard,</hi> and <hi>lift up our Legs high enough,</hi> and there's no danger.</p>

The Papists may spight the Church of <hi>England</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its fair and vast Revenues, great Dignities, marvellous Honours, Wealth, Splendour, and whatever is desirable to the Eye, because hereby the Church is able to vye with her; and yet their malice upon <hi>the pure account of Religion</hi> may be greater against other lesser, weaker parties, whose Principles stand <hi>more directily in opposition</hi> to those of <hi>Rome:</hi> I do not doubt but our <hi>Enquirer</hi> could bring better Arguments than these, to prove the distance of Religion between the Two Societies, for this I am sure is too weak, unless it may appear, that their spight is levelled against the Church, <hi>meerly on account of those Principles wherein she differs from Dissenters.</hi>

then there is, and yet the opposition against Popery may not prove the distance so great, but there may be too great an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement: The State of <hi>Venice</hi> did once expel <hi>the Iesuits,</hi> and yet they expelled <hi>not Popery;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> were long before they entertained <hi>the Decrees of Trent,</hi> yet still they were <hi>Popish:</hi> I quote them for no more than this; that its evident there may be <hi>fierce opposition</hi> upon some particular accounts, when yet there may be <hi>a great Harmony</hi> upon other accounts: Many oppose a Popery coming <hi>Top and Top Gallant,</hi> that yet would compound for a Popery upon handsome Terms.</p>
               <p>This last Question has strangely transported him into a most passionate Panegyrick in commendation of <hi>some Church-men,</hi> for some rare exploit or other, which by all the circumstances, must be the procuring <hi>The late Proclamation against Dissenters:</hi> An Act so glorious, that no Age shall ever wear out its memory; This is it, which challenges from posterity, Statues of <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Brass, and will embalm their memories to all succeeding Generations: He had lately exposed the Ignorance of those sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Men of <hi>Dort,</hi> that <hi>they kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>This high Encomium is attended in the rear with a severe charge against the Dissenters, That <hi>they were instrumental in procuring a toleration and suspension of the Laws for Popery:</hi> It is true. Consciencious Dissenters desire not the execution of <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary Laws</hi> upon Papists, merely for their Religion, there are proper ways enow to obviate the cursed tendencies of <hi>their principles,</hi> without dishonouring <hi>our own.</hi> Nor ought the modest desire of a sober liberty for the exercise of their own Consciences, to be interpreted an endeavour for <hi>a Toleration of Popery;</hi> They ever hoped that Governours know the difference between <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Protestants;</hi> who agree with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Essentials of Christianity, and <hi>Recusants</hi> who substantially differ; and the wisdom of his gracious Majesty in his Declaration for Indulgence, made a clear distinction between them, though some wise Church-men could not see it.</p>
               <p>Protestants however differing in some things from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent establishment, yet have no forreign Interest, no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine dependences; They own no Exotick Head, that may Alienate their affections from their natural Prince and leige Lord, their private peace and happiness is wrapt up in the general Happiness of the King and Kingdom; Any eye but that of Envy might have discovered a sensible difference between these parties.</p>
               <p>That Protestant Dissenters were instrumental to procure such

a Toleration for Popery, is therefore a slander so unworthy, that none would have forged, but they who never baulk an Officious untruth, when it may subserve their main design, to render the Non-conformists Odious; that so the instruments of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction may not be fetter'd with the reluctancy of their restif Consciences.</p>

Yes so it may be, and yet none of the best neither; what sleighty Topicks are these from whence to evince the excellency of English Preaching: Commend me to read <hi>one Sermon</hi> in the works of the Learned <hi>B. Reynolds,</hi> and it storms the incredulous sooner then a hundred of these Ridicules put together: But how does it appear that the English transcends the Romish Preaching? pray mark the proof: why <hi>Erasmus wrote a Book of the Art of Preaching, and full of the follies and rediculous passages in Popish Sermons.</hi> Most Meridian Conviction!

               <p>As he would be injurious to the Truth that should take the sollies gathered up in this modern Author for the measure of present Preaching, so shall he be equally vain, that shall make those impertinencies gleaned up by <hi>Erasmus,</hi> to be the true measure of the Preaching of those times: And why may we not charitably suppose, that the Romanists have furbisht up their rusty Preaching since the days of <hi>Erasmus,</hi> as well as we have scowred up ours since the days of the Homilies?</p>

Now the first of these Remote Causes is; <hi>That it was the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and is the great disadvantage of this Church, that it was not well confirmed, and swadled in its Infancy, it conflicted with Serpents in its Cradle, and underwent a severe persecution.</hi>

               <p>What he understands by that old Blind Heathenish Beldame <hi>Fortune,</hi> I cannot tell.

                  <hi>a Certificate</hi> that he is no friend to <hi>the immutable Counsels of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However <hi>this early persecution</hi> must needs have a considerable influence upon the Churches present weakness; for thus <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosheths Nurse,</hi> making more hast than good speed, in her fright and flight threw down <hi>her Nursery,</hi> and he became lame to his dying day.</p>
               <p>It was therefore politickly done of <hi>Licurgus</hi> (thinks the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer, when he had framed the Body of the</hi> Spartan <hi>Laws, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend an occasion to Travel; and having first taken an Oath of the People, that they should make no alteration</hi> in that Government (either in Church or State) <hi>till his return, he resolvedly never returns again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the old Masters of Ceremonies could have perswaded the people to some such subscription, that they would never alter their Inventions till their return, and then had sentenced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to a voluntary perpetual Exile, it had been a successful piece of self denial to cheat a Nation into Uniformity, no less honourable to themselves than grateful to thousands.</p>
               <p>But thus the Case stood with the Church in its Infancy. <hi>King</hi> Edward VI. <hi>dying Immaturely, (too soon</hi> says the <hi>Enquirer, too late</hi> says Dr. <hi>Heylin) Q.</hi> Mary <hi>succeeded him in the Throne,</hi> and so the Church was <hi>put upon difficulties and trials, before its Limbs and Ioints were settled and confirmed.</hi>

§ 3. Its a scandalous reproach which he throws upon the English Reformation, as if it lay <hi>in Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> and such kind of inventions. <hi>Before</hi> (says he) <hi>they were well in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>red to the English Reformation, they became enamoured of the Rites of other Churches:</hi> The Reformation lay not in <hi>preserving</hi> Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, but in <hi>purging</hi> them away: so far <hi>purged.</hi> so far <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;</hi> you may call <hi>the Scar upon the Face,</hi> it's <hi>Healing,</hi> if you please: but I will rather chuse to call it, <hi>a foot-step, or relique of the old former wound:</hi> nor will I call <hi>the dust behind the door</hi> part of <hi>the Houses cleanliness,</hi> and yet I dare not impose, let others call them as they please: this is evident, That those things wherein the Reformation consisted, were opposed by the Papists, but the Ceremonies were not opposed by the Papists, therefore our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation consisted not in Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>§ 4. No less is the reproach cast upon those famous Exiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they were <hi>enamoured of the Rites of other Churches;</hi> we read indeed 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16. 10. 11. That King <hi>Ahaz</hi> in his Journey to <hi>Damascus, saw an Altar</hi> there, which pleased his Humour, and <hi>he sent to</hi> Urijah <hi>the Priest, the fashion of the Altar, and the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of it, according to all the workmanship of it,</hi> and he like a tractable good-natur'd man, that would not offend the King for a small matter, <hi>built an Alter according to all that King</hi> Ahaz <hi>had sent from</hi> Damascus: but our banished worthies imitated not the Example, it was not the opposing one Ceremony to another, but the opposition of all Ceremonies which was their Glory.</p>
               <p>But our <hi>Enquirer</hi> is resolved they shall be in an Errour, and which looks something like Charity, he will convince them of it too.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their first weakness was, That <hi>they considered not whether those other Rites were better, so long as they were newer and fresher.</hi> A groundless charge! new or old, fresh or stale, was nothing to them, it was Ceremonies as such which they rejected; And if he can evince, that the present Dissenters have derived from the Transmarine Churches any Rite or Ceremony, which is not of Divine Institution, they are not so enamoured of it, but they will presently deliver it up into his hands, to be dealt with at discretion.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Another failing was, that they observed not, <hi>That there are oftentimes reasons to make one form necessary in one place or people, and not in another, when its possible they may be both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They <hi>observed</hi> without his information, that the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time and place in general, were indifferent; but they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served not, that new invented Rites were necessary in any time or place, to present the grace and duty of the Gospel; They knew well, that all Christs Ordinances were <hi>Decently to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred;</hi> and they knew as well that there was no need to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute <hi>New Rites or Ceremonies</hi> to create a decency, to conciliate a respect or reverence to any of Christs Ordinances: If we must have <hi>New Rites,</hi> to render <hi>Christs Ceremonies decent and comely,</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:52034:44"/>
then we must have <hi>New Rites also</hi> invented to render those <hi>Humane Ceremonies decent and comely;</hi> and so infinitely forwards, others to make <hi>those latter decent and comely,</hi> because we cannot imagine the wisest man on Earth able to contrive <hi>a more perfect Ceremony</hi> then Christ has done: And thus we must have <hi>a Lace</hi> to make the Garment <hi>decent,</hi> and then an <hi>Edging</hi> to make the <hi>Lace decent;</hi> and then we shall make Religion <hi>a Suit,</hi> as fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick as <hi>that Princes,</hi> who fitted it with <hi>Loop-holes,</hi> like <hi>Argu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>I have heard of a Taylour (from <hi>France</hi> no doubt) that was sent for to take measure of, and make a Corde robe for the Moon; she was then very slender, as being in Conjunction with the Sun, and when at the Fortnights end he brought her home her Gown, she was grown so Corpulent, that it would not meet by a Third part of her Circumference; The poor man was sadly ashamed, blamed his Spectacles, and with more Circumspection, takes measure of her Ladyship, and when he came <hi>to try her Stayes,</hi> she was grown so slender, that she looked like a shrimp in a Lobsters Symarr: Now the Moon is the Church, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the measures which our modish Fashion-mongers take of her, must at <hi>every Change and Full,</hi> appear in new Accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements: And as Nations have differing Attires each from other, and <hi>the Winters-freeze</hi> differs from <hi>the Summers-stuff;</hi> so the same Church must have a <hi>Mourning Worship,</hi> and <hi>a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Worship,</hi> accommodated to her outward accessions or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clensions in Wealth and Riches.</p>
               <p>The <hi>external Condition</hi> of the Church does vary, but <hi>her God</hi> is the same; her <hi>joy may be turned into sorrow,</hi> her <hi>sorrow into joy;</hi> she has her <hi>fasting,</hi> as well as her <hi>feasting</hi> days; solemn Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and solemn Thanksgivings, but <hi>her Worship</hi> continues still <hi>the same;</hi> Though the <hi>Worshippers</hi> may alter their garbe, yet the Worship which respects the <hi>immutable God,</hi> is <hi>immutable</hi> like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: If <hi>new things</hi> pleased our God, it were our duty to study <hi>new things.</hi> If he shall declare for <hi>Summer Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>Winter Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> we must provide accordingly; but if with him there be <hi>no variableness nor shadow of turning,</hi> that Worship and Service which we offer to him, ought to observe the same fixedness and stability.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another of their follies was, that they could not hit upon <hi>the right rule of Reformation.</hi> It was <hi>their unhappiness,</hi> that this <hi>Enquirer</hi> was not then born to direct them to it; which advantage the present Age may enjoy, if we be not wanting to our selves; And it is this: <hi>That those differing forms be fitted to the Humour and Custom of the People, and made consonant to the civil Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> A <hi>Rule</hi> had need be <hi>straight,</hi> or else whatever is framed by it will be <hi>crooked:</hi> Now 1.

a score times in four and twenty hours. 2. <hi>Custom</hi> has I confess a <hi>fairer plea,</hi> some persons of no small Learning, pretending it to be <hi>the only rule of decency in things indifferent,</hi> In p. 31. <hi>our Enquirer</hi> intimates, <hi>That the Constitutions</hi> (of a Church) <hi>by Time are digested into Customs, and made natural.</hi> Now if Custom be <hi>the only rule of decency,</hi> then <hi>the Churches Constitutions</hi> ought to be of no things but what are <hi>naturalized to a People by Custom,</hi> and thereby made decent, unless he has a power also <hi>to command All things te be done undecently,</hi> and then leave to be <hi>made comely by long usage,</hi> and continued Custom; but if the <hi>Churches Constitutions,</hi> her power to <hi>impose and judge what is decent,</hi> be <hi>the Rule of Decency,</hi> and <hi>the Reason of our Obedience,</hi> then Custom is not <hi>the only Rule of Decency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How much better were it, that the peoples <hi>fluctuating Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, odd Customs,</hi> and <hi>the Churches Constitutions,</hi> were all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by <hi>the Word of God;</hi> which is equal, insallible, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial: <hi>Equal,</hi> and therefore we shall not be to seek for our Worship upon every accident; <hi>infallible,</hi> and therefore we may safely confide in its direction; and <hi>impartial,</hi> and so abets no party, favours no faction or worldly interest, but faithfully and fully delivers out to us the mind and will of God: Whereas our <hi>Enquirers</hi> rule, must prove the Author of all mis-rule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion amongst the Churches of Christ, when <hi>Humours</hi> shall cross <hi>Customs,</hi> Customs thwart Humours, and perhaps <hi>Civil Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuiions</hi> shall retrench both <hi>Customs and Humours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One instance will a little enlighten us in his design and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Where</hi> (says he) <hi>the Reformation had not at the first the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Civil Government, there the Reformers were constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enter into particular confederations with one another, from whence Presbyterian Government seems to have taken its rise.</hi> Say you so? then I know who will assume; But for the first three hundred years after Christ all along through the purest Primitive times, the Christian Reformation had not <hi>the Countenance of the Civil Government,</hi> and therefore they <hi>enter'd into particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federations;</hi> from <hi>whence the Presbyterian Government had its rise.</hi> I cannot certainly tell, and therefore dare not conjecture, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these <hi>particular confederations,</hi> be not a kind of <hi>New La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> for <hi>the solemn League and Covenant;</hi> but this I will say, That t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>All this while it remains a great mystery, <hi>how these poor Exiles prejudiced the English Reformation;</hi> And therefore in the first place he will give us some light into it by a plain and familiar il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration. <hi>As the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>even when they had Bread from Heaven, Angels Food, longed for the Onions and Garlick of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>remembring how sweet they were to them, under their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Bondage; so these Men retained as long as they lived a lingring after those entertainments which they found then very pleasant, when the other was denied them.</hi> The foundation of this ingenious
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52034:45"/>
illustration lies in these Two Things. First, That the Rites and Ceremonies of <hi>England</hi> were <hi>Manna, Bread from Heaven, Angels Food:</hi> And Secondly, That the Worship of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches without these Ceremonies were <hi>Onions and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> he must have an Ostrich-Stomack that could concoct them, unless they were first m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>erated, and dissolved in a Menstruum of Ceremonies: Now the parallel is so self-evident, that we shall only need to gather what drops of it self, and not to shake the Tree: For 1. As the Manna was of Gods own appointment, so we must not question but the Ceremonies also were. 2. The Manna was <hi>Angels Food,</hi> and as whenever An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels will cloath themselves with <hi>a Garment,</hi> they cannot as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume one of more Congruity than <hi>Light;</hi> so whenever they shall please to condescend <hi>to a Treat</hi> from Men, they cannot be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved up with <hi>a more agreeable Dish</hi> than Ceremonies; And then 3. As the Manna was despised, and accounted <hi>dry Meat,</hi> so are these Ceremonies too; and therefore as wise Fathers take away their Childrens Meat, if they will not eat their Bread; so the Fathers of the Church think it wisdom to deny their Children Spiritual Food, if they will not down with the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or let them fast till they have a better Stomack: But the parallel comes off very lamely at last: For the Manna lasted only whilst the Church was <hi>in the Wilderness,</hi> and <hi>ceased</hi> as soon as they entered <hi>the Land of Canaan;</hi> whereas the poor afflicted and persecuted Churches knew none of those Rites, but surfeited of them in the day of her Rest and Prosperity: And therefore to have carried on the Humour, he might have feigned one thing more as well as all the rest; That those Exiled Worthies lived all the fourty years of their Banishment upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Rites and Ceremonies, but when they came to the Land of Promise, <hi>the Manna ceased.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. A second Cause of this evil effect is: <hi>The bad and incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent provision made for a learned and able Ministry in the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and generality of the great Parishes in</hi> England.</p>
               <p>But before <hi>this Incompetency</hi> can possibly <hi>be remedied,</hi> it must be known what is <hi>a Competency</hi> for a Learned Minister, for some that are <hi>Learned</hi> enough, are also <hi>Able</hi> to spend five times more than the people are worth, or can spare.</p>
               <p>Two things are here considerable, which have exercised <hi>our Enquirers</hi> politick Head-piece.</p>
               <p>The Grievance, and the Redress of the Grievance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Grievance. <hi>The multitude of Opinions that deform and trouble the Church, are generally hatch'd and nursed in the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations and Market Towns. Nay not only the dissatisfaction with the Rites and Ceremonies, but the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>se greater Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> But how easily might all this mischief have been remedied, had he pursued <hi>his own Primitive Rule of</hi> Reformation. <hi>viz.</hi> Modelled <hi>the Rites and Government of the Church to the Humours and Customs of the People.</hi> But his meaning was; That Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation should be accommodated <hi>to the Humours of the Villages,</hi> where the people mind nothing of Religion, (as he thinks) but not <hi>of the Market Towns, where they are intent upon New Fashions:</hi> But the Reader must look on these as the lesser sports of his Wit, and the dilations of a pregnant Fancy; for the true Reason of all the dissatisfaction about those Rites, has been the want of good ground for them in the Word of God, and the main cause of the troubles that have ensued thereupon, has been the unreasonable and unseasonable imposition of them upon the Consciences of Men.</p>
               <p>But our <hi>Enquirer</hi> is otherwise minded, and he imputes these <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ns and Confusions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>To the Fullness and Luxury of these great Towns.</hi> Well! have a little patience till he can procure his Proclamation against Trade, and to shut up the Shops, and that will most effectually take down their Greace, and humble their haughty Stomacks, and they will grow tame and manageable: But then another diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty will arise, how they should maintain a <hi>Learned and able Ministry,</hi> and allow him <hi>such a Revenue</hi> as he shall confess to be <hi>a Competency;</hi> but is not this inconvenience to be found in the Country Towns and Villages? No! They <hi>are for the most part quiet, and peaceably comply with establish'd Orders;</hi> for they are <hi>tired with hard labour, and never trouble themselves no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:52034:46"/>
but apply themselves to Till the ground, and earn their Breat with the sweat of their Brows.</hi> Let them have liberty to be poor, and pay their Tithes, and they concern themselves little in Religion, or the saving of their Souls; they go by the old Rule, <hi>Si Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus vult vadere sicut vult, Mundus debet vadere sicut vult:</hi> These Creatures indeed will make fit materials for Uniformity to work upon; you may put the Bridle in their Mouths, and clap the Saddle on their Backs, and ride them till they are broken winded and foundred, and they will neither wince nor complain; and yet there are some sowr Lads and knotty pieces amongst these too, that will not budge a foot, nor yield an Ace further than Conscience informed from the Word of God shall command them.</p>
               <p>§ 2. In these great Towns <hi>they have leasure to excogitate Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Spirit, and confidence to abet them; and here there is great concourse of people, where Notions are more easily started, and Parties sooner formed for the defence of them:</hi> Where the dividing Notions have been most started. I cannot infallibly tell; but I am sure the richest Corporations find themselves something else to do than <hi>to excogitate Ceremonies,</hi> or other Novelties; and whether Convocations have always sat in the great Towns or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Villages, is easily determined.</p>
               <p>§ 3. The misery of all is; That in these great Towns where was <hi>most need of the most liberal maintenance: so pittiful a Pittance is left to the Curate or Minister, that he can scarce afford himself Books to study, nor perhaps Bread to eat, without too servile a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the benevolence of his Richer Neighbours, by which means either his Spirit is broken with Adversity, or the dignity of his Office obscured, or he tempted to a sordid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>The bottom of the Grievance in plain terms is this: If the Clergy could but once procure a Revenue settled hard and fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="2">2. The Remedy of this insupportable Grievance in short is this. That a Law be made, that all Corporations, Market Towns, and great Parishes, provide a Maintenance for the Vicars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>in proportion to</hi> London; for <hi>till some such course be taken, it will be in vain to expect, that the Church of</hi> England, <hi>or the best Laws of Religion, should either obtain just Ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So far am I from envying them their Honours, Revenues, and desired Affluences, that I could be content they had <hi>the Nine parts,</hi> and the poor <hi>Tenth only</hi> left to the Land-lord, as a <hi>small quit-rent</hi> in memory that <hi>the whole</hi> was once his own: But what security can we have, that <hi>that also</hi> will not be demanded in time to make up a <hi>Compotency;</hi> for Trade is <hi>too great,</hi> Corporations <hi>too rich,</hi> every one has <hi>too much,</hi> only the Clergy have <hi>just nothing</hi> till they have got their Competency, which <hi>is nothing less than the whole.</hi>

               <p>This was the glorious design managed by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> when the Church was so unmeasurably rich, that it maintained abundance of Cardinals, every one carrying the Port and State of a King; so many Arch-bishops, Bishops, Priests, besides the infinite numbers and swarms of Religious Persons, all endowed with ample Revenues, and yet they made a <hi>Begging Decree;</hi> much would have more; <hi>Cujus avariti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>He that has a mind to interpose in a discourse of Wars, may possibly get a broken Pate for his pains; otherwise the Valour of the English Nation, has so justified it self in our Naval Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it needs not be ashamed to look back upon its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; but I shall only observe as I pass on these few things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Ecclesiastical Histories observe to our hand, that the Wars between the Emperour and the <hi>Persians,</hi> proved a means to check those persecutions which the <hi>Arians</hi> raised against the Orthodox: And if the great Governour of the World will <hi>over-rule publick Calamities,</hi> to render the condition of persecuted Christians tolerable, we have the more reason to admire his powerful wisdom, who out of <hi>so great an Evil</hi> could extract <hi>so great a Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I must call to mind one of our <hi>Enquirers</hi> grave sentences; <hi>ubi solitudinem feccrunt, pacem vocant:</hi> That which some men count <hi>Peace,</hi> is nothing but <hi>havock and desolation.</hi> Like some great <hi>Enclosers,</hi> who having depopulated all about them, and left nothing but the bare Ribs, and naked Skeleton, of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flourishing Farms, bless themselves that they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Thus when our Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical projectors, shall have ruined Trade, routed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious, and forced peaceable Dissenters into deserts; beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar'd Corporations, those Nests of Schism, they may applaud themselves for profound States-men, that they have wrought out their own Ease, with the miseries of the People.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wars may reasonably contribute something to a just and well bounded Liberty of Conscience, for how could a Prince expect his Subjects should hazard their lives in his righteous cause and quarrel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and open their Purses wide to maintain the War, when either they must lose them in his Service, or if they return ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving survived apparent dangers, be trampled upon at home,

by those who have all the while sat still at ease, wrapt up in warm Furr, and security.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Dignity of the Church shames theirs: Dignity</hi> is <hi>a Term of Art,</hi> and capable of several meanings: If by Dignity we should (as we ought) to understand, <hi>A real essential worthiness,</hi> arising from something excellent in the account of God; then <hi>this Church</hi> has so out-stript <hi>her,</hi> that she ought not to be named in the same day and year.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>The An ient Gravity of our Church reproves</hi> theirs: I am sorry for the Honour of our Church, which I truly Reverence, that this Gentleman in vying with <hi>Rome,</hi> should pitch upon those particulars, wherein if we <hi>do excel,</hi> and carry the day, it will be no such Victory as to challenge <hi>a Triumph;</hi> and yet such is the dubiousness of the case, that perhaps we may lose the day: I do not yet hear that <hi>Rome</hi> has disclaimed Antiquity to be one of <hi>the marks of the true Church:</hi> and know something of her presumption in applying into her self: Let any Antiquity short of Scripture Epocha, be fixt upon, and she will make a sorry shift to scramble through many a tiresome Century, and scuffle to come as near the Apostolical days as some others: Both sides I think have play'd at the game of <hi>Drop-father,</hi> so long till they are weary, and forced to confess, that some things <hi>now in usage,</hi> were <hi>unknown to the Fathers,</hi> and many things practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>by the Fathers,</hi> which we have silently suffered to grow ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solete by desuetude.</p>
               <p>I look upon these things as matters of course and form, to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52034:53"/>
look big, and set the best foot before: for if ever we confute <hi>Rome</hi> with an <hi>Army of hard words, Decency, Order, Antiquity, Gravity,</hi> they must be such as <hi>the Word of God</hi> has made so. It must be a <hi>Decency</hi> warranted by God himself, either from <hi>the Light of Nature,</hi> or <hi>Scripture; an Order</hi> of Christs Establishment; a <hi>Gravity</hi> exemplified from the Apostles; and <hi>an Antiquity</hi> which was <hi>from the Beginning;</hi> and when <hi>Scripture</hi> is once made sole Umpire in the Quarrel. As the Church of <hi>England</hi> will certainly run the Papist <hi>out of all distance,</hi> so the Non-conformist will begin to put in his stake, and perhaps <hi>win the Plate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. If you ask how the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> undermines <hi>our Church,</hi> he answers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>She furnishes other parties with Arguments against it.</hi> It were much easier to evince, that the <hi>Euquirer</hi> has rather borrowed his Arguments from <hi>Rome,</hi> then <hi>Rome</hi> lent one to the Non-conformists: I think there's not one Arrow he can shoot against them, but I can shew him where't was borrow'd, or shotten from a Jesuites Quiver: where was that Argument taken from Axes, Halters, Pillories, Galleys, Prisons, Consiscations, as some express it, or as he more concisely, <hi>Executing the Laws,</hi> borrow'd, but from <hi>Rome?</hi> The Scripture knows it not, the better sort of Heathens abhorr'd it, Protestants disown it, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists only glory in it.

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And whence was that argument for Active unlimited Obedience to all things commanded by the Church, borrowed; for though it becomes no mouth so well as his that can boast of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> yet still we are pressed with the same Argument, and in the last resort <hi>Publick Conscience</hi> must carry it. I am sorry this impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent person should give any one occasion <hi>to say further,</hi> that some of us at home, have furnisht <hi>Rome</hi> with Arguments against the Reformation, Arguments from the Scripture, <hi>Rome</hi> has none; from the nature of the thing, not one; but some have put into their Hands a left-handed Dagger, which does mischief enough, it's called <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem.</hi> Thus when we are earnest with them to throw away their <hi>Oil and Cream;</hi> they bid us, throw away <hi>our Cross;</hi> If we desire her to reform <hi>her Cowles and Copes,</hi> she calls to us to reform <hi>our Surplice.</hi> When we in a friendly way caution them not to feed upon <hi>the Devils flesh,</hi> they answer, As good eat <hi>his flesh</hi> as <hi>the Broth he was boiled in.</hi>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52034:53"/>
propounded a few <hi>Enquiries,</hi> I would immediately resign to him his Province.</p>
               <p>§ 1. If the enmity between the two Churches be so great as is pretended, what was the reason that so many Stars of the first magnitude in this Orb, were <hi>in Conjunction with the Dragons Tail?</hi> why were they so ready to yield him his <hi>Western Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate,</hi> and all within the <hi>first four hundred years?</hi> which will at once bring <hi>England</hi> under his Subjection: though I much que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> will have so much good nature as to resign him <hi>the Eastern Patriarchate</hi> so easily.</p>
               <p>§ 2. If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be this Churches <hi>Enemy,</hi> is she not then concerned to get more Churches to be her <hi>Friends?</hi> It's a wild Humour of some Church-men, that they will disoblige all the world, provoking every ones hand against themselves, whilst their hand is against every one; If <hi>Rome</hi> be an Enemy, she is a potent, malicious, subtle, and United Enemy, and it concerns a Church not to be <hi>divided at home,</hi> when her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are <hi>united abroad:</hi> and to combine with the forreign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants in Love, were an excellent way to prevent the Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of <hi>Romes</hi> hatred.</p>
               <p>§ 3. It would be enquired, If <hi>Rome</hi> be such an Enemy, what should be that which provokes her wrath and indignation? what that should be that makes the envious Snakes, wherewith An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists head is periwigg'd to hiss and spit out their Venom? Does she Storm and Rage because we have retained two or three of her fine Ceremonies? that cannot be the Origin of her spight! They are <hi>those things</hi> wherein the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Non-conformists are mutually agreed, that <hi>Rome</hi> opposes this Church in, and they are <hi>those things</hi> wherein this Church symbolizes with <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein she differs most from the Non-conformists.</p>
               <p>When the Heathens triumphed in the great feats of their <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Tyrius,</hi> and <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> the Christians answered. That whatever good effect their Religion ever had upon the Lives of Men, was owing to those Principles and Truths, which it had <hi>in Common</hi> with Christianity; Thus will Dissenters plead, That whatever success this Church has had in its Ministry upon the Souls of Men, is due to those fundamental Truths and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Christian Faith, which she obtains <hi>in Common</hi> with the Reformed Churches: On the other side; The <hi>Roman</hi> Faction persecutes and undermines this Church upon grounds equal to all the Reformed Churches, and this Church is angry (at least) with Dissenters for those matters wherein she seems to approach too near <hi>Roman</hi> corruption.</p>

than their Lives, and yet will venture it upon indifferent things? Are they not more to be admired, that extol Peace so highly, and yet sacrifice it to their own meer wills and pleasures: But is not this yet the greatest wonder, that Peace should depend o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> that which Salvation does not; and yet he will sacrifice his Life for it, as soon as against that, upon which his Eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depends? 2. If Men be <hi>not Competent Iudges of their own Actions,</hi> what is become of <hi>that Iudgement of Discretion,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we were even now gratified? Is this <hi>the Iudgement of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi> to surrender our Consciences <hi>upon Discretion?</hi> The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists,</hi> who <hi>appropriate all Iudgement to the Clergie, and deal with the rest of Mankind as Idiots and Sots,</hi> could have said no more, then that Men are <hi>not Competent Iudg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Why is not the danger of trusting others, as great as trusting to the Word of God? Mine Eyes may be presumed to see for my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct as faithfully as another Mans; and my own Conscience will probably be as faithful to my Eternal concerns as any ones I could find. And I have tried it, that it's much easier to obtain a moral certainty that I have <hi>the Mind and Will of God,</hi> then that I have grasped the Mind of any Church from their most Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Articles, or Confessions of Faith. 4. Why should others be troubled, that I am not so wise as they? It's none of my trouble that they use their liberty without dispising, whilst I exercise that which God has given me without judging. If we must trust others in composing Worship and Divine Service for us, Terms of Communion of Christians, where is then the difference between <hi>That,</hi> and the Popish Implicit Faith? <hi>This will make the People Sheep indeed, but silly ones</hi> I am sure; such is my weakness, I can see no difference between <hi>Blind Obedience,</hi> and <hi>trusting others with the determination of it;</hi> or between <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith,</hi> and <hi>trusting others</hi> as <hi>the Reason of my Belief;</hi> either then here's <hi>no Remedy,</hi> or one <hi>worse</hi> then the Disease: <hi>The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease</hi> at worst is but to enjoy a liberty in those things <hi>Christ left free;</hi> nor is there any necessity that freedom should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

tempt us to think that is no Remedy of Gods prescribing, that deals alike with humble and pround, the peaceable and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. But for all this demureness, I doubt there are <hi>other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies</hi> besides <hi>a Declaration,</hi> other <hi>Weapons</hi> besides <hi>Paper Pellets.</hi> There is <hi>a Significavit,</hi> a Writ <hi>de Excommunicato Capiendo, de Har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>I have often admired the modesty of the Church of <hi>Rome: She never put any Man to death: She never burnt any at a Stake:</hi> It's not for <hi>Holy Men, Men of Peace</hi> to shed Blood, to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of Cruelty; No, the Church only delivers them over to <hi>the Secular Power,</hi> and what he does with them, how he treats them she knows nothing: Thus having drawn in the Magistrate to do her Drudgery, she <hi>wipes her Mouth, washes her Hands,</hi> and protests she is <hi>Innocent of the Blood of these Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An Objection was timely foreseen that might be made against his Discourse, and like a person that knew how to be friendly to himself, he has put it in favourable and gentle Terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This will equally extend to all other Reformed Churches, as well as our own, and might have brought forth all the evil we complain of, and impute to it in former Ages as well as now; for the generality of the People were not much wiser then now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, the Protestant Churches have their Members as lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to mistake beyond Sea, as ours on this side; they have <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Reason</hi> as well as we, and <hi>a Iudgement of Discretion</hi> too; and so had the Primitive Times too; Christians then were equally in danger of being seduced by their own injudiciousness, and yet the one continued in much peace, and the other still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues so, without <hi>the Remedy of Imposing Mystical Ceremonies:</hi> Nay, to speak properly, without <hi>the Disease of Impositions:</hi> The <hi>not imposing doubtful things as the Terms of Communion,</hi> were with them the Prophylacticks of Schisms and Divisions, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of them (which is strange) is the Therapeutick of Schisms and Divisions, to which he answers two things.</p>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>That other Churches found the effects of Ignorance and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance more or less as well as we:</hi> To which might be returned; That they found it not in those things which they left free; but if at any time they laid the weight of the Churches peace upon unnecessaries, they found in proportion the same effects of the same Cause, which we have found: <hi>But</hi> (says he) <hi>that was to be ascribed not to the happiness of their Constitutions, but to the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of their Conditions.</hi> I confess I am not altogether of his mind; it was mainly due to the happiness of their Constitution there were fewer Contentions, because fewer Bones of Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and less of Divisions, because they united upon a Scr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> ptural, and therefore secure bottom.</p>
               <p>That <hi>the Church of</hi> Corinth <hi>needed a check for her Divisions,</hi> is very true, and a smart one she deserved: And 'tis as true too;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52034:59"/>
That the Apostle had not Recourse to our <hi>Modern Remedies,</hi> to exert his Apostolical power, to silence the Clamour by dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Thunderbolt of Excommunication against the weaker Party; and yet he had a far more specious pretence, then any Church Governours can now justly Claim: His Apostolical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <hi>to Plant and Water Churches,</hi> which would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Reverence</hi> to his Person, and conciliated <hi>Authority</hi> to his Determinations; and yet he either had no such power, or durst not use it, but took the Healing way, tolerating things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and pressing them mutually to Love and Peace under their various apprehensions about Mint, Anise and Cummi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. But yet he thinks, That <hi>the Reason why Primitive Christians, whilst under persecution, had one Heart and Mind, was, because they submitted their private Fancies to publick Safety:</hi> Which is only the assigning of an Imaginary cause for a Real one. Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians, whilst surrounded with Adversaries, were <hi>of one Heart and Mind in the main,</hi> and the true Reason was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their dangers and pressing fears had not yet let in that <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical Imposing Spirit</hi> into the Guides of the Church, which Ease and Liberty afterwards produced. And though we dare not charge our Divisions upon <hi>Peace, Plenty and Liberty,</hi> which are great Mercies to a sinful people; yet we would lay the Saddle upon the right Horse, the blame at the right door; 'Tis not the injudiciousness of the People, who are willing to be quiet, and accept of rest upon tolerable terms; but the obstinacy of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who make their own Wills, the reason of their Injunctions, not considering that all mens Intellectuals are not of one size and height; and yet as if Consciences were to be fooled with, Mens Souls sported with, they necessitate the People either to act against their Light, or to fall under the severe lash of a Poenal Statute.</p>
               <p>§ 2. <hi>That these Evils broke out no sooner</hi> (says he) <hi>is due to the contentment generally took in their first Emerging out of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Superstitions of Popery:</hi> Very true! they were so full of Admiration at what God had done for them; that they consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not what further to ask God to do for them: so transported that they were out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they never considered <hi>how short the Wilderness was of the promised Land;</hi> And hence he might have answered himself, p. 13. <hi>If there be such a dangerous Affinity between the Church of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Rome, <hi>how came it to pass that</hi> Cranmer <hi>and</hi> Ridley, <hi>&amp;c. laid down their Lives in testimony to this against that? Rome</hi> was not built, nor will it be destroyed in one day. Our first Martyrs laid down their Lives in Testimony that <hi>Rome</hi> was guilty of dangerous Doctrines, but not that we had nothing remaining that needed a Reformation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A second cause is, That <hi>a great part of this Nation having been leavened with Iewish Superstitious or Traditions, hath thereby been indisposed to an uniform reception of, and Perseverance in the Reformation of Religion held forth by this Church.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And it does appear (by his talk) that a more secret and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Judaisme then all this, has of old been rooted in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that no Ecclesiastical Pick-axes have been able to extirpate it; <hi>for</hi> (says he) <hi>the greatest difficulty that</hi> Austin <hi>the Monk found here, was to bring the Inhabitants from the observation of Easter, and some other Rites according to the manner of the Iewish and Eastern Churches; to that of the Roman and Western: and the doing it, cost the lives of twelve hundred Monks, who stubbornly opposed his Inovations.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>, or by <hi>just conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> derived thence, they are ready to justifie it without fear of Judaizing, That nothing, no outward visible sign of inward and invisible Grace, is lawful in the Service of God, as a part of that Service, which is not expresly, or by just and clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence prescribed in the Scripture, not excluding whatever help from the Light of Nature, to give us a fuller prospect into the Mind of God in his Word. Nor ought this to be stigmatized as a principle peculiar to the <hi>Iews,</hi> but common to them, with all other true Worshippers of God, from the beginning of the World. To impose a <hi>part of Worship,</hi> is not only an Imposition <hi>upon Man,</hi> but <hi>upon God.</hi> The Imposer does not only compel <hi>Man to offer,</hi> but <hi>God to Accept</hi> what is offered: for seeing <hi>the End</hi> of All Worship is <hi>Acceptation</hi> with him <hi>whom we Worship:</hi> this End must influence our whole Worship. And this is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who prays, (or invites to pray) <hi>for true Repentance and the Holy Spirit, that those things may please him which we do at this present:</hi> Now it's neither <hi>our own Fancies,</hi> nor <hi>the Will of Men,</hi> but <hi>the Word of God</hi> that is a Competent Declaration of what will please our Creatour.

And I would fain know of the</hi> Jews, <hi>whether their own severe and strict prohibition of things, not at all forbidden in the Law of God, came not near the adding to Gods Law?</hi> Again, God having given no rule to direct us in excogitating and imposing new Worship, it's impossible but we should mistake; or if we should hit now and then upon some happy contrivance, we must thank his blind <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess fortune,</hi> rather then the fruitfulness of our own Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings:

               </p>
               <p>§ 3. Their Law-giver was <hi>Faithful,</hi> one to whom they might securely commit their Consciences, one with whom they might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But though we ought not to be Censorious, yet we may, and ought to exercise some prudence and caution to whom we resign our selves in matters of Religion, though <hi>the best of Men,</hi> not knowing how they may use us. but well knowing, that we may more easily Captivate ourselves to the Will of an Imposer, then being once enthralled, vindicate our selves into our Christian Liberty: Or if for no other Reason, yet for this, because they are <hi>but Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 4. The Jewish Yoke was a <hi>determinate Yoke:</hi> It was <hi>Onus,</hi> but <hi>Determinatum. A Burden,</hi> but <hi>a stinted Burden:</hi> It's no small alleviation to the <hi>Labourers toyl,</hi> when he <hi>knows</hi> his work; to <hi>the Traveller,</hi> that he knows his Journeys end: The <hi>fews</hi> had their work before them, but upon <hi>the Modern Principle:</hi> The burden of Christians is <hi>Indefinite,</hi> which is but <hi>a better word</hi> for <hi>Infinite:</hi> The Truth is, in these Humane Impositions we see <hi>the beginning,</hi> but no Man knows <hi>the end of them;</hi> it's a <hi>Nemo scit.</hi> Our load must be bounded with <hi>no other Limits</hi> then a Churches <hi>Will;</hi> and that Will perhaps bounded with no other then its <hi>Power,</hi> since it's Canoniz'd for good Divinity, That <hi>the Church may impose whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is Decent,</hi> and that <hi>the Church is Iudge of what is Decent;</hi> though who the Church is, is not so certain.</p>
               <p>§ 5. Their Law-giver was one of known and approved Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, who either apportioned his work to their strength, or their strength to his work; he fitted the Yoke to their Neck, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52034:62"/>
their Neck to the Yoke. The main thing that renders Christs own <hi>Yoke so easie,</hi> his <hi>Burden so light,</hi> is, that as his <hi>Authority im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,</hi> so his <hi>strength supporta.</hi> Men may lay heavy burdens on our Shoulders. but where there is most need, cannot <hi>touch them with one of their Fingers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 6. Their Law-giver was one, who in all his Impositions consulted <hi>their own good</hi> and benefit, as wel as exercised <hi>his own Authority:</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> wrought hard indeed, but their work had much of <hi>wages</hi> in't. The design of their Mystical Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies directed them to a <hi>Saviour. Legal Administrations</hi> well order'd, were <hi>Gospel Priviledges:</hi> Before Christ came Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were <hi>Illustrantia,</hi> such as discovered the Person, Nature, Office and Grace of the <hi>Messiah; a Candle is better then no Light;</hi> but to us they are all <hi>Obscurantia,</hi> such <hi>as darken the state of Christianity.</hi> As <hi>before the Sun-rising,</hi> the Prodromous Clouds, whose edges are fringed with Gold, comfort us with the hopes of an approaching greater Light, which when the Sun is up, do but darken the Horizon. Thus did Ceremonies illustrate Christ at <hi>the Annuntiation,</hi> but obscure him at his <hi>Advent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will be needless further to Vindicate the Dissenters: I shall leave them to the <hi>Enquirers</hi> Patronage; who by the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that he justifies the Church of <hi>England</hi> from Popery, will I hope clear the Non-conformists from Judaism, <hi>p. 12. All</hi> (says he) <hi>is not to be accounted Popery which is held or practised by the Church of</hi> Rome: Nor (say I) is all to be accounted Judaism which was either the principle or practise of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, <hi>p. 13. Nor is it reasonable to say such a thing is received from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>because it is there to be found, unless it be found no where else.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as little Reason to say the Dissenters <hi>have received this Principle from the</hi> Jews. <hi>[That no Worship is lawful</hi> (for that is their Principle) <hi>but what is prescribed by the Scripture] unless it were found no where else.</hi> But this was a Principle so clear in the Light of Nature, that <hi>Numa</hi> the great Ritualist of Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> durst not hope that ever his Ceremonies would ever ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, <hi>fallen from</hi> Jupiter; and whilst the World was filly enough to be imposed upon by those little Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, we had scarce a New Shrine, Altar, place of Pilgrimage erected, but upon pretence of some rising from the Dead, or an Angel from Heaven, or a Letter from the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or some such Pious Frauds and Religious Cheats, which the Priests had at their Fingers ends.</p>
               <p>Let us now consider the <hi>Enquirers</hi> Discourse upon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. <hi>That all absolutely necessaries are so determined, we readily grant,</hi> (says he) <hi>and that all those Rites prescribed by our Saviour are
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52034:63"/>
necessary to be obserued, we will yield them; but that nothing is lawful but what is to be found so prescribed, we utterly deny.</hi> And so do we! Let that end the Controversie: When Rethoricians have flanted it out in fine Language, and Ruffled a little in Phrase, apposite words and expressions they have satisfied their Office, and are not obliged by the Rules of their Art, either to state the Question, or speak to it: <hi>Something may be practised which is not prescribed</hi> that we grant; but from <hi>something</hi> to <hi>every thing</hi> is too great a Leap for <hi>Bucephalus:</hi> From <hi>practising</hi> to <hi>prescribing</hi> is another large stride; from <hi>Circumstances</hi> to <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> is a third; from <hi>Civil</hi> things to <hi>Sacred</hi> is one more; from <hi>Indifferent</hi> to <hi>Necessary Conditions of Church Communion</hi> may go for another; and from the common Accidents that attend <hi>the Worshippers as Men,</hi> to <hi>Parts of worship,</hi> are Inferences which we can neither make to lead or drive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We come now to a second Judaical Principle: <hi>That all Princes and Law-givers are bound to conform the Municipal Laws of their several Dominions to the Institutions of</hi> Moses. This indeed has a strong taint of Jewish Leaven in't; which they who plead so Zealously for the <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> of <hi>Tythes, and Holiness of Places,</hi> because <hi>Moses</hi> once <hi>put off his Shooes</hi> may do well to advise upon; the Non-conformists for ought I know are little concern'd in't. We grant that there is no necessity that the Temporal Sanction even of <hi>the Moral Law it self,</hi> should be the same under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, that it was under the <hi>Administration of</hi> Moses: That the Violaters of the <hi>Lords days</hi> Holy Rest should be stoned, as the infringer of the <hi>Sabhath</hi> was of old; the Adulterers should be punish'd with Death, or a Blasphemer endure the same now which then was exacted. Law-givers do consider the tempers and dispositions of their Subjects in these matters; we are no further concerned herein then to pray, that they who moderate the Affairs of the Empires of this World, may be directed with Wisdom from above, may order all things in a subserviency to his Glory by whom they Reign, and the publick peace, welfare and prosperity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Third Instance is in Excommunication. <hi>Which</hi> (says he) <hi>they hold must be by a Synod or Presbytery, and the Prince as well as the People must be subject to the Sentence.</hi> Here are several Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions that invite our serious debate; as 1. What is <hi>the proper Seat</hi> of the power of Excommunication? 2. Who are the <hi>proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of this Power? 3. Whether to fix the power of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be a Judaical Principle? And 4. Whether a Prince may come under the Edge of that Sword? Any one of which would require more room then I have allotted my self to turn in: What I shall say is this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>the Synod or Presbytery</hi> are the Seat of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, carries as fair proof at least, as the <hi>Chancellor</hi> who is a <hi>Lay-man,</hi> or at best a <hi>Deacon</hi> of no Scripture Institution, can show for himself by Divine Right.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all scandalous persons are lyable to that Censure, is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52034:63"/>
true in the general, but that it may not be executed upon a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magistrate, arises from peculiar Maximes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon which the safety of a Kingdom depends: I know not that this is a Principle of the N. C. for my part I disown it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this was a Jewish Principle to excommunicate their Kings, I do not certainly know, nor date positively determine: That they received any such standing Law from God I do not find: That <hi>a High-Priest</hi> did once actually separate a King upon the score of his Leprosie, we read, and that others perhaps would not do as much if a Prince pleased not their Humours we have no security: I should shrowdly suspect their Inclinations this way, whoever they were, that inse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But how came <hi>this precise qualm</hi> over <hi>our Enquirers</hi> heart, that he is so skittish at the word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> because forsooth it's not given <hi>the Day</hi> in the New Testament? They have some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular priviledge, and prerogative surely, that may <hi>institute</hi> what <hi>Officers,</hi> what <hi>Offices</hi> they please, though neither <hi>Name nor Thing</hi> be found there, nor print nor mark of the least Foot-step, when the poor Non-conformists may not use indifferently an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent word, which signifies no more in it self, then he will acknowledge to be found there.</p>
               <p>But how is this a point of Judaism; or how one of <hi>the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer causes</hi> of separation? If it be, we may confidently say we have imbibed both from the Liturgy of the Church, which teaches the Minister to rehearse the Fourth Commandment. <hi>Remember the</hi> Sabbath-day <hi>to keep it Holy;</hi> and then enjoins us all to pray, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this Law;</hi> but if <hi>this Word, this Dactrine,</hi> be of such pernicious a contagion, as to insect us with Judaism, and Non-conformity; we have need of another, <hi>miserere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the temper of the times, under the Reign of <hi>Charles the Great:</hi>

                  <hi>We ordain, as also the Lord hath commanded in the Law, that no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile works be done on the Lords-day. As also our Father of happy memory, in his Synodal Edicts hath commanded, that is to say, That Men neither exercise the labours of their Farms, neither in dressing Vineyards, nor in Plowing, nor in Mowing Grass, or in laying a Hedge, or to grub up, or cut down Trees, or to labour in Quarries, or to build a House, or to order a Garden, or to hold pleas, or to practice Hunting.</hi>

                  <hi>Let not Women practice Weaving; let them not take pains about their Hair, nor mend their Cloaths, nor work Needle-work or Point; nor Card Wool, nor Heckle Flax, nor wash Cloaths openly, nor Shear Sheep, That the Honour and Rest of the Lords-day may by all means be secured.</hi> Const. Carol. M. fol. 32 It will be time now to draw to a conclusion, when I have noted:</p>
               <p>§ 1. It looks like a piece of great disingenuity to Bait Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters like Jews, for the indifferent use of the word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not found in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and at the same time to worry them with Barking words, and Biting penalties, for not practising upon that <hi>very day. Humane Ceremonies,</hi> which (name and thing) are perfectly strangers to <hi>the New Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. It seems so far from a <hi>next cause</hi> of <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously to observe <hi>The Lords-day,</hi> that it were rather an Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Conformity, when we observe the Church so strictly commands her Children in the Rubrick, <hi>After every Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Kneeling to ask God mercy for their transgression of the same.</hi> And if the Dissenters were of this <hi>Enquirers</hi> principles, they must be obliged to be Non-conformists, till the Liturgy in that particular should be Reformed.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Its highly disingenuous to upbraid them with the less strictness of some of the Reformed Churches abroad in this one point, when they are not allow'd to vouch their principles and practices in <hi>twenty others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 4. It deserves a <hi>most serious Enquiry,</hi> whether any Church did long maintain any splendour of <hi>Practical Religion,</hi> that grew remiss and loose in the Consciencious Observation of the <hi>Lords-day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 5. Whether the strict and Religious attendance to the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52034:66"/>
Worship of God on that Day, be a cause of Non-conformity or no, is uncertain; but this is certain, that <hi>the loose and formal</hi> observation of it, has been a direct and immediate cause of that <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Prophaneness,</hi> and perhaps of <hi>those Iudgements</hi> which have broken in upon us.</p>
               <p>§ 6. It ought to be matter of serious Humiliation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, both to the Conformists and Non-conformists, that between them both, they have suffered Piety to decline in their hands, by a visible degeneracy from the strictness of former time, <hi>in Sanctifying Gods name on his Holy-day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 7. It ought to be considered, That they who of late times have written against <hi>the Divine Right</hi> of that day, have yet spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken so honourably of, and pleaded for, the <hi>Holy use of the day,</hi> as will justifie greater Reverence to the day, then I fear the Non-conformists are guilty of. The Learned <hi>Brerewood,</hi> Tract. 1. p. 47. <hi>I confess, It is meet that Christians should on the Lords-day abandon all wordly affairs, and dedicate it wholly to the Hunour of God.</hi> The B. of <hi>Ely,</hi> p. 255. <hi>Devout Christians, who are so piously affected, as that on the Lords-days, and other Holy-days, they do resolve to retire, and sequester themselves from secular business, and ordinary pleasures and delights, to the end they may more freely attend the Service of Christ, and Apply their Minds to Spiritual and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Meditations, are to be commended and encouraged; for the doing thereof is a work of Grace and Godliness, and acceptable to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 8. It would be enquired, whether it have not a greater Tincture of Judaism, to enjoin <hi>other days for Holy-days,</hi> which have <hi>no f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>

               <p>It were more for this Gentlemans comfort and credit, to write <hi>a serious and Compassionate Enquiry into the</hi> Pretended <hi>and</hi> Real, <hi>the</hi> Remote <hi>and</hi> near Causes <hi>of his own conformity to that Doctrine which he so pleasantly derides.</hi> And with what Engines, Machines, Screws and Pulleys he could hale his Conscience to a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription: The old Device was good. <hi>Lingud juratus sum, mente juravi nihil:</hi> It's a happy freedom of Spirit, a blessed enlargement of mind to <hi>subscribe any thing, and believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things there are which ought to have been cleared; first, that the Doctrine of predestination is a <hi>Iewish Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> secondly, that it's a Cause, or <hi>a piece of a Cause of Non-conformity.</hi>

No wonder then if the Non-consormists suffer under Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice amongst those that have not only seen their Doctrine stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized with the odious Marks of Judaism, their Churches with the Brand of Schism, their Persons with Treason and Rebellion, but also had been formed into a Combination against them; and so had both their Consciences and worldly Interest engaged against them and it.</p>

                  <hi>There, can be</hi> (saith he) <hi>no General Reformation without the Abolitions of sundry Canons and Statutes, which neither are, nor reasonably can be observed in these times, which do nothing but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare the Consciences of men to their endless Perdition, no tongue is able to express what evil, what danger and confusion, the neglect and contempt of the Holy Scripture, (which doubtless is sufficient for the Government of the Church, else Christ had been an imperfect Law-giver) and the following of Humane Inventions, hath brought into the Church.</hi> Serm. in die circ. part. 1. 'Tis that which has ever been lamented, and by all moderate persons complained of: That unnecessary Impositions, have been made the indispensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52034:69"/>
conditions of Church-Communion, without precept or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent from the Word of God.</p>
               <p>To this cause had he reduced all our Divisions, he said more in those <hi>few plain words,</hi> then in all those well coucht periods wherewith he has adorned his Discourse, and darkened Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel. As <hi>the matter of Law</hi> arises out of <hi>the matter of Fact,</hi> so the Justice of the Non-conformists Cause, appears from the terms that are put upon them in order to Communion; If the Terms be unjust, it will justifie their Cause; If they have sinfully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged their Cause, its goodness will not justifie their Persons; what Dissenters usually insist upon for their Justification, I shall reduce to these Heads.</p>
               <p>§ 1. They plead, that some things are imposed upon their Faith, tendered to Subscription, as Articles of Faith, which are either false, or at best, they have not yet been soo happy as to discover the truth of them: In <hi>Art.</hi> 20. They are required to subscribe this Doctrine, <hi>The Church hath power to Decree Rites and Ceremonies;</hi> which Clause of the Article, as we fear, it has been by some indirect means shuffled into the Article, it not being found in the Authentick Articles of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. so it proves also, that the Terms of Communion have been enlarged since the first times of the Reformation.</p>
               <p>They object also against that Doctrine in the Rubrick; That <hi>it is certain from the Word of God. That Children Baptized, and dying before the Commission of actual sins, are undoubtedly saved.</hi> The Scripture, the Protestant Churches, nor any sound Reason, have yet given them any tolerable satisfaction of the Truth of the Doctrine about the <hi>Opus operatum,</hi> of Sacraments: That Doctrine laid down in the Catechism; That Children do <hi>perform Faith and Repentance by their sureties,</hi> is also as great a stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to our Faith, and we cannot get over it: How the Adult should believe and repent for Minors, or Infants Believe and Repent by Proxie. I omit many others.</p>
               <p>§ 2. They plead, that they are not satisfied in the use of any Mystical Ceremonies in Gods Worship, and particularly they judge the use of <hi>the Cross in Baptism</hi> to be sinful: A Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Divine Institution according to the definition of the Church in her Catechism, <hi>is an outward and visible sign, of an inward and invisible Grace given unto us, ordained by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to assure us thereof:</hi> where we have 1. <hi>The matter</hi> of a Sacrament, <hi>An outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual Grace;</hi> 2. The <hi>Author</hi> of a Divine Sacrament, <hi>Christ himself 3. The End</hi> of it: to be <hi>a means</hi> to convey the thing signified, and <hi>a pledge</hi> to assure us of it. Hence it's evident. that it's simply impossible that any Church should institute a Divine Sacrament, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give it a Causality to those Graces it is instituted to signifie: Nevertheless it's possible for Men to institute Humane Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which shall have the <hi>Matter</hi> of a Sacrament, <hi>That is an outward Visible Sign of an inward Spiritual Grace;</hi> and they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52034:70"/>
may pretend to ascribe an effect to it also <hi>to stir up, to excite, or encrease Grace and Devotion:</hi> And yet because it wants the right efficient Cause, it's no <hi>lawful Sacrament,</hi> though it be an <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Sacrament;</hi> Such an institution (say they) is the <hi>Sign of the Cross. An outward Visible Sign of an inward Spiritual Grace, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Men as a means to effect whatever Man can work by his Ordinance.</hi> Here is the matter without Divine Signature, which is the thing they condemn it for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They plead, that since Communion with the Church is sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and denyed but upon such Terms as take away Christian Liberty in part, and by consequence leave all the rest at Mercy; they dare not accept of Communion upon those Terms: There are some things which God has in the general left free and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, to do or not do; yet at some times, and in some Cases it may be my great sin if I should do some of them, as when it would wound the Conscience, and destroy the Soul of a weak Christian: If now I shall engage my self to the Church, that I will never omit such <hi>an indifferent thing;</hi> and the Soul of that weak Christian should call to me to omit it, I have tyed my Hands by engagement, I cannot help him, though it would save his or a thousand Souls out of Hell, because I have given away my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They plead, that they ought not to hazard their Souls in one Congregation, if they may more hopefully secure them in another; for that their Souls are their greatest concernment in this World and the next: Now say they, there's no Question but Men Preach such as they Print with pubiick allowance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to provide better for their Souls elsewhere: Especially they say, That the Doctrine of Justification is <hi>Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus stantis vel cadentis Ecclesiae,</hi> an Article with which the Church falls or stands: This Article, say they, in the Parish where we live is quite demolish'd by the Doctrine of <hi>Iustification by Works;</hi> we are bound therefore to provide for our safety and depart; and when we are once out, we will advise upon another Church, not which is tolerable, but which is most eligible, and in all things nearest the <hi>Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. They plead, that there's no obligation upon them to own the Churches Power to impose new Terms of Communion; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Church can prove her Power from Christ: it's not for them to disprove it; it lies upon her to prove it, and to prove it substantially too, or else it will be hard to prove it their duty to own it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They say, the World is pestered with Disputes about Worship, about Religion; and therefore since all cannot be in the right, they are willing to go the safest way, and Worship God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Word: If the things disputed be lawful to be done, let 'em be so; they are sure its lawful to let 'em alone; and they think there's no great hazard in keeping to Scripture Rule, nor can believe that Christ will send any to Hell, because they did not Worship God in an External Mode, more neat and spruce then God commanded.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:52034:70"/>
7. They pretend, that the things imposed are <hi>parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> which none can Create but God, nor will God accept of any but such as are of his own Creating; and whether they be <hi>Integral or Essential Parts</hi> they do not know, but in the Worship of God they find them standing upon even ground, with those that are <hi>certainly Divine:</hi> or at least as high as Man can list them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They do not find that God ever commanded the things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, either in general, in special, or their singulars; If God has commanded a Duty to be done, the Church must find a place to do it in; but though the Church must find a place for the Duty, a time for the Duty, she may not find <hi>new Duty</hi> for the time and place.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They are the more cautious of all Ceremonies, because the old Church of <hi>England,</hi> in her <hi>Homilies</hi> Serm. 3. <hi>Of Good Works</hi> tell us: <hi>That such hath been the corrupt inclination of Man, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiously given to make New Honcuring of God of his own Head and then to have more Affection and Devotion to keep that, then to search out Gods Holy Commandments, and do them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. They say, they have read over all the Books that have been written in justification of those things, and they find their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments so weak, their Reasons so futilous, that setting aside Rhetotick and Railing there's nothing in them, but what had been either answered by others, or is contradicted by themselves, which hardnes them in their Errour, who are gone astray into the right way.</p>
               <p n="11">11. They say, it's their duty to endeavour a Reformation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word, which if others will not, they cannot help it, and hope they will not be angry with the willing.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Had the Apostles understood those frightful consequences which we have learnt to impute to diversities of judgement in lesser matters, with suitable variety in practise attending it, they might easily have silenced those disputes by the interposition of their Authority; and the Churches no doubt would as easily have acquiesced in the judgement of the Apostles, who could give irrefragable proof that they were sent of Christ.</p>
               <p>Nor have these rigorous Decisions ever reacht their pretended ends, in healing differences, but only consopited them under the Ashes for a while, or taught men a little more craft to draw over the Articles to their <hi>private Opinions,</hi> rather then conform <hi>these to the publick belief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Papal Remedy, is <hi>the Accommodation of Religion to the Lusts and Interests of Men,</hi> allowing them to think, believe, do any thing in the world, provided they be subject to the <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Pastor:</hi> for the Pope seeing that the World will not be brought over to him <hi>upon the Terms of Christ,</hi> is content to come over to the world <hi>in Morals,</hi> if they will but come over to him in <hi>his Ceremonials.</hi> Much what of the same good nature with that other grand Impostor <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who when that <hi>sullen Mountain</hi> would not stir a foot to come to him, very courteously answer'd, <hi>Then let us go to the Mountain.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>We want not some who can reconcile the levity of the Stage and Theatre, to the gravity and severity of the Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; that can teach men by their writings or practice, how they may retain these vanities, and never throw off their <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal Livery;</hi> and it is upon good Advice: for should they lose such numbers from the party, it would make a filthy Hole in it; and the weeding out such Tares would make a thin Field of Corn; and therefore some plead that they ought to <hi>grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether till the Harvest.</hi>

We are now come to <hi>the great and infallible Remedy,</hi> which the Pope trusts more to, then his <hi>great Infallibility;</hi> But there are considerable diversities about the form of this Medicine in the Dispensatories: some (as Mr. <hi>Necessity Bays)</hi> express it by a tedious Periphrasis, <hi>Axes, Halters, Racks, Fire, Faggot,</hi> with an <hi>Et catera,</hi> which has more in't then all the rest; but the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> who are <hi>concise men,</hi> and love short work, and to express <hi>multum in parvo,</hi> have Epitomiz'd all in that <hi>one word, the Holy Inquisition,</hi> so called by the same <hi>Catachresis,</hi> by which we call our former Antagonist, <hi>the Compassionate Enquirer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you enquire a Reason of this <hi>various reading;</hi> know that it arises from <hi>the different Copies</hi> of the <hi>Dispensatories:</hi> The <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocopaeia</hi> of <hi>London</hi> calls it one thing, that of <hi>Rome</hi> Another; the Titles differ, but the Medicine is the same, only <hi>Rome,</hi> according to her old overdoing and undoing Humour, has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a few drops of the Spirits of Vitriol; And yet the last Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ours at <hi>the Old Bayly,</hi> re-assumes its former Title, and calls it downright, <hi>The Inquisition of</hi> Spain.</p>
               <p>This Medicine is truly <hi>Soveraign;</hi> it has the <hi>Probatum</hi> of thousands who <hi>being dead yet speak,</hi> its answerableness to its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive design, to silence all disputes, and stop the mouth of all gain-sayers; when all is done, there's no Argument convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces so effectually as <hi>Stone-dead;</hi> The wild-Irish themselves will

believe their Enemy to be dead, when his Head lies sever'd a Yard from his body; But the Question will be still, <hi>whether it will down with English-men?</hi> for though they have good <hi>Beef Stomacks,</hi> they want that of the Ostrich to digest Axes and Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: There's no Question but it will <hi>go down</hi> well enough with them that <hi>give it,</hi> but it needs the assistance of much Rhetorick to perswade them into a willingness of mind, who are to take this wallowish potion: If we could agree who should be perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, there are enow could be content to be the persecutors, and this is one of the greatest Quarrels.</p>
               <p>That the Genius of this Nation (as our <hi>Enquirer</hi> informs us) is so <hi>couragious,</hi> and withal so <hi>compassionate.</hi> I am very glad to hear; the one part so <hi>tender hearted</hi> that they will <hi>not inflict,</hi> the other so <hi>tender Conscienced</hi> that they will endure what shall be so in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

How great soever it be, they have all <hi>for Edification, none for Destruction.</hi> They ought not to reject those whom Christ will receive; And a little plain English would here have done no hurt, but have been Acceptable to the best of Church-men, whose misery it is, to have <hi>many flatterers</hi> about them which let them know <hi>their virtues,</hi> but few faithful <hi>Monitors,</hi> who will acquaint them with <hi>their Duty.</hi>

Its material too, <hi>who are to be instructed?</hi> It's presumed by our <hi>Enquirer,</hi> that the Dissenters alone want a word of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, they only are Crooked; but whatever they want, as they will submit to, and be thankful for wholesome Counsel, so they conceive a word of Instruction will be necessary <hi>another way.</hi> When the Non-conformists are come to <hi>the End of their Tedder,</hi> when Conscience will suffer them to Advance not one step fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

You have been reputed a discreet person, I wonder at you, and so do all that know you, that you will be so little a Friend to your case, so obstinate against liberty, as to lye reezing your self in a smoakie hole, you ought to submit your private judgement to that of the generality of mankind. who with one voice agree, that the fresh Air is much sweeter then this nasty Lodging!</hi> How much more proper had it been to have expostulated with this <hi>Cruel Creditor,</hi> Sir! The poor man has paid you all he has, he is not worth a groat more in all the world, you may have his skin, but flesh he has none, shew now your Charity, and since he cannot release himself, but you may, shew your Charity. The Dissenters say this is their Case: they cannot come up to the propounded condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without sin, the Imposers may abate of the Conditions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52034:76"/>
sin, and therefore they are the proper Subjects of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Indeed I find the Non-conformists very shy in charging the Terms to be sinful; they are loath to speak a word that may be interpreted any reflection upon the Church, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly insist upon other pleas: but when Importunity shall extort it from them, they must deal liquidly, and assert, that they <hi>cannot do these things, and sin against God thereby.</hi>

               <p>§ 3. From what grounds will this Instructer draw his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?

Otherwise the Advice is no more but this: Come over to our party, and there will be Peace! why, so there will (reply the Dissenters) if you come all over to ours, or to any third party, There would be a Peace, an ill Cemented, ill grounded one; and such, as upon every occasion would bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Let nothing be declared <hi>Schism,</hi> but what the Scriptures ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> made so, and we shall be content it be made <hi>as great a sin</hi> as he can reasonably desire.</p>
               <p>Had not our <hi>Enquirer</hi> been carried down in the torrent of his own overflowing Eloquence, till he had quite lost himself, he might have answered himself from his own words, p 109. <hi>For this cause</hi> (says he) <hi>it pleased God that his Church, in those early days, should rather be harassed with persecutions, which made it unite it self the closer, and paring off all superfluities, keep to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and essential Doctrines delivered to it, then to be softned, and made wanton by ease, and so to corrupt the simplicity of the Gospel:</hi> Let a Church then return to <hi>the simplicity of the Gospel:</hi> Let her repent of that <hi>softness and wantonness of Spirit,</hi> which <hi>by Ease</hi> she has contracted. Let her <hi>pare off all superfluities,</hi> and keep close to <hi>the necessary and essential Doctrines delivered to it,</hi> and she shall find us as ready to write <hi>Philippics</hi> against <hi>Schism</hi> as him self, though we want his <hi>Ciceronian</hi> quill, and wordie excellencies.</p>
               <p>Now though we are all convinced that Schism <hi>(veri nominis)</hi> is a most detestable Impiety; yet to beget in us a greater aversation from it, it may be profitable to listen to his reasonings, which are so potent, as will doubtless drain both the Conventicles and the Theatres.</p>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>None</hi> (says he) <hi>can doubt of this, who considers what care our Saviour took to prevent it, what pains he took with his Apostles that they might be throughly instructed, and not differ in the delivery of his mind to the World.</hi> We do with all humble thankfulness own the faithfulness of our Saviour in <hi>instructing,</hi> and the Careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Apostles in <hi>following their instructions.</hi> They delivered to the Churches, as <hi>the whole Counsel of God,</hi> Acts 20. 27. so, <hi>only the Counsel of God; 1 Cor. 11. 23.

§ 2. To prove the greatness of this sin, he <hi>observes</hi> (and we thank him for the observation) <hi>that the Apostles were industrious to resist all beginnings of Schism in every Church, to heal all breaches, to take away all occasions of Division, to unite all hearts, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile all minds:</hi> and to requite his kindness, I will repay his obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with this other; that they either are not the <hi>Apostles Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors</hi> in their healing Spirit, or else have seen some weighty reason to depart from their judgement about <hi>the hainousness of that sin,</hi> who instead of taking away <hi>the occasions of Divisions,</hi> which they have given: or removing <hi>the stumbling Blocks</hi> out of the way of Union, which they have laid, do give greater to, and lay more obstacles before the Christian world.</p>
               <p>§ 3. His third proof is taken from <hi>the loveliness of Unity. It's not</hi> (says he) <hi>the sublimity of Christian Doctrine, nor the gloriousness of the Hopes it propounds, that will so recommend it to the opinion and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> though under different perswasions, as to Modes of Divine Worship and Discipline; That their hearts are larger to receive one anothers persons, then their heads are to conceive one anothers notions. But yet, as he is a fond Lover that chuses his Wife <hi>by the Eye,</hi> for the symmetry of her external frame, or <hi>cloathing of wrought Gold,</hi> rather then those virtues which adorn the Soul; so he that chuses his Religion <hi>by Sense, and not by Faith,</hi> will make a most lamentable bargain; He that falls in love with Christs Church upon External Allurements and Extrinsick Motives, will either repent, or quit his choice when she is persecuted, her outward frame discomposed, her order violated, <hi>the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd smitten, and the Sheep scatter'd;</hi> whereas, he that espouses Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for those invisible glories which she propounds, and keeps in his steady eye <hi>the recompence of reward,</hi> will adhere to his choice when she is <hi>most black,</hi> and <hi>the Sun of Persecution</hi> has too familiarly <hi>looked upon her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I shall not need to trouble my self, or the Reader, with any more of these fine Arguments; <hi>Schism is an evil,</hi> whether he be angry at it or no. And separation <hi>may be good,</hi> whether he be pleased or no: All the Question will be, that seeing there is an apparent separation found amongst us from the Political Church of <hi>England,</hi> and supposing that there is sin one where or other, where the guilt of it ought to lye! The <hi>Enquirer</hi> has spoken a great deal of Truth in in a few words, <hi>That some have found plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to get that Child, which they would by no means have laid at their own doors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A successful piece of Villany</hi> it is, which sometimes passes
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52034:78"/>
for <hi>a virtue,</hi> for the Fathers who have begot these Brats, to expose them to be kept and maintained at the cost of the poor innocent Parish. And if we might guess at the true Father by the Childs Physiognomy: All the divisions which have so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily charged the Churches, having sprung from Ceremonies, from needless Impositions, from unnecessary Terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; They who take such pleasure to <hi>beget th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>If yet there be any controversie depending whose the Child is: The <hi>Enquirer</hi> recommends to us the Wisdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> for discovering <hi>the True Mother,</hi> and because we know, <hi>Partus sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ventum,</hi> if we can once find out the Damm, we shall make her confess the Sire: <hi>It was the early proof</hi> (says he) Solomon <hi>gave of his Wisdom in discovering the true Mother of the living Child, to which both the Litigants laid equal claim—</hi>I confess his illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeds hitherto but very oddly, for <hi>there,</hi> the quarrel was, who should have the Child, and be reputed the true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but <hi>with us,</hi> all the controversie is who shall be discharg'd of it: but all similitudes do not run of four Leggs, and it's very well if this will hop on one: observe how he lays both ends of his discourse together: <hi>As that wise Prince discovered the true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the tenderness of her Bowels towards the Infant, so we may perhaps discover the true Children of the Church by their respect and tenderness to her.</hi> Ay; just so no doubt!

                  </gap> for Fishers folly; The comparison would run a little more naturally and regularly thus. As the true Mother was discerned by the tenderness of her Bowels towards the Infant, who would rather part with her right, then that her bleeding Eye should ever see her Child divided, so we may perhaps discover the true Mother of the Church, by her condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending and relenting pity, who would rather wave her claims, and resign her right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in some lesser instances, then ever endure to see the body of Christ divided by a Schismatical Dichotomy. And as the Harlot, notwithstanding all her pretences, bewrayed her self to the discerning eye of that Judicious Prince, who could be content the Child should rather dye, then she lose her moye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, so will she evidence her self to be a Stepmother Church, which peremptorily insists upon a pretended right to Imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>We are come at length to the Question, what is <hi>the true notion of Schism?</hi> A point that deserves to be handled with the greatest exactness; for upon the True stating hereof, the issue of the whole controversie depends. His notion, or definition of Schism, is this. <hi>Schism is a voluntary departure or separation of ones self, without
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52034:79"/>
just cause given, from that Christian Church, whereof he was once a Member:</hi> Or, <hi>Schism is a breach of that Communion wherein a man might have continued without sin.</hi> I shall not need to find faults, or pick holes in this definition, they will offer themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves as he opens the Terms, only I observe, (1) That it offends against one of the sacred Laws of Definition, which ought to be most religiously and inviolably preserved. <hi>Definitiones debent cum Definito reciprocari;</hi> The <hi>Definition ought to be convertible with the thing defined:</hi> And that <hi>this is not so,</hi> is evident, because there may be <hi>a Schism where there is no separation from External Communion:</hi> There is a Schism <hi>in a Church,</hi> as wel as <hi>from a Church.</hi> The Churches Garment may be <hi>rent,</hi> and yet not rent <hi>in two:</hi> Thus the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 18. When ye come together in the Church, I hear there are Divisions amongst you:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That Definition which is as narrow as <hi>his Charity,</hi> and leaves out those who ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o be taken in, must necessarily be stark naught. (2) This defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very short, in expressing that which is indeed <hi>the Poison and Venom, the formal Reason of all Schismatical departure,</hi> viz. the want of <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>true Evangelical Love;</hi> for he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from a Society, yet loves the real Christians therein, and the Society it self, so far as it is a Church of Christs institution, only he loves his own Soul with a more intense love, and accordingly makes the best provision for it he can, and would rejoyce that others would accept of the same advantages, ought not to be called a Schismatick; but if they who pretend to a power to stamp what significations they please upon words, will call him so, the best is, no Nick-names will prejudice him in the sight of that God, who searcheth the heart, and tryeth the reins. As Heresie is opposed to <hi>the Faith,</hi> so Schism is opposed to <hi>Love;</hi> and Heresie and Schism are distinguisht by those things to which each of them is opposed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It's faulty for its ambiguity: because he tells us not what the <hi>Christian Church</hi> is, from whence the departure must be made to denominate it Schism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ical: If he means <hi>a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> united under its proper Pastor according to the Laws of Christ, it will prove it Schismatical to depart from a Church of Non-conformists. If he understands a National Church, he should do well to prove, that such a Church is of <hi>Christs institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> but I shall wave these and many more, till he has discan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the particulars of his own Definition.</p>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>I call it</hi> (says he) <hi>a departure or separation from the Society of the Church, to distinguish it from other sins, which though they are breaches of the Laws of our Religion, and consequently of the Church, yet are not a renunciation of the Society.

               <p>§ 3. <hi>I call it</hi> (says he) <hi>a departure from a particular Church, or from a part of the visible Church, to distinguish it from Apostacy, which is a casting of the whole Religion, the name and profession of Christianity:</hi> But here his definition is very Crazie, and ill joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for it ought to be defined <hi>a departure from a particular Church of Christ;</hi> to distinguish it from <hi>such a Constitution,</hi> as is either

no particular Church of Christs institution, or none, <hi>so far as the separation is made from it:</hi> such a one as is not united under <hi>Christs Officers,</hi> nor conjoyned by <hi>Christs Ligaments:</hi> Christ has taken special care that there may be <hi>no Schism in the Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12-25. And for this end he has commanded <hi>a spirit of mutual forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and condescension;</hi> he has mingled and temper'd the body together with such exact geometrical proportion, that each of the parts may care for the other; for this end also he has insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted some <hi>extraordinary Officers,</hi> whose work and Office, was to cease with the present exigency and occasion, and the ordinary, whose Office and Employment (as the Reasons of them) were to be perpetuaI. Now if any Society of Men, calling themselves a Church (and in the main respects being really so) retaining the great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Christianity, and such Ordinances whereby Salvation is attainable, shall yet put it self under other Officers then Christ has appointed, and practise other Ordinances then he has insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, and make Communion with her impracticable, without submitting to such Officers, such Ordinances; <hi>separation from that Society,</hi> can be <hi>no separation from a particular Church of Christ:</hi> Because<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though they may be such a Church in the main, yet <hi>so far</hi> as the separation is made, they are <hi>not so:</hi> And <hi>they deny</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them, <hi>so far</hi> as they <hi>are a Church of Christ;</hi> because of non-submission to them, so far as they are <hi>no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§ 4. <hi>I add</hi> (says he) <hi>those words—</hi>whereof he was once a Member, <hi>because Schism imports division, and making two of that which was but one before.</hi> So that if an Act was made to divide some of our greater Parishes (which are much larger then some of the Primitive Diocesses) into Two, under their distinct Pastors, this must be a Schism, according to this famous definition; for here is, 1. A voluntary departure, 2. From a particular Church, 3. whereof once they were all Members; and wherein 4. they might all have continued without sin.</p>
               <p>But the most considerable thing here will be, how I became a Member of that Church, from which the departure is supposed to be made; for 1. To be <hi>forced into a Church,</hi> will never make me such a Member, but that I may re-assume my liberty and right when <hi>the force is removed;</hi> Violence and Constraint unite me no otherwise to a Church, then <hi>a great Beetle unites a Wedge to a Tree;</hi> which though it may by main strength be driven into the Tree, yet not being engras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ed into it, no Union is created with it, nor does it derive any nourishing juices from it. 2. <hi>Baptism alone</hi> will not do it: because as I conceive, that Ordinance so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly unites me only to <hi>the Catholick visible Church,</hi> and not to a particular Congregation; otherwise, whenever the providence of God shall transplant me into <hi>another particular Church,</hi> I must be <hi>re-baptized,</hi> and so as often as I remove, because <hi>as to that Church</hi> I am <hi>unbaptized.</hi> 3. Nor will my being born and bred within national limits and precincts, denominate me a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of such National Church or Constitution, because it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for a Current Maxime.

                  </hi> they take away with <hi>the left:</hi> And herein our <hi>Enquirer</hi> is as strait laced as they; for though in the general he will prodigally allow us, <hi>that sinful Impositions</hi> are a just plea for separation, yet he has forestalled that concession all along with a fine contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; That <hi>our private Wisdom</hi> must lower the Top-sale to <hi>the publick.</hi> Thus p. 64. <hi>Since the peace of the Church often depends upon such points as Salvation does not, and since in many of those, every man is not a Competent judge, but must either be in danger of being deceived himself, and of troubling others, one of necessity must trust some body else wiser then himself;</hi> so that the matter accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Gentlemans <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> is just as long as 'tis broad; but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> speaks that with open Mouth, which he delivers between the Teeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other supposed extream is, that of some Protestants, <hi>who make the Causes of separation as many, and as light as the Iews did of Divorce, almost for any matter whatsoever: But as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, when the case was put, found out a middle way betwixt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce for no cause at all, and for every cause, so ought it to be done in this business of Schism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader! we are now in a hopeful way for the compromising all the Controversies that have vext our Northern Climate, and to seal general Releases of all Actions, and causes of Actions against each other, from the beginning of the Reformation, to the day of the Date of these presents: for as we may charitably presume of all our <hi>Episcopal Brethren,</hi> that they will stand to the final award of so great an undertaker as our <hi>Enquirer,</hi> so I am confident I may engage for all the <hi>dissenting Brethren,</hi>

that they will abide by the Umpirage of <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> and that whatever expedient he used in deriding the grand Question <hi>about Divorce,</hi> shall conclude them in all their Debates <hi>about Schism:</hi> Now the final Decision of that affair we find, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 8. where our Saviour considers not what could plead <hi>inveterate Custom,</hi> or <hi>a gray headed practise</hi> to abet its pretensions, he slights all the Arguments from <hi>laudable Examples,</hi> and the <hi>Traditions of their Forefathers,</hi> and runs up the practise <hi>to its Primitive Institution;</hi> and tells them, <hi>From the Beginning it was not so.</hi> And indeed if a Transcript be blotted or blurr'd. we presently have recourse to the Original, and from thence redintegrate whatever the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry worm, or greedy Moth has de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And if I should tell the Reader, I say the contrary, we should make a squabble on't, to render our selves ridiculous; let it therefore neither be what I say, nor what he says, but what wiser men then us both say, who may be presumed more impartial in their Judgements, wherein they vindicate the Dissenters, because they were, or are eminent Members of this Church. And first I will present him with the judgement of Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> a Person of whom the Church of <hi>England</hi> has great cause to boast. Now amongst many other things to our purpose, in his <hi>Treatise of Schism,</hi> he acquaints us; 1. That <hi>when either false or uncertain conclusions are obtruded for Truth, or Acts either unlawful or ministring just scruple, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us to be performed; in these cases, consent were Conspiracy, and open Contestation, is not Faction or Schism, but due Christian Animosity.</hi> 2. That <hi>nothing absolves men from the guilt of Schism, but true and unpretended Conscience.</hi> Therefore such a Conscience will absolve from the guilt of it. 3. That <hi>where the Cause of Schism is necessary, there not he that separates, but he that is the Cause of the separation is the Schismatick.</hi> 4. That <hi>to require the execution of some unlawful or suspected act, is a just cause of refusing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; for not only in Reason, but in Religion too, that Maxime admits of no Release,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

I perswade my self, God never yet spoke so loud, that they who have barracadoed their Ears with prejudice, will hear him: nor ever yet wrote so plain, that they will see his mind, whose Eyes interest has sealed up: And what if it be an <hi>apparent breach</hi> of the Divine Law in the sincere judgement <hi>of him that separates;</hi> must he never discharge his Duty, till he can perswade all the world to see theirs, and pursue it.</p>

§ § Who shall be <hi>Iudge,</hi> whether the Imposed Terms contain <hi>an apparent breach of the Divine Law?</hi> and such as will justifie a separation? Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> indeed tells us, <hi>It's a point of no great depth or difficulty;</hi> but yet <hi>the true solution of it, carries fire in the Tail of it; for it brings with it a piece of Doctrine which is seldom pleasing to Superiours.</hi> But were it not that men hate <hi>chargeable Truth</hi> more then <hi>cheap Errour,</hi> and love <hi>cheap Corruptions</hi> beyond <hi>costly Reformation,</hi> there could be no great difficulty who should be judge in this case: For 1. Who may more just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challange a Liberty to judge <hi>what is sin,</hi> then he that must be damned <hi>if he do sin:</hi> He that sins at another; Command will hardly perswade him to be his substitute in the Condemnation, nor will God accept him for the sinners proxy. 2. If the Church must judge; Then though her terms be <hi>the most apparent vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Divine Law,</hi> yet there can never be any <hi>lawful separation,</hi> unless we can Imagine her <hi>so modest,</hi> as to <hi>confess</hi> a sin, and yet at the same time, so <hi>immodest</hi> as to <hi>impose</hi> it. To <hi>acknowledge</hi> her Terms <hi>sinful,</hi> and yet with the same breath to enjoyn them as necessary to Communion.</p>
               <p>It will be pretended, that the same Inconveniencies will follow <hi>the other way:</hi> for if a particular person who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws, must judge, then let the Terms be <hi>perfectly innocent,</hi> yet to be sure, he will plead, that they are <hi>sinful;</hi> unless we can suppose him <hi>so modest,</hi> as to <hi>confess</hi> himself a Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick; and yet at the same time <hi>so immodest,</hi> as to persevere in his Schism. But I conceive that this arguing is very wide: 1. Because every Mans Soul lies at stake, and it cannot be imagined that he should either not study its Interest, or that understanding it, he should not endeavour to secure it: I speak of such as are <hi>otherwise Consciencious;</hi> for if he be a person vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to suppose any Man to be a Hypocrite in the matter of sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is attended with so mamy dreadful penalties, unless notorious evidence will warrant such a Judgement.</p>
               <p>§ 3. A <hi>rational suspicion of a breach of the Divine Law</hi> is enough in the Apostles judgement to justifie the suspension of my own Act; and if it prove no other then a thing indifferent in it self, yet such dissatisfaction will excuse from sin: for so the Apostle, Rom. 14. 5. <hi>Let every man be fully perswaded in his own mind. 14.

For the poor <hi>Romanists,</hi> he gives them a small pat with his Foot, and they are silenced for ever. <hi>It's plain</hi> (says he) <hi>it can be no sin to separate, when it's a sin to Communicate</hi> Yes very plain it is! but so say <hi>the Dissenters.</hi> It can be no sin <hi>for us</hi> to separate, when it's a sin to communicate: Ay but (says he) It was <hi>an apparent breach of the Divine Law</hi> upon which we separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>from Rome.</hi> Why so say the Dissenters: It's an apparent breach of the Divine Law, upon which we separated from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Ay but (will he say) you ought to have <hi>trusted wiser men then your selves,</hi> and not like the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> to have run upon your heads: Oh! but then comes in the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> and falls upon his bones: <hi>You ought to have trusted wiser men then your selves,</hi> your Superiours in the Church, from whom you separated, and not have ran upon your own heads: Nay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies he, but we have <hi>a judgement of Discretion,</hi> and ought to be <hi>Masters of our own Reason,</hi> so far as to take <hi>Cognizance of our own Acts:</hi> Well!

               <p>
                  <hi>It's plain</hi> (says he) <hi>that Schism being so great a sin, and of so extream bad Consequences, that which must acquit me of the guilt of it in my separation, can be nothing lesse then an equal danger on the other hand, and that when I may persevere without sin, it must of necessity be a sin to separate upon inferior dislikes.</hi> This looks pretty well at first but for a few Inconveniences in the Argument. 1.

                     </gap>her the Imposition of such Laws and Terms of Society as cannot be submitted to without apparent breach of the divine Law be the only just cause of separation?</hi> He affirms it, and for proof gives us this, that Schism <hi>being so great a sin that which must acquit me of the Guilt of it in my separation, must be equal danger of sinning:</hi> wherein he supposeth <hi>that all separation is Schism, where there is not equal danger of sinning that is of an apparent breach of the divine Law, whith is but the question it self a little disgnised</hi> to make it more passable to the unwary Reader; the truth is, <hi>Schism is so great a sin that no danger of sinning whatsoever</hi> can acquit me of it, for I do not know that any thing will compound for <hi>uncharitableness,</hi> for <hi>pride,</hi> for <hi>obstinacy,</hi> but <hi>separation</hi> for the benefit of all Gods Ordinances, that I may be edifyed and built

up in the most holy faith, but nothing of the nature of the <hi>abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> sin in it. 2. Dissenters will answer, that <hi>the danger of sinning is more clear and evident</hi> when I act <hi>against my Conscience,</hi> then in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating peaceably and modestly from a particular Church: for it cannot be lawful in any Case to act against my light, but it may be lawful in <hi>some Cases</hi> to <hi>separate from a particular Church:</hi> there is lesse danger of sin in breaking a humane constitution, whitch ('tis at least) questionable whether man has power to en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>oyn, then of violating the dictate of my own reason informed by all the means I can use from the word of God. 3. Non-conformists say, that they ought not to separate, but when non-separation is sinful, but then they say, that non-separation may be sinful upon other accounts then the apparent breach of the divineLaw made the terms of entring into; or continuing in communion: for, say they, it is our sin, if a Church retains some corroptions in it, which <hi>prejudice edification,</hi> and she shall resolve never to make any alteration in her worship; or discipline, nor make any further progress towards a through Reformation, not to provide for my self elsewhere, and having opportunity, I sin if I take not, accept not the advantage which providence offers me, and wherein the word warrants me.</p>
               <p>And yet he wonders that <hi>any doubt should be admitted in this Case.</hi> Let me advise him to beware of Excessive wonderment: they say, it will make a man as lean as a rake: but whats the Cause of his admiration? Why some think to wash their hands of the Imputation of Schism upon other terms as namely; <hi>if a Church shall not require such terms of Communion as are Expresly sinful, yet if she shall require indifferent unnecessary or at most suspected things that in this case there is enough to Excuse the person that shall separate from a participation of this sin.</hi> There are some no doubt of that judgment: and when I have praelibated a few things, he shall have his full blow at them.</p>
               <p>§ 1. That when they joyn issue upon this point, 'tis not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are satisfyed that the things required unto Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as <hi>the antecedent conditions</hi> of it, or to be practised in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as the <hi>mattor of</hi> it are indifferent <hi>in their use and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for they are ready to maintain it upon equal laws, before equal Judges, that they are sinful in their use, antecedent to, their imposition, but the true reasons why they use this place, are. 1. Ex abundanti thinking that their very outworks are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable against his batteries. 2. Out of respect to this Church which they highly honour, and reverence her too much then to charge her flatly with sinful impositions; and therefore do offer this state of the question, and are hardly capable of so much incivility to so considerable a body, and so great a part of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Catholick Church, unless the importunity of some modest men did extort that answer from them. 3. They doubt whether some Churchmen will be Masters of so much patience as to bear freedome though temperateness of speech, which is absolutely necessary to the manadging the Controversy when thus stated:

and have reason to fear that some who provoke them to assert the sinfulness of <hi>the terms,</hi> will make such an Assertion an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable sin, not to be expiated without, if with Martyrdom.</p>

               <p>§ 3. They desire the same justice in Explaning themselves about the term <hi>indifferent: A thing may be indifferent in its own nature,</hi> which is not so <hi>in its use,</hi> as applyed to and practised in the Immediate worship and service of God; If the things under debate be found upon diligent search to remain indifferent, after they are vested with all their circumstances in Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, they have no quarrel against them that I know of; but if they be only indifferent in their own <hi>general nature,</hi> they desire to be Excused if they dare not admit the consequence, that therefore they must needs be so when <hi>used in Gods worship,</hi> and then made the <hi>terms of Communion.</hi>

If it be <hi>the Churches</hi> sin to command <hi>unnecessary burdensom suspect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions:</hi> It cannot be my duty to obey; A Church may possibly sin in the <hi>manner of her Command,</hi> and yet I <hi>not sin</hi> in doing the <hi>matter of the Command,</hi> but when <hi>the sins in the Enjoyning,</hi> I cannot conceive how it should be <hi>my sin not to give obedience;</hi> for I look upon my <hi>duty</hi> as the <hi>result</hi> of the Churches <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> and wherein she has <hi>no Authority</hi> it will be impossible to find a <hi>foundation</hi> upon which to build <hi>my duty:</hi> All Offices of Justice arise from that relation wherein he that <hi>claims</hi> and he that <hi>yeelds subjection</hi> stand to each other: And where there's <hi>no relation,</hi> there can be <hi>no relative duty:</hi> now in this case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us where the Church has no <hi>power</hi> to command, nay <hi>where she sins,</hi> if <hi>she commands,</hi> so far she is <hi>none, of my superior;</hi> and therefore so far the <hi>relation</hi> is none, and by consequence the <hi>duty</hi> just as much. 2. If the <hi>Church be to blame</hi> highly, nay <hi>very highly to blame,</hi> that clogs her Communion with these <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densom</hi> things, then we may presume <hi>she sins,</hi> for who shall dare to assume so much freedom as to <hi>blame</hi> her, unless she <hi>transgress the Law of her God?</hi> If then she have sinned and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed some Law of God, it must be some negative precept, <hi>thou shalt not impose burdenso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Gal. 1. <hi>to stand fast in that liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and not again to be entangled with the yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage;</hi> Now if ever these Scriptures do us any service, or be of any use, it must be in this particular, that I am obliged not to take a burden and cumber upon my soul, at his hands who has <hi>no authority</hi> to impose it: If then a Church shall clog her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with burdensom things, she is to blame, she sins, and I am not bound to obey, and therefore my departure can be no Schism.

We come now to his Assertion notwithstanding all this, which he has granted he will fetch it back again, if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and we shall gain nothing by any thing he gives us, and there are also two parts of his Assertion. 1. The negative part; <hi>'Tis not burdensomness, nor every light suspicion of sin that can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stific any separation;</hi> concerning the <hi>burdensomness</hi> we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken somewhat before; yet a word or two about the suspicion; <hi>'tis not a light,</hi> or however <hi>not every light suspicion</hi> that is but like the <hi>dust of the ballance</hi> that will do it: really it was cunningly fenced! He expects perhaps that we should assert every light suspicion that weighs no more then a feather should be enough to justifie a separation; Ay; but there are <hi>violent presumption,</hi> which they say in some cases are admitted for good evidence. If I meet a person coming out of the house in a great rage with a bloody sword in his hand, and Immediately I enter in and find a person lying in his blood, I do assure you I shall not condemn my self for <hi>lightness of belief,</hi> or <hi>casmess of entertaining suspicions;</hi> if I suspect the man I met to have been the <hi>murder or; light suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions</hi> may be as easily shook of as fastened on, and contemned as tendered: but it becomes no wise man to act against these <hi>strong presumptions</hi> of sin, which the Dissenters have of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed terms of Communion; And it will appear they are such as may make a hardy resolute person stand and pause before he rushes upon the practise: 1. They are sure that Christ is the perfect and therefore the only Lawgiver of his Church: had he not been the former, there had been no pretence he should be the <hi>later:</hi> Now seeing these terms of Communion, are Laws <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> upon the Church; they seem to impeach his wisedome that he saw not the fittest terms for his Churches to hold Communion upon, they do reproach his care that he has not left laws enough for his Church, and they seem to invade his Authority without any warrant: all which things are enough to raise a suspicion (at least) of good strength in a wisemans breast, which none but a hardy spirit would act against.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are sure that some of these conditions have been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by and used in and with, and are suited and accommodated to the <hi>grossest Idolatry</hi> that ever was in the world, and is at this day used to give countenance to it: And they say they are sure that God did <hi>once hate Idolatry,</hi> and so hate it as that he could not endure to be served in the vessels, worshipt in the places, not after the manner (in the most minute circumstances) that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry

was committed in; and therefore we have Reason to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that the things required of us are displeasing to God: our using of them has emboldened Idolaters, and hardened them to go on without repentance in the way of so great abomination: Nor have they been a Bridge as was hoped, to bring them over to us, but a Boat to waft us over to them, they being more hardened by our retaining them, and some of our own made more waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; thinking there can be no great difference between those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, where there is so great a Symbolizing in outward modes and Ceremonies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are sure that <hi>all uncommanded worship is forbidden wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> and do think their time ill bestowed with him that shall deny it: All worship being part of that Homage and service we owe to God, it will be impossible to Guess what he will accept as such without revelation: Now we are sure that the <hi>Enquirer</hi> owns the Liturgy to have been a <hi>principal part of worship:</hi> and we are as sure that the Ceremonies are <hi>part of the Liturgy,</hi> and that which is a <hi>part of a part,</hi> is part of the whole, nor can any man discern any difference between them, and other things which are confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly parts of worship, and therefore they think they may with modesty say, there's ground enough for a violent suspicion of their sinfulness.</p>

The affirmative part of his Assertion follows; <hi>It must be plain necessity or certainty of sin in complyance that can justifie any sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi> I should be glad to know what <hi>cortainty of sin he</hi> will allow to <hi>justifie a separation?</hi> does he Expect a <hi>mathematical certainty?</hi> or only a <hi>moral assurance?</hi> If you ask, an Arithmetician says (I: Martyr in his dialogue with Trypho) how many twice two will make? he will answer yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> as often, <hi>four!</hi> and if I were asked a thousand times <hi>what certainty of sin</hi> were required to the <hi>suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my own act,</hi> I would as often answer no more of necessity then that the thing does <hi>not appear</hi> to my best and Impartial judgment to be <hi>Lawful,</hi> separation is <hi>not necessarily a sin,</hi> there are as <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant Commands</hi> for it, as <hi>prohibitions</hi> of it, It may be a <hi>duty,</hi> and it may be a <hi>sin,</hi> and why need we not <hi>as plain</hi> argument to prove that separation is <hi>not my duty,</hi> as that it is <hi>not my sin?</hi> seeing it may be one as well as the other? why now he arrests us with his Reasons.</p>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>Forasmuch</hi> (says he) <hi>as I cannot be discharged from a plain duty, but by an equal plainess of sin.</hi> This reason looks very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily at first sight, and yet it demonstrates no more then a great good will to the cause: And 1. 'Tis no more then a plain beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Question; viz. That <hi>Complyance is a plain duty,</hi> Schism indeed is a <hi>plain sin,</hi> but separation <hi>is not</hi> plainly Schism; It is a <hi>plain contradiction</hi> to the Assertion, but not a <hi>plain confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of it, unless the denyal of it in other words be a <hi>confutation.</hi> The business in short is this; I suspect <hi>such Compliance</hi> is <hi>not my duty;</hi> and again, I suspect the <hi>terms of Communion are sinful,</hi> and surely we may set <hi>suspected sin,</hi> as a Barr to what is but <hi>suspected duty</hi> at any time of the day; let us a little compare things: that which he calls plain duty, is complyance with such a Church as imposes
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52034:86"/>
things <hi>unnecessary, burdensom and suspicious,</hi> that which he calls <hi>plain sin,</hi> is refusing such compliance; now this say I, is a plain begging of the Question which is all the plainess in his Reason: First to enquire whether such a separation or non-Complyance be Lawful, and then to suppose such Complyance to be plain duty. And then to assign this for the Reason that nothing but equal plainess of sin can discharge me from a plain duty. 2. Dissenters do affirm that it is <hi>as plain,</hi> nay <hi>more plain,</hi> and if he will have it <hi>so much more plain</hi> a sin to practise the Ceremonies then to separate, for separation may be a duty in some cases, but the practising of such Ceremonies cannot be a duty <hi>in any Case,</hi> on this side divine prescription: God has warranted separation in the General, but he has not so warranted Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>§ 2. His second reason is; <hi>And for this phrase</hi> suspected; <hi>it is so loose and uncertain that there's no hold of it, men will easily suspect what they have no mind to:</hi> whether this word <hi>suspected</hi> be a <hi>phrase</hi> or no, I shall leave to the wrangling Grammarians, only I am afraid in a while, every small <hi>particle</hi> will be a phrase, where these Gentlemens occasions require it. <hi>A suspected evil</hi> is no such trivial thing in the Apostles divinity as the Enquirer would persuade us: to act in any case when we have not clear light into the Lawfulness of the action is sin, and such a one as renders the actor obnoxious to eternal damnation. <hi>He that doubts is dammed if he eat.</hi> And indeed to act against the restraine of our own judgment <hi>though mistaken,</hi> argues a mind prepared to act against our judgments, if they <hi>had not been mistaken:</hi> He that shall attempt to <hi>clip the Kings Coyn,</hi> may meet with a <hi>plated piece,</hi> yet had if been <hi>right stander'd,</hi> he would have served it no better: <hi>that men will easily suspect what they have no mind to,</hi> ought not to prejudice those wo have <hi>no mind to a thing,</hi> because they <hi>suspect it to be evil.</hi> Tis <hi>as easy for another to say that what men</hi> have a <hi>desperate love to,</hi> they will never be brought to <hi>suspect its sinfulness.</hi> What wise man would suspect four or five hundred pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> to be <hi>unlawful?</hi> our Inclinations naturally warp towards ease, and rest, and they that know no God but their mistaken selves, will own no Scripture but what is dictated from the inspiration of <hi>fleshly Interest.</hi> The Byas of nature draws us more to <hi>suspect the Lawfulness</hi> of that which <hi>being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi> would undo us, then to suspect that <hi>to be unlawful,</hi> which <hi>being Lawful</hi> would advance us.</p>
               <p>And this may justifie all sober Dissenters, that they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them are confessed to be too blame in clogging their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with unnecessary, burdensom and suspected Conditions, and they who are condemned for suspecting it to be as sinful in them to obey as it is in others to command, and thereupon suspending their Compliance, are either violently cast out of, or not admitted into Communion. And this is your monstrous Schismatick.</p>
               <p>And I am very confident, that not only the Scripture, but all Antiquity with the unanimous su <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rage of the Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52034:86"/>
will justifie and acquit that person of the Guilt of Schism, who being found in the faith, holy in his life, earnestly plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and petitioning for Reformation, humbly desiring he may have Christs ordinances upon Christs terms, and yet being denyed his Right shall make his applications to some other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church of Christ, where his admittance may be more easy, his continuance more certain and safe, his mind not distracted with suspicions about his own actings, but his whole strength and spirits expended in the edification of his own soul in truth, holiness, and peace, which before were wasted in doubtful disputations.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The second thing he will say is, <hi>if the non-necessity of some of the terms of Communion be a warrant of separation, then there can be no such thing as Schism at all:</hi> I doubt not but he intends that his argument shall proceed a remotione Consequentis ad remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem Antecedentis: But there is <hi>such a sin as Schism,</hi> therefore the non-necessity of some of the terms of Communion is not a warrant of separation: there are many things I would answer to this argument: 1. That the whole Syllogism is troubled with an old malady called ignoratio Elenchi, for 'tis not half an hour ago since he undertook to prove that <hi>the Churches requiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, unnecessary, or at most susp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>cted things would not excuse the person that should separate from the Guilt of Schism.</hi> Afterwards he put in <hi>burdensom</hi> into the Question: And now I perceive he would be glad to take Eggs for his money, if he could get them, and sit down content with this sorry conclusion, that the <hi>non-ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of some of the Terms is no sufficient warrant of separation:</hi> which fault is an argument some call an Ignorance of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but I call it a fighting with his own shadow, what if bare non-necessity alone, without burdensomness, or what if both these without strong suspicion of sin will not warrant it, yet if all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct will do the feat. Dissenters will Escape the <hi>Hue and Cry</hi> after Schism, and Schismaticks; 2. I deny his Consequence: there might be, there would be Schism, to much Schism, though I confess not half so much as there is, though the non-neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the Terms were a good warrant of separation: If Schism lay in nothing indeed but <hi>running away from</hi> a Church (as the vulgar error carries it) he had come a little nearer the mark; but if we durst content our selves with the Scripture notion of Schism which includes those feuds, heats, intestine broiles, those envyings malignities, wherewith factious and bandying parties in the besome of a Church do persecute each other, there might be as much Schism as almost the Divel could desire, and yet no separation: But let us hear his proof of the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>forasmuch</hi> (says he) <hi>as there never was, nor probably ever will be such a Church as required nothing of those in her Communion, but things strictly and absolutely necessary,</hi> Ergo what? why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if <hi>the non-necessity of some of the terms of Communion be a sufficient warrant of separation, there can be no such thing as Schism,</hi> pray forbear, there is a medium as I take it between <hi>non-necessary,</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:52034:87"/>
and <hi>strictly</hi> and <hi>absolutely necessary;</hi> I mean those things which being neither <hi>necessary in their own nature,</hi> nor made so by any <hi>positive Law of God</hi> in particular: yet by a concurrence of weighty circumstances serving under some General Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, do become at <hi>that time, and under those circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> necessary, and these are those things wherein many Churches, I suppose all Churches, have at one time or other Exercised their power, now then though 'tis true that <hi>if the non-absolute necessity</hi> of the Terms of Communion be a warrant of separation, there would be <hi>no such thing as Schism at all</hi> by unwarrantable separation from a Church, because perhaps <hi>there never was a Church that required nothing of those in her Communion but things absolutely necessary;</hi> yet it may be true, that the <hi>non-necessity</hi> of the Terms of Communion may be a good warrant for separation, and yet there may be Schism enough in the world: for captious froward Spirits will be cavilling at, and dividing upon the account of those things which by a particular Church are required <hi>becoming necessary from circumstances:</hi> but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him aright in this matter; Non-conformists do affirm, that what ever is made a condition of Communion, ought to have <hi>some kind of necessity</hi> in it or with it, <hi>antecedent to its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;</hi> and being made such a condition; still he is harping upon: and has great mind to prove what we are not concern'd to deny: but if he tempts to it, perhaps I may deny it: <hi>That there was never, nor ever will be any such Church,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Nevertheless our <hi>Enquirer</hi> is resolved he will give us two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of this Truth that <hi>some things are necessary to the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and administration of a particular Church, that are not in themselves necessary absolutely considered:</hi> And if he thinks it worth the while, he may give us two hundred, for we are perfectly unconcerned in them all.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) The first instance is in the Apostles times: <hi>the abstaining from things strangled and blood, was by the Council of Ierusalem adjudged and declared necessary to be observed by the Gentiles, in order to an accommodation between them and the Iews; and yet I suppose scarce any body thinks the observation of that Abstinence so Enjoyned necessary in it self:</hi> Let us apply it, either then the <hi>abstaining from Ceremonies</hi> must be adjudged <hi>necessary in order to an Accommodation between our Church, and other Protestants,</hi> or the <hi>obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But let us Examine a little his great Instance.</p>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>It was adjudged and declared necessary to be observed</hi> (sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>dal Letters,</hi> nor the Council at liberty to have <hi>determined the contrary</hi> unless an accommodation between Jew, and Gentile, was a thing unnecessary, 15. Acts 28. <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> no greater burden then those necessary things,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now let him try his skill to conclude a power to impose <hi>things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary</hi> from this fact of theirs, who only imposed <hi>things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. That a Council had the <hi>Immediate assistance of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and might more safely adventure upon such an Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then any particular or National Church, who as they have <hi>no promise,</hi> cannot <hi>in faith</hi> expect any such extraordinary dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and we hope that no Church will assume equal power to impose, unless they could produce equal authority for their power, in which the Consciences of Christians might securely acquiesce: It would be strange language from a Synod. <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no other burdens then these necessary things,</hi> that yet observe all Ceremonies of our appointment.</p>
               <p>§ 3. The people might reasonably conform to that decree, which had their own <hi>Antecedent consent,</hi> and the more patiently bear the burden, which was not imposed upon <hi>them, without themselves,</hi> for this Canon was not only sent to the Churches by the order of the <hi>Apostles, and Elders, and the whole Church,</hi> v. 22.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52034:89"/>
but what ever obligatory power there was in it <hi>from man,</hi> It ran in the name of the <hi>Apostles, Elders and Brethren;</hi> But alas the Case is otherwise with the poor Churches in reference to impositions of late Ages, who know no more what Impositions shall be laid upon their Consciences, then the poor horse is acquainted whither his Master intends to ride him.</p>
               <p>§. 4. This was a Decree <hi>not to burden</hi> them, but to <hi>case and relieve</hi> them, not to pinch the Gentiles, but to discharge them of those servile loads, which some Judaizing Converts, would have imposed on them; we read v. 1. <hi>That certain came down from Iudea which taught the brethren; and said, Except ye be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised after the manner of Moses ye cannot be saved.</hi> And when Paul, and Barnabas opposed this Tyranny, yet such was their Zeal for their old Ceremonies, that they reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their scatter'd squadrons from <hi>certain of the Sect of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees who believed,</hi> (v. 5.) <hi>saying, That it was necessary to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise them, and Command them to keep the Law of Moses:</hi> At last the Case comes before the Council, and they determine against these Judaizing Bigots; That their blind Zeal should not be the measure of what was necessary, or unnecessary; and yet not to Exasperat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> them, left perhaps they might apostatize wholly from Christ, and relapse to Moses, (as they were in a fair way,) They determine to <hi>Lay no other burden upon them but those</hi> (really) <hi>necessary things:</hi> In opposition to <hi>those other,</hi> which the Jewish Brethren <hi>falsly</hi> pleaded to be necessary: so that they eased the burden which some would <hi>by doctrine</hi> have laid upon their shoulders, and only charg'd them by their determination with what was <hi>really necessary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. Let us consider the things Imposed. v. 29. Abstaining <hi>from meats offer'd to Idols, and from blood, and from things stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, and from fornication.</hi> Of which, <hi>fornication,</hi> was unlawful in it self; By <hi>Blood,</hi> many Learned men understand <hi>Murther,</hi> which opinion the Learned Dr. Hammond recites, and, as I remember approves: As to the <hi>not eating of things strangled.</hi> It had Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a very Reverend, and Grave Countenance by its Antiquity, being Numbered amongst the seven percepts of the sons of Noah: And lastly, as for <hi>meats offer'd to Idols,</hi> under <hi>that Notion,</hi> it was, and is still, unlawful.</p>
               <p>§. 6. All this was for Avoiding scandal; The Morality of which praecept, had it been understood by the Raw Novice Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the gentiles, it had taught them to abstain from a greater matter then <hi>Blood or things strangled</hi> (supposing them indifferent) that they might give no offence. And therefore whilst this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non was in force, and the sharpest edge set on it, I question not but that the Gentile Christian might have eaten the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52034:89"/>
for thus was the end of the Decree attained, the Apostles satisfied, the Jews pleased, and Christian Liberty asserted, and vindicated: But the Case is otherwise with us: for such is the Holiness of a Cross, or Surplice, that if a Minister satisfied <hi>in their use;</hi> and yet convinced that they ought to know their distance, and give place to the Conscience of <hi>the weak,</hi> or of <hi>the strong,</hi> who is supposed weak in this instance, shall omit them, he shall be lyable to be reviled <hi>by the Author of the former part of the Enquiries.</hi> p. 25. for an <hi>underminer of the Church, A debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of his Office,</hi> and what not, and for want of a white garment, shall have a hole pickt in his black coat, and suspended both a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§. 7. Here was no penalty annext by way of sanction to this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. The Apostles contented themselves with that spiritual Power wherewith the Lord Christ had Armed them: nor do we read that ever any were excommunicated about it, nor urged it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable Condition of enjoying the ordinances of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>§. 8. It appears from the Apostle Paul, that when this Decree had a little gratified a people ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>There is no question but those Churches who going of from the Dregs of Rome, finding their people both Ignorant, and obstinate, and extreamly a verse to a through Reformation, did in prudence leave them some of their old little toyes, till they should know better, and then they would throw 'em away of themselves; They that had suckt in Popery with their Mothers milk, would be very pievish, and wrangle unmercifully to be weaned all at once: staied nurses did therefore deal with them as they could bear, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting when they should fall to more manly food: But seeing by this time they have either reacht their end, or never will; and seeing the subtle enemy of Purity and peace, would pervert their ends, if they be permitted quietly to expire, and dye of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, (which they would soon do, if not fetcht again by their over-Officious friends importunity) The Protestant Religion should have no Cause to bewail their funerals.</p>
               <p n="2">[2] His second Instance is in <hi>Church-government.</hi> The short of, it is thus much: That <hi>some</hi> Church-government is necessary, yet no particular form necessary. <hi>As whether it ought to be Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or Aristocratical, Episcopal, or Consistorial.</hi> This seems very dangerous Doctrine, for now it seems <hi>Episcopal government</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded of its old pretence to a <hi>jus Divinum:</hi> And now the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian and Congregational forms stand upon even grounds with the Praelatical, saving wherein this last has got the advantage <hi>by Law.</hi> But here we are to understand that <hi>his Text and his margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reading;</hi> his Chethib, and Keri, do strangely vary, and its like to

               <p>But this is not the worst on't. Here seems to be an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable Contradiction. Episcopacy, is <hi>Indifferent,</hi> and yet <hi>best in it self: Not necessary,</hi> and yet <hi>Apostolical,</hi> and yet some think there was an absolute necessity of this quarrel between the Text, and Margine; The Margin was Added to make the Text passe muster, and if the one had not been a <hi>Deleatur,</hi> the other had mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Let him then Agree himself with himself, whilst I examine his Reasonings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Church government</hi> is <hi>Necessary in the General;</hi> but <hi>this or that form</hi> of government, in particular, is <hi>not necessary, (not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary)</hi> therefore somethings <hi>not necessary in themselves, are, or may be necessary to the constitution, or administration of a particular Church.</hi> This, if I greatly mistake not, is the whole strength of this Period. To which I answer in these particulars. (1.) That though the Scripture does not trouble us with Terms of Art, <hi>Monarchical, Aristocratical, Democratical,</hi> Yet at least <hi>all the Officers</hi> belonging to the Church of Christ are there <hi>specially determined:</hi> And <hi>from the Nature of the Officers,</hi> the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or <hi>particular form</hi> of the Government, will <hi>of necessity</hi> emerge; If the Officers of the particular Churches stand upon equal ground one with another, the government which results from thence will be Aristocratical: If there be an Imparity,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52034:90"/>
and subordination of the governors of one Church to another the government which results from thence will be Monarchical; And if the Churches governed by their respective Pastors are not knit together by some Common bond, the government will be denominated Congregational. (2.) Supposing that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is only <hi>Commanded in the general,</hi> but the <hi>particular form not determined,</hi> yet this will never conclude, that the Church may Impose such things as Terms of Communion which are <hi>noe Commanded in the general.</hi> It can never follow that a Church may <hi>institute, and impose</hi> Ceremonies, for which there is <hi>no General warrant,</hi> because it must agree upon <hi>a Government,</hi> for which there is <hi>a General warrant:</hi> Nor that she may Impose those things which are <hi>not necessary</hi> either to <hi>the Constitution or Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Church,</hi> because she must determine upon that, which is necessary both to the <hi>constitution,</hi> and <hi>administration</hi> of it. (3.) He pretends to prove that <hi>it is unlawful to separate</hi> upon the Account of <hi>unnecessary Conditions of Communion,</hi> and he gives us an Instance <hi>in Episcopacy,</hi> which yet his Margin affirms to <hi>Be best in it self,</hi> and <hi>Apostolical for Antiquity:</hi> from hence we are instructed, That <hi>unnecessary conditions,</hi> are such as are or may be <hi>Best in themselves:</hi> And let him but produce such Terms of Communion, as being <hi>unnecessary in themselves,</hi> are yet <hi>best in themselves,</hi> and I am confident there will be an end of this Controversy: whereas therefore his Margine tells us, That this is <hi>Argumentum ad Homines:</hi> he says very true, it is so to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his friends.</hi> If Episcopal government be <hi>best in it self,</hi> how will he thence conclude the Churches power to Impose <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things, unnecessary things;</hi> which are <hi>not best in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</hi> But if Episcopal government be <hi>indifferent,</hi> and <hi>unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in it self,</hi> how is it <hi>best in it self,</hi> and <hi>Apostolical for Antiquity?</hi> An <hi>indifferent</hi> thing, <hi>best in it self,</hi> An <hi>unnecessary Apostolical constitution,</hi> is a notion which founds very harshly in my ears, and perhaps the most of our Readers.</p>
               <p>But we are all tyred out with these paralogisms, we have heard a great clamour of <hi>Schism, Schism,</hi> as the manner is, and when we come to Enquire after that Reason, we are returned with a nihil dicit, or which is all one, <hi>nothing to that purpose.</hi>

               <p>But here for the credit of his Discourse (wherein we are all equally concerned with himself) I could have wish't he had not prefaced it with so foul and gross a slander: <hi>It is said by some, that there is as much cause for Secession from this Church now, as there was from the Roman in the time of our Ancestors.</hi> I only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand so much Justice from the Reader, as to suspend his belief till this judicious Imputation be made good, and in the mean time return thus much in Answer.</p>
               <p>§ 1. There may be <hi>a just Cause,</hi> where there is not an <hi>equal Cause</hi> of separation: There may be a great latitude in the terms of Communion, and yet all injustifiable, and there may be great variety in the Reasons of separation, and yet all may be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable. Had the Popes Terms been much lower, they had been much too high for our Ancestors to come up to: And
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52034:92"/>
though the Terms of this Church are lower then those of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet they are something too high for Dissenters, who humbly plead that they have just cause for a <hi>peaceable Departure,</hi> since they cannot <hi>peaceably Abide</hi> in the Society.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Upon our <hi>Enquirers</hi> Principles, it had been as lawful for our Ancestors to have continued in Communion with the Roman, as for Dissenters to conform to the present demands of this Church. For let me have a clear Answer, why <hi>their Private Wisdoms,</hi> ought not to be sacrificed to <hi>the Publick Wisdom</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign, as our private wisdom resign to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick, under our present Circumstances? For in this Case, we consider not <hi>the lawfulness, or unlawfulness of the Terms</hi> as they are in <hi>their Naked selves;</hi> but where <hi>the final Decision</hi> shall rest, <hi>whether they be lawful or unlawful?</hi> Now the <hi>Enquirer</hi> tells us, page 168. <hi>Its enough to warrant our obedience, that the thing is the Command of the Superiour, and not beyond the Sphere of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> But who can measure the Sphere of the Magistrates Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, unless we could take the just Diameter of it? Again page 178. <hi>The Result of all will be, that instead of prescribing to the Magistrate what he shall determine, or disputing what he hath concluded on, we shall compose our minds, and order our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances for the more easy, and cheerful compliance therewith.</hi> What Rivers of precious Blood had this Doctrine saved, had it been broached in <hi>Q. Maries</hi> dayes: That men must <hi>not dispute what the Magistrate has concluded on:</hi> And though he thinks to heal all this by saying page 166. <hi>That God has made the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate a General Commission, and made no exception of this kind,</hi> (meaning as far as Circumstantials, and those things that God himself has not defined) yet this will not salve the difficulty, because 1. Who shall judge what is a <hi>Circumstantial,</hi> and what a <hi>Substantial;</hi> what an <hi>Integral part</hi> only, and what an <hi>Essential part</hi> of Religion? Where shall we lodge the determination ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, what <hi>God has defined and not defined?</hi> If the Magistrate! Then our Ancestors are gone by the Common Law. If the private person, we are all <hi>in statu quo.</hi> 2. God has no where dister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Circumstantials, from Substantials in the Magistrates Commission; for though our <hi>Enquirer</hi> has excepted the one, yet it is by his private Authority, which binds not the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, His Commission is <hi>Patent,</hi> and therefore it may be read. 13 <hi>Rom. 1. Let every soul be subject to the higher powers,</hi> &amp;c. This Commission does no more except an <hi>Obedience,</hi> then a <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;</hi> he that will put in the one, may at pleasure insert the other, and he that will except the one, may and will, except the other. So that I conclude, or at least see no reason why I may not; that according to this <hi>Enquirers</hi> sentiments, had providence allotted us our habitations under a Prince of the Roman Communion, we might have practised all his Injunctions, without warrant to plead our Consciences in Bar: which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple will bear a mans charges through all the Turks Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and make any man a free Citizen of <hi>Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:52034:92"/>
when once Conscience is sacrificed to the Deity of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan.</p>
               <p>Every true Protestant will gladly read his Justification of this Churches departure from <hi>Rome:</hi> And therefore though it be not much to the matter in hand, I shall not grudge to go a little out of my way with him, for his good company and profitable discourse.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We could not</hi> (says he) <hi>continue in the Roman Church upon any better Conditions, then</hi> Nahash <hi>propounded to the men of</hi> Jabesh Gilead <hi>to put out our Right eyes, that we might be fit for their blind Devotion.</hi> Whether the eye be put out that it <hi>cannot;</hi> or hood-winckt, that it <hi>may not</hi> see, is no such considerable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; but we have the less need of <hi>a Private,</hi> if there be <hi>a Publick eye</hi> that can see for us all, and better discern the fit Terms of Communion: And whether it be the <hi>right eye,</hi> or <hi>the left,</hi> or both, that our <hi>Enquirer</hi> would pluck out of our heads I cannot tell: for when we have considered with the best eyes we have whether it be our duty to withdraw from the present esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment in some things, and the result of our most impartial inquiries, concludes in the affirmative, yet we are Schismaticks, and all that is naught; if then we may not see with our own eyes, as good pluck them out.</p>
               <p>They that fancy man to be but an Autamoton, a well contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved piece of Mechanism, have certainly fitted him to this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis: For suppose him to be like a Clock, which once put in motion, will jog on the round, and drudge through the Horary circle, and perform you a twelve hours work, in twelve hours time without attendance, or other charge than a little Oyle; and you may then set him to what hour you please. And he shall as freely strike twelve at Sun-set, as Mid-day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We must not here have renounced our Reason;</hi> What if we had? Our own <hi>private Reason</hi> is not worth so much as to contend with <hi>the publick:</hi> And thanks be to God, that our Governours are Counselled by their own Reasons; for had they been guided by the Counsels and Interests of such Divines, we must have Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ours too long ago.</p>

               <p n="2">[2] His second task is to prove that <hi>something must be foregone for peace.</hi> The design of this loose Discourse may de reduced to this Argument. Small matters though truths, or duties, are to be sacrificed to peace: But the things that Dissenters stick and boggle at, are such small matters, therefore they ought to be sacrificed to peace. To which I only say at present; That I modestly deny both his Premisses, and do hope he will as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly deny the Conclusion. And perhaps some Sawcy Fellow or other will take up the Argument, and give it one turn. Small matters that are indifferences ought to be sacrificed to peace, but the things imposed upon Dissenters (in the judgment of the Imposers) are small indifferent things, therefore they ought to be sacrificed to peace, or thus.

               <p>To the same purpose he gives us that excellent counsel of the Apostle. 12 <hi>Rom. 18. If it be possible, as much as in you lyes, live peaceably with all men.</hi> Admirable advice it is, God grant us grace to take it. And truly the Non-conformists can live peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with all the World, if they might be let alone, but its not in their power to prescribe Terms to others, but to receive them. <hi>Leges à victoribus dari, à victis Accipi,</hi> said <hi>Caesar:</hi> If then reasonable Terms be offered us, we will accept, and love them: If unreasonable, we will refuse, and love them. If we be taken into the circle of their Charity, we will love them; if we be excluded, yet still we love them: <hi>Amabo &amp; si Nolis, Amabo &amp; si Nolim ipse.</hi> We will love whether they will accept our love, and thank us for it or no: Nay we will love them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our own exasperating sufferings will perswade us, or no; that is, we will follow them with a Christian affection, in spight of their teeths, and of our own.

               <p>I confess it cost me a Smile when I read his improvement of

the Apostles exhortation. <hi>Surely</hi> (says he) <hi>he did not mean we should only accept of Peace, when its offered us for nothing, or be quiet till we can pick a quarrel, but that we should be at some cost to purchase it, and part with something for it:</hi> The <hi>old something</hi> still! Why, we are willing to part with all our outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, we will give <hi>skin upon skin,</hi> will neither Gods Terms, nor the Devils please him? Only we would not part with our Consciences instructed from the Scriptures, the Soveraingty of Christ, the Perfection of the Written Word; and is all this Nothing?</p>
               <p>But still he's at it again—<hi>We must deny our selves something upon that account.</hi> Why, we will take an Oath in the presence of Almighty God to <hi>lead quiet and peaceable Lives</hi> as become good Subjects, <hi>in all godliness and honesty;</hi> Will that serve to purchase our Peace?

                  <hi>There are hardly</hi> (says he page 1. 1.) <hi>any two persons perfectly of the same apprehensions, or stature of understanding in the whole World. So much difference there is in mens Constitutions, such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Education, such variety of Interests and Customs, and from hence so many prejudices and various Conceptions of things, that he that resolves to yeeld to no body, can Agree with no body.</hi> What now is to be done in this perplexed Case?

Why we must <hi>castigate our heats, take in our sailes, lighten the ship, and offer sacrifice to the touchy Deities of received Custome and Vulgar Opinion,</hi> with all the fine stuff you heard before: But surely there's an easier, cheaper, more honourable and Christian way then all these put together: To bear with one another, to leave judging, censuring, despising, persecuting; to leave men to those Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents which they have contracted from insuperable weakness, or less happy Education, whilst they are good men, good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, good Christians, sound in the Faith, and Worship God no worse then the Scripture commands them. And he that

cannot Indulge his brother sound in the Fundamentals, and walking together with his brethren so far as he has attained, let him prate of peace till his Tongue akes, 'tis evident he would not purchase Peace with Shoobuckles.</p>
               <p>The Apostle has recommended this expedient to us by his own example, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 20, 21. which the <hi>Enquirer</hi> could see to quote, and not to understand. <hi>Unto the Iews I became as a Iew, that I might gain the Iews; To them that were without the Law as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law (being not without Law to God, but under the Law to Christ) that I might gain them that are without the Law; To the weak became I as weak that I might gain the weak, I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.</hi> It seems the Blessed A postle had not yet learnt to snickle <hi>the private Conscience,</hi> with his <hi>publick Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which he quotes from <hi>Greg.

I would ask the <hi>Enquirer</hi> whether the Dissenters ever pleaded to be gracified in so weighty a point as <hi>the Coessentiality of the Holy Spirit?</hi> Or whether Ambiguity, or a handsome equivocation there, must be <hi>one of those things we must give for Peace;</hi> If neither of these, he might have spared <hi>Bafil,</hi> if not for our sake, yet for his own. And out of all these excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Materials we expected he should have composed a Speech to the Reverend Bishops.</p>

Nay, if Any Ceremony I have in my worship not Commanded by Christ, may do him a kindness, I have no such kindness for it as to disoblige him, nor shall he need to send me back one of his beloved ones in Exchange, I shall never feel the want of it. But now the Reader must be entreated to use his eyes: The Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was that <hi>it is Lawful to Conceal my opinion (when the main Doctrine of Christianity is not in dispute) rathet then disturb the peace of the Church:</hi> from whence he would wisely infer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may practise Ceremonies, which I am either fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied are sinful, or not fully satisfied that they are Lawful: for this is the upshot:—<hi>That we may comply with the Laws in being, so they be not palpably Contrary to the Scriptures or Common Reason;</hi> It very amazing to me, that I cannot conceal what I think true, unless I must assert what I judge false: nor bite in my sentiments about Anothers unlawful practise, but I must practise with him: I may suppress my judgment that such a thing is sinful, and yet not dare to deliver my judgment that it is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. He that Commanded me <hi>not to judge</hi> my brother, did not command me <hi>to Imitate</hi> him.</p>
               <p>It must not be overlook't, what an <hi>Emphasis</hi> he lays upon this word <hi>Palpably,</hi> we may comply with the Laws, so they be not <hi>Palpably</hi> contrary to the Scriptures. And p. 11. It must be An <hi>Apparent breach</hi> of the divine law, that gives just cause of sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And p. 118. Conditions of Communion that are not <hi>Expresly</hi> sinful, and such wherein there is not a <hi>Plain necessity,</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> of sin in Compliance, are justified. <hi>Sinful Terms,</hi> will not justify separation, unless they be <hi>Apparently, Expresly</hi> so. Nor will <hi>a sinful Command</hi> warrant my non-obedience, unless it be <hi>Palpably</hi> such. It must be some <hi>gross impiety,</hi> which like the Egyptian darkness may <hi>be felt:</hi> Thus if I be prohibited <hi>to partake of the Lords Supper,</hi> oftner then once in three, four or seven years, I must pocket up the wrong, because here's no palpable, apparent, express violation of the law of God. The Law says indeed, <hi>As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup:</hi> but has not determin'd <hi>how often.</hi> As one of your Roman Casuists determines, that we are not bound <hi>actually</hi> to love God above <hi>once in three years;</hi> And Another thinks, <hi>once in a Mans life</hi> will serve the turn, provided we do not down-right <hi>Hate him:</hi> because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Command of <hi>Loving God,</hi> is an affirmative praecept, which binds indeed <hi>semper,</hi> but not <hi>ad semper.</hi> And if all the Rabble Rout of Popish Ceremonies were Commanded, and five times as many more, yet these will not justify non-obedience, because (forsooth) they are not <hi>expresly</hi> forbidden, by Name, nor <hi>palpably</hi> contrary to any one Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, the Reader shall now know at a word <hi>the Lowest price of Peace.</hi> That <hi>we part with all that, which is no essential point of our Religion, for Charity, which is.</hi> This is the Lowest penny, take it, or Leave it, try the world, and mend your selves, where you can.

                  <hi>Charity</hi> to any <hi>point,</hi> or <hi>part of Religion:</hi> As if charity, which is Commanded by <hi>the principles</hi> of our Religion, should cross <hi>those principles:</hi> Charity Commands <hi>a Religious person</hi> to stoop to all in his private concerns, but requires not that Any <hi>Principle of Religion</hi> should stoop to it. 2. It's weakly suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that it's <hi>the Concern of Charity,</hi> that we be of one uniform practise in the Minutes of Religion, when her highest, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest exercise is to Embrace those that differ from us in sinless practises. For I cannot yet understand, what Interest Evangelical Love has to reduce us to an uniformity in Rites, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; And do know that Protestants who differ in the lesser points of Religion, as to principle, and practise, do yet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a more entire and cordial love amongst themselves, then the Papists who are cudgelled by the Iron rod of the Inquisition into a precise Indentity, in their little fopperies.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>That the things now scrupled in this Church are such as were heretofore submitted to, by the most Leading-men of those that now depart from it:</hi> To which I shall very briefly return these few particulars. 1. That the Non-conformists are <hi>not led by Men,</hi> further then as they have Authority in the Name of Christ to Lead them. The Leaders or Pastors disclaim all other conduct, then by Gospel direction; their power is Ministerial, not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotical, And their people disclaim <hi>all such Leaders,</hi> as would Lord it over their faith, and take away the Judgment of Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over their own Acts. It's a very uncomely fight to behold a Drove of Rational Creatures with their Consciences Tayled to one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e horse, and so conducted to <hi>a Faire,</hi> there to he sold for <hi>peace, and Expediency.</hi> 2. With equal Reason the Dissenters will plead, That the worship which they now use, is the very same that was lately used, and practised by some of the most Leading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Amongst the Conformists; And is it not a wonder that whether men go backwards or forwards, yet both shall form an Argument for Conformity. If they have <hi>sometimes been Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,</hi> and are now reclaimed, that shall conclude for Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, because they must be supposed to have their eyes Anointed with some excellent <hi>Collyrium,</hi> and to see better; If they were once Conformists, and become at last Dissenters, yet that will conclude full as well for Conformity, because they once saw better: such shuffling arguments would with equal Truth serve the occasions of the Dissenters too. Many of the <hi>Conformists</hi> were once <hi>Non conformists,</hi> and therefore we are no worse now, then they were then; and Many of the Non-conformists were once Conformists, and therefore having tryed the difference are more competent Judges which way of worship is nearest the Rule. And though both these ways of Reasoning are none of the best, yet if there be any Advantage, the latter carries it: because there can be no such Arguments from <hi>worldly Interest</hi> the <hi>one way,</hi> which
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52034:101"/>
may possibly have a stroke <hi>the of other;</hi> few are Ambitious to be <hi>starved,</hi> and as few that are so irreconciliable to preferments. 3. Not former Apprehensions, but present Light into the mind of God from his word, ought to be our Immediate, and next Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in our worship of him: Men may change, as times and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Accidents change, but the Rule of Religion is <hi>unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and abides for ever.</hi>

               <p>Before we can possibly know, whether. <hi>A better way may be found out,</hi> we must first be Agreed <hi>what is a Good way.</hi> Now <hi>All Goodness</hi> Consists in the <hi>due Conformity</hi> of a thing to it's <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Idaea</hi> by which it ought to be measured; and it's <hi>fitness</hi> to reach that <hi>end</hi> to which it is <hi>a Means:</hi> And therefore <hi>the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness</hi> of Any thing must be judged of by it's <hi>nearer Approach</hi> to that Rule, and it's <hi>greater proportionableness</hi> to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it's design: If then we could find out <hi>A worship</hi> more Agreable to <hi>the Rule of worship,</hi> or a Constitution more apt to reach <hi>the great intendments of Holiness and Peace,</hi> such a worship, such a Constitution will justify it self to be <hi>a better,</hi> then any of it's Competitors which shall Deviate from that Rule, or more uncertainly attain the Desired End.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) The first part of our task then will be to find out <hi>our Rule,</hi> which when we have done, we have nothing remaining but to apply that Rule to those Models which we would erect, or having erected, we would examine their Regularity. And as they shall be found to approach nearer, or depart farther from that Rule, we may Confidently pronounce they are therefore by so much <hi>The better, or the worse.</hi> Now the <hi>only Rule</hi> of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52034:105"/>
in our judgment, <hi>is the Infallible word of God:</hi> which we therefore judge sufficient and adaequat, because they give this Testimony to their own Perfection: And seeing we have now to do with those who own the Scriptures to assert <hi>nothing but Truth,</hi> it will be evidence enough that they are <hi>such a Rule</hi> if they do but <hi>Assert</hi> that they are so.</p>
               <p>It is indeed no new thing to hear them charged as <hi>Lame and defective,</hi> such as must be pieced and eked out either with Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>Revelations,</hi> or Humane <hi>Traditions,</hi> to render them a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect standard of our Faith, and acceptable obedience. To which we only oppose the Testimony of the Apostle, 2. Tim. 3. 16. 17. <hi>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for Doctrine, for reproof, for Correction, for instruction in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thorowly furnisht unto all good works.</hi> Concerning which sacred Rule, I will use our Authors Confidence with (I think) better warrant; <hi>That they who find fault with this Rule will never be able to find out, or Agree upon a Better;</hi> whereof the Endless mazes, the perplexed labyrinths into which they have cast themselves, who despising, and forsaking this only <hi>Canon,</hi> have delighted to find out by-paths, is very clear, but very sad demonstration; for when they have tryed <hi>Traditions,</hi> or gaped for <hi>revelations,</hi> or depended on the <hi>Churches</hi> Authortiy, and yet found no satisfaction, they think to secure themselves, and gratify theMagistrate with <hi>a New power</hi> who has already such bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens upon his shoulders, that we have more need incessantly to sollicite the throne of grace on his behalf for wisdom, Counsel, strength to manage, and bear them, then fondly to think to do him a kindness, by Imposing upon him a greater work which all others are weary of.</p>
               <p>But this one Text which I have mention'd, may abundantly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy us that there can be nothing requisite to equise, and furnish out A <hi>Christian,</hi> A <hi>Minister,</hi> A <hi>Church</hi> for Duty, and obedience, but what is summarily therein ascribed to the written word.</p>
               <p>§. 1. That the Scriptures are of unquestionable Authority to Determine all those Controversies whereof they haveCognizance; because they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>divinely inspired,</hi> which no person, no Church, no Convention of men, can with any Colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text affirm of their Dictates, Canons, Decretals, or Constitutions: And that amongst many other Reasons, because they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited in heat, or passion; were not Contrived to advance one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or to depress, and crush another, but were the Result of infinite wisdom, impartially respecting Truth, fuithfully acquaniting us with the mind, and will ofGod, without Adhering to any faction.</p>
               <p>§. 2. That there can be no concern of any Church, or Officer in the Church, or member of theChurch, but the Scripture speaks fully to it. As, 1. If a Church will approve her self to be <hi>the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Truth,</hi> and expose to all her Members the Doctrine of the Gospel, the Scripture is, <gap reason="foreign">

is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It Lays down <hi>the Truth,</hi> and thereby discovers errour, heresy, false doctrine, all Corruption, in worship, and manner; It gives us what is <hi>straight,</hi> and thereby enables us to judge what is <hi>Crooked;</hi> or 3. Are there <hi>any Tares sprung up</hi> in the field of the Church, <hi>sowen by the Enemy whilst Men Slept,</hi> (and men will sleep) it is profitable also <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, No paedagogy, no Constitution, no discipline to be compared with it.</p>
               <p>§. 3. That it is a Rule which must direct <hi>All the builders</hi> in Gods house in whatsoever Quality, under whatsoever character they appear; It's <hi>profitable</hi> for the <hi>Man of God,</hi> And indeed it only becomes <hi>The Man of sin,</hi> he that is the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§. 4. The <hi>Absolute profection, and compleatness of this Rule is</hi> also Asserted: <hi>It's able to make the Man of God perfect, throwly furnish to all good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this Perfection of the Scripture <hi>as a Rule:</hi> it is always supposed, that every one in his private, or more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick capacity be Able to <hi>use,</hi> and <hi>Apply the Rule.</hi> As the square, or Rule of the <hi>Architect,</hi> however exact in it self, yet presupposes him to have <hi>eyes to see,</hi> and <hi>brains to Apply</hi> it to his work; so the Scripture <hi>as a Law</hi> teaches Duty, and whatever of well-pleasing obedience we can perform to God, yet supposes us at least to be <hi>RationalCreatures,</hi> that can apply <hi>that Law</hi> to our own particular Actions. Whence these two things must necessarily follow. 1. That it was not only <hi>Needless,</hi> but <hi>Impossible,</hi> that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture should enumerate, or determine upon the <hi>particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Circumstances,</hi> of <hi>general time, place, person, when, where, who</hi> should worship God, every day, hour, and minute to the End of the world: for so the whole world would not have afforded suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient stowage for Rubricks, <hi>nor have been able to contain the volumns that must have been written:</hi> for as the End, and use of a Rule is not to each the Artificer <hi>when</hi> he shall begin to work, but <hi>how</hi> he may do it like a Workman, whenever he begins; so neither was the Scripture design'd for <hi>a clock</hi> to tell us at <hi>what hour</hi> of the day we should commence the publick service of God, but that when ever we begin, or end, we manage all <hi>according to this Rule.</hi> 2. That when the Scripture has prescribed us all <hi>the parts of worship,</hi> instituted <hi>the Administrators</hi> of worship, given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>les how to <hi>separate them to that Office,</hi> and laid down general rules for the Regulating those Natural circumstances, which could not particularly be determin'd, as that they be done to <hi>Edification, decently and in order;</hi> And has withal commanded
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52034:106"/>
us to attend to this Rule, and no other, it has then Discharged <hi>the Office of a Rule,</hi> and as <hi>a Rule is Compleat and perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) Besides our Retrospect to our Rule, we must also look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>the End, and Design of all Riligion,</hi> and when that is once well fixt, we shall have Another great Advantage to judge what worship is <hi>Better,</hi> and what <hi>is worse;</hi> Now the great End of all Religion, and specially of Religious worship is <hi>the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of God, the pleasing of God;</hi> And therefore whatever shall pretend to that Glorious Title, and Dignity of being <hi>an Act of Religion, a part of Religion,</hi> and yet has no real Tendency to the Advancement of his Glory, (which it can never have without a due regard to the Rule) ought to be Expunged out of the Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue of Lawful Acts, or parts of worship; And is so much the more abominable both to God, and Man: To <hi>God;</hi> because it offers him a Sacrifice not subservient to his Praise; and to <hi>Man;</hi> because it deludes him with a pretence of recommending his person, and service to God, and yet leaves and exposes both to Gods abhorrence.</p>
               <p>From what hath been said, I might plead my self Competently qualified to gratify the Importunity of the <hi>Enquirer;</hi> and answer the Question, whether <hi>A Better frame of things might not possibly have been found out?</hi> If whatsoever <hi>Agrees</hi> with the Rule is <hi>good,</hi> then what is <hi>discrepant</hi> from the Rule is <hi>Evil;</hi> If what makes <hi>a nearer approach</hi> to the Rule is <hi>better,</hi> then what <hi>departs further</hi> of, is <hi>worse;</hi> but I look upon these kind of Questions as a <hi>vapour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party</hi> sent out to draw the unwary, within the Clutches of an Ambuscado.</p>
               <p>Whatever Constitution shall impeach the only true Rule of <hi>shortness and deficiency,</hi> is less good then that which implies <hi>no such shortness or deficiency;</hi> But there are some Constitutions on the world, which impeach the only true Rule of shortness and deficiency, and Therefore they are less good then those which impeach not the Rule of such Deficiency, whatever Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made, supposed useful for decency, which are not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the Rule, do impeach that Rule of Deficiency; but there are some Constitutions made, supposed useful for decency, which are not comprehended under the Rule; and therefore there are some Constitutions which impeach the Rule of De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ncy. Whatever is Comprehended under a Rule, must at least be necessary <hi>by way of Disjunction;</hi> but there are some Constitutions in the World which are <hi>not Necessary,</hi> so much as <hi>by way of Disjunction;</hi> therefore they are not Comprehended under the Rule. There is not the <hi>smallest or most minute Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> which can cleave to any Religious Act, or wherewith we can Lawfully cloath Gods Worship, but it is by the Command of Christ made necessary at least <hi>disjunctively.</hi> But there are some Constitutions which are not made necessary <hi>disjunctively,</hi> and therefore they are such as wherewith we cannot Lawfully cloath Religion, or the Worship of God. We are Commanded by Christ to <hi>Baptise;</hi> now though it was not possible that it should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52034:106"/>
                  <hi>how often,</hi> in <hi>what places,</hi> at <hi>what houres,</hi> with <hi>what Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of persons</hi> the Ordinance should be administred in Every Age and Country from its first institution, to the End of the World; yet its' determin'd that they to whom of right it belongs to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise at one hour or other, in one place or other, and so time and place are Determined <hi>by way of disjunction:</hi> but there are some things which 'tis not necessary to do, <hi>the one or the other</hi> to the Compleat fulfilling, and decent performance of the precept, and therefore are not commanded by way of disjunction.</p>
               <p>It would therefore be no such difficult labour to find out a better way, for all the difficulty would lye in reforming Abuses, removing Corruptions, and reducing Christs Ordinances to their primitive institutions: <q>Hoc enim adversus omnes haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses valet: Id esse verum quodcunque Prius: id esse adulterum, quodcunque posterius. </q>
                  <hi>This is</hi> (saith Tertullian)  <hi>the great Mawle of all heresies,</hi> (and I will add, against all Corruptions) <hi>that whatsoever was first is True, whatsoever was introduced af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, is a Corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though perhaps, the Dissenters may possibly <hi>find out what is Better,</hi> yet they will never <hi>Agree amongst themselves;</hi> which is an old Politick put-off for Reformation: The Levity of which Objection is easily discovered for.</p>
               <p>§. 1. We are all Agreed, that the Scriptures are <hi>the only Rule of worship,</hi> and they that are thus far Agreed are in a fair way towards <hi>perfect unity</hi> so far as 'tis attainable in this <hi>state of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection:</hi> for though they may miss in the <hi>Application,</hi> through the weakness of their judgment; yet being secure that their <hi>Rule is good,</hi> and sincerely endeavouring to come up to it, and reform by it, they cannot be <hi>fatally wide,</hi> nor <hi>mortally differ:</hi> All that are <hi>Agreed in their rule,</hi> have this singular Advantage, that they can debate their differences amicably upon common principles, whereas they who <hi>differ in the Rule</hi> must needs differ in all the Rest; they that divide in <hi>the Center,</hi> must needs divide infinitely in their motions towards <hi>the Circumference,</hi> and they that differ in <hi>the foundation,</hi> must necessarily disagree in <hi>the superstructures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. All that Agree in the Rule have <hi>prepared minds</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to Cassier, whatever they shall once discover to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant to that Rule: and will easily part with any mistake as it shall be made out to them; whereas they who set up false Rules of worship, and yet suppose them to be true, are as tenacious of whatever they find suitable to those erroneous Measures they have taken, as if they were the most sacred Concerns of Religion.</p>
               <p>§. 3. They that own the same perfect, and infallible Rule, are thereby kept within such bounds of sound judgment, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable obedience, and Christian Moderation, that they can maintain Communion with each other, and both of them with the same <hi>one God, one Lord, one Spirit,</hi> in the Ordinances of the Gospel, though still differing in lesser matters: whereas they

who set up new Rules of worship; exclude all others from their Communion, but such as submit to their <hi>Novel Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> and Constitutions, imposed as the Terms of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>§. 4. They who embrace the word of God for their Rule, do keep alive the fire of Evangelical Love towards each other, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the little diversities that are found amongst them; when they who advance their own Pleasures for the Rule. and Reason of obedience, are engaged in a Zealous persecution of all those who comply not with their Concepts, as is Evident in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day. It will be delightful no doubt to the Reader, to be Refresht with the <hi>Enquirers</hi> Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, who has been tyred with my duller discourse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall gratify him with his Reasonings.</p>

If there must be some determination of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials, it must be made either by God or man;</hi> 4.

               <p>§. 1. If <hi>a Church cannot be conserved without some Rites,</hi> then let the Imposed Terms of Communion be only of such Rites, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which <hi>the Church cannot be conserved,</hi> and we will contend no longer: If <hi>any Rite</hi> be so necessary to the being of a Church, that its Constitution must moulder away into dust, without it, we are content <hi>that Rule</hi> be made a Term of Communion:</p>
               <p>§. 2. From hence then it will evidently appear that <hi>mystical Ceremonies,</hi> such as the <hi>cross in Baptism, the Surplice,</hi> ought not to be imposed as <hi>the Terms of Communion,</hi> because that <hi>without
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52034:107"/>
such Rites</hi> of humane appointment, the Society of the Church may be conserved: I would fain know how the Church was <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served</hi> in the Early, purer times of Christ, and his Apostles? They had not recourse to the <hi>Ladies Closet open'd,</hi> They understood nothing of the Modern curious Arts of <hi>Conserving, candying,</hi> and <hi>preserving</hi> Religion in Ceremonious <hi>Syrrups;</hi> and yet Religion kept sweet, and Good. They were some of his Holinesses <hi>Ladies of Honour</hi> that first taught the World, out of a miraculous good will, and tender pitty to the Church, to <hi>conserve</hi> the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Christs institution, in <hi>five more</hi> of their own invention: because our Saviour had not prescribed enow to <hi>Conserve the Church from Dissolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. This seems to be a little too high preferment for humane Ceremonies, to make them <hi>Conserving Causes</hi> of the Church; At Rome they have proved <hi>Defiling</hi> Causes; in other places <hi>Causes of Offence, scandal, and Division;</hi> they have <hi>burdened</hi> some, and <hi>debauched</hi> others, and <hi>Raised persecution</hi> against the rest: but they were never yet <hi>Conservators</hi> of the Churches purity, or peace; surely the parts of a Church are very sorrily put together, that has no other Cement, to unite them; and the frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture there of exceeding brittle, that must dissolve upon the Removeal of a Ceremony.</p>

               <p>There are three Considerations of Time which may deserve our thoughts in this Case.</p>

                  </gap>e conveniences, and inconveniences of determining this way or the other, are the most competent Judges in this Case: Suppose the Question were, whether we ought to meet together for publick worship at nine, or ten of the clock? what could <hi>a convocation</hi> say to this? or what <hi>general Law</hi> could be made for all the particular Churches in a thousand miles Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit?

               <p>Suppose, nevertheless, that some will needs Determine this affaire; That all Churches under whatsoever Circumstances, expedient, or inexpedient, right, or wrong, with all their particular members, shall upon pain of excommuniation assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for publick worship, strictly at <hi>nine of the clock,</hi> upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of uniformity, and that all may unite and associate their devotions, as it were at once beleaguering heaven, and wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for a blessing; I cannot but think what distractions, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions it would raise in mens hearts, and consciences; what squab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, what quarrels it would create in the viceinage; For my neighbours Dyal, I observe, goes a full quarter of an hour before mine, and he sets his clock by his own Dyal; and then rises in the Morning by his own clock: If for no other Reason, yet because he can hear his <hi>clock</hi> strike, better then his <hi>Dyal,</hi> so that here's an endless controversy like to arise between us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his clock, or mine shall deserve <hi>Excommunication;</hi> Now to part or prevent this fray, there is a certain <hi>infallible Officer</hi> erected, called a <hi>Sexton,</hi> or <hi>Sacristan,</hi> one that will take his cath, his Clock goes true, whatever Sir, Sun says to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and he shall decide this Brawle, when he <hi>chimes all-in;</hi> so that in the upshot, this great Question, the Church troubles her self with, must be resolved into this <hi>Momentous Canon.</hi> That all Churches shall begin their publick Worship, when my <hi>Goffe whatchicallum</hi> pleases. And thus much for the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Time.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>Place.</hi> This is indeed <hi>a Circumstance,</hi> and considered <hi>in general,</hi> an inseparable Circumstance of <hi>a Body;</hi> so that it haunts us wherever we go like <hi>a familiar,</hi> and pursues us more earnestly then <hi>our shodow;</hi> and therefore as to publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship there must be some Determination of <hi>Common place,</hi> where a Church shall assemble for the ordinary worship of God. But if place be consider'd <hi>as Riligious,</hi> that is, as <hi>such a place,</hi> as renders the worship <hi>more acceptable to God,</hi> we say, It's not in the power of Man to Determine of any such Religious, or holy place, because he can make none so.</p>
               <p>And yet though he cannot determine the place <hi>as Religious,</hi> he may determine it as <hi>convenient,</hi> and perhaps <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> And besides, since the Magistrate is concern'd to keep an eye upon <hi>all assemblies</hi> whatsoever, that <hi>the publick peace</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted directly to his charge, may be preserved, and not viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>seditious Meetings,</hi> he may therefore command all the Churches under his jurisdiction to convene in such open places where his Officers may come, and make inspection into their demeanours, and behaviours, and the Churches are bound in order to this end, to submit to his determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in Conscience to God: for if the Place (or time) be <hi>inconvenient,</hi> yet that's only some prejudice to <hi>the worshippers,</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:52034:110"/>
but <hi>no pollution of the worship it self;</hi> and the primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans no doubt would chearfully, and thankfully have struggled with many incommodities, provided the freedom of worship at <hi>any time or place</hi> might be secured to them.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>more open</hi> places will certainly expose them to ruine, they may Lawfully keep their foot out of the snare; for as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Hales</hi> says well. <hi>In times of Manifest corruption, wherein Religious assembling is dangerous: Private Meetings however besides publick order, are not only Lawful, but of necessity and duty, else how shall we excuse the Meetings of our selves in Q. Maries days?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) For <hi>Persons:</hi> they also will fall under the same distinction. The Circumstance of the Person <hi>in general,</hi> as whether his Name be <hi>N.</hi> or <hi>M.</hi> is of little, or no consideration in the case; but for persons <hi>in special,</hi> as marked out for publick service, that is very material. And we affirm that Christ has already deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon that point; The Qualification, calling, setting apart of such a one to his Office, with the Nature and end of his Office, together with his whole emploiment, work and duty towards the Church, are all determined, and none has power that I know of to dispense with those determinations. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials out of which a Church is to be formed, the ends of that embodying, by what bonds and ligaments they are united, the duty of Pastors, Teachers, and all Church Governours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, by what Laws they shall govern, and how far the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are to give obedience, are all so far limited, that the Church has nothing to do but to submit to the Commands of her Lord, and if she be a true Spouse of Christ, she will submit exercising all prudence in applying general Rules to particular persons, and emergent cases.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) But his last word [And the like] will do him more service, and us more mischief then all the rest: for how to bring in <hi>the Cross, Surplice, and other Mystical, Symbolical Ceremonies,</hi> under <hi>time, place, or person,</hi> was very difficult; but this <hi>Et catera</hi> [And the like] will do the feat; and at this back-dore thousands of Ceremonies, such as Holy Oyl, Spittle, Cream, Salt, Epha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's, <hi>and the like,</hi> may be introduced. But what now if <hi>these Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> be not <hi>The Like,</hi> but <hi>other-like?</hi> why, then is all this pompous discourse blown up! A <hi>moral Circumstance</hi> is not <hi>the like</hi> with <hi>a Natural;</hi> That which adds neither <hi>moral good, nor evil</hi> to the worship, is not <hi>the like,</hi> with one that does so: That which is Commanded <hi>with the duty,</hi> is not <hi>the like</hi> with that which is <hi>not so.</hi> That without which the Worship <hi>cannot</hi> be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, is not <hi>the like,</hi> with that which is <hi>not requisite</hi> to its performance. I conclude therefore, that <hi>And the like</hi> conceals some mysterious point from us, which 'tis not as yet convenient to discover to us; And keeping a wary Eye upon it, let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to his third assertion.</p>
               <p n="3">[3] <hi>If there must</hi> (says he) <hi>be some determination in Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, it must be made either by God, or man:</hi> very true! If it must

               </p>
               <p>God has determined <hi>in general</hi> that we worship him, and has prescribed all the ordinances by which we ought to worship him, and therefore we must come to a determination <hi>when, and where</hi> we will worship him: He has determined more specially that the Churches worship him solemnly upon <hi>his own day,</hi> and the Churches must come to a fixed resolution, when they will <hi>begin</hi> that worship: he has determin'd we shall <hi>Baptise with water,</hi> and therefore if we will execute that Command, we must use <hi>some water or other:</hi> but he has not determined that we shall <hi>make any Figure,</hi> either of <hi>Triangle, square, cross, or Circle,</hi> and therefore none can determine <hi>in particular</hi> where God has not determined <hi>in the general:</hi> He has determin'd that I must worship him <hi>decently,</hi> and therefore that I worship him in <hi>some garments,</hi> for Nakedness is contrary to <hi>Natural Decency;</hi> but he has not Commanded me <hi>in general,</hi> that I worship him in <hi>holy garments,</hi> and therefore none can determine <hi>holy garments</hi> in worship. Again, he has determined <hi>the Officers</hi> of the Church, and wherefore such and such persons, duely qualified according to his rules, must be chosen to execute the Offices; but he has not empowred the Church to Erect <hi>new Officers,</hi> and <hi>new Offices,</hi> and therefore such an attempt is beyond the Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
               <p>But now (says he) <hi>God has made no such determination.</hi> Ay! but we say, and must say it a hundred times over, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary be a hundred times asserted without proof, That God has already determined all Religious Circumstances, which we call Ceremonies, all Ordinances of worship to exhibite, seal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey any Spiritual mercy, or supernatural grace: and for those natural Circumstances which attend all Actions whether sacred or civil, they must be agreed on before such actions can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a Community; And if this be the game he flies at, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it he stoops to a very mean Quarrie.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As time, <hi>in General,</hi> is a Circumstance <hi>concreated</hi> with every <hi>Humane Action,</hi> so with <hi>every command, and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to duty, there is a <hi>Concreated Command,</hi> and <hi>obligation</hi> to determine of <hi>some time,</hi> wherein to <hi>discharge that duty.</hi> And hence it must unavoidably follow, That <hi>to whomsoever</hi> God has <hi>immediately and directly given a Command to worship his Great and holy Name,</hi> to them he has <hi>immediately and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,</hi> at the same time, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> given a <hi>Concurrent Command,</hi> to <hi>determine of all those circumstances</hi> which are necessary to the executing of that Command. Thus if God has obliged every Individual person <hi>to Pray,</hi> he has <hi>therewith</hi> commanded him to <hi>single cut, and set apart some time</hi> wherein to put up his supplications to God. Thus also, If God has <hi>directly, and immediately</hi> Commanded <hi>every particular Church</hi> to worship him jointly and publickly, he has also by virtue of that Command enjoyn'd them to agree upon a time to celebrate and solemnize that worship; Now this Command is so straightly bound upon the Consciences of all Churches, that though <hi>none should determine for them,</hi> nay though <hi>all should Determine against</hi> them, yet are they under it's authority, and must come to an issue about it, unless they will draw the guilt of the neglect of worshipping God upon their souls, with that wrath which is due to so great contempt of the Divine Law.</p>
               <p>Now that every particular Church has a direct Command to worship God, and by consequence to determine of those circumstances which are necessary to the worship, is evident from this one Consideration, that <hi>they all did so in obedience to the authority of Christ in his word,</hi> whilst all <hi>Civil Governours</hi> were so far from <hi>Determining the Circumstances,</hi> that they <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined against the substance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gracious God has now made some of the Kings of the earth <hi>Nursing-fathers to his Churches,</hi> but yet we cannot believe, that the Churches power is less under her <hi>Fathers;</hi> then it was o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>der those <hi>Bloody Persecutors:</hi> And if this power be lodged in the Civil Magistrate, and he have no rule to Direct him about the <hi>when, and where,</hi> what a miserable case would the Churches be in, if he should <hi>never determine</hi> these Circumstances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Churches can <hi>never worship</hi> God: For thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds his Argument. <hi>No publick worship can be Performed without the Determination of some Circumstances</hi> (as time for one, and place for another) But <hi>God has determined none of these Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,</hi> therefore unless some other Determination be made, besides what God has made, no publick worship can be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Again, If <hi>some other determination</hi> must be made besides what <hi>God has made, then</hi> it must be made <hi>by man,</hi> but some other determination must be made besides what God hath made, therefore it must be made by man: Again, If a determination of circumstantials must be made <hi>by Man,</hi> then by the <hi>Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:52034:112"/>
But a determination must be made by man, therefore by the Civil Magistrate, from whence it will be easy to Argue: That if a Magistrate <hi>will not determine</hi> of those circumstances which are necessary to the publick Worship of God, there can be no publick worship; but when the Magistrate is an enemy to the Christian Religion, he will never determine of those cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances which are necessary to the publick Worship of God, Therefore when the Magistrate proves an enemy to the Christian Religion, there can be no publick Worship of God: Nay <hi>there ought to be none:</hi> And it will hold against <hi>the Protestants worship</hi> where the Magistrate is <hi>a severe Romanist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now though it be true that the Command to Worship God publickly, be directly and immediately given to the Church, yet seeing every Church is <hi>in the Commonwealth</hi> as a part of it, and that every soul therein ought to be <hi>subject to the higher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,</hi> and because the peace of a Nation is not a little concern'd in the prudent or disorderly management of publick assemblies, and seeing that the chief Magistrate is the Vicegerent, and great Minister of God to preserve the peace, that this lower world may not be too like a Hell, therefore has he a very great concern herein. <hi>Ne quid Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That where <hi>no private person</hi> might determine of such a Circumstance in his personal devotions, nor <hi>a particular Church</hi> hath any power to determine for themselves in their publick worship, there it seems the Magistrates power reaches not, because he might then make that a persons, or a Churches duty <hi>by his Authority,</hi> which <hi>without his Command</hi> had been their sin:</p>
               <p n="1">1 If then the Question be; who is fittest to determine those Circumstances which are Necessarily to be determined? the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is ready; They are fittest to determine <hi>to whom the Command is Directly given,</hi> and who must answer it to God, if for want of such Determination the Worship of God be laid aside, and neglected.</p>

               <p n="3">3. If the Question were once more moved: what if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate should forbid a Church to Worship God at all?

                  <hi>When the Athenians consulted Apollo, what forms of Religion chiefly they should embrace: The Grave Oracle answers, Those which had the Authority of their Ancestors Custom, and usage.</hi> But here the <hi>Embassadors</hi> cross't him, and told his worship; <q>Morem Majorum saepe esse mutatum:</q>
                  <hi>The Custom of their Ancestors had been often changed.</hi> Alas they had reform'd, and reform'd again, and again, over and over, and could arrive at no settlement for want of <hi>a Rule,</hi> and therefore they demand:, Quem morem potis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simùm sequerentur è variis? <hi>Which of all those various Customs and Rites they should observe?</hi> The Devil, who is never wholy at a loss for an Answer, gave them this: <hi>Optimum! pray pick out the best you can find:</hi> though <hi>never a barrel had better herrings.</hi> But to his Reason I say.</p>

               <p>To illustrate this, I shall use a very familiar Instance; I will suppose a standing <hi>General Law</hi> in a Nation, That <hi>no person (except the Legislatour) shall add to the Laws of the Land.</hi> I will suppose also a <hi>particular Law</hi> promulgated by the Legislatour: That <hi>every subject shall sweep his dore once a week with a Beesom:</hi> Now to sweep my dore with a Beesom of <hi>Birch, or Broom,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly be <hi>any Addition</hi> to that Law, because 'tis <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required</hi> to the putting of the Law in practise, that I do it with the <hi>one, or the other,</hi> and therefore they are both compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <hi>virtually</hi> in the Law by way of <hi>dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>unction,</hi> that is either with <hi>this, or that, or some other.</hi> Again, to sweep my dore on the third day of the week, and at the ninth hour of the day, can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> no Addition to the Law, because I am commanded to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, upon <hi>some day in the week, and at some hour of the day,</hi> and the Law not having defined the precise day and hour, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to the Lawgiver, which I chuse, but <hi>one or other I must chuse,</hi> unless I will obstinately disobey the Law.</p>
               <p>But now, If I will not only sweep my dore, but over-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously will needs make <hi>a Cross</hi> over it, this is an Addition to the Law, being neither Compehended under the Command of sweeping, nor necessarily required to the reducing the Law into Act.</p>
               <p>Let us suppose yet further, that the <hi>Mayor</hi> of some of our <hi>Enquirers Petty corporations,</hi> with the Advise of his Brethren, shall put forth an Order or Edict, that Non-obstant the Law <hi>De non Addend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> every person within the limits of that Burrough shall be obliged to <hi>Cross,</hi> as well as sweep his dore, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he will Cross it, he shall not sweep, and that every man shall subscribe to this Order and Edict, and whosoever shall contravene the same, shall be disfranchised; This must needs be interpreted an Addition to the Law with a witness; A most express and daring violation of it.</p>
               <p>But now to mend the matter, we will suppose the <hi>Mayor</hi> with his Brethren shall solemnly declare, that though they do Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Crossing as well as sweeping, yet they do not here by intend, in any wise to make <hi>any Addition to that or any other Law;</hi> such an Explanatory declaration would be of little Credit among the more Considerate sort of men, as being contrary to the fact.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Mayor</hi> will plead, that though he has added something for the greater solemnity, and decency of the Action, yet he pretends not to make a Law for the Nation, his is only an order of the Court for his own corporation, and therefore he ought not to be charg'd with Adding a Law, to the Systeme of the Laws; But his worship is hugely out, for the General prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52034:114"/>
caution'd him not only against Adding <hi>a Law to the Law,</hi> but against <hi>Adding any thing to the Law:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reader has often observed our Distinction of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral Circumstances.</hi> Now <hi>a Natural Circumstance</hi> is such a one, as arising out of, or adhaering to a <hi>Natural Action,</hi> adds no Goodness nor Evil to the Action: but a <hi>moral Circumstance</hi> is such, as always renders the Action either <hi>better, or worse:</hi> Thus Baptism is neither better nor worse, more, nor less pleasing to God, whether it be administred at <hi>ten a clock, or eleven;</hi> but <hi>every Symbolical Ceremony</hi> must either render the Ordinance to which it is added or with, which it is used, more or less accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Thus the sign of the Cross instituted to signify <hi>a persons dedication to the Lord Christ as his faithful Soldier,</hi> must either add to, or detract from the Moral Goodness of that Institution to which it is annex't, or with which it is used: for either it makes it <hi>better:</hi> As doing the same thing with Baptism. viz. dedicating a person to the service of Christ, seeing a double tye, or obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to any duty seems stronger then a single one, or else it will render it <hi>worse,</hi> because it does that <hi>supertuo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>sly,</hi> which Christs own Ceremony had before done <hi>sufficiently;</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to perform that <hi>ineffectually,</hi> which the institution of Christ had already <hi>effectually performed:</hi> And because it being a part of instituted worship, and yet wanting divine Institution; nor having any track, or footstep in the light of Nature, it seems to <hi>Overdo,</hi> what was <hi>once well done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now since it must either prejudice, or Meliorate the worship, it may be convenient to enquire, whether it may have a <hi>propitious, and benign;</hi> or <hi>a Malignant influence</hi> upon it? And Dissenters are enclined to think <hi>the latter:</hi> All the goodness of Instituted worship depends meerly upon the Authority of the Legislatour, either as he has instituted it, or empowred others to institute it, or promised to accept it from us, and bless it to us: Now (say these Dissenters) Christ has neither instituted this Dedicating Symbol, nor empowred others to institute it, nor promised to accept it at our hands, nor Entailed any blessing upon it, and therefore it must needs render the Worship less good, because itself, (as used) is evil: And whether Christ has <hi>instituted</hi> it, or <hi>warranted others</hi> to do it, or <hi>annext any such promise</hi> to it, they are willing to joyn issue with any of their Brethren who will soberly manage the Debate.</p>
               <p>Some of them I have heard thus Argue: All <hi>worship not-Commanded,</hi> is forbidden;</p>
               <p>But these Ceremonies are <hi>worship not-Commanded;</hi> therefore they are forbidden.</p>
               <p>§. 1. The Major Proposition I thus prove, first from the Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Learned Dr. H. <hi>Hammond,</hi> a great and strenuous Patron of Ceremonies, who in his <hi>Treatise of Superstition, and will-worship</hi> against Master D. C. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>teely owns it. That all <hi>uncommanded worship is forbidden.</hi> Secondly, I prove it by this Reason. They who may institute <hi>New Worship,</hi> may destroy the <hi>old Worship.</hi> For <hi>Cujus
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:52034:115"/>
est instituere, ejus est destituere:</hi> the same Authority that can <hi>make a Law,</hi> can <hi>Repeal a Law;</hi> But no man can destroy <hi>the old worship,</hi> therefore none can institute <hi>new worship.</hi> Lastly, I prove it from the Authority of God, who destroyed Nadab, and Abihu, 10. Lev. 1. and renders this Reason of it, because <hi>they offer'd strange fire before the Lord, which he Commanded them not:</hi> I know it is answered by Master <hi>Booker,</hi> and others, That the strange fire was not only <hi>not-Commanded,</hi> but <hi>forbidden:</hi> To which I reply, suppose that to be true; yet God only insists upon this that it was <hi>not-Commanded:</hi> It is pleaded further, that God was strict, and punctual in his commands to <hi>the Iewish Church;</hi> but he has indulged us a greater Latitude under the Gospel: But the reply is easy: That our Liberty under the Gospel lies not in an exorbitant power to frame <hi>New Ceremouies, or new worship,</hi> but in our discharge from <hi>the ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>itude of the old:</hi> Not that <hi>we may Create more,</hi> but that he has loaded us <hi>with fewer particulars of instituted worship:</hi> It's then very evident: That <hi>all worship not-Commanded is forbidden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. The <hi>Minor</hi> I thus prove: viz. That <hi>Symbolical Core<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are worship not-Commanded.</hi> That which is <hi>a part of worship, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>r</hi> I thus evince, from the <hi>Enquirers</hi> Concession in his <hi>Introduction:</hi> where he reckons it amongst the Glories of the first times of Resormation, That <hi>the Liturgy, and publick Prayers were counted a principal part of Gods worship.</hi> That which is made a part, of a principal part of Gods worship, and yet uncommanded, is a part of Worship not-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but such are the Ceremonies, therefore they are a part of Worship not-Commanded. The former proposition depends upon a known, and received Maxime: <hi>Quod est pars partis est pars <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               <p n="1">(1) His first great assertion is, p. 147. <hi>That Christ uever went about the Composure of Laws, either of Civil, or Ecclesiastical Policy,</hi> We shall not need to concern our selves about Christs <hi>Civil Laws,</hi> seeing he professes <hi>his Kingdom was not of this world.</hi> 'tWas not <hi>a Worldly Kingdom,</hi> administred according to <hi>the Maximes of State,</hi> and <hi>Mysteris of Policy</hi> which had obtained here below; That it should be <hi>Spiritual:</hi> The Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,

Cor. 10. 4. <hi>The Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our warsare are not Carnal, but mighty through God.</hi> v. 5. <hi>And having in readiness to Revenge all disobedience:</hi> It's true also, that when once we have tinctured our brains with false No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Ecclesiastical Policy,</hi> whereof we find no footsteps in Scripture, we shall be ready to affirm as much of those Laws which he has prescribed concerning the Administration of his spiritual Kingdom: but this we think clear. 1. That Christ has instituted as many Laws, as such a Church as he established shall need, And perhaps he was not concerned to write Decretals. Extravagants, Glosses, Canons, Bulls, to fit all the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that the wit of man should afterwards excogitate. 2. He has by Himself, and his Apostles described <hi>all the Officers</hi> which he judged sufficient to conduct his Disciples in wayes of Holy obedience through the temptations of this world to eternal life, 3. He has also instituted <hi>as ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> Ordinances and Sacraments</hi> as may serve to guide and direct them as Christians, and let any one Name one that is wanting to that end, if they be able. 4. From the Nature of those Officers which he hath appointed, the species, Nature, Kind, of his Ecclesiastical Government is abundantly manifested. 5. He has given express charge that <hi>It be not so</hi> with his Officers, as 'tis with <hi>the Kings of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles who exercise Lordship over them,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Nor has he Commissioned any Governours to make any Laws directly for his Church, as a Church, binding the Conscience of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. 7. The Sacraments which he has ordained, the express Rules he has given for Pastors or Bishops, with all other Officers, are evidence sufficient that he has made some Laws of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical nature: and that he has been defective therein, becomes not Christians to Assert.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>The Apostles</hi> (says he, ibid.) <hi>gave certain directions suited to the Conditions of the times and places, and people respectively; but never composed a standing Ritual for all aftertimes: Which will be put beyond all dispute by this one Observation, That several things instituted by the Apostles in the primitive Churches, and given in Command in their sacred writings were intended to be obliging only so long as Circumstances should stand as then they did, and no longer.</hi> Where we have two things that challenge Consideration.</p>
               <p>§ 1. His Doctrine. That <hi>the Apostles game Certain Directions suited to the Conditions of the times, places, and persons respectively, but never composed a standing Ritual:</hi> To which I say, 1. If by <hi>a standing Ritual</hi> he mean a Portuis, a Liturgy, a Mass-book, a Ceremonious Rubric, The Rules of the Pye, or the like, it's very true, and that which the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> do gladly accept the Confession of: but if by <hi>a standing Ritual</hi> he understand fixed Laws, suited to the Condition of the Church in all Ages, under all the various dispensations of Gods providen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That there were indeed <hi>some temporary Ordinances,</hi> such as were to expire with the Reason and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their institution: but then there was also sufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that it was the will of God that they should expire, and cease: such was that Command of <hi>Anointing with Oyl.</hi> 5.

But God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now Broken that seal, withdrawn the concurrence of his power, we need no other evidence that it was only proper for the first planting of Christianity and is now long ago out of date. 2. His one observation comes infinitely short of putting this question out of dispute with any wise man: for what if <hi>several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi> were <hi>temporary,</hi> will it follow that none were <hi>perpetual?</hi> what if some were suited <hi>only to those times,</hi> shall we thence conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de there were not enow suited <hi>to all aftertimes?</hi> There were <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Apostles,</hi> are there therefore no <hi>ordinary Pastors and Teachers?</hi> Or must a Nation be at all this vast charge to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Humane Creatures?</hi> what if <hi>some Rites</hi> were momentany? Are there not <hi>Sacraments,</hi> in the right use where of Christ has promised to be with his Ministers <hi>to the end of the world?</hi> such wherein we are to <hi>shew forth the Lords death till he come?</hi> It's as easy to say all this of <hi>Baptism and the Lords Supper,</hi> that they were calculated only for the Meridian of those days, (and some are not ashamed to say it) as of any other order, or constitution of Christ by his Apostles, whose <hi>temporary nature</hi> is not expressed, or evidently implyed in the <hi>temporary Reason,</hi> upon which it was built. 3. The Epistles of the Apostle to the Corinthians <hi>as a Church,</hi> shews what ought to be the order and Government of every Church: The <hi>occasion of writing</hi> those Epistles might be, and was <hi>peculiar to them,</hi> and so was <hi>the occasion</hi> of writing all the rest, but <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God lays very little stress upon Circumstantials:</hi> That may be true! And <hi>God lays very great stress upon Circumstantials;</hi> That may be as true also! But when He lays <hi>very little,</hi> and when <hi>very great</hi> stress upon them, let others blow the coal for him, he will save his breath for better purposes.</p>
               <p>The Question would receive a very quick dispatch, if we his poor <hi>Plebeian Readers</hi> were worthy to know what he intends by <hi>Circumstantials;</hi> but seeing we are none of his great <hi>Cronies,</hi> and <hi>Confidents</hi> that may be admitted into his Cabinet-Consels, we must be content with the <hi>Andabatarian Feneers,</hi> to Cuff it out blindfolds.</p>
               <p>If he were under any Obligation to use such <hi>Mediums, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> as were proportionable to his conclusion, we might conjecture that by <hi>Circumstantials</hi> he means some <hi>Divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utions:</hi> But seeing he has imposed upon himself no such severe discipline, I know none has that power over him, as to compel him to their Laws of Discourse and Disputation.</p>
               <p>God lays very little stress upon Circumstantials, <hi>undetermined by himself;</hi> but there imposers <hi>lay the main stress;</hi> And God lays very great stress upon Circumstantials <hi>by himself once deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,</hi> but there, (I thank you), our <hi>Enquirer</hi> lays <hi>very little.</hi> And there is Reason enough, and to spare, why God should lay
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52034:118"/>
great weight upon the smallest matters which he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but not half enough why Men should lay such a stress upon their Pleasures, as to venture the Churches Peace upon them, unless it could be made out, that they had <hi>Authority</hi> from God to do it <hi>warrantably,</hi> an <hi>Infallible Spirit,</hi> to do it <hi>exactly,</hi> and <hi>infinite Charity,</hi> to guide that <hi>Authority,</hi> without which, to entrust any Creature with such a Power over Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials, were but to put a sword into it's hand, that would kill some, wound many, and at last Destroy himself.</p>
               <p>It is indeed a Noble Design which he pursues, viz. <hi>To Beget in Men better Notions of God, and better Measures of Religion;</hi> for hetherto Men have sancied God to be very rigid, and severe about <hi>small sins;</hi> but our <hi>Enquirer</hi> will ease the minds of Men of their scrupulosities, and discharge conscience from any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Authority of God in his positive Laws, and institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. A work infinitely grateful, and eternally obliging this prophane, and Atheistical Generation, who had rather keep ten of their own, then one of Gods Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>And with such Sophistry did the Archenemy prevail upon the less wary Minds of our first Parents. <hi>Ye shall not surely dye!</hi> The Command is meerly Positive, <hi>no eternal Reason of evil</hi> in the thing; And <hi>God Lays little, very little stress upon</hi> Circumstantials, <hi>secure but the main,</hi> Let there be <hi>no Schism</hi> between you, and never trouble your selves about these institutions which are but <hi>secunda intentionis;</hi> And he is seconded notably by the <hi>Enquirer;</hi> p. 161. <hi>All Ceremonial Appendages,</hi> (and such were the Trees of Life, and Knowledge, in Paradise: Circumcision, and the Passeover, under the Law; Baptism, and the Lords Supper, under the Gospel) <hi>are perfectly subordinate, and ought to yeeld to the designs of Peace, Charity, and edification.</hi> And yet these poor deluded ones found to their cost, that He who represented God As <hi>a Captious Deity</hi> (as the <hi>Enquirer</hi> with great seriousness words it) proved himself <hi>A Captious Devil,</hi> and that it had been more their Intetest to have Credited Gods most <hi>severe threatnings,</hi> then Satans most <hi>sugred promisos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if it be true, That God lays so very little stress upon his own, we need not Question but Men will lay at least as little upon their institutions; If God be so indifferent, and remiss, we hope we shall not find them rigorous; for seeing <hi>Magistrates</hi> are called <hi>Gods,</hi> such as hear some considerable part of his Image, and borrow of his Authority, they will no doubt represent that God to us, truly as he is, <hi>A God of Mercy, grace and pitty;</hi> and not <hi>watch Advantages against their Creatures;</hi> but <hi>so long as the Main of subjection is provided for, and the substance of their Institutions observed, Alterations may be made in lesser matters without their offence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>the Servant</hi> is sometimes more severe then <hi>the Master,</hi> we are taught from <hi>Gehazie's</hi> sin, and may we never learn it from his Leprosy. 2. Kin: 5. 20, <hi>My Master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, but as the Lord Liveth I will run after him, and take
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52034:118"/>
somewhat of him.</hi> And there was <hi>another Servant</hi> in the parable, who laid a great stress upon <hi>a few Deniers,</hi> when his Lord laid less upon <hi>many Talents;</hi> And would have pluckt out his fellow servants throat for <hi>a sorry Circumstance,</hi> when he had the face to beg Indulgence <hi>in the substance.</hi> And we are sufficiently lesson'd that it's better to address <hi>the Lord himself,</hi> then the <hi>Steward;</hi> ever since the <hi>Syrophenician</hi> met with such churlish treatment from the Disciples, and so gracious a Reception from our <hi>B. Saviour:</hi> such are some of our Church men, who Lye baiting at and worrying of the Magistrate night and day, to exact the rigour of Conformity and the penal Statutes, as if all Religion were utterly lost, unless <hi>their Circumstantials</hi> were preserved, Sacred and inviolable, whatever become of <hi>Gods Circumstantials.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Title of this Chapter Modestly asserts only thus much, that <hi>God lays very little stress upon Circumstantials:</hi> But the continued Tenor of his discourse labours to make it out, that he lays very little upon <hi>some of his own precepts,</hi> the True and clear sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therefore of <hi>Circumstantials</hi> in the Question, would be above half way towards its Answer.</p>
               <p>Under the Mosaical Law God commanded that they should offer to him the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> juge Sacrificium, or the Daily Burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering: and in this case <hi>the Coulour of the Beast,</hi> (provided it was otherwise rightly qualified) was <hi>a meer Circumstance.</hi> Such as God laid no stress upon, and that Man had proved himself an Ardetious, superstitious Busy-body that should curiously adhaere to any one Colour: but for <hi>the Heighfer,</hi> whose ashes were to make <hi>the water of separation,</hi> there the colour was no Circumstance, but made by Gods Command <hi>a substantial part</hi> of the service: To be <hi>Rod,</hi> was as much as to be a <hi>Heighfer;</hi> for when circumstances have once pass't the Royal Assent, and are stampt with a Divine seal, they become substantials in insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worship.</p>
               <p>The Question then ought to have been, whether God have any regard to his own positive Laws; or whether he be so indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent about his own institutions, that he lays little stress upon our obedience to them? But this had been too broad English, a little too uncivil for any that would carry fair correspondence with the Scriptures: and therefore let it be mollified, and stand as it does: Whether <hi>God lay very little stress upon Circumstantials in Religion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In deciding this Question, he had done very ingenuously, and fairly to have told us, from whence we are to take <hi>the measures of that stress, and weight,</hi> which God lays upon these things; which because it was not for his Interest, yet may be much for the Readers, I shall endeavour to clear up these two things, first, from whence we <hi>ought not;</hi> and secondly, from whence <hi>we ought</hi> to fetch these measures.</p>
               <p n="1">[1] From whence we ought not to take the measures of the stress which God lays on them?</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Then we ought not to judge that God has <hi>little regard</hi> to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52034:119"/>
any of his Commands, because <hi>the Matter</hi> of them abstracted <hi>from his Authority, is little;</hi> for we must not conceive that Christ sets little by <hi>Baptism,</hi> because <hi>the Element</hi> is plain <hi>fair water;</hi> or little by that <hi>other Sacrament,</hi> because the Materials thereof are common Bread, and Wine: nor to set them of, must we varnish them with pompous Pageantry, as if any thing were necessary to Buoy up their Repute, or beget an awful Reverence to his Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, besides his Authority, For 1. Though the things <hi>in themselves</hi> be small, yet <hi>his Authority</hi> is great. As God appears great in creating little things, his power conspicuous in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying little instruments to Archieve great effects, so is his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority very glorious in enjoyning small observances: 2. Though the Things be small, yet God can bless them to great purposes. 2. King. 5. 11. Naaman was in a great Huff, that the Prophet should prescribe so plain, and mean a way for his Recovery: he expected some Majestick procedure in the Cure, that the Prophet should <hi>come out, and stand, and call on the Name of the Lord, and strike his hand over the place.</hi> This had been something like! but to send him away ingloriously, with all that train, and bid him <hi>Go wash in Jordan seven times,</hi> was not to be endured by a Person of his ranck. and quality. <hi>Are not Abana, and Pharpar, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Damascus better then the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? And he went away in a Rage!</hi> But we are to judge that to be best, which best reaches the End; <hi>Healing Jordan,</hi> then <hi>ineffectual Pharpar.</hi> 3. If the things be small, then the grace, and mercy conveyed by them, may be had at cheaper rates; And shall it be objected to Gods Ordinances, as their <hi>Reproach,</hi> which is their real <hi>Glory? Baptismal water</hi> may be had a thousand times cheaper, then the Popes <hi>Holy water,</hi> shall that be it's crime, when 'tis a thousand times more useful?</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Nor are we to judge that God lays little stress upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes, because he does not immediately avenge the contempt and neglect of them upon the Violaters. And yet such is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness of Reprieved sinners, that they have formed one of their strongest Arguments for the Continuance of Corruptions in Gods worship, because he breaks not out upon them with present Destructions. 8. Eccles. 11. <hi>Because sentence against an evil work is not speedily executed, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil:</hi> whereas, 1. Such an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would equally conclude that God lays <hi>very little stress</hi> upon Murder, Idolatry, Sacriledg, nay <hi>Schism</hi> itself. 2. God will find a time soon enough to reckon with all those who bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster up themselves in these presumptions, and take an unworthy occasion to be therefore <hi>Bad,</hi> because God is so <hi>Good:</hi> All the threatnings that are upon Record, will certainly find out, and lay hold on the Despisers of his sacred institutions; And who to Accommodate their Doctrines to the Genius of the age, and humour the People with a Religion agreable to their Customs, must remember. 5. Math. 29. <hi>whosoever shall break one of the

               <p n="3">(3) We are not to conceive that God lays <hi>very little stress upon his institutions,</hi> because we see a prophane, and contemptuous generation of men <hi>lay little weight on them,</hi> except it be a Load of Reproach, and contumely: for this were to measure God by the world; as those prophane wretches did. 50. Ps. 21. <hi>These things hast thou done, and I kept silence, and thou thoughtest, that I was altogether such a one as thy self</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As we must not think that God appretiates, whatever men set a high value upon; so neither are we to judge that he disesteems any thing because it's grown out of fashion, and thereby exposed to contempt by the Atheistical wits of Mercenary writers.

That what is <hi>highly esteemed amongst Men, is Abomination in the sight of God.</hi> And on the other side, what is of high account in the sight of God, may be depretiated by men.</p>
               <p>If any of Christs institutions seem necessary to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; it will be first necessary to decry them as poor, low, inconsiderable Circumstantials, and then to fill the peoples heads with a Noice, and din<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="4">(4) Nor may we conclude that God lays little stress on his posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws, because he is ready upon unfeigned repentance to pardon the violation of them, for thus we might conclude also, that he laid <hi>little stress</hi> upon Murder, and Adultery, in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Ps. 18. And <hi>that the prayer of him that turns away his ear from hearing the Law, is an Abomination,</hi> 28. Prov. 9.</p>
               <p n="7">(7) Nor may we gather that God makes little account of a positive precept, because he sometimes sees Reason to indulge the omission of its practise for a season. What weight he laid upon Circumcision is well known, that he threatned excision to the Malechild that was uncircumcised at eight days old: And yet for fourty years in the wilderness the Act of circumcising was suspended: for the Acts of an Affirmative moral praecept may be forborn for some time by our own prudence, and much more and longer by divine warrant, and yet the precept itself all the while stand firm in Gods regard, and in full force, power, strength and virtue to us.</p>
               <p n="8">(8) We are not to conclude that God lays little stress upon an Institution, because he sometimes commands an Act, which were it not for that <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>special Command,</hi> would by virtue of a <hi>General Command,</hi> be a most horrid impiety. Thus God laid a great stress upon <hi>Killing,</hi> much greater upon a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Killing a child;</hi> and yet greater upon <hi>offering Humane Blood in sacrifice:</hi> And yet he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to sacrifice his only Son, and by his Command made that most acceptable, and rewardable service, which otherwise had been most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to the Divine Majesty.</p>
               <p>To borrow, and not to pay again, is one of the Characters of a wicked person. 37. Ps. 21. And yet God by his special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand authorised the Israelites to borrow of the Egyptians <hi>Iewels of silver, and jewels of Gold:</hi> with no intent I am perswaded to repay them either <hi>use or principal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God is the soveraign, and Absolute Legislatour, who may suspend, rescind, alter his own Laws at pleasure, and yet he has said such a stress upon the meanest of them that <hi>no Man</hi> may, nor any man, but <hi>the Man of sin,</hi> dares presume to dispense with them, much less to dispense against them.</p>

(9) Nor are we to think that God lays little stress upon a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, because he little regards those observances, which superstition, folly, Tradition, Custom, have ascribed to it, which were never comprehended in it: yet such is the process of our <hi>Enquirers</hi> Arguments: He instances in <hi>some superstitious Additament</hi> to the Command, which God <hi>never required,</hi> and thence concludes very learnedly that God lays <hi>very little stress upon the Command;</hi> let him therefore have leave to infer; God <hi>laid little weight upon the observation of the Sabbath day,</hi> because the supperstitious Jews were halter'd with an erroneous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they were bound tamely to sit still, and offer their <hi>Naked throats</hi> to their enemies <hi>Naked swords</hi> upon that day, which folly indeed God little regarded.</p>
               <p n="2">[2] Whence then ought we to take the measures of that stress God lays upon his institutions?</p>
               <p n="1">(1) The true measure of that respect which God has for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, is to be taken by us, from <hi>the Authority of God:</hi> If the thing be small, yet we are to regard his authority in it, for this God regards: And therefore he has back't of old both the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and the Moral precepts with this; <hi>I am the Lord;</hi> and the greatest Instances of his Royal Praerogative are given us in those Mandates, which have only his <hi>soveranig pleasure</hi> to recommend them to our observance.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The measure of that regard God has to an institution, is to be taken from <hi>the greatness of that glory which we give him in our obedience.</hi> The great tryal of our sincerity, and subjection to God lies in giving Deference to his will as the Rule, and Reason of our obedience: and then do we recognize his Absolute power to dispose of us when his will, whatever be the <hi>Reason of it,</hi> is <hi>the Reason of our Compliance.</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> gave God the greatest testimony of inward Honour, when he praepared himself to sacrifice his only Son, upon his only Command.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) We may take the measure also of the weight of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from its designed usefulness to his great ends: for seeing, the smallest, and seemingly weakest of his injunctions are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with his blessing upon the Holy, and due use thereof, we are thence to instruct our selves in the weight and worth of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Enquirer</hi> tells us from <hi>Maimonides,</hi> that <hi>there were some things in the Iewish Law, that were</hi> primae intentionis, <hi>such as God required for themselves, as being intrinsically good: others that were</hi> secundae intentionis, <hi>only required for the sake of, and in order to the former:</hi> Now his own judgment herein he acquaints us with, in these words. <hi>The first kind that were essentially good, were absolutely necessary: and could never be otherwise, such we call Moral duties: the latter kind were of so indifferent a Nature, as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> they might not only not have been commanded, but also insome cases having been Commanded, they may not be a duty:</hi> but either he, or his Mr. <hi>Maimonides</hi> are quite out. For. 1. The <hi>Acts</hi> of Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive moral praecepts may in some cases become no duties, the Command it self abiding in it's full force; yet none will say that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52034:121"/>
God lays <hi>little stress</hi> upon <hi>the Acts</hi> of affirmative Moral precepts: Thus the Acts of affirmative positive precepts may become no duty, yet none can say, that God lays little stress upon <hi>the Acts of obedience</hi> to a positive precept. 2. If this wil prove that God lays little stress upon positives, because <hi>they are required only for the sake of, and in order to the former:</hi> Then it will evince that God lays little stress upon <hi>all the means</hi> which he has appointed for his great ends: for the <hi>means, as they are, means</hi> are only valuable for the sake of, and in order to the end.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) What stress God lays upon his positive precepts, we may judge from those severitiis which God has threatned against, and sometimes executed upon the Violaters of them. It was for the violation of a Ceremonial Law: <hi>the eating of the Tree of knowledge of good, and evil,</hi> that God ejected Adam out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise: It was for the neglect of a Ceremonial affirmative Command that the <hi>Lord sought to kill Moses</hi> 4. Ex. 24. And yet he had this to plead, that he was upon a journey, and about Gods Errand. It was matter of meer institution, that was the Israelites security against the Destroying Angel: 12, Exod: viz. The sprinkling the blood of the Paschal Lamb upon the lintle, and posts of the dore: That many do escape Gods vengeance at present, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their not obeying what God has instituted; and insti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§. 1. It follows, That he argues himself a pittiful Sophister who concludes the least Command may be broken, because God turns not men to hell as oft as 'tis broken.</p>

Whosoever shall openly preach this Doctrine, that <hi>God lays little stress upon the Circumstantials of Religion,</hi> has open'd a floodgate to let in a Deluge of prophaness upon the world: for seeing no Command of God <hi>is small,</hi> in respect of the Authority of the Law-giver, which is the formal Reason of our obedience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a Command for <hi>standing;</hi> yet it might be only <hi>pro hâc vice;</hi> whilst <hi>that posture</hi> might <hi>be symbolical</hi> of their hasty departure out of Egypt: and <hi>that sitting</hi> should ever after enure, when providence should allot them more <hi>setled Habitations;</hi> A posture more accommodated to express the fixed condition of the Church in the Promised Land. 4. If God commanded them to eat the Passeover <hi>standing throughout their generations,</hi> without any <hi>exception</hi> in the Canon of the institution, without any <hi>dispensation</hi> from the Institutor himself, then they did most certainly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, were guilty of sin; continued in, lived in, dyed in sin, through all their generations, for <hi>sin is nothing else but a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of a Law;</hi> and then our B.

I shall therefore conclude with more reason thus: Christ ate the Passeover in <hi>a Table-gesture,</hi> therefore God Allowed it, rather then thus, <hi>God forbad sitting,</hi> and yet <hi>Christ sinn'd not,</hi> though <hi>he ate it sitting;</hi>

               <p>From hence I will thus Argue with our <hi>Enquirer:</hi> Either God
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52034:123"/>
commanded the Jews to <hi>stand</hi> at the eating of the Passeover in all ages, or not: If he did so command them, no cunning will excuse them from sin, who ate it <hi>sitting:</hi> If he did <hi>not so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;</hi> Then this instance <hi>comes home to his purpose,</hi> just as his others did: for it can never prove, that God lays <hi>little stress</hi> upon <hi>Commanded Circumstantials,</hi> because he laid so little upon <hi>uncommanded ones.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Positives</hi> may be altered, changed, or Abolished, by the Legislator, when, and how far he pleases; but this will never prove that he lays little stress on them whilst they are <hi>not changed, not Abolished:</hi> Nor will it prove that <hi>Man</hi> may chop, and change, barter, and truck one of Gods least Circumstantials, because the <hi>Law-giver</hi> himself may do it: He that may alter <hi>one,</hi> may for ought I know, alter them all, seeing they all bear the same Image, and Superscription of Divine Authority; and he that has a commission to abolish one, I am confident has as good a Commission to abolish all the rest, which none pretend to but the <hi>Pope, George Fox,</hi> and this <hi>Enquirer.</hi>

               <p>§. 2. His next instance which <hi>comes home to his purpose,</hi> is in David, who <hi>distributed the Priests into Orders for the conveniency of their ministration: and besides that, he institututed Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Musick to be used in the worship of God, without any Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from God that Appears:</hi> But this instance is further <hi>from home</hi> then any of the rest. For. 1. That one word of his <hi>[that Appears]</hi> will destroy his whole Argument: For it was not simply necessary, that it should <hi>Appear to us,</hi> at this distance of time, and under our present dispensation, That every <hi>Prophet,</hi> or <hi>pious Reforming Prince,</hi> had a commission in particular for every Alteration he then made in, or about Gods worship: for seeing we <hi>know</hi> they had <hi>a standing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition upon Record,</hi> not <hi>to Add to, or take from</hi> Gods insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions: it is supposed that they were Armed with such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and received particular instructions from the Divine will, though the wisdom of God saw it not good to exemplify those Commissions, and Instructions; It was enough that when God Authorized any such extraordinary Commissioners to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the concerns of his service, they produced their sealed Letters Patents to that age, and people who were concern'd to obey them, 2. David did <hi>not ordain Priests, and Levites,</hi> he created <hi>no new Order, or Office,</hi> of his own head, and heart, all he did was this: seeing the whole Number of the <hi>Priests</hi> must attend upon the <hi>Sacerdotal,</hi> as the whole Body of the <hi>Levites</hi> upon the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical service,</hi> and yet all could not <hi>at once</hi> engage therein without confusion and distraction, he casts them into <hi>regular Courses,</hi> that in successive Revolutions they might all share in the work and duty, 3. David was an <hi>Eminent Prophet,</hi> who received directions from God in affaires of less moment, and as I cannot easily believe it, that God would call him to an employment without sufficient advise how to manage it, so neither can I conceive that so holy a Person would enterprize any thing of this Nature, without such
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52034:123"/>
advise, when he might so easily have it from God: And that which fully satisfies me herein, and may do as much for another, that is not highly concern'd to quarrel plain Scripture, is this. That when <hi>David</hi> had order'd <hi>the Levites.</hi> 1. Chron. 23. 4. 5. 6. And the <hi>Priests.</hi> Ch. 24, And <hi>the Singers,</hi> Ch 25. And <hi>the Porters.</hi> Ch. 26, And <hi>the Captains and Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That <hi>David gave to</hi> Solomon <hi>his Son, the Pattern of the Porch, and of the houses thereof, and the Pattern of all that he had by the Spirit; Also for</hi> the Courses of the Priests, and Levites, <hi>and for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord:</hi> And v. 19. <hi>All this (said David) the Lord made me understand in writing, by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as <hi>David</hi> had special direction from the Lord thus to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute the <hi>Levites, Priests, Singers, Porters,</hi> for the Conveniency of their ministration: so was he to make <hi>particular Application</hi> to God, for the determination of the most <hi>minute Circumstances:</hi> One would think that if there must be so many Divisions of Priests, Levites, Porters, and Singers, it had been <hi>a most inconfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Circumstance,</hi> which of these divisions should begin the Round, or Circular combination, that they might winck, and chuse; and yet <hi>David</hi> used even in <hi>this punctilio</hi> a great, and solemn Ordinance of God, viz. <hi>The Lot,</hi> wherein the Alseeing, and Alruling God Controuls the Contingency of the voluble Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for when <hi>the Lot is cast into the Lap, the whole disposing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is of the Lord.</hi> 16. Prov. 33. So that the very Porters, and Singers were chosen as solemnly, and with respect to Gods deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, to the order of their Courses, as <hi>Matthias</hi> was chosen to be an Apostle, and preferred to <hi>Barnabas</hi> by the Decision of the true. 4. I will add, that it appears that this Determination of <hi>David</hi> was not made <hi>Iure Regio.</hi> but <hi>Prophetico, &amp; Divino.</hi> Because when that Holy Prince <hi>Iosiah</hi> set about Reformation, he Regulates <hi>the Priests, and Levites</hi> according to the order of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> 2. Chron. 35. 2. <hi>He set the Priests in their Charges—</hi>v. 3. <hi>And he said unto the Levites, prepare your selves by the houses of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers after your Courses—According to</hi> the writing of David, <hi>King of Israel:</hi> Which was that writing, no doubt, which he mentions 1. Chron. 28. 19. By which <hi>God made him understand all those things:</hi> Now I would gladly learn what need this good, and pious Prince had to have recourse to <hi>Davids pattern,</hi> to <hi>Davids writing,</hi> had he been acquainted with our <hi>New Doctrine,</hi> that <hi>God lays very little stress upon Circumstantials in Religion,</hi> and might have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd that small Matter <hi>Iure Regio:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is farther evident, in that Solomon, a Prince of great power, and wisdom, yet was so punctual, and precise in this very thing, to order <hi>the Courses of the Priests, and Levites,</hi> according to Davids Rubric. 2. Chron. 8. 14. <hi>He appointed also according to the Order of David his Father, the Courses of the Priests to their services: and the Levites to their Charges, to praise, and Minister before the Lord, as the Duty of the Day required; for so had</hi> David the Man
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52034:124"/>
of God <hi>commanded.</hi> Where we may observe first, that what David commanded herein, was not <hi>as King,</hi> but as the <hi>Man of God,</hi> a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or one <hi>Commissioned by God</hi> for that service: and secondly, that David could not bind <hi>his Successors,</hi> by any Determination of his own, meerly as a Prince, and therefore their obligation to follow that pattern, did arise from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whereas our <hi>Enquirer</hi> has searcht it seems, but can find <hi>no Commission</hi> for <hi>instrumental Musick.</hi> I have sued out <hi>a Melius Inquirendum,</hi> and he may read it exemplified. 2.

               <p n="6">6. And lastly: supposing <hi>David</hi> had ordered <hi>all these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> of his <hi>own Head,</hi> yet will it not follow, that God lays <hi>little stress</hi> upon either the <hi>omitting</hi> what he has <hi>commanded;</hi> or the <hi>Doing</hi> what he has <hi>prohibited;</hi> seeing he supposes, that the <hi>things ordered,</hi> were neither <hi>Commanded nor prohibited:</hi> All that with Modesty could be drawn from hence, would be no more then this little: That <hi>a meer Circumstance undetermined</hi> by God, and yet <hi>necessary to be Determined,</hi> to the executing <hi>what was determined,</hi> might be determined by a <hi>Prophetical person:</hi> And even for this also He had an express, and punctual warranty from the Lord.</p>
               <p>§. 3. A third instance is from Sacrifices: <hi>which</hi> (says he) <hi>though God had with great solemnity instituted as the means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiating his Divine Majesty towards sinful men, and had with great accuracy prescribed the Laws thereof, yet he puts a great slight upon all of that Nature, as a thing he regarded not in comparison of the substantial points of virtue, and obedience.</hi> We have hence a great help to understand a little of our Authors mind, about those <hi>Circumstantials in Religion,</hi> which he says <hi>God lays so little stress upon.</hi> And <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> the <hi>means of propitiating the Divine Majesty towards sinful man,</hi> are of that Number: And hence we may also satisfy our selves why <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> has <hi>no more stress laid on him</hi> in some mens Divinity; for seeing <hi>He is the Means of propitiating the Divine Majesty toward sinful Man,</hi> he may prove <hi>a Circumstantial in Religion,</hi> and upon the Matter an <hi>insignificant,</hi> or at best but <hi>a significant Ceremony.</hi> But for his Answer I shall say these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a falshood very opprobrious to the great Law-giver of the Church, that he ever <hi>instituted,</hi> and yet <hi>slighted</hi> what he had instituted, whilst it <hi>continued in for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>the Grand Propitiation</hi> had answered all their ends, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God <hi>never slighted Sacrifices,</hi> in <hi>comparison</hi> of virtue and obedience, for to <hi>offer Sacrifices</hi> aright, was <hi>virtue and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> but in <hi>opposition</hi> to sincerity, to <hi>virtue, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:</hi> just as he would have slighted <hi>the most splendid outward Acts</hi> of <hi>virtue, and obedience</hi> without <hi>the Heart,</hi> which is the life, and soul of all. To <hi>give Almes, to pray</hi> were, and are duties of moral virtue, and obedience, and yet when the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees performed both <hi>to be seen of men,</hi> to hunt for popular applause. God not only slights, but abominates them; not <hi>the Acts themselves,</hi> but <hi>the persons</hi> that perform'd them; not what they performed, the <hi>outward work,</hi> but that they kept back <hi>the Heart:</hi> or if the <hi>things</hi> yet not as commanded <hi>in specie:</hi> but as sinfully done <hi>in individu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Sacrifices had a threefold use, 1. <hi>A typical use,</hi> as leading to Christ, and in this respect God was so far from slighting them, that he laid the greatest stress imaginable on them; 2. A <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical use,</hi> to set the Transgressor of the Law right in the Court of Justice, and to satisfy for the temporal punishment. 3. <hi>A moral use</hi> might be accidentally made of them too, they served well to represent some <hi>moral virtue, or duty.</hi> And I will not deny that God might slight this symbolical use of them, 1. Because that use had <hi>no institution,</hi> and we never find that God had any esteem of Symbols that were not of his own appointment, 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no Ceremony, or Symbol, could represent the Moral duty, or virtue to that advantage, which the precept it self, with those encouragements and rewards propounded by God himself, were able to do.</p>
               <p>Yet he will prove from Scripture that <hi>God slighted Sacrifices.</hi> 50. Ps. 8. <hi>I will not reprove thee for thy Sacrifices;</hi> v. 14. <hi>Offer to God the Sacrifice of righteousness, as if he had said, let me have the latter, and I shall not much complain for defect of the former.</hi> This is his gloss, this his proof; wherein I only blame two things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>The falshood</hi> of it: The words may be interpreted as spoken either by way of <hi>concession,</hi> or <hi>commination.</hi> 1. By way of <hi>conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. I will not reprove thee for thy Sacrifices.</hi> q. d. Quantum ad externa Sacrificia satis estis occupati: says a learned Person. I have no cause to rebuke you on that account, for you do your duty, you are very deligent in them: God slights not <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but he requires <hi>a better Sacrifice,</hi> that of <hi>righteousness:</hi> 2. By way of <hi>Commination.</hi> And there is no greater argument of Gods Displeasure then when he threatens to leave a people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproof for their Neglect of duty: Thus. 4. Hos. 17. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols let him alone.</hi> God's not reproving for <hi>omission of a duty,</hi> or commission of a sin, is a sorry Reason that God lays <hi>little stress</hi> either upon <hi>the duty,</hi> or <hi>the sin:</hi> Thus again.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52034:125"/>
14. Acts. 16. God is said to have <hi>suffer'd all Nations to walk in their own ways.</hi> Gods keeping silence at, and non-reproof of sin, when once it shall be interpreted an indulgence of sin, his future rebuke in Thunder, and Lightning shall convince mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Sinners of the folly of their comment upon the Text of Gods forbearance. And this seems the true sense of the place we are upon. For, v. 21. God uses parrallel language; <hi>These things hast thou done, and I kept silence,</hi> but I will <hi>reproove thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) I blame his gloss of <hi>blasphemy:</hi> He puts words in to Gods mouth which are the abhorrence of his soul. <hi>Let me have these latter, and I shall not much complain for defect of the former.</hi> Strange Doctrine this! What? God not Complain for want of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Commands? He told us in the beginning, that God was <hi>not a Captions Deity:</hi> And now he would prove him one: He tells us that God <hi>Instituted Sacrifices with great solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as the means of propitiating his Divine Majesty:</hi> and now he introduces God of another mind: let them use the means, or not for averting his displeasure, God will not much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain:</p>

intent, and meaning thereof; It follows therefore that my Disciples by their fact have not violated the intendment of the Law.</hi> 3. That our Saviour tells them <hi>he will have mercy, and not Sacrifice,</hi> has no difficulty in it, because. 1. <hi>Negatives</hi> are often put for <hi>Comparatives:</hi> I will <hi>have mercy, and not Sacrifice,</hi> is no more then I will have mercy <hi>rather</hi> then Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, when I cannot have them both. There's no Question but if <hi>an Act of Mercy,</hi> and <hi>an Act of instituted worship.</hi> should stand in Competition, all Circumstances concurring: the Act of instituted Worship ought to give place; we will suppose a Congregation assembled for the publick Worship of God, and at the same time a fire breaks out, the Church is not only Allowed, but obliged to omit the publick worship at present, and to employ their endeavours towards the quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fire: And he will render himself somewhat more then rediculous that would infer from hence, that God lays <hi>little stress upon publick Worship:</hi> or that God lays <hi>less stress</hi> upon the Churches Worshipping him in publick, then upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of a House: but only that <hi>the work of mercy</hi> must be <hi>now</hi> performed, or the season is lost <hi>for ever:</hi> whereas the Worship of God may be reassumed. So that all the business is, That <hi>a circumstance of undetermined time is of less weight in Gods Account,</hi> then <hi>an Act of Mercy, or Charity.</hi> 1. Cor. 1. The Apostle tells them: That Christ sent him <hi>not to baptise, but to preach the Gospel:</hi> that is <hi>not so much</hi> to baptise, as to preach: which yet will never inforce, that Christ lays little stress upon the Ordinance of Baptism: our B. Saviour. 4. Luke. 26. acquaints his Disciples. That <hi>he that Hates not Father, and Mother, cannot be his Disciple</hi> And yet it's true too, that he <hi>that Hates his Father or Mother cannot be his Disciple:</hi> But by <hi>hating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> is meant only <hi>less loving;</hi> He <hi>that loves not Father and Mother less then me cannot be my Disciple:</hi> Now let the Reader judge, how absurd it would sound in his ears, to hear such Doctrine: That God lays <hi>very little stress</hi> upon <hi>our filial affection,</hi> and duty to Parents; A Doctrine worth it's weight in gold to such a Jew, that would plead <hi>Carban</hi> against Commandment, and evacuate the precept of God, by his own Traditions.</p>
               <p>And sometimes that duty which God lays <hi>the greater stress</hi> upon, may give place <hi>pro hie, &amp; nunc,</hi> to that which he lays <hi>less weight</hi> upon: a Father commands his Son to discharge such a service, as he is addressing himself to his duty he finds his enemies Oxe, or Asse ready to perish; in this case I conceive the Son ought to suspend the execution of his Fathers command to save the life of a beast: And yet the <hi>Debt of Iustice</hi> which I owe my Father is greater then <hi>the Debe of Charity</hi> which I owe an Enemy: And thus much of his Old Testament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>

                  <hi>If this</hi> (says he) <hi>was the case, and condition of things under the old Testament, where God seemed so punctual in his prescriptions. so rigorous in his Animadversions, and where: he danger of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="1">(1) The Antecedent, that God laid little stress upon Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials, that is (as his instances bear witness) had little regard for his positive praecepts under the Old Testament: Now how false this is, in any sense, which being true would subserve his main design, I think is pretty well cleared by this time; but the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer</hi> like a good natured Man, searing his Answerer should be so silly as not discover his weakness, has our of a prudent fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast refuted all his own Instances. For he tells us. 1. That <hi>God seem'd to be punctual in his prescriptions; 2. rigorous in his Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions.</hi> 3. That the <hi>danger of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rring capitally was great.</hi> 4. Implies that <hi>the least deviation from the line of Revelation,</hi> was an <hi>errour:</hi> Now if all this be <hi>to lay a little stress</hi> upon them, I despair of ever knowing what 'tis to lay <hi>a great:</hi> when Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are <hi>punctual in their praescriptions,</hi> telling us when we must <hi>how,</hi> and when <hi>stand,</hi> when <hi>kneel,</hi> and when sit, when look this way, when another, when speak, when hold our tongue; when they are so <hi>rigorous in their Animadversions,</hi> that to slip, or trip, to stumble, or grumble at compliance, shall be an <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition thrice with a breath,</hi> and a dreadful excommunication at the end of all, when it shall be <hi>criminal</hi> if not <hi>capital</hi> to <hi>deviate from the line of Humane Determination,</hi> Dissenters are humbly bold to call this <hi>a laying very great stress</hi> upon Ceremonies.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) His consequence is, <hi>then certainly in the N. T. the minds of men may be secure from superstitious fears.</hi> Oh without peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! To see how strangely we have been out all this while! I thought verily the Question had been, whether God lays little stress upon Circumstantials under the Old Testament, and the New, and we are now flam'd off with this conclusion, that we may be <hi>secure from superstitious fears:</hi> which is very true, whether Christ had instituted <hi>many Ceremonies or few;</hi> whether he had laid <hi>great, or little stress</hi> upon them; but all the Policy of this lyes in a crafty insinuation, which it's to be hoped the perfunctory Reader will swallow down, That <hi>all fears</hi> about displeasing Christ in the Matter of instituted worship, are but <hi>superstitions fears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) The Reason of his consequence follows: Because (forsooth) <hi>in the N. T. the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

that put words into <hi>the Fathers</hi> mouth so lately, may make the Son also speak what he pleases, and both of them to bear false witness against themselves.</p>
               <p>But whereas his Argument proceeds thus: If God laid so little under the O. T. upon positives, how much less under the New: I should invert his Argument, If God was so rigorous in his ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions, so punctual in his prescriptions, when his institutions were so Numerous, his praescriptions so multiforme, what will he be when he has prescribed us <hi>so few,</hi> and those <hi>so easy,</hi> and <hi>useful</hi> to the Observer? If we cannot be punctual in the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>a very few positives</hi> of so plain signification, how should we have repined had we been charged with a Numerous Retinue of Types, and Carnal Rudiments? If Christs yoke be accounted Heavy, how should we have sunck under the Mosaical Paedagogy? The servants of Naaman thus humbly expostulated with their Lord. 2. Kin. 5. 13. <hi>My Father if the Prophet had Commanded thee some great thing, would'st thou not have done it? how much rather then when he saith to thee; wash and be clean?</hi> Suppose Christ had exacted of us what <hi>Barchocheba exacted of his Disciples,</hi> that every one in token of absolute subjection should cut of his little finger; had it not been better <hi>to enter into Life maimed,</hi> then having all our joints to <hi>be cast into hell</hi> for our disobedience; how much more then, when he has enjoyned us only <hi>these few,</hi> which are <hi>our singular priviledge,</hi> as well as our <hi>unquestionable Duty?</hi> our <hi>Benefit,</hi> not our <hi>Burden;</hi> and our helps, and not our hindrances in the way to everlasting felicity: The fewer are his institutes, the more punctual will he be in exacting Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to them; And therefore as the <hi>last thing</hi> Christ instituted <hi>before his death</hi> was the <hi>Ordinance of the Supper,</hi> so the <hi>last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> he gave <hi>before his Ascension,</hi> was that of <hi>Baptizing all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, charging them to observe whatsoever he had commanded them.</hi>

               <p>If a tender, and loving Husband at the point of death should recount to his beloved Spouse, all the former evidences of endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affections, and withal tell her that he expected nothing in lieu of so great love, but that he might live in her memory, when he is dead and gone, by one only observation; surely the words of a dying friend would live in the living friend, and if there had been ever any true conjugal affection, it would operate strongly to be punctual in that single observance: our B.

               <p>It has been hetherto taken for granted by all that I have met with, that the Apostle <hi>Circumcised Timothy</hi> some good while before he wrote <hi>any one of his Epistles,</hi> and somewhat longer before he wrote those wherein he <hi>proclaims the danger of Circumcision.</hi> The first Epistle that he wrote was that first <hi>to the Thessalonians:</hi> And (not long after) <hi>the second to the same Church:</hi> The postscripts to both which, Date them <hi>from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> where we find him <hi>Acts.</hi> 17: But the learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> judges, and I think upon clear grounds, that they were penned <hi>a year after,</hi> and written from <hi>Corinth.</hi> But whether from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> or <hi>Corinth,</hi> both must needs be written <hi>after the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of Timothy,</hi> which we find Acts. 16. 1.

               </p>
               <p>Here is then a most desperate stumble somewhere or other; unless he can prove, (and what can he not prove) that St. <hi>Paul's</hi> journey to <hi>Lystra,</hi> and <hi>Derbe</hi> was after his journey to <hi>Athens, and Corinth,</hi> which unless he showes himself a scorn to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he will not attempt.</p>
               <p>The instance being so impertinent, we need not much be concern'd about the winding up of his conclusion: yet because some may have a mind to be pleasant, let us have it.</p>

And yet to speak plain English, here's nothing but pittiful trifling: For. 1. This Irrefragable Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration is reared upon a rotten foundation; that Paul wrote his Epistles first, wherein he declaims against Circumcision, and then afterwards Circumcises Timothy. 2. All that he has built upon that foundation is as rotten. That <hi>all Ceremonial Appenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are perfectly subordinate, and ought to yeeld to peace, charity, and edification:</hi> let me observe. §. 1. If these <hi>Ceremonious Appendages b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

so perfectly subordinate to those great ends; then how will it prove that God lays <hi>very little stress</hi> on them? Just as if some superacute Philosopher should undertake to prove, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause eating and sleeping are <hi>perfectly subordinate</hi> to Health, and life, therefore we ought to lay very little stress on them.</p>
               <p>§. 2. If those institutions of the Gospel which he calls <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Appendages,</hi> should at any time cross the great ends of <hi>peace, charity, and edification,</hi> there's no doubt but that they ought to strike fail, but he cannot prove that the meanest of Christs institutions are opposite at any time, to <hi>a just peace,</hi> that they <hi>weaken Christian charity,</hi> or <hi>hinder edification:</hi> Nor can we suppose without the highest derogation to the Divine wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. That any of Christs means for edification should ever over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw their designed ends. Their <hi>subordination</hi> to the end shows their inseriority to the end; but since Christ has allotted them their place, let no man dare to disturb their station.</p>
               <p>§. 3. If <hi>Divine Ceremonial Appendages</hi> ought to give place and yeeld to peace, charity, and edification; then we may presume without presumption, that <hi>Humane Ceremonial Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages</hi> shall be compelled to submit, and conform themselves to those great ends, and that none shall ever lay such a stress upon these as may endanger, much less destroy those glorious intendments. But here we are disappointed! God must lay little stress upon his, but they will lay incredible weight upon theirs. And as one said <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>As no forreign power can justly pretend to intermeddle with his Government at home, so no person of whatever Character <hi>at home,</hi> ought to own a dependance upon any forreign Potentate <hi>Abroad.</hi> Let <hi>every soul be subject to the higher Powers:</hi> upon which words Holy <hi>Bernard</hi> thus: <hi>si omnis anima; ergo &amp; vestra: Quis vos excepit ab universalitate?

               <p>There are two sorts of Persons that fancy they have laid an eternal obligation upon Princes, beyond all possibility of requital: The first are they who would entitle them to an absolute Right to, and Dominion over the possessions of their subjects: The second, they would make them soveraign Lords of Conscience: Thus the great Hooker, Eccles.

               <p>This was indeed the great Transgression of Jeroboam, in divine Worship. 1. Kin. 12. 32. Who ordained <hi>a Feast in the eight moneth, on the fifteenth day of the moneth, like unto the Feast that is in Iudah,—Even the moneth that he devised of his own heart.</hi> 'Tis true he was a Person obnoxious upon many other Accounts, guilty of other superstitions and encroachments upon Gods Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and yet the Scripture takes special notice, and severely brands him for the Altering of <hi>the moneth,</hi> the <hi>Circumstance of time,</hi> without better warrant then he had from his <hi>own heart,</hi> or the <hi>Regal Authority.</hi> [4] Still admitting that this was done besides the primitive institution, or the warrant of that after-Law, yet still <hi>the Prophets of the Lord were in Iudah,</hi> with whom in extraordinary cases both <hi>King, Princes, Peopl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

[5] Supposing still more then all this comes to, that his practise was besides <hi>the primitive pattern, not warranted by Numb.</hi> 9. that he had <hi>no Lawful Direction from the Sanedrin,</hi> nor from <hi>any of the Lords Prophets,</hi> (which yet can never be disproved) but that he made this alteration meerly <hi>Iure Regio</hi> (which can never be proved) yet did he not set up <hi>any one Mystical Ceremony,</hi> appointed no other <hi>worship, part of worship, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) A second branch of his variation from the primitive pattern, he give us from v. 17. <hi>Where he appointed the Levites to kill the Passeover, which by Gods appointment was to have been performed by the people themselves:</hi> wherein he supposes, That by

the Institution <hi>the people ought to kill the Passeover;</hi> that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> non-obstante that Institution appointed the <hi>Levites</hi> to do it; that he did this <hi>without Divine Direction,</hi> and yet was <hi>perfectly innocent</hi> in what he did.</p>
               <p>§. But 1. Whether by Gods appointment the <hi>Paschal Lamb</hi> was to be stain by the <hi>people,</hi> or <hi>the Priest,</hi> is a Question that has been ventilated by no small Names: and though it seems most probable that <hi>the people</hi> were entrusted with that service, yet the <hi>grounds are too weak</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Exod. 27. <hi>It is the Sacrifice of the Lords Passeover.</hi> And if <hi>a Sacrifice,</hi> then to be performed by <hi>a Priest,</hi> and whereas it is said. ver. 6. That <hi>the whole assembly of the Congregation of Israel should kill it,</hi> they answer, Jugulent, id est <hi>Iugulari Curanto,</hi> nempe per Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes. That <hi>their killing</hi> was no more then their <hi>taking care</hi> that <hi>the Priests</hi> should kill it.</p>
               <p>As to my own private Judgement, I conceive that the Master of every Family was <hi>a Priest</hi> within his <hi>own Temple,</hi> and did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that service according to the primitive Institution; but that assoon as God had chosen out <hi>the Family of Aaron</hi> to Minister unto him in that Holy employment, <hi>all the powers that lay disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and scatter'd up and down particular families</hi> were thereby <hi>united; and devolved upon that family which God had called.</hi> And that this notwithstanding the people in this as well as other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices had some hand in the oblation of it.</p>
               <p>Abarbinel reckons up <hi>ten things</hi> in a Sacrifice; <hi>five</hi> of which he assigns to the <hi>people.</hi> 1. To put their hands upon the head of the Sacrifice. 2. The killing it. 3. The taking of the skin. 4. The divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it into parts. 5. The washing of the entrails. The other five he allots to the Priest. 1. To receive the blood in Basins. 2. To sprinkle it. 3. To kindle the fire on the Alter. 4. To order the wood. 5. To take the parts of the flesh that were sacrificed.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Whether <hi>Hezekiah</hi> Commanded the Levites to kill the Passeover against the Rule of the Institution? is yet another Question. For. 1. It's the judgment of some, that in <hi>Hezekiah's Passeover</hi> the Levites did not <hi>Personally</hi> kill the Lamb, but only <hi>deliver it into the hands of the Priests</hi> to be killed. So Menochius: <hi>Existimo rem ita peractam esse, ut populus Immundus, Agnos Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis darent; Levitae ad Sacerdotes afferrent, qui eos immolarent. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> (says he) <hi>that the matter was thus transacted, that the people being unclean, delivered the Lambs to the Levites, who handed them to the Priests, and they slew, and Sacrificed them.</hi> 2. It seems more probable that <hi>the Levites</hi> did actually slay the Passeover, as also those other Sacrifices. Chapt. 29. v. 34. And in justification hereof I affirm, that if it was besides the order of the first Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet it was agreable to <hi>the after Determination</hi> of God himself, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

it was appointed them <hi>jure Divino, non Regio.</hi> And if so; then how will it evince, that the Prince had this power over Gods institutions, because God had such a power to alter, and change the first institution according as he in wisdom saw good?</p>
               <p>Now that whatever change was made, was wholy by the Command of God, I think will be evident from these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 2. Chron. 35. 3. 4. 5. 6. <hi>And</hi> (Josiah) <hi>said unto the Levites—Serve now the Lord your God, and his people Israel, And prepare your selves by the houses of your Fathers, after your Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, according to the writing of David King of Israel, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the writing of his Son Solomon—So kill the Passeover and sanctify your selves, and prepare your Brethren, that they may do according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses.</hi> Now hence it's evident, that the Levites <hi>in killing the Passeover</hi> acted according to <hi>the writings of David, and Solomon:</hi> which writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings must necessarily be one and the same, and both of them Received from the Lord. 1. Chron. 28. 19. Where David pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests: That <hi>the Lord made him understand all this, in writing by his hand upon Him:</hi> 2. It's plain also that good <hi>Iosiah</hi> aimed at this one thing in all he did, that all might be done <hi>according to the word of the Lord by Moses,</hi> and then either the Levites must be judged to have the same power <hi>by the Command of Moses,</hi> or else that <hi>no subsequent Dispos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>tion</hi> of affairs <hi>otherwise</hi> by the Authority of God could be adjudged contrary to what he had <hi>Commanded by Moses.</hi> 3. It is plain also that <hi>Iosiah</hi> had no respect to <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> practise as the Reason of his own, because he quotes not the practise of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> but the <hi>writings of David and Solomon,</hi> so false it is what the <hi>Enquirer</hi> so confidently asserts, <hi>that Hezekiah preferred the Levites to assist the Priests in killing the other Sacrifices, which never before they were admitted to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore I would be satisfied, to what purpose <hi>Iosiah</hi> should trouble himself, to conform to the patterns of <hi>Moses, David, Solomon,</hi> in these Circumstantials, if <hi>by praeregative Royal</hi> He might dispense with, alter, r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And we may reasonably hence conclude, that this pious Prinse, who was so sensible of <hi>the peoples irregularity</hi> in one kind, would have been as apprehensive of the <hi>Levites deficiency</hi> in another, had their fact conrravented the Institution; And as little Reason to doubt, but that the jealousy of God had smoaked and flamed out against <hi>the Levites</hi> as well as <hi>the people</hi> had <hi>they killed,</hi> as the other <hi>ate</hi> the Passeover <hi>otherwise then was written.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Grotius,</hi> who magnifies this as <hi>an illustrious instance of Royal authority to relax a Divine Command in case of necessity,</hi> yet dares not affirm that the King did all this upon his own Head, (least whilst he advanced his Power, he should draw his prudence into Question) but <hi>Consulto (ut credibile est) priùs Synedrio:</hi> having <hi>first advised with the Sanedrin about the Legality of the fact:</hi>

When therefore he askes us this Question; <hi>since the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates had once such a power, how came they to lose it?</hi> I confess I cannot tell! I believe they have as much power as ever they enjoyed; and this I am certain of, that never any received such a power from God, as would warrant him to alter any of Gods institutions, to set up a New Religion, a new Office, or insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, without special direction from divine prescription, or immediate Revelation.</p>

The practise of the primitive Christians, which commented admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly upon that Text of the Apostle, and other clear places, has put all this out of dispute, who were most severe in their obedience, under the most severe persecutions.

Nor do I except, <hi>the case of Religion,</hi> out of the Magistrates Commission, but only Humbly enquire, of <hi>the Enquirer,</hi> how farr <hi>the Commission extends in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious matters?</hi> To this he gives us an Answer, <hi>I mean so farr as Circumstantials, and those things which God himself hath not defined.</hi> But this will either destroy all again, or not mend the matters one jot: for, 1.

If a Commission be produced that the Magistrate shall guide me in all acceptable external instituted Worship, excepting the <hi>substantials</hi> thereof, I have enough; for <hi>exceptio in non exceptis firmat Regulam.</hi> The exception of <hi>substantials</hi> would more strongly include <hi>the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials.</hi> And therefore I am affraid he will not produce a Commission that excepts <hi>substantials.</hi> Let it be <hi>substance</hi> or <hi>Circumstance:</hi> let men invent what Terms or Names they please, If in the outward exercise of Religion Christians shall disturbe the peace, they shall know and find that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate has a coercive power that will reach them and all their outward Actions, for the assecurating that peace wherewith God has entrusted him.

I know not what a <hi>Legislative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Religion</hi> means in the hands of any but the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> The Scripture has told us. 4. Jam. 12.

It's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from hence, that Christ is the <hi>only Law-giver</hi> to his Church, in <hi>some sense;</hi> and in <hi>what sense</hi> that should be, but that he alone can impose matters of <hi>immediate worship upon the Conscience,</hi> I cannot tell.

(and accordingly practised) that Fathers and Governours of Families have Authority in Matters of Religion within their own families, at least so farr as the case in hand.</hi> Nay pray forbear a little: That they have an Authority in matters of Religion, is indeed acknowledged, and I wish it were more practised; All I haesitate at, is, whether he has such a power <hi>as farr as the case in Hand:</hi> The case <hi>in hand</hi> is or should be, whether <hi>the Magistrate has power to determine,</hi> such externals of Religion, as he (to blind the business) thought meet to call <hi>Circumstantials:</hi> and such a power, as Dissenters acknowledge not, so they practise not: It were very hard if a Master of a Family should arrogate to himself such a power as to enjoyn his Wife, Children, Servants, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Strangers, to have a Pugil of salt layd upon their Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, in token that <hi>they shall not be ashamed to have their speech seasoned with savoury discourse,</hi> without submission to which Crotchet they shall either not be admitted into the family, or if already admitted, cast out of doors, or however not permitted to hear a Chapter read, or joyn in prayer all their days; This would have been a little more to the case, of which our <hi>Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> instances come exceeding short.</p>

That the consequence from the Power of a <hi>Master of a Family,</hi> to <hi>the Civil Magistrates power,</hi> is not very clear: for the Master of a Family is supposed to have <hi>Minors</hi> in his Family, who cannot be safely trusted with the Determination of those Circumstances, which must necessarily be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but it would be a reproach to the Christian Religion, that all the Bishops, Pastors, and Churches in a Nation could not find wit enough to determine, what time of the day were most expedient to Assemble in. The power of a Prince is farr more Noble, then that of the Family Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and yet by Reason of the <hi>incapacity, and unfitness of the matter, the bulkiness of the Aggregate;</hi> the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser power may possibly Determine upon some small
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52034:138"/>
Circumstances which the greater power is unfit to do: To be Captain of <hi>a Man of Warr</hi> is more honourable, then to Command a Skuller; and yet this latter will tack about more nimbly, then that cumbersome Argosie, because the Vessel is more Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable.</p>
               <p>§. 3. This <hi>uniformity</hi> which is so much driven at in all these arguments, as the great Reason of the Necessity of <hi>universal</hi> Determination, is a name much bandied in speculative discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, rather then a thing practicable; if we may judge that <hi>not fecible,</hi> which never yet was attained. Let us look a little nearer home! And first we find no Punctual uniformity between the two Provinces: He that can sing Divine Service in the Province of York, may without new instruction be utterly to seek in the Psalmodie of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> look upon the same Province, and compare the <hi>Parochial,</hi> with the <hi>Cathedral</hi> service, and there's less uniformity still. He that can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>adge pretty well at a Country-Church, is quite lost in the uncouth usages of the Minister: Look into the Parochials, and some have their Conformity, superconformity, statute Ceremonies, and Canon Cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>monies, so that you would hardly judge them to be half-sisters: take a step nearer, and look in the same Parish-Church, uniformity is not to be found there; the Minister is not conformable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. At one prayer <hi>he stands,</hi> at another he <hi>kneels,</hi> at one part of the publick Service he is <hi>all white,</hi> and then that Colour is most decent, by and by <hi>all Black,</hi> and then <hi>that is most decent;</hi> nor is there any uniformity between the Minister, and the people; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e, at the <hi>Delivery</hi> of the consecrated Elements, <hi>praying</hi> in a posture of <hi>standing,</hi> and they in <hi>the Act of Receiving,</hi> who <hi>pray not,</hi> yet confined to <hi>Geniculation.</hi> Nor is there less discrepancy between the several <hi>parts of worship;</hi> for whereas the grand Plea for Ceremonies is a certain <hi>Decency,</hi> which they conciliate to the service, and their great usefulness to stirr up the dull minds of men, yet <hi>only Baptism</hi> is adorned with <hi>the sign of the Cross,</hi> and the rest left naked of so great an ornament, and yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Rule is, let <hi>all things</hi> be done <hi>decently;</hi> and we have as much need to have our dull minds quickned in <hi>the other Sacrament,</hi> and all other pars of worship.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Lastly. That power which belongs to the supream Civil Magistrate, <hi>as such</hi> belongs <hi>to all and every supream Magistrate;</hi> but this power of instituting, imposing Ceremonies belongs not to every supream Magistrate, therefore it belongs not to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Civil Magistrate as such, that is, it belongs to none.</p>
               <p>The Reason of the Major Proposition is taken from that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Axiome. <hi>A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>:</hi> The proof of the <hi>Minor</hi> is this: That which belonged not to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Civil Magistrate for three hundred years after Christs time, belongs not to all Civil Magistrates; but this power of instituting, and imposing Ceremonies belonged not to the Civil Magistrate for three hundred years after Christs time,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52034:138"/>
therefore it belonged not to all. To enervate which Argument it must either be denyed that the Roman Emperours during that Period were supream Civil Magistrates, which St. Paul opposes, charging the Churches to obey them; or asserted that they had a power to determine of the Circumstantials of the Christian Religion, and prescribe what Ceremonies they saw good in the Evangelical worship.</p>
               <p n="2">[2] We now come to his second Thesis. <hi>If the Magistrate may Determine these Matters; then not only Christian Charity, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, but Common Prudence requires us to presume of the wisdom, and reasonableness of his determinations, and much more to obey them.</hi>

               <p>The true Ancient Protestants of this Church with no less zeal then success defended the Princes Power, and supremacy against all the claims of Rome, and yet never ascribed such a power to him as might shackle Conscience, and dispose of Religion at pleasure.

speak of:</hi> To permit and resign up our selves to the conduct of others in Religious matters absolutely is <hi>blind obedience,</hi> whether <hi>a sober Enquirer</hi> will call them <hi>little</hi> or no. Though the things may be <hi>small,</hi> the <hi>blindness of our obedience</hi> may be as <hi>great</hi> as if the things were <hi>greater; Blindness</hi> consists not in the <hi>Object;</hi> but in the <hi>Faculty,</hi> but. 1. The things wodiscourse of, (if we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <hi>ad idem)</hi> are <hi>no little,</hi> but the <hi>great things</hi> of the Gospel: Great I say, if we either consider the greatness and danger of those <hi>Principles</hi> which they proceed upon, or the greatness, and dangerousness of those <hi>Consequences</hi> which they draw along with them, <hi>a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And they draw along with them a train of Fatal consequences, as that 'tis possible the condition of Christs Church may be irremediably more servile then ever was that of the Jewish, if Religion should fall into bad mens hands. But no sin is little to him, that knows what blood it cost to expiate it, what <hi>sorrow</hi> it costs the true penitent to mourn for it, and what pains it cost the true Christian to resist it. 2. If the things be <hi>so little</hi> in the judgment of Imposers, we hope we shall tast of their compassion in indulging <hi>such little things;</hi> It shall be no <hi>little praise</hi> we should return to the <hi>great God,</hi> no little returns of duty, and exemplary obedience we should make to his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, that should permit us the indisserent use of indifferent things, and suppose them so, yet <hi>the faith of indifferent things is no indifferent thing:</hi> But I observe, That when our Enquirer would have Dissenters <hi>punisht</hi> for the Neglect of <hi>these things,</hi> then they are <hi>not little;</hi> then they become <hi>the greatest, weightiest,</hi> most <hi>important things</hi> in the world; then Churches, Government, Religion cannot subsist without them, as accidents cannot subsist without their substances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so neither substances exist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their accidents; but when he comes to drole us into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, then they are little triffles, the minutes, punctilios, of Religion. 3. If to resign up our selves in matters of immediate worship without a warrant from God, to any but God, be not <hi>blind obedience,</hi> 'tis because we are blind, and cannot see what blind obedience is: We freely commit our selves to the Political conduct in all things temporal; a ministerial Conduct we own in our Pastors, and Teahers; a Soveraign Conduct we would gladly reserve for Christ. We would willingly go any whether but <hi>to Hell,</hi> do any thing but <hi>sin,</hi> lose any thing but <hi>the peace of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,</hi> and part with any thing, but what is <hi>none of ours to dispose</hi> of, rather then seem to tergiversate from the Commands of our Governours.</p>
               <p>And as we confess <hi>the Magistrate stands upon higher grounds then we;</hi> so we <hi>must,</hi> and without displeasing our Superiours <hi>way say;</hi> That Christ stands upon <hi>higher ground then he;</hi>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:52034:141"/>
And when we shall come to stand before his Tribunal, there to receive according to our works, we shall all stand upon even ground, as to any difference, that external advantages in this present world, shall then make.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) <hi>We have Reason to perswade our selves that we may as easily lye under prejudices, as they; and that we may be as much trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Considerations of ease, and liberty, as they may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be suspected to be with Ambition.</hi> Ans: It's the duty of all to watch against those temptations, to which welye most open from without; and to watch over those corruptions, to which we are most obnoxious from within: we dare not think it <hi>probable that our Magistrates are transported with Ambition;</hi> And we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that we are not transported with any base lust, or pittiful considerations to suspend active obedience, till we discover such transport by its proper fruits. But if we must still be represented by our sometimes Brethren, but now Persecutors, as misguided by prejudices, we are sorry for it, but cannot help it: and must place these secret Aspersions in the number of those burdens, which by frequent use grow familiar, and less pinching, and such as seeing they are not to be avoided, wisdom dictates they ought to be contemned. And yet we shall pray that our Magistrates, like the highest Boughs of the goodliest trees being most fruitful, may bow down themselves with abundance of precious fruits, and drop some of it into the laps of their despised, but loyal subjects.</p>
               <p n="7">(7) <hi>There are no less different capacities of mind, then Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Body, and as great difference in mens outward Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as in either of the former:</hi> The Magistrate will certainly thence judge that there ought to be as great a diversity and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in his Impositions: He that has a larger swallow, let him have a larger cann: Let the best stomack have the largest tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher: and since one stomack will bear, what would oppress ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, why should one mans Conscience be compelled to digest, what anothers can easily put over: Either we must <hi>practise,</hi> whilst we <hi>think not</hi> the <hi>same things,</hi> which is a sordid piece of <hi>unworthy Hypocrisy,</hi> and no credit to uniformity to congregate such Heterogeneous materials; or else tormented, because our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, capacities, consciences, circumstances are not of one size, which is not our fault, for we had not the mingling of our temperatures, nor the putting together of our frames; or else (which we hope they who are wiser then us all will judge most eligible) that every one retaining his different sentiments which impede not Christianity, or disturb the peace, may be indulged in a practise peaceably managed, suitable to those innocent vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. And since our <hi>Enquirer</hi> has quoted an old story, I shall only repeat his words, and leave the Reader to his own thoughs for the application: <hi>Those that would have the Laws fitted to their humour, without respect to other Men, do but imitate the Barbarous Custom of the Infamous Procrustes, who is said to have either Rackt all those Persons that fell into his hands, and stretcht them out to his own size, if they were too short; or cut them of to his

own proportions, if they were too long.</hi> And really if any of the Dissenters be of that Imperious and Tyrannical temper. I know not why they should expect that Mercy they will not show, or institute themselves in those Priviledges, out of which they would eject all others.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein Christian Liberty consists? The <hi>Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> Reasonings examined, and Dissenters vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated from that Insinuation, that they pretend by their Christian Charter to be discharged from Obedience to Laws.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a Priviledge that has too much of Absolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raingty in it for <hi>the Opponent,</hi> to impose what state of the Question he pleases upon <hi>the Respondent:</hi> The <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer</hi> has therefore got the poor Non-conformists upon a sure lock, if he can oblige them to maintain, <hi>That Christian liberty discharges them from obedience to Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are indeed <hi>some Laws</hi> from whose obligation if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Liberty cannot discharge us, it can do <hi>very little:</hi> and there are <hi>other Laws,</hi> from which if Christian Liberty should pretend to give a discharge, it would assume <hi>too much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>Discharge from obedience,</hi> is to Ambiguous a Term to be put into this Question. For. 1. Christian Liberty in some cases does not discharge us <hi>from obedience,</hi> but <hi>prevents the obligation:</hi> It does not <hi>dissolve the Bond,</hi> but prevents the <hi>Binding;</hi> 2. Christian Liberty may discharge from <hi>a Necessity of obedience</hi> (in some cases) which is the <hi>formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of subjection to a Law, and yet not discharge from <hi>the Lawfulness of doing</hi> that which is <hi>the Material part</hi> of the Law: If a Law be made the Matter whereof is things <hi>purely indifferent</hi> in their Natures, and these things appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to <hi>the immediate service of God,</hi> Christian Liberty will not make it <hi>unlawful to do those things,</hi> but it will still
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52034:143"/>
maintain it's ground, that it's <hi>Lawful not to do them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Province of this Liberty whereof we now treat lyes between those things which are <hi>necessary, and sinful;</hi> as it is frequently pleaded about the Magistrates power, since things forbidden cannot Lawfully be done, nor things Commanded, Lawfully omitted (in their proper seasons) the Magistrate must either have a power in these <hi>middle concerns,</hi> or he can have no Legislative power at all: The same or some such thing I would affirm here; whatever is <hi>sinful</hi> admits of <hi>no Release,</hi> whatever is <hi>a duty</hi> admits of <hi>no indulgence,</hi> and therefore <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> must have it's appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in these <hi>Adiaphorous things,</hi> or be quite shut out of doors.</p>
               <p>Now seeing the Magistrates power lyes only in those things <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, such as stand in a posture of neutrality, and side in neither with good nor evil; and seeing also that Christian Liberty has for it's Sphaere indifferent things, these two powers must needs strike fire, and their interests perpetually clash, unless some expedient may be found out to reconcile their seeming enterfeering motions.</p>
               <p>Indifferent things may fall under a twofold Consideration, either as they are applied to, or used in ordinary affairs of Humane life; or as they are appropriated to divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and preferred to serve in Religious affairs: in the former respect they come unquestionably under the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates Cognizance, which our B. Saviour has put beyond the Die of Controversy by his exemplary practise: 17. Math. 24. Where though he might have pleaded a peculiar Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet he rather chose to wave it, and recommend to us a singular pattern of due subjection: in this case then Christian Liberty ought not interpose. In the other Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration Christian Liberty puts in a claim, and this also our Saviour has made indisputable by his example, who though he would freely submit to a tax of twenty pence, would not yeeld to their Ceremony of <hi>washing hands,</hi> though it was not worth a farthing, when Superstition had lifted it up above it's place.</p>
               <p>And yet as sacred things in their external exercise may come under the inspection of the Civil Powers, in order to the securing of Publick peace, which is directly entrusted with him by the God of order and peace; so may things in their own nature <hi>secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> come under the Jurisdiction of <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> when they shall be advanced above their Pedegree, and made either <hi>parts of Worship,</hi> or <hi>Conditions</hi> to the enjoyment of Communion therein.</p>
               <p>There are two sorts of Persons who as they are enemies to all Truth, so they are but back-friends to <hi>Christian Liberty;</hi> some there are who have made it such an Idol, that they have sacrificed things sacred and civil to it's Deity: and given it such a boundless Dominion,

               <p n="5">(5) Though Christian Liberty may in some cases be <hi>restrained,</hi> yet can it not in any Lawfully be resigned: He that has Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to moderate it by the Rules of <hi>prudence and charity,</hi> has yet Commanded me <hi>to stand fast</hi> in it: He that <hi>resigns</hi> his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <hi>in one case,</hi> by consequence gives it away <hi>in all;</hi> for though he has not actually resigned in every case, yet has he virtually betray'd it, by yeelding in one, for there is the same reason of all the rest; as an owner may forego <hi>the use,</hi> and yet reserve <hi>the right;</hi> which right will reduce <hi>tho use</hi> too in season; so may a Christian wave his Liberty <hi>in the use,</hi> still serving <hi>his Right,</hi> that when opportunity shall invite, <hi>the use</hi> may attend, and wait upon <hi>the Right.</hi>

For. 1. Such resignation of my self to be restrained fixedly and statedly, is to subscribe, engage, and make an implicite vow and oath against all opportunities of using my Liberty for the spiritual good of another, which providence may offer to me. Gods Providence by mustring together all due Circumstances, is the great Director when, and where to use, and employ my Christian Liberty: If then such concurring Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances should command my forbearance of an Act, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the sin of my Brother; If now I have suffered my self to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined <hi>the other way,</hi> that I will const<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

By such predetermination of my self in things indifferent, in submission to any man I do as much as in me by alter <hi>the nature of indifferent things.</hi> For things sinful can <hi>never be done;</hi> Duties must <hi>always be performed in due time, and place,</hi> and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things should be <hi>indifferently</hi> used, as present Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances invite <hi>Prudence, and Charity</hi> to determine: but when once they are predetermined, I can no more do an <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing,</hi> then if it had been <hi>sinful;</hi> or no more omit an <hi>indifferent act,</hi> then if it had been <hi>necessary.</hi> 3. By such a fixed predetermination of my liberty I ascribe more to man in his <hi>positive precepts,</hi> then to God in his <hi>affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive moral precepts:</hi> for the Acts of such Commands may be suspended <hi>pro hic, &amp; Nunc,</hi> when they obstruct some great Good, but in this case I must act uniformly, without respect to circumstances, let thousands be offended, stumbled, wounded in Conscience, and prejudiced against Religion. And in short, by such Resignation of my liberty in <hi>is't exercise,</hi> I have redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced my self to that imaginary <hi>Liberty of Opinion,</hi> that dreaming freedom, which the <hi>Lollards</hi> enjoyed in their Tower, and the poor Protest ants in <hi>Bonners</hi> Cole-hole.</p>
               <p n="7">(7) When Christian <hi>Charity</hi> commands me <hi>to forbear the use</hi> of the thing, which otherwise is within the Charter of <hi>Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to use;</hi> and at the same time the <hi>Christian Magistrate</hi> shall command me to <hi>to practise that very thing</hi> by a fixed Law; I humbly conceive, that <hi>Christian Charity</hi> ought to <hi>restrain my Liberty, not to act,</hi> rather then <hi>the Commands of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate enforce me to act,</hi> 1. Because the restraint which <hi>Charity</hi> puts upon me, will <hi>soon determine, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>pire,</hi> but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Magistrate is <hi>perpetual:</hi> 2. The restraint which Charity puts upon me is <hi>internal,</hi> and so agreable to, and consistent with the <hi>greatest Freedom and Liberty,</hi> but the restraint, put upon me by the Magistrate, is <hi>external,</hi> and <hi>compulsory,</hi> which comports not with my inward liberty: for if he deals meerly by his <hi>will, and authority,</hi> that suits not with my reason, and therefore has in it the nature of force; But if the Magistrate should deal by Argument, then when a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger appears to act according to his precept, then that drawn from the good of my Neighbour by Charity, Christian Liberty may be free, and yet obey: provided always that that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be taken from <hi>the nature of the thing commanded,</hi> and not from the <hi>naked commands.</hi> 3. The weak Christian for whose sake Charity commands me to forbear acting, is one that cannot prevent his own weakness, his stumbling scruples, and aptness to be wounded; but he that commands me to act, may prevent, recal, or suspend his own Edict in that which in it's own nature is indifferent. And God has commanded me not to offend my weak Brother by the use of indifferent
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:52034:146"/>
things, but he has no where commanded the Magistrate to impose indifferent things, which become not some way or other necessary. 4. It seems a most horrid thing to interpret Scriptures at this rate: That I should be commanded to <hi>walk Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> till I am commanded to <hi>walk uncharitably;</hi> And forbidden <hi>to destroy him for whom Christ dyed,</hi> by my indifferent things, till I am <hi>enjoyned to destroy him. Not to wound weak consciences,</hi> till I am <hi>commanded to wound them.</hi> Thus shall <hi>Moral precepts</hi> be avoyded by humane <hi>positive Laws,</hi> which cannot be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seded by the <hi>Divine positive Laws.</hi> And if one may be thus ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, the whole <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>It is therefore a most approbrious, and invidious charge with which he begins this discourse. <hi>All that we have hetherto discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed about the power of the Magistrate, some think may be avoided by pleading the</hi> Magna Charta <hi>of</hi> Christian Liberty] for though it may be pleaded against some power that may possibly be assumed, yet against none wherewith he stands' endowed by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Scripture; nor indeed against <hi>any useful power</hi> for the attaining the great ends of Government, publick peace, and tranquillity.</p>
               <p>The Church of England in her avowed Doctrine asserts, that <hi>Christ has ordained in his Church two Sacraments, generally neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation;</hi> now we conceive, that having a Right <hi>as Christians</hi> to <hi>all the Ordinances of Christ necessary to Salvation,</hi> ChristianLiberty may plead the enjoyment of all thoseOrdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, upon those naked Terms Christ has off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This is our <hi>Maegna Charta;</hi> And if any shall encumber that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with new clogs, provisoes, restrictions, and limitations, we plead our <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> which if it be denyed us, our Christian Liberty is so far violated.</p>
               <p>Nor do we deny the Magistrate a Power <hi>about our Christian Liberty;</hi> If any shall turn this <hi>Liberty into licenciousness,</hi> he may restrain them: Nay he may restrain <hi>the Liberty it self,</hi> where God has not <hi>praeengaged us to restrain it;</hi> And he will eminently employ his power for Christ, when he exerts it, to assert and vindicate to all his loyal Subjects the free use of that great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; And if encroaching violence shall make a forcible entry upon that priviledge, whereof we are in quiet, and peaceable possession; we shall complain of the force to him, who will remove it, and reinvest us in our Christian freehold, whereof Christ has made the purchase with his own blood.</p>
               <p>Two things there are which the <hi>Enquirer</hi> has lustily promised us, and therefore we may confidently expect from him: first, that he will give us <hi>the true notion,</hi> and secondly, the <hi>due extent</hi> of Christian Liberty: and he has freed his name pretty well, for first he has made it a <hi>meer notion,</hi> and then <hi>layd an extent</hi> upon it, that is, he has seized it into his own hands, upon pretence for the Magistrates use.</p>

Is he a reasonable Creature that refuses the <hi>plain, and reasonable Terms</hi> of Communion, <hi>contained in the Gospel?</hi> what a hideous Monster would a Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick be, did Churches keep to these Terms? but his Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion retracts all this again:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>—And such other (not contradictory to them) as Publick wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, peace, and Charity, shall dictate, and recommend.</hi> Now you have it!

               </p>
               <p>It minds me of the Story of <hi>Sanctius</hi> the King of <hi>Arragon's Brother,</hi> who marching against the <hi>Saracens,</hi> diverted himself a while at <hi>Rome;</hi> the Bountiful <hi>Pope,</hi> who is always prodigal of what costs him nothing, causes him to be proclaimed, <hi>Sanctius by the grace of God King of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </gap>! I shall not need to observe to the Reader the Egregious folly of such Propositions. <hi>We are not bound to the Laws of Moses</hi> (i. e. as Terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) <hi>nor any other, but such other—</hi>That is, we had been <hi>free,</hi> but that we are in <hi>bondage.</hi> Negatives are infinite! and under that one word [such other] we may be pester'd with more then those Nice Laws of <hi>Moses.</hi> For. 1. Who can tell what <hi>publick wisdom</hi> may Determine? The publick wisdom of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> has introduced such a Lumber of <hi>those other</hi> Terms, as hath eaten out almost all Religion, with the Divertisements of <hi>Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Paganical,</hi> whimsical Constitutions: The publick wisdom of <hi>Abassia</hi> has introduced <hi>Circumcision</hi> it self, and no thanks to

It's very Childish to put the determination of <hi>those other Terms</hi> of Communion upon the Tresviri, <hi>Publick wisdom, peace and Charity.</hi> For what if they accord not in their votes about <hi>the Terms?</hi> what if perhaps <hi>Publick wisdom</hi> should clash with <hi>Charity?</hi> Charity should say I will have no Terms of Communion that may exclude Persons of <hi>honest hearts,</hi> though <hi>weaker In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals;</hi> but <hi>publick wisdom</hi> should contend <hi>for some other</hi> intercalated conditions, which may render Divine Institutions more August and solemn; 4. No publick wisdom can possibly Determine upon <hi>those other Terms;</hi> in a way that shall secure the Interests of <hi>Charity,</hi> nor in what cases I am bound for <hi>her sake</hi> to restrain my self in the use of my Christian Liberty. For the prudent admeasurement between my Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and my Charity to my Christian Neighbour, depends upon the view of the particular Circumstances of time, place, Persons, which cannot come under the prospect of <hi>publick wisdom:</hi> Suppose a Command were given forth from publick wisdom, that I should at such a time, and in such a place drive a Coach with violenee down the High-way, and when I come to execute this Command, I find multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of little Children playing in that High-way; the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance <hi>of these Persons</hi> was not foreseen by <hi>publick wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> must that therefore take place of <hi>my Charity</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the lives of these little ones? or my <hi>Charity</hi> submit to <hi>publick wisdom,</hi> and fall pell mell in amongst them?

               <p>§. 2. His second generous Concession is. <hi>There lyes now no more bonds upon the Consciences of Christians, then did upon the Ancient Patriarches, saving those improvements our Saviour has made upon the Law of Nature, and those few positive institutions of his expresly set down in the Gospel:</hi> And what a blessed day were it with the Christian world,

if we might see this made good! This would shut out of doors all those <hi>Ianus Articles,</hi> penn'd by <hi>wise Reconcilers,</hi> to perswade the combating Parties first to shake hands, and then to fall more suriously to Cudgels. This would shut out of doors all Humane impositions: forestalling our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Christian Church.</p>

1.

               <p>That which was the intolerable burthen of the Jews, which they were not able to bear, our Enquirer tells, p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 186. was espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this: <hi>That the Law of Moses enjoyn'd a great number of little observances, which by their multitude were hard to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, by their Nicety difficult to be observed, and by their meer positive nature, and having no essential goodness in themselves, had less power upon the conscience of men, to awaken their care, and diligence about them; and because it's hard for the mind of man to attend to many things at once, especially if also the things in which his care and obedience is required, be such as are not enacted in his Conscience, and when he can see no other Reason of, or advantage by his obedience but meerly his obedience, therefore was that Law called impossible:</hi> This, say the Dissenters, would be their case, should they submit to what the <hi>Enquirer</hi> pleads for, and there fore an infringment of their Christian Liberty.</p>
               <p>There is one Text of Scripture by which he will prove that his is the true Notion of Christian Liberty: <hi>The Apostle</hi> (says he) <hi>in several of his Epistles, but especially that to the Romans, en joyns the Christians in their scruples about eating of certain Meats, and in the conduct of themselves to consult Charity towards their weak Brethren, the peace of the Church, and their own edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: to which purpose</hi> he advises us to see 14. Rom. and Chap. 15. Now if the Reader will be Ruled by me, we will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for one quarter of an hour to look into those places, let the danger be what it will, and I am confident we shall not find our Christian Liberty determinable by any outward power: v. 3. The Apostle lays down the only true way of maintaining peace and love amongst Christians under their various apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and various practises. <hi>

And to this Rule the Canons of 1640. did attend. Can. 8.

That they which use this Rite, despise not them which use is not, and that they who use is not, condemn not those that use it.</hi> Which Rule was it applied to all other matters of the like nature, would undoubtedly preserve what of <hi>Love is left,</hi> and recover that measure of <hi>Christian amity, which is lost.</hi> Peace <hi>may be had</hi> under <hi>differing notions</hi> about in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things, and <hi>peace must be had</hi> under <hi>differing pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises</hi> suitable to those <hi>differing notions,</hi> not by screwing up <hi>the weak</hi> to the Latitude which <hi>the strong</hi> allows himself, nor by pulling down <hi>the strong</hi> to the narrow practises, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>the weak</hi> are confined, but by <hi>the strong</hi> Christians not despising <hi>the weak,</hi> and <hi>the weak Christians</hi> not judging his more grown, <hi>and stronger Brother;</hi> v. 4.

The Apostle gives a Reason of his former Rule: <hi>If thy Brother be grieved with thy Meat, then walkest thou not charitably;</hi> And much more if he be scandalized, and drawn into sin: Is it not a most unchristian humour to insist so peremptorily upon <hi>doing,</hi> because in it self <hi>Lawful;</hi> when Charity <hi>countermands that doing,</hi> and therefore 'tis <hi>unlawful in the use.

the blood of Christ, if thou wilt for <hi>a sorry indifferent thing</hi> hazard its eternal damnation: our <hi>liberty to act</hi> must stand out of the way, when <hi>a Brothers soul</hi> comes in place; v. 19. <hi>Let us follow the things that make for peace, and the things that may edify one another.</hi> Here we have another Rule for the restraint of our liberty in things indifferent: When the using my liberty would disturb the peace of the Church. I must cease to act: for <hi>the strong</hi> may forbear what he judges <hi>Lawful,</hi> and yet <hi>the weak</hi> cannot do what he judges <hi>sinful:</hi> And therefore <hi>to the strong</hi> he speaks thus: v. 22. <hi>Hast thou Faith? have it to thy self before God:</hi> Art thou perswaded such a thing is Lawful, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the many violent presumptions of others of it's sinfulness, keep thy judgment to thy self; trouble not the Church with thy Orations, let thy disputing talent yeeld to the weak judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others.

               <p>All this while here's not one syllable of restraining Christian Liberty by the <hi>Authority of another,</hi> by <hi>outward force,</hi> and <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> all must be determined by a Christians <hi>own Prudence,</hi> as moved by <hi>the edification of anothers Charity to his soul,</hi> and <hi>the peace of the community:</hi> not a word to consult my <hi>own secular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and emolument;</hi> Not a letter that <hi>Conscience, Christian Liberty, private wisdom,</hi> my <hi>own Reason</hi> must be impressed to militate under the command and conduct of the <hi>publick wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> the <hi>publick Reason,</hi> or <hi>the publick Conscience.</hi>

               <p n="1">(1) His first Postulatum is this: <hi>That Christian Liberty doth consist in a freedom in utramque:</hi> (pray do not mistake him) <hi>that is, that antecedently to the Considerations of prudence, peace, and charity, it's equally in the power of a Christian to do or not to do, any, or all those things that are not expresly forbidden by the H. Scriptures.</hi> Very good! Then I will assume: But <hi>to love God with all my heart, and soul, and strength,</hi> is one of those things which God hath <hi>not expresly forbidden in the H. Scripture:</hi> Therefore <hi>antecedently to the Considerations of prudence, peace and charity, It's in the power of a Christian</hi> to love, or not to love God with all his heart, and that <hi>Christian Liberty consists in this freedom in utramque.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am not so uncharitable as to think that the <hi>Enquirer</hi> owns <hi>this conclusion,</hi> or that <hi>any principle</hi> he holds will <hi>inferr it:</hi> All I note it for is to evince to him, that he has worded his matters besides his onw intention, and that he intended really to have said: That <hi>Antecedently to the Considerations of prudence, &amp; charity</hi>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:52034:150"/>
it's <hi>equally in the power of a Christian to do, or not to do,</hi> any <hi>or all those things that are not expresly forbidden by, nor contradict the express Laws of the Scriptures.</hi> And taking the words according to <hi>the presumption of his meaning,</hi> and not <hi>the Letter,</hi> I say. 1. Here's something more then Truth. That Christian Liberty gives us a power <hi>to do</hi> what is not <hi>expresly forbidden:</hi> many things are forbidden <hi>by consequence,</hi> which are not <hi>expresly forbidden.</hi> I pray shew me an <hi>express prohibition</hi> to <hi>recognize the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</hi> To <hi>subscribe the Tridentine Decrees;</hi> And if this be part of the <hi>Enquirers</hi> Christian Liberty, to do, what is not <hi>expresly forbidden,</hi> I hope he will not find himself aggrieved if we judge that <hi>he,</hi> and some others of <hi>the same Latitude,</hi> are not at so irreconcileable a distance from Rome, as they would be thought.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As <hi>all is not Truth,</hi> so neither is this <hi>the whole Truth: for Christian Liberty</hi> gives us a Power-to <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>not do</hi> the things neither <hi>commanded, nor forbidden,</hi> not only <hi>Antecedently</hi> to <hi>the considerations of prudence, peace, and charity,</hi> but also. 1. <hi>subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> to those considerations, that is, assoon as ever those <hi>considerations</hi> shall <hi>ecase;</hi> and 2. <hi>conco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="3">3. There is much ambiguity in the jumbling, the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>prudence, peace, and charity</hi> together: for the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of <hi>peace and charity</hi> are <hi>objective,</hi> such as I am to consider as <hi>the motives, and inducements</hi> to restrain my liberty: but the consideration of <hi>prudence</hi> is <hi>subjective:</hi> that is, <hi>Prudence</hi> is that virtue which is to make a judgment, when, and in what cases, those two <hi>peace, and charity,</hi> are <hi>considerations</hi> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eient to enforce <hi>such a restraint:</hi> so that, would we speak plain English, the matter amounts to no more then this: that <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently</hi> to my <hi>prudent</hi> consideration of the concerns of <hi>peace, and charity,</hi> I may do, or not do, whatsoever is <hi>in it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different:</hi> which Truth will be too feeble a foundation to erect his intended superstructure upon.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) His second <hi>Postulatum</hi> is this: <hi>That it is no infringment, but an exercise of this liberty, actually to be determined to that side towards which</hi> prudence, or charity, <hi>shall incline: Though in the mean time the other side be in general as Lawful as that:</hi> It would ill become me to teach him how to word his own conceptions, though I should rather have chosen to have express't my self; not <hi>disjunctively. [To that side towards which</hi> prudence or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>shall incline]</hi> but rather <hi>conjunctively, [prudence and charity]</hi> or most properly <hi>[prudence at the invitation of charity]</hi> for <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> enclines me neither one way nor other further then as she is directed by the considerations of <hi>peace, and charity,</hi> the <hi>good
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:52034:150"/>
of my self or Neighbour;</hi> nor can the interests of these two ever be divided. But I answer. 1. That <hi>it is no infringment of Christian Liberty</hi> for <hi>prudence,</hi> to determine upon my own act, as that <hi>I will not do an indifferent thing,</hi> when peace, and the spiritual good of my Brother prohibit me; Because the Scripture, which contains <hi>the Charter of Christian Liberty,</hi> has also directed my prudence, thus, and in this case <hi>to restrain it:</hi> but yet (which is the thing he drives at) to be <hi>determined to one side</hi> by <hi>outward power, civil force, naked Authority, or will;</hi> when my <hi>own Reason</hi> can see no Prudence is such a Determination, is an evident infringment of my liberty: so that <hi>to be determined to one side</hi> may be an infringment, when I am determined by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or menaces; and yet to determine my self upon the considerations of <hi>Charity, and Peace,</hi> may be none; for in the former case, I see <hi>no Reason</hi> of my obedience, <hi>but my obedience;</hi> but in the latter I am determined by <hi>my own election,</hi> upon <hi>rational grounds,</hi> becoming a <hi>rational Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Though a prudential determination not to act, at the Request or command of peace, and charity, when <hi>otherwise</hi> I might have acted, be <hi>no infringment</hi> of my Radical Liberty, yet it is <hi>a restraint of my Liberty,</hi> which the <hi>Enquirer</hi> calls, p. 208. <hi>A denying himself some part of his liberty,</hi> and therefore it seems improperly called <hi>an exercise of Liberty:</hi> 'Tis indeed an <hi>exercise</hi> of <hi>my Prudence,</hi> an exercise of <hi>my Charity,</hi> but hardly an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of my Liberty, further then as <hi>the will</hi> is <hi>the principle</hi> of such restraint, and determination.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though Prudence ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> teach me <hi>not to act,</hi> but to adhere to the side of Charity; yet Prudence must not take her measures for not acting from such poor, low, <hi>selfish considerations,</hi> as the saving, or gaining those outward advantages to my self, which are the great Idols of Prudence <hi>salsely so called,</hi> which is no better then <hi>carnal policy,</hi> and <hi>sinful selfishness;</hi> but from the interest of <hi>Gods glory,</hi> the advancement of his Gospel, and all this <hi>bondfide,</hi> for if Prudence mistakes in her reckonings, an imaginary good end will not indemnify, and save her harmless.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>These two points thus gained</hi> (as the Enquirer fancies) <hi>will give abundant foundation for a third to be inferred from them,</hi> viz. <hi>That whatsoever is so free to me, that I may do it, or not do it, according as I shall be inclined by the considerations of Brotherly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and compassion, must of necessity be also, as free to me to obey the Magistrate, and serve publick peace, and order in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us but resolve this unwieldy proposition into it's distinct branches, and we shall need no more to expose it's nakedness. 1. <hi>What soever I may do at the command of charity, I may do at the command of Authority in order to publick peace:</hi> Now to furnish him with a minor: <hi>but I may practise the Ceremonies at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Charity,</hi> therefore I may practise them at the command <hi>of Authority in order to publick peace.</hi> And now for the proof of the minor we are as far to seek as ever.</p>
               <p>This then is the Quintessence of his Reasonings, the utmost
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:52034:151"/>
resort of all the wit, and learning of this Chapter, which in other, and more advantagious words to his purpose he gives us thus: <hi>Whatsoever I usay do in compassion to my</hi> Brothers <hi>infirmity, surely that I may much more do in Reverence to Gods Ordinance,</hi> the <hi>Lawful Magistrate,</hi> which is <hi>the point I have all this while drove at.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this conclusion however he seems cock-sure of it, will no ways follow from those premises. And the fallacy of it is so thin that it's transparent to the weakest eye. In the first <hi>postulatum</hi> he allows a freedom to act in utramque, <hi>antecedently to the Considerations of Prudence, peace, and Charity:</hi> In the second he asserts, that it's no infringment of this Liberty <hi>to be determined to one side by prudence, or Charity.</hi> In his third, that we may (and therefore may) act or not act according as we shall be determined <hi>by Authority.</hi> I shall summ up my answer in these particulars, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
               <p>§. 1. Though <hi>the Lawful Magistrate be Gods Ordinance,</hi> yet it remains a Question und-cided, whether he be <hi>Gods Ordinance so far, and for this end,</hi> to deter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> of things indifferent, antecedently to the determination of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, by gathering together all due Circumstances which ought to determine the Natural indifferency of the things aforesaid: Many things are true <hi>secundum quid,</hi> which are not so <hi>simplicitèr.</hi> But if he shall judge it a Prize worth all his labour to impose upon us with so broad a Sophism, much good may his own Dream do him.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Though <hi>the Lawful Magistrate be Gods Ordinance,</hi> yet it's a greater Question still, whether he may determine my Liberty <hi>in utramque,</hi> to the <hi>one side,</hi> when <hi>Charity</hi> would determine it <hi>to the other:</hi> that is whether he has power to <hi>Command me to act,</hi> when Charity <hi>prohibits me to act,</hi> or make it my <hi>duty to move,</hi> when <hi>Charity</hi> commands me <hi>to stand still.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's true the concerns of <hi>a true and desirable peace,</hi> and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are inseparable: nothing can advance the design of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but what does really subserve the interest of the latter: for so has the Apostle conjoin'd them, 14. Rom. 19. <hi>Let us follow after the things that make for peace, and things wherewith we may edify one another.</hi> Whatsoever advances the edification of my Brother, advances also Peace, unless imprudent men have made the Terms of peace so desperate, that it's not attainable, without the ruine of Charity, which the <hi>Enquirer</hi> confesses <hi>an essential part of our Religion:</hi> but yet it's possible that the Command of a Magistrate may oppose the concerns of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in which case, I think without offence I may say, he is none of Gods Ordinance to that end and purpose, nor has God given me any Liberty to obey in that case: And as such a Command would be a direct invasion of my Christian
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:52034:151"/>
Liberty, so obedience to such a command would be a plain betraying of it: If therefore the freedom to act <hi>in utramque</hi> he determined to <hi>the one side,</hi> by charity. I have no free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (under that posicure of Circumstances) to submit to a determination to <hi>the other side</hi> at the Command of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>§. 3. As <hi>the Lawful Magistrate is Gods Ordinance,</hi> so is it an <hi>express Ordinance</hi> of the same God, not to use my Liberty in indifferent things, when by such use <hi>my Brother is made weak, or stumbled, or offended.</hi> 14. Rom. 21: And it's a hard way of concluding; That what <hi>one Ordinance of God countermands,</hi> that I may do <hi>at the command of another.</hi> God has oftens superseded <hi>general Commands</hi> by <hi>special ones,</hi> but I find not that he has instituted any <hi>general Ordinance</hi> to suspend the duties of a <hi>special Command.</hi> He that says, <hi>If thy Brother be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, eat not,</hi> has given no power to any to say; <hi>Though thy Brother be offended, yet eat!</hi> And if our own pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the view of all Circumstances shall determine that 'tis my duty <hi>not to act</hi> at the prohibition of Charity, notwithstanding a Command <hi>to act</hi> by the Magistrate, yet cannot this be interpreted <hi>Irreverence to Gods Ordinance the Lawful Magistrate,</hi> unless we will suppose, that by shewing obedience to <hi>the one,</hi> we must be irrevertent to <hi>the other</hi> of Gods Ordinances.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Christian Liberty is committed to every Christian to keep for <hi>the use and behoof of his weak Brother,</hi> and not to resign at <hi>the meer pleasure</hi> of another: Publick peace, and Charity shall not need to weigh against one another, for their interests sweetly meet together, and kiss each other; but when a Command issuing out from <hi>will, pleasure,</hi> and <hi>bare power,</hi> shall come in composition with them, Christian Liberty has secured me, and prudence will counsel me, and Charity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines me, and God commands me what course to steer, which way to take.</p>
               <p>§. 5. The Magistrate himself is Gods Ordinance, the great Officer and Minister of Jesus Christ to secure, and preserve the <hi>great Charter</hi> of Christian Liberty sacred, and inviolate, against all the encroachments of those who would commit a rape upon a Priviledge, in it self so innocent, to others so useful, and in the price payd for it so invaluably dear and precious.</p>
               <p>The summ of which is this much, that though charity and peace are always agreed when to use, when to restrain my liberty, yet if any power without reference to the concerns of these shall endeavour to restrain my liberty, by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to do what Reason and Prudence shall inform me, are repugnant to those ends; such Command is a plain infringment of my liberty, and my obedience a plain abuse of my liberty, unless we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. That it's an exercise of my Christian Liberty to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:52034:152"/>
act against the great ends of Christianity; or an exercise of my freedom to run against the Dictates of my judgment, and Conscience.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore, if this be that great thing, he has <hi>all this while drove at,</hi> I must tell him, he drives at too surious a rate for me to keep pace with him; but thus would <hi>Phaeton</hi> drive, though he set the world on fire; such was <hi>Iehue's</hi> Career, though he sought himself more then God, and so have I seen your hair-brain'd Drivers resolve to <hi>whistle out their whilstle,</hi> though the Cart turn over.</p>

                  </gap>, in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Jewel-house, to touch one Ceremony, is to steal the Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conscience</hi> has ever hetherto maintained a good Repute amongst the more Civiliz'd part of Mankind, and he has been adjudged a Person unmeet for converse, that should once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute and debauch it; It will therefore he expedient at least, first to represent it as an <hi>usurper,</hi> and then to execute it as <hi>a Traytor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I pittied that Innocent Person who being fast asleep, and dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no harm, an assassinat puts into his hand the bloody knife wherewith he had committed an execrable Murther: upon which violent presumption being apprehended he is arraign'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, executed.</p>
               <p>Thus the Jews found no better way to deliver our B. <hi>Saviour</hi> over to the Secular Powers, then to misrepresent him as an Enemy to <hi>Temple, and Caesar;</hi> Church, and State: and when they had arrayed him in a Mock-robe, put a Reed-sceptet in his
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:52034:152"/>
hand, and a Crown of Thorns on his head, lead him out with Triumph to be Crucified.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Enquirer</hi> being very sensible that this <hi>Conscience</hi> has been an old Enemy to the dear concerns of Ceremony, tells us feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: That <hi>unless we can pull down this usurper, we must look for no Magistracy; and except we discover the weakness and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity of this pretension, all endeavours of Restoring uniformity in the Church will be vain, and useless.</hi>

               <p>The Master-piece of <hi>Iezabels</hi> Policy was to make <hi>Naboth</hi> more then he desired to be, that he might be really less then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be. 1.

               <p>This Conscience (says he) <hi>is thought to have not only a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but a kind of praerogative, to carry with it an exemption from all humane Laws, but especially Ecclesiastical; it pretends to be Gods peculiar, and exempt from any inferiour Cognizance; Nay it looks like a Dictatorian Authority, and seems to be</hi> Legibus soluta, <hi>This (they would make us believe) can limit the Magistrate, null Laws. forbid execution, and which is more, change the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, and make that good and holy, which was wicked, and rebellious before. This can Canonize any Opinion, Legitimate any Action, warrant any extravagancy in the person that owns it, Whatsoever he thinks, can be no Heresy; and whatsoever he does, can be no sin:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which charge he has sprinkled here and there a word of Truth, for he that would be believed in <hi>a great falshood,</hi> must be sure to intersperse some <hi>little verities.</hi> Conscience is <hi>a most Absolute Monarch</hi> indeed, if it has all these praerogatives, but this is the great praerogatives of his own Conscience, to bear salfe witness against his Neighbour; and (if we may call things by their proper Names) by unworthy, scandalous insinuations, sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster reflexions, and false accusations against Dissenters, to provoke the Magistrate to proscribe them as Out-Laws. But I answer.</p>
               <p>§. 1. The highest Immunities I ever met with, ascribed to Conscience are in Bishop <hi>Saunderson,</hi> a most Zealous stickler for Ceremonies. Serm. on 14. Rom, 23. <hi>There cannot</hi> (says he) <hi>be imagined a higher contempt of God then for a Man to despise the power of his own Conscience, which is the highest under Heaven, as being Gods most immediate Deputy for the Ordering his life, and ways;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§. 2. It's a most injurious charge, if applied to Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, that <hi>Conscience can alter the nature of things, make that good which was wicked, and Rebellious before;</hi> &amp;c. All they say in

this particular is with <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thes. de Consc:</hi> 18. <q>Tanto vis est Conscientiae, ut actionem suâ naturâ mediam, efficiat Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, vel malam; &amp; suâ naturâ Bonam, reddat malam, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis illam quae suâ naturâ, mala est, non possit convertere in Bonam. </q> 
                  <hi>So great is the power of Conscience, that it can make an Action in it self indifferent, to become either good or evil</hi> (viz. to the Person) <hi>and an Action, in it's own Nature good, to become evil. Although it cannot make that which is in it's own Nature</hi> evil, <hi>to become</hi> good. Which Powers are clearly ascribed to Conscience by <hi>the Apostle.</hi> 1. The power to make <hi>an indifferent,</hi> or <hi>good action</hi> in it self, to become <hi>evil to him that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to be evil,</hi> and yet will venture upon it: 14. Rom. 14. <hi>To him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</hi> 2. It's power to make an indifferent thing <hi>good:</hi> using it to Gods Glory, with all other due circumstances, is clear also from 1. Tit. 15. <hi>Unto the pure all things are pure.</hi> But that it can <hi>alter the nature</hi> of things; that it can make an action <hi>evil in it self</hi> to become <hi>good,</hi> that it can <hi>null Laws,</hi> are such powers, as no Casuists have ever attributed to it, but those whose Consciences carry an exemption from any necessity of speaking truth, when 'tis in order to the Advancement of their cause. But it is too common for men to charge others with the wickedness of their own thoughts, and hearts, and what was once their <hi>own Old Crime,</hi> to make other mens <hi>New Accusations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. As to the Power of Conscience <hi>to excuse Errour from Heresy:</hi> we say, that there may be a <hi>material</hi> Heresy, which is not <hi>formally</hi> so: what a Man judges to be a <hi>real Truth,</hi> though possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it may be <hi>a dangerous Errour;</hi> yet unless there was <hi>Prava Dispositie</hi> as the cause of that Errour, or something of <hi>Obstinacy in the will</hi> in Adhaering to it; <hi>Errour, and Heterodoxy</hi> it is, but <hi>Heresy</hi> it cannot be; that is, it will not Denominate <hi>the Person a Heretick:</hi> Thus the Learned and judicious Mr. <hi>Hales: Heresy is an act of the will, not of the Reason; and is indeed</hi> a lye, <hi>not a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take: for else how could that saying of Austin be true.</hi> Errare pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum haereticus esse nolo. <hi>I may possibly mistake, but am resolved never to be an Heretick:</hi> That is, by a tenacious and obstinate abetting any mistake after Conviction.</p>
               <p>There are three things which we are obliged to wait upon our <hi>Enquirer in.</hi> 1. Whilst he entertains us with his discourse <hi>what Conscience is.</hi> 2. What a <hi>Tender Conscience is.</hi> 3. What <hi>priviledges, or exemptions</hi> it may claim to?</p>
               <p n="1">[1] <hi>What Conscience is: Now</hi> (says he) <hi>if men loved plain English, and to understand what they say, it is plainly this, and no more:</hi> a man's <hi>own mind, or understanding, under the distinct consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of reflecting upon himself, his own actions, and duty.</hi> He may call this <hi>plain English,</hi> if he pleases, define, and describe his <hi>own Conscience</hi> how he will, but we poor people are edified much what as with the Rhemists <hi>Parasceve, Azymes, and Paraclete;</hi> who seeing there was no remedy but they must Translate, were resolved that few should be the wiser for <hi>the translation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:52034:153"/>
There are somethings that look oddly in this Description.</p>
               <p>§. 1. It seems very improper to assign <hi>the mind or understanding</hi> for the <hi>Genus</hi> of Conscience. For Conscience is not a <hi>faculty,</hi> but an <hi>Act seated in a faculty;</hi> Or the exercise of the faculty of the understanding, putting the will upon operation: Thus that fore-mentioned Bishop. ibid. <hi>The will of Man (which is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whence all our Actions immediately flow) should conform it self to the judgment of the Practique understanding, as to it's immediate Rule, and yeeld it self to be guided by it;</hi> And indeed the Office of Conscience is not only <hi>to judge what is good or evil,</hi> according to those Notices it has of God from the light of Nature, and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor only to take Cognizance whether the will has obey'd those Dictates of the practique understanding, but to be <hi>a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor and Counsellor,</hi> nay a <hi>Commander</hi> to the <hi>will</hi> to act according to it's Discoveries of good or evil. <hi>This is good,</hi> therefore I charge thee to do it: and <hi>this is evil,</hi> therefore I command thee to avoid it.</p>
               <p>§. 2. It seems very defective, in that it tells us of <hi>the mind reflecting upon actions,</hi> and yet mentions not with Reference <hi>to whose Authority</hi> it is so pragmatical, as to meddle with those Actions: whereas all that Conscience Dictates as <hi>a Counsellour;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ll that Conscience Determines <hi>as a Iudge,</hi> is in <hi>the Name of the supream and soveraign Iehovah.</hi> 4. Jam. 12. <hi>There's one Law-giver who is able to save, and to destroy, and who are thou that judgest another? 14. Rom. 4. Who art thou that judgest another mans Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; to his own Master he standeth or falleth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. His Description seems very lame, in that he makes the whole employment of Conscience to be <hi>reflection:</hi> whereas 'tis in it's Commission to <hi>Dictate before the fact,</hi> as well as to <hi>reflect upon the fact.</hi> It teaches what we <hi>ought to do,</hi> as well as enquires and examines whether we <hi>have done well or no:</hi> And such a faiture will expose us to great mistakes in this case; as that we are not bound to examine the Lawfulness of our work before we act; but to rush Headlong upon the precipices of dubious and suspected things, and examine them afterwards at leasure. Whereas the Apostle condemns the Gentiles, especially that they knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such and such things to be evil, <hi>and worthy of Death,</hi> and yet not only <hi>did those things,</hi> but <hi>took pleasure in those that did them.</hi> 1 Rom. 32.</p>
               <p>Of such a Conscience as this he will certainly make a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable emprovement: <hi>For scarcely</hi> (says he) <hi>any man that says his Conscience is incontrollable will say, his own Opinion or Reason is</hi> the ultimate Rule <hi>of his actions.</hi> Truly I believe so, nor any man neither that says his Conscience is <hi>Controllable,</hi> except he be out of his senses: for I would sainbe in formed what <hi>an ultimate Rule</hi> signifies, with him that pretends to <hi>speak plain English,</hi> to them that understand nothing else? I have heard of a <hi>subordinate and ultimate End:</hi> And I have heard also of <hi>a near, and a Remote Rule,</hi> but an <hi>ultimate Rule</hi> like that Monster which was <hi>like a horse,</hi> and yet <hi>not a horse,</hi> is <hi>like sense,</hi> but in truth very <hi>Non-sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:52034:154"/>
All that we affirm of Conscience as 'tis <hi>a Rule,</hi> is no more but this: That it is <hi>the next,</hi> and <hi>immediate Guide, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of our Actions;</hi> And that <hi>the mind of God,</hi> however noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to us, is the <hi>next and immediate</hi> Governour, or Director of Conscience; That as nothing can possibly intervene between <hi>the Command</hi> of Conscience-, and <hi>the will and executive power</hi> in Man; so nothing can possibly interpose between <hi>the Authority of God</hi> and the Conscience; and both these are expresly owned by the above mentioned learned Person. Dr. S. 1. That God is the <hi>immediate</hi> Controller of Conscience by his word, and will reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us. <hi>Conscience</hi> (says he) <hi>is Gods most immediate Deputy, for the ordering the life, and ways of men.</hi> 2. That Conscience is the <hi>immediate Rule</hi> of our Actions; <hi>The will of Man</hi> (says he) <hi>should conform it self to the judgment of the practique understanding, as to it's proper,</hi> and immediate <hi>Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And such were once the Notions of that great Man, when he is professedly pleading the cause of Conformity, which had never been waved but that wise men are aware, the cause not to be tenable, if Conscience be not made a piece of <hi>Non-sense,</hi> whose <hi>Nature and Office</hi> are therefore <hi>inconsiderable,</hi> because <hi>unintelligible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But some wise men or other it seems have formed a parcel of objections (or else he has formed them to their hands) which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> will answer, and then suppose himself victorious.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Objection, Allowing Conscience to be nothing but the mind of Man, yet even so it's subject to no humane Laws: for as much as no Man can force me to think otherwise then I do, nor Compel me to be of his opinion, in the inward sence of my mind; my mind therefore or Conscience is only obnoxious to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which <hi>he Replies.</hi> [The <hi>answer to this is easy! for since my mind is not insallible: I may and must have something to guide my mind, and that is it which we call</hi> Law.]</p>
               <p>To which I <hi>rejoin.</hi> That this is <hi>an easy,</hi> but not a <hi>satisfactory</hi> answer. For. 1. The <hi>Remedy</hi> is not proportionable to the <hi>disease:</hi> For if the Reason why my mind must have <hi>something else to guide it,</hi> be, because <hi>the mind is not infallible:</hi> the same Reason will informe us to have recourse to a better guide then that which <hi>he calls Law,</hi> because <hi>Humane Laws are not infallible:</hi> It will mend the matter but sorrily to take me of from one <hi>fallible guide,</hi> and send me to <hi>another.</hi> 2. Since the mind of man is thus <hi>fallible,</hi> and there is a necessity that it have <hi>something else to guide it in it's determinations,</hi> God has provided an <hi>infallible directory</hi> in his word, in all things concerning his immediate Worship, and that is it which we call <hi>the Law of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But if the <hi>mind of Man be fallible</hi> in it's Directions, as well as <hi>Humane Laws,</hi> It's safer to be guided by that which God has made my <hi>next Director</hi> though <hi>fallible,</hi> then by that which being <hi>also fallible,</hi> he has <hi>not made so.</hi> God has constituted Conscience the <hi>next, and immediate Counsellour</hi> to my <hi>will,</hi> the <hi>next, and immediate Deputy</hi> under <hi>himself,</hi> and therefore to erre with <hi>a

Nor is it universally true what he says: that <hi>the Law</hi> (of Man) <hi>morally obliges</hi> (to follow it's Directions) <hi>that is, it will be my sin, if I do not:</hi> for it may be my sin, if I <hi>do obey in some cases;</hi> as well as my sin, if I <hi>do not in others;</hi> at least the Apostles were of this opinion. 4.

               <p>He replies. <hi>It's true in things notoriously, and plainly evil.—But where those</hi> (the Law of God, or Reason) <hi>are silent, there the Law of the Magistrate is the Immediate Rule of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and then to contradict that, is to affront the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Tribunal, with a private Consistory,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

That he has given away his whole cause by <hi>this one Concession.</hi> That a higher Law of God <hi>or Reasen</hi> may <hi>make a nullity in the Law of the Magistrate:</hi> for if Reason in any case may make such a nullity: it must either be <hi>the publick Reason,</hi> or <hi>the private Reason:</hi> If the former: then it amounts to no more then this goodly maxime, that <hi>the Magistrates Reason may make a nullity in his Law.</hi> But if it be the latter: that <hi>private Reason</hi> may make such a nullity, then Conscience guided, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by that Reason <hi>cannot transgress the Law,</hi> because <hi>Reason has already disannulled it,</hi> as to that particular Person: And if it be said, that it's only in things <hi>notoriously evil,</hi> that Reason has this Soveraignty to make a nullity in the Law; It's easily answered, that whatever my Reason judges evil, is notoriously evil as to me, for I have no way to make out <hi>the Notoriety of the evil of a thing,</hi> but <hi>my Reason</hi> informing it self from Gods Word.</p>
               <p>§. 2.

Person, whom he takes for a Magistrate, would no doubt have struck him though he had been a Magistrate: Every man takes the voice of Conscience to be the voice of God, and he that will disobey that Dictate which he supposes the voice of God, will disobey that dictate which really proves to be his voice.</p>

Even an erroneous Conscience bindeth thus far, that a Man cannot go against it, and be guiltless; because his practise should then run cross to his judgment, and so the thing could not be done in faith: for if</hi> his reason <hi>judge the thing to be evil, and yet he will do it, it argueth manifestly, that he hath</hi> a will to do evil, <hi>and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a Transgressour of Gods General Law, which bindeth all men to eschew all evil.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Objection:</hi> But <hi>if after all my Consideration of the Reason of publick Laws, I cannot satisfy my self of the Lawfulness of the thing commanded, I must then Govern my self by my Conscience, and not by the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He Replies. <hi>If the unlawfulness of the thing commanded is not as plain, and visible, as the Command of God for obeying Authority, my opinion, or Conscience, will be no excuse to me; Because I forsake a Certain Rule, to follow an uncertain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I <hi>Rejoin:</hi> That he has made a very <hi>unaequal Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison:</hi> viz. Between the <hi>unlawfulness of the particular thing;</hi> and the <hi>general Command of obeying:</hi> whereas the comparison ought to have been between; either <hi>Gods General Command not to act against my Conscien;</hi> and his <hi>General Command to obey Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi> or else between <hi>the unlawfulness of that particular action,</hi> and Gods Command <hi>to obey in that particular:</hi> It is plain in <hi>the General,</hi> that I ought to <hi>obey Authority.</hi> And it's as plain <hi>in the General,</hi> that I ought <hi>not to sin against the dictate of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi> It may be doubtful, and not so plain, that <hi>this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular action</hi> is sinful; but then it's doubtful, and no more plain, that <hi>in this case</hi> 'tis my duty to obey. Compare the General Law of obeying <hi>the Laws,</hi> with the general Law of <hi>not sinning against my Conscience,</hi> and it's much more plain, visible, or what he pleases, that I ought not to sin against my Conscience, then that I ought to obey the Laws of Humane appointment; for that I ought to obey the latter admits of <hi>many exceptions, but
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:52034:155"/>
that</hi> I ought not to act against the former <hi>admits of none.</hi> And if Conscience may deceive me in <hi>a particular instance;</hi> so also may the Law deceive me in <hi>the particular Command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This will more evidently appear, if we take the Ranverse of the case, thus: <hi>If the Lawfulness of</hi> the thing <hi>commanded by the Law, be not as plain and visible, as the Command of God not to act against Conscience, no Command of the Magistrate will excuse me, because I forsake a certain Rule, to follow an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God commands me <hi>to obey Authority</hi> the same God commands me <hi>not to sin against my light.</hi> In some cases I am <hi>not bound to obey Authority;</hi> but in <hi>no case am I allow'd to act against my light:</hi> It's very clear that the Magistrate has <hi>a power to Command,</hi> but <hi>not so clear</hi> that he has a power <hi>to determine things indifferent, and make those determinations the conditions of my enjoying the</hi> means of Salvation: But it's very certain, that <hi>Conscientia erre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea ligat, licet non obligat,</hi> An erroneous Conscience though it oblige me not to act against what God has made a Duty; yet it binds me up from ever acting against it's Convictions; And therefore it's safest to adhaere to <hi>the clearer side,</hi> and not to act against the Decission of Conscience, in compliance with a Command which it's uncertain <hi>whether it oblige or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in a word, if this way of our <hi>Enquirers</hi> Reasoning be solid; Then it will not excuse a Protestant from sin, who refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <hi>to how before an Image when the Magistrate Commands it;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it's plain <hi>in the general,</hi> that <hi>we ought to obey Authority,</hi> but not so plain that it's sinful <hi>to how before an Image,</hi> if things <hi>disputable</hi> be less plain then <hi>indisputable.</hi>

               <p>4. <hi>Objection:</hi> But <hi>if after all endeavours of satisfying my self to Obey the Humane Law, yet the thing commanded by the Magistrate (however innocent in it self) seems to be as plainly unlawful, as obedience is plainly a duty;</hi> What Now?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He replies,) This case is pityable, and will make some abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the sin of Disobedience, but it doth not totally excuse it, much less make a nullity in the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I <hi>Rejoin.</hi> That he has now made a very noddy of his Objector. That can suppose the thing commanded <hi>innocent in it self.</hi> and yet to <hi>seem to him as plainly unlawful as obedience is a Duty:</hi> But to the thing. 1. He has put the case very unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: For we suppose the things controverted, though Lawful in their <hi>abstracted natures,</hi> (and what actions are not so?) yet to be <hi>really unlawful in their use,</hi> upon a just ballancing of all Circumstances: for we conceive many things <hi>Lawful out of worship,</hi> which in worship are <hi>not so:</hi> Many things Lawful when used <hi>without offence,</hi> which are otherwise when they <hi>give offence to the weak:</hi> Many things Lawful when <hi>Conscience is satisfied,</hi> which are not so under it's <hi>real dissatisfactions;</hi> many things <hi>Lawful to be used,</hi> under <hi>the power of which 'tis sinful to be brought:</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:52034:156"/>
2. We say not that Conscience makes <hi>a nullity in the Law,</hi> but that under present Circumstances it will not suffer us to act: But if we had said so, we might perhaps have drunk in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion from his own words so lately quoted. <hi>Some higher Law of God, or Reason, by which my Conscience is guided, hath in that case made a nullity in the Law of the Magistrate.</hi> 3.

               <p>When <hi>Iosiah</hi> that great Pattern of all Royal virtues, the great instance of ripe Grace in green years had heard the book of the Law read, with those dreadful comminations thundred out against prevarication in that holy Law, and had duly consider'd how his people had incurred <hi>the menaces</hi> by violating <hi>the praecepts</hi> thereof, he <hi>rent his cloaths, and went to Enquire of the Lord.</hi> who gives him this Answer: <hi>Because thy heart was Tender, and thou hast humbled thy self, I also have heard thee, saith the Lord,</hi> 2. Kin. 22. 19.</p>
               <p>Wisdom it self has taught us: That <hi>the man is happy that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth always; but he that hardens himself, shall fall into mischief. 28. Prov.</hi> 14. They that know the World is thick sown with snares, and those snares baited with suitable temptations, will see Reason to walk very cautelously towards the world, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Godly jealousy over themselves, least they be surprized with the deceitfulness of sin: But there are a daring sort of jolly Adventurers, that fear no colours; that will come up to the mouth of a Canon, that neither regard Gods threatnings, or warnings, the Devils stratagems, or the Ambuscadoes of the flesh, but being fool-hardy, make a mock of sin, and all preciseness about it; who think it a piece of gallantry to dance on the brink of that praecipice, that hangs over the bottomless pit, and can find no fitter essays of their valour, and skill, then how to come within a hairs-breadth of Hell, and yet not tumble in. And these are the men <hi>that fall into mischief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This tenderness of heart being of so great price in the sight of God, we must expect it will not escape long the severe lashes of virulent spirits; but it will be difficult to persecute a thing so innocent before it be exposed, and therefore they advise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from <hi>Amnon's</hi> example, who first <hi>defiled,</hi> and then <hi>reviled</hi> his Sister <hi>Tamar.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A tender Conscience</hi> (saith this Compassionate Enquirer) <hi>is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but either an ignorant or uninstructed mind, or a sickly,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:52034:156"/>
melancholy, and superstitious understanding,</hi> which he might more concisely have described without this vast expense of words. <hi>A tender Conscienced person is one that has a soft place in's Head:</hi> or had he but spoke <hi>in plain English,</hi> as he did in the Definition of Conscience. He is <hi>a most profound Coxcomb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They who preach this Doctrine <hi>to the World,</hi> might with the same labour, and almost equal honesty, preach God <hi>out of the World:</hi> for whoever would dethrone God from the heart, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers but an impotent Ambition to pluck him down from his throne in Heaven: But when they have run through all their vain methods to excusse his soveraignty, God will maintain to himself an Authority in the Conscience.</p>
               <p>Nay this will destroy <hi>the Magistrates power</hi> also in a while, for whose sake the Contrivance is pretended; for when subjects are once instructed so far to debauch conscience, that though we judge an action sinful, yet we may do it, it will lead to this easy inference, that though we judge the Magistrates Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Lawful, yet we may disobey them: for as we say, when men have got a hole in their hearts, one concern will drop through after another without regret.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Italians</hi> would call any one <hi>Fool</hi> with an <hi>Emphasis,</hi> they say <hi>He is a Christian!</hi> Hence forwards when the Devil would shame his modester Servants from cowardise in sinning, he has a nickname for them, these are your <hi>men of tender Consciences!</hi> And that which has been <hi>a Holy Engine</hi> of Gods wisdom to secure from sin, shall now become the <hi>Devils Machine</hi> to flish raw novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in it.</p>
               <p>That <hi>a tender Conscience is a good Conscience,</hi> has been hetherto presumed by all our Divines; and I never met with a Collect in the Liturgy of any Church that taught us to pray <hi>from the great plague of a tender Conscience, Good Lord deliver us?</hi> which yet if it be <hi>so great a judgment,</hi> we may presume they would have done. But the <hi>Enquirer</hi> is of another judgment, and perhaps may proselite us with his Reasons.</p>
               <p>1. Reason. <hi>Tenderness cannot be taken in the same Latitude with a good Conscience, every good man has such a tenderness as to be affraid of sin, and to decline the occasions of it:</hi> If this argument has any strength in it, it must be because every <hi>good man</hi> is a Fool: But why I pray cannot a good, and a tender Conscience meet in every good man? Oh the Reason is this, <hi>It would be too arrogant and presumptuous for those that plead the tenderness of their Consciences to suppose themselves the only men that make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of what they do.</hi> But if <hi>a tender Conscience</hi> be <hi>a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> it will be nevertheless good, because some unjustly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, or others unjustly revile it. Dissenters do not suppose themselves the only men that make a Conscience of what they do; It suffices them to enjoy the peace of their own without daring to judge other mens Consciences.</p>
               <p>2. Reason: <hi>Because</hi> (says he) <hi>Then the contrary to it must be a brawny Conscience.</hi> Well! what hurt is there in that? <hi>Soft and

But a brawny or hard Conscience cannot be contrary to a tender Conscience, ergo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. He that has nothing else to do with his time, let him abuse it in answering such Syllogisms.</p>
               <p>Ay! but (says he) <hi>this would be too contumelious to reproach all men but themselves with:</hi> very admirable! As if the no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>This way of Arguing is a shooe that will fit any mans foot, serve any mans occasions, as will as the owners.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Tender Conscience</hi> cannot be an <hi>ignorant mind,</hi> for it would be too presumptuous and Arrogant for those that reproach it to account themselves the only wise men on earth: And then the contrary to it must be an <hi>inlightned mind;</hi> and it would be too contumelious to reproach all the world for Fools but their own precious selves.</p>

               <p>But the best of our Entertainment is yet behind: for he will now read a very <hi>Learned Lecture</hi> to this <hi>Tender Conscience:</hi> which in my weak judgment is monstrously absurd, seeing he supposes his <hi>Auditors to be all Fools.</hi> Men of <hi>ignorant minds, or sickly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings:</hi> The business lyes here, how a Tender Conscience must be qualified, that it may enjoy it's <hi>Priviledges?</hi>

               <p>§. 1. <hi>He that pleads for compassion upon the account of his weakness</hi> (that is his Tenderness) <hi>must be so ingenious as to submit himself to Instruction:</hi> And if <hi>the Enquirer</hi> must be <hi>the Instructer;</hi> He deserves to wear <hi>a Fools Coat</hi> for his pains, for I would gladly learn that as <hi>the first Lecture;</hi> what is the Nice, and Critical difference between <hi>a Tender,</hi> and <hi>a Compassionate Enquirer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two points they say of wisdom, the <hi>first</hi> that we be able to <hi>advise our selves,</hi> the <hi>second,</hi> that being Conscious of our own inability, we be willing to submit to the advise of others,

               <p>The Apostle Paul was <hi>a publick Person,</hi> and one as well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to discern, and impose things indifferent, as any that have made the fairest pretences that way, and yet he Professes with more then ordinary servency. 1.

The Church has served God decently, lived peaceably, and glorified God eminently without them, and in his time may do so again. 2. <hi>Flesh</hi> was a thing perfectly <hi>indifferent in it self,</hi> and owned so by all that were well instructed in their Manumission from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical servitude; but the more we are faithfully instructed in the Doctrine of Christian Liberty, the more are we satisfied, that we are at Liberty from all other Ceremonies of men as well as from those that were once of Divine Institution.</p>

Christ dyed.</hi> 14. Rom. 15. And that there is no comparison between the Law that <hi>enjoins Ceremonies,</hi> and that Law that commands us <hi>not to offend our Brother,</hi> I thus prove: 1. The Law that <hi>forbids scandal,</hi> is <hi>Negative:</hi> but the Law that commands Ceremonies, is but <hi>Affirmative.</hi> Now <hi>Gods own affirmative precepts</hi> may have their <hi>outward acts</hi> suspended in some cases for some time; but <hi>Negatives</hi> admit of no relaxation; He that says <hi>thou shalt not do,</hi> says, <hi>thou shalt never do;</hi> unless dispensed with by a power aequal to his that gave the Prohibition. 2. The Command of <hi>not scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing</hi> is purely <hi>moral,</hi> the heart, and life of the sixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; For he that says <hi>thou shalt not Kill,</hi> primarily intends I shall not <hi>destroy the soul:</hi> but the Command of Ceremonies but <hi>positive;</hi> And <hi>positives</hi> ought to give place to <hi>Morals:</hi> If there be any Truth in that Doctrine of the <hi>Enquirers:</hi> That <hi>Godlays little stress upon Circumstantials:</hi> that his <hi>own positive Laws</hi> give place to <hi>the Moral Law:</hi> much more ought <hi>Mans Ceremonial Law</hi> give place to Gods Moral Law: <hi>Thou shalt not Kill.</hi> 3. The Command of not giving offence, because <hi>Moral,</hi> is therefore <hi>perpetual,</hi> but the Command of Ceremonies Temporary, and may be momentany, for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> 34. Art. Asserts a power in every National Church, <hi>not only to ordain, but to change, and abolish Ceremonies.</hi> 4.

                     </gap>,</hi> the thing it self is good in it self, and for it self, though no positive Command had interposed in the case; but Ceremonies have no other Goodness, but what is breath'd into them by the breath of Man, which if it were measured by the good effects, would be found very little. 5. The Command <hi>not to offend,</hi> is <hi>unquestionably obligatory,</hi> but that Command for Ceremonies is at best questionable whether it be so much as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. 6. The Command to avoid offence, has a direct and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency to beget and preserve Amity and unity amongst Christians; but the Command of Ceremonies apparently has occasion'd Divisions between Protestants, and Papists, between Protestants themselves, between those of the same Nations, and all Humane Terms of Church-communion necessarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the same bitter fruit. 7. The power of ordering the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest matter in the Church, must conform to the Soveraign end of edification. 2. Cor. 13. 10.—<hi>The power which the Lord hath given me for edification, and not Destruction;</hi> But no power may suspend my duty of pleasing my Brother to his edification. 8.

               <p>To <hi>scandalize,</hi> or <hi>give offence,</hi> may be taken either in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary sense, and so it denotes <hi>a culpable giving occasion to a Brother to sin,</hi> or in a lower and secondary sense, for the <hi>anger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and displeasing of a Brother.</hi> This distinction well observed would unravel much confusion, which pesters our discourses.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we compare the displeasing of <hi>a private person,</hi> with that of <hi>a publick,</hi> the latter is more <hi>sinful,</hi> and much more <hi>dangerous,</hi> for <hi>the wrath of a King is like the roaring of a Lyon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To occasion culpably <hi>a publick person</hi> to sin, is more heinous, then to occasion the sin of <hi>a private person,</hi> because the sins of those in eminent places have such a fatal influence upon the peoples <hi>pollution,</hi> and the procurement of Gods displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But if we compare a scandal in the <hi>primary</hi> sense, with one in the <hi>secondary,</hi> then it's no measuring cast, whether it be more eligible to <hi>displease</hi> the one, or destroy the other: Nor can there be sin in <hi>displeasing</hi> one, when I cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise please, but by destroying the other: for though my own folly may possibly so ensnare me; yet God never puts me under such Circumstances, that I shall be necessitated to sin:</p>

You have heard his fair <hi>concession,</hi> now take his <hi>Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> along with you: <hi>That is</hi> (says he) <hi>in those things that are matters of no Law, but left free,</hi> and <hi>undeterminate, there the Rule of the Apostle takes place.</hi> 15. Rom. 1. 2. <hi>We that are strong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please our selves:</hi> And, <hi>let every one of us please his Neighbour for his good to edification,</hi> and we will add. 14.

               <p>This is the last retreat of these Gentlemen: Hether they retrire as to their <hi>Triary,</hi> and strong Reserves. You ought <hi>to bear the infirmities of the weak,</hi> to <hi>edify him</hi> heavenwards, not <hi>to murder his soul,</hi> till a Law be made <hi>to the contrary,</hi> you are <hi>bound in Charity, and compassion</hi> to such a one, till you receive further Orders, and then you must be <hi>savage, and barbarous:</hi> But his Reasons follow.</p>
               <p>1. Reason: because <hi>we may not do evil that good may come:</hi> The sinews of which Reason lye in a supposition: that to <hi>omit a Ceremony,</hi> is an evil thing, compared with <hi>the saving of a soul.</hi> This General Rule may be applied that other way: we must <hi>not do evil that Good may come;</hi> and therefore may not draw <hi>a poor Brother into sin, that
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:52034:160"/>
some good</hi> may come by it; and the rather, if we consider <hi>what good</hi> comes by it. As the saving my self <hi>a pecuniary mulct;</hi> or Recognizing, <hi>the Magistrates power to Command;</hi> which may be done, and is so in many ways, wherein the scandal of another is not concern'd; And if I should transgress a Ceremony, or so, for the saving of a soul, we may Lawfully presume upon <hi>the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> will of the Legislator, that <hi>no positive Command</hi> of his should be so rigorously insisted on, when it would destroy a greater good.</p>
               <p>2. Reason: <hi>We must not break the Laws of God or man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ut of an</hi> humour of complaisance <hi>to a Brother:</hi> Ans: To discharge a weighty duty, to avoid the scandalizing of a Brother, to <hi>walk charitably:</hi> which the <hi>Enquirer</hi> p. 137. (when he had occasion to magnify Charity) tells us <hi>is an essential part of Religion:</hi> ought not to be put of with a frothy Droll, as if it were nothing but the humour of Complaisance.</p>
               <p>The Apostle whose head understood the speculation, and whose heart entertained the love of this Doctrine much better then himself, has taught us other things: That <hi>to sin against the Brethren, is to sin against Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 12. 'Tis to <hi>destroy with our meats</hi> (indifferent things) <hi>him for whom Christ dyed,</hi> 14. Rom. 15. And if these be matters of <hi>humour, and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance,</hi> and we should venture a Ceremony for them, it would be but to stake one Complement against another.</p>
               <p>3. Reason: <hi>In those times</hi> (says he) <hi>the Magistrate being Pagan, took no care of the Church, nor had passed any Laws concerning the management of the Christian Religion: And so Christians had a great deal of scope, and room for mutual condescension.—But the case is quite otherwise when there's a Law in being,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Really, the Pagan Magistrate was very much overseen, unless perhaps he knew nothing less or more of his Authority over things indifferent; and then the Apostles must needs be to blame, who never inform'd him of that Power over the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Christ had e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The <hi>Enquirer</hi> instructed us, p. 144. that <hi>such a Society as a Church,</hi> could never <hi>be conserved without some Rites or other,</hi> nor <hi>any publick Worship be performed if all Ceremonies, and Circumstances such as of time, place, persons, and the like, be left indefinite, and undetermined.</hi> He has told us since, that the power of Determining and Defining these things ly's in <hi>our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours who understand the Civil Policy.</hi> p. 151. And now he tells us, That <hi>in those</hi> (primitive) <hi>times the Magistrate had passed no Laws concerning the manage of the Christian Religion:</hi> so that it was impossible that either <hi>Church Government</hi> should
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:52034:160"/>
be Lawfully administred, or <hi>publick Worship</hi> duely performed, because the Apostles were negligent in informing the Emperour of his power, or he careless in performing his duty.</p>

               <p>But to satisfy that Assertion, I shall offer further these pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It cannot appear that the Roman Emperours had any such Commission as is supposed to make that <hi>no duty,</hi> which God had made <hi>a duty.</hi> To make it <hi>no sin to give offence,</hi> which otherwise had been <hi>a sin:</hi> nor to add New Terms of Communion, or to shut out of the Church those whom the fundamental Laws of Christ would receive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This principle of his Reflects most scandalously upon the greatest Temporal Mercy which God ever vouch safed his Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; I mean <hi>the Christian Magistrate:</hi> for it implies, that the condition of Christians was much more easy under <hi>the Pagan,</hi> then under <hi>the Christian Magistrate. Then</hi> (says he) <hi>the Christians had a great deal of scope, and room for mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension:</hi> but now they are crowded up by restrictions. Then the Worship of God was <hi>not clog'd</hi> with needless Ceremonies, but now it's incumbred with <hi>New Terms</hi> of Communion. I might then have relieved a weak Conscience. <hi>But the case is quite oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And when all is done, it's a question whether the Ceremonies are <hi>so grateful</hi> to the <hi>greater and more considerable part?</hi> many learned and pious Ministers, many sincere and sober Christians make a rubbing-shift to get them down, accounting them <hi>tolerable,</hi> though not <hi>eligible;</hi> to these they are <hi>not grateful,</hi> but as <hi>a burden</hi> of which they cannot fairly discharge themselves, may be <hi>grateful;</hi> and leave but them at Liberty, and it will soon be visible, that the matters of our differences are not grateful either to the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or <hi>more Considerable part</hi> of the Nation.</p>

The <hi>time of these instructions,</hi> that it may be competent to work upon our minds, will be a Considerable Circumstance. I have read of one who being asked, <hi>What God was?</hi> Desired a <hi>days time</hi> to consider of that important que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: and when that was expired, he desired two, then four, still doubling his time, as he had doubled his diligence in his study of the Point: I am verily perswaded the more impartially, and sedulously any one shall examine the matters in Controversy, the more Reason he will find to crave more time for his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and if he arrives not at <hi>a Plerophory that</hi> the things are <hi>sinful,</hi> he shall never be able to reach <hi>a full assurance</hi> that

               <p>I must for a conclusion entreat the Reader to Recollect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and remember where abouts <hi>his lesson</hi> is. In Part. 2. Ch. 1.

In these things we have been indoctrinated without reasonable proof, and we are, or have Reason to be as far from satisfaction as we
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:52034:162"/>

               <p>Many Clergy-men measure the Wisdom, Grace, Mercy, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and Bounty of Princes to their Subjects, by their own narrow, and incapable hearts; Thus when one told <hi>Alexander,</hi> that his bounty was too large to bestow upon a subject; He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd; Tell not me what's meet for him <hi>to Receive,</hi> but what's fit for <hi>Alexander</hi> to <hi>give:</hi> Princes are called <hi>Gods,</hi> and they then most eminently answer <hi>their Names,</hi> when they imitate him who Commands the Sun impartially to shed abroad his beams upon the habitable world, not taking the proportions of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to his Creatures, from <hi>the malice, and envy</hi> of some, or the little merits of others.</p>
               <p>The Story of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> is as remarkable as common: <hi>Ve dius Pollio</hi> had once invited this Emperour to a Treat; whilst they were in the Gallery, comes in a poor Slave, with <hi>death</hi> in his face, and <hi>Hope</hi> in his hast, cast himself at the Emperours feet, and humbly begs, he might suffer a less cruel death, then his Patron <hi>Pollio</hi> had doomed him to: <hi>Augustus</hi> was surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and upon enquiry into the matter, understands, that this Boy had accidentally broken some of his Masters <hi>Chrystal Glasses,</hi> wherein he greatly delighted, for which fact his furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Master had inhumanely condemned him to be thrown into a Pond, there to be devoured by the <hi>Canibal Lampreys:</hi> And this was the Reason of his so confident Application, to the grace of Soveraign Majesty: <hi>Augustus</hi> transported with the novelty of so Barbarous punishment, commanded the rest of the Glasses to be broken, and the Fish-pond to be filled up: That there might either be no occasion for such passion, or not the means to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it.</p>
               <p>Let therefore the <hi>Enquirer</hi> know, who with his smooth <hi>Praela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Charity</hi> has given up Dissenters to <hi>the Rods and Axes,</hi> that they will Honour and obey the King, under all those penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which it shall please his wisdom to inflict; And if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so serviceable in well-doing, will endeavour to suffer for well-doing, with a heart so submissive, and a conversation so inoffensive, that shall make their enemies more repine at the Glory of their sufferings, then the eye-sore of their indulgence;</p>
               <p>Nor yet dare they despair of the clemency of their Soveraign, who having suffered hard things in his own sacred person, has learnt to pitty them who do suffer: But if this <hi>Compassionate Enquiry</hi> be all the <hi>instruction</hi> they must expect for their <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> the Non-conformists may have Reason to say, they are <hi>illfed, and worse taught.</hi>

And yet I must needs say, that the good name, and <hi>moderate Repute</hi> of every <hi>Christian,</hi> much more of every <hi>Minister of the Gospel,</hi> ought to be of that value to him, as not to prostitute it to every <hi>three half penny temptation,</hi> nor to render it cheap by Levity, and inconstancy, when no more cogent Reasons are offer'd for an alteration, then <hi>meer will, and pleasure:</hi> nor has any one thing more debased the honour of Christianity, nor weakened the success of the Ministry, then that some of those who wear those glorious Liveries, have either fullied them in the dirt, or turned them <hi>wrong s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Yet that we may not prove sturdy Okes, but flexible Willows, the <hi>Enquirer</hi> has two waighty things to say to us.</p>

I hope then he will allow it to be <hi>a manly generosity, and a Christian virtue</hi> to keep our <hi>minds unchanged,</hi> to assert our own convictions, till those <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of better reason</hi> shall appear which may change them, and that it would be <hi>a childish pusillanimity.</hi> to change <hi>our practise,</hi> till <hi>better reason</hi> shall oblige us to change <hi>our minds:</hi> but I am fearful, though upon <hi>mature deliberation</hi> we fix our minds accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the dictates of the best reason we can get, yet shall we not avoid trouble till we conform them to <hi>the publick reason.</hi> But (says he) <hi>the very temper which our Saviour requires of his Disciples, and which is the great preparatory disposition to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:52034:164"/>
of Christianity, especially consists in a simplicity of mind, and an indifferency to comply with whatsoever shall best recommend it self to our faculties.</hi> Well! Dissenters say they have already <hi>complied with that which has best recommended it self to their faculties,</hi> shall they be secured from vexation upon such complyance? They resolve never to be <hi>Non-conformists to their own faculties!</hi> Still I doubt that they who have invented <hi>a publick wisdom, a publick reason, a publick</hi> Conscience, will set their wits on work once more to contrive <hi>a publick faculty</hi> wherein those <hi>publick powers</hi> may reside, for it's but congruous that the <hi>publick Treasure</hi> should be deposited in <hi>a publick Treasury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am all this while at a loss where our <hi>Saviour</hi> has required this same <hi>indifferency,</hi> unless perhaps where he says, <hi>He that will be my Disciple, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.</hi> An indifferency of spirit towards <hi>every thing</hi> is an excellent preparatory towards <hi>just nothing.</hi> And the best temper (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Such has been the Policy of our <hi>Romish Emissaries;</hi> To endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reduce the dissenting world to <hi>Atheism,</hi> that they might be prepared to receive the impressions of their <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licism;</hi> and upon this Maxime was the Counsel founded their great <hi>Boverius</hi> gave to a greater person fortified with more grace then to take it. <hi>Ut quoniam v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <q>That seeing your Majesty is now going to search for the true Religion, before you fall upon the work, you would first suspect every Religion: and that you would be pleased so long to suspend your assent, and consent to the Faith, and Religion of the Protestants, as you are engaged in the disquisition of the Truth.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) The second thing he has to say to us is, <hi>That the Honour of our Religion is of more value then our personal Reputation,</hi> Still orthodox! but the <hi>Honour of Religion</hi> is very little secured by the Professors adapting themselves to that which has the vogue, and carries no other advantage but that of power to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and back it: Christianity will shine with it's own native beams, without sinful complyances: Nor need we fear but that Christian Magistrates will cast a benign aspect upon the <hi>Religious,</hi> though the <hi>Religion</hi> was never of their Composure: They like it the better, because their <hi>Saviour</hi> made it, and not they: And how high soever God has set them above their subjects, it's their greatest glory to stoop as low to a Redeemer, as the meanest Peasant. Christianity in it's naked simplicity, and most modest attire disturbes no forms of Government, but is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:52034:165"/>
suited by the wisdom of Christ to all modes of Civil Policy: And if we may speak according to the <hi>best evidences of the reason,</hi> and own that which <hi>recommends it self to our faculties,</hi> a Monatch may be as absolute without the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and other unnecessary Additions, as with them:</p>
               <p>§. 2. A second insinuation is, That Non-conformists are <hi>turbulent, unperswadable, ungovernable;</hi> That their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples have a malignant influence upon Government; And for the more dexterous management of this suspicion he tells us, <hi>That it's a great blot in the writings of Calvin, that after he had discoursed rarely well of the power of Princes, and the duty of Subjects, he undoes all again with an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py exception in these words: De privatis hominibus semper loquor.</hi> I see if Calvin has but <hi>one blot,</hi> the <hi>Enquirer</hi> will hit it, so quicksighted he is, that none must Hope to take him with <hi>a why not?</hi> I meet indeed with an Eagle-eyed Jesuite, who to palliate the villanies of their own Society, would gladly pick a hole in <hi>Calvins</hi> Coat, but the Reverend, and Protestant Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> roundly takes him up thus: <hi>Calvin is so well known to those that be learned, and wise for his great pains, and good labours in the Church of God, that a few suarling Fryers cannot impeach his good Name, though you never so wretchedly pervert his words.</hi> And yet the Bishops book came sorth <hi>cum Privilegio,</hi> and was dedicated to <hi>Q. Elizabeth,</hi> by one very tender in the point of Supremacy, and Prerogative. Dialog. p. 509. But <hi>Calvins</hi> greatest crime was his Syncretism with the <hi>Doctrine of the Church,</hi> and not his enmity to <hi>the Civil Government.</hi> And because a shred cut of from the whole piece of his Discourse may easily through ignorance be misconstrued, or through malice misrepresented to his prejudice. I shall present his words at large to the Reader. </p>

These are those dismal lines which have raised the clamour against poor <hi>Calvin,</hi> wherein thou wilt observe these particulars. 1.

And 5. the guilt he charges upon these popular Magistrates for betraying their trust, arises from this alone, that they <hi>connived at the miserable harassings of the Comonalty,</hi> they took no notice at all of the invasions upon the Subjects Rights, and proprieties: which they might have done, and never have mingled heaven and earth together with civil broyles. And what can an ordinary eye espy hence, that should justify the <hi>Enquirers</hi> out-cry <hi>a passage</hi> (says he) <hi>of that ill Aspect upon Government, that it is suspected by some, and not altogether without cause, that most of the Confusions of Kingdoms, that have happen'd since, and especially the troubles of this Nation, have received encouragement, if not taken rise from hence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this <hi>Enquirer</hi> (or any other) has formerly contributed to the confusions and troubles of this, or any other Nation, and received encouragement from this place of <hi>Calvin,</hi> he ought first to be deeply humbled before God, that he should draw such desperate conclusions as those of Rebellion out of an innocent sentence, and give more essential proofs, and signal marks of repentance, then accepting a benefice of three or four hundred <hi>per annum;</hi> and secondly, be ashamed that he ventur'd to read <hi>Calvin,</hi> before he could well construe a piece of plain Latin, for I cannot understand that <hi>Calvin,</hi> though he was bound to write true Latin, was also bound to help every one to a construing book; no no, God obliged to prevent all the evil consequences which an evil heart, and base lusts might draw out of the most inoffensive expressions.</p>
