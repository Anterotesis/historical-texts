            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the year of our Lord 1663. <hi>May</hi> 28. upon an Invitation from my only Brother, I departed from <hi>London,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Boston,</hi> the chief Town in the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> a Colony of <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> the 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boston</hi> (whose longitude is 315 deg. and 42 deg. 30 min. of North Latitude) is built on the South-west side of a Bay large enough for the Anchorage of 500 Sail of Ships, the Buildings are handsome, joyning one to the other as in <hi>London,</hi> with many large streets, most of them paved with pebble stone, in the high street to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Common there are fair Buildings some of stone, and at the East End of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60068:5"/>
Town one amongst the rest, built by the Shore by Mr. <hi>Gibs</hi> a Merchant, being a stately Edifice, which it is thought will stand him in little less than 3000 <hi>l.</hi> before it be fully finished. The Town is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Parishes, yet they have three fair Meeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>houses or Churches, which hardly suffice to receive the Inhabitants and Strangers that come in from all parts.</p>
            <p>Having refreshed my self here for some time, and opportunely lighting upon a passage in a Bark belonging to a Friend of my Brothers, and bound to the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I put to sea again, and on the Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>August</hi> I arrived at <hi>Black-point,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Scarborow,</hi> the habitation of my beloved Brother, being about an hundred leagues to the Eastward of <hi>Boston;</hi> here I resided eight years, and made it my business to discover all along the Natural, Physical, and Chyrurgical Rarities of this New-found World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New-England</hi> is said to begin at 40 and to end at 46 of Northerly Latitude, that is from <hi>de la Ware</hi> Bay to <hi>New-found-Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sea Coasts are accounted whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somest, the East and South Winds coming

            </p>
            <p>The Country generally is Rocky and Mountanous, and extremely overgrown with wood, yet here and there beautified with large rich Valleys, wherein are Lakes ten, twenty, yea sixty miles in compass, out of which our great Rivers have their Beginnings.</p>
            <p>Fourscore miles (upon a direct line) to the Northwest of <hi>Scarborow,</hi> a Ridge of Mountains run Northwest and Northeast an hundred Leagues, known by the name of the <hi>White Mountains,</hi> upon which lieth Snow all the year, and is a Land-mark twenty miles off at Sea. It is rising ground from the Sea shore to these Hills, and they are inaccessible but by the Gullies which the dissolved Snow hath made; in these Gullies grow <hi>Saven</hi> Bushes, which being taken hold of are a good help to the climbing Discoverer; upon the top of the highest of these Mountains is a large Level
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60068:6"/>
or Plain of a days journey over, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing grows but Moss; at the farther end of this Plain is another Hill called the <hi>Sugar-loaf,</hi> to outward appearance a rude heap of massie stones piled one upon another, and you may as you ascend step from one stone to another, as if you were going up a pair of stairs, but winding still about the Hill till you come to the top, which will require half a days time, and yet it is not above a Mile, where there is also a Level of about an Acre of ground, with a pond of clear water in the midst of it; which you may hear run down, but how it ascends is a mystery. From this rocky Hill you may see the whole Country round about; it is far above the lower Clouds, and from hence we beheld a Vapour (like a great Pillar) drawn up by the Sun Beams out of a great Lake or Pond into the Air, where it was formed into a Cloud. The Country beyond these Hills Northward is daunting terrible, being full of rocky Hills, as thick as Mole-hills in a Meadow, and cloathed with infinite thick Woods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New-England</hi> is by some affirmed to be an Island, bounded on the North with the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60068:6"/>
River <hi>Canada</hi> (so called from Monsieur <hi>Cane</hi>) on the South with the River <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hegan</hi> or <hi>Hudsons</hi> River, so called because he was the first that discovered it. Some will have <hi>America</hi> to be an Island, which out of question must needs be, if there be a Northeast passage found out into the South Sea; it contains 1152400000 Acres. The discovery of the Northwest passage (which lies within the River of <hi>Canada</hi>) was undertaken with the help of some Protestant <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> which left <hi>Canada</hi> and retired to <hi>Boston</hi> about the year 1669. The Northeast people of <hi>America,</hi> i. e. <hi>New-England, &amp;c.</hi> are judged to be <hi>Tartars</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Samoades,</hi> being alike in complexion, shape, habit and manners, (see the <hi>Globe:</hi>) Their Language is very significant, using but few words, every word having a diverse signification, which is exprest by their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; as when they hold their head of one side the word signifieth one thing, holding their hand up when they pronounce it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth another thing. Their Speeches in their Assemblies are very gravely delivered, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in perfect <hi>Hexamiter</hi> Verse, with great silence and attention, and answered again <hi>ex tempore</hi> after the same manner.</p>

They commonly have four or five young ones, and when they go away, which is much about the time that Swallows use to depart, they never fail to throw down one of their young Birds into the room by way of Gratitude.

            <p>The Men are somewhat Horse Fac'd, and generally Faucious, i. e. without Beards; but the Women many of them
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60068:55"/>
have very good Features; seldome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Come to me, or Cos Amoris, in their Countenance; all of them black Eyed, having even short Teeth, and very white; their Hair black, thick and long, broad Breasted; handsome streight Bodies, and slender, considering their constant loose habit: Their limbs cleanly, straight, and of a convenient stature, generally, as plump as Partridges, and saving here and there one, of a modest deportment.</p>
            <p>Their Garments are a pair of Sleeves of Deer, or Moose skin drest, and drawn with lines of several Colours into Asiatick Works, with Buskins of the same, a short Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Trading Cloath, either Blew or Red, fastened with a knot under the Chin, and girt about the middle with a Zone, wrought with white and blew Beads into pretty Works; of these Beads they have Bracelets for their Neck and Arms, and Links to hang in their Ears, and a fair Table curiously made up with Beads likewise, to wear before their Breast; their Hair they Combe backward, and tye it up short with a Border, about two handfulls broad,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60068:55"/>
wrought in Works as the other with their Beads: But enough of this.</p>
