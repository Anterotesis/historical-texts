            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The cawses of controuersie thow maist herby perceaue to be no light or small matters concerning things indifferent or some fewe trifling ceremonies, (as they haue long labored to make the world beleeue (although euen those least litle trifles being brought into &amp; thrust by way of law vpon the church hauing no warrant in the testament of Christ ought not to be suffred for the space of an howre) but most high &amp; vvaightie are these matters, concerning the whole building of the church: whith is affirmed to be altogether out of order from the verie foundation to the top, &amp; not according to the patterne of Christs testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t either in the people, ministerie, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, vvorship, gouernment, order, al things out of frame, such as can neither stand before the face of Christ, neither may anie of Gods children ioine vnto vvith promise of salvation. Now the course the BBs &amp; their cleargie haue taken, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue themselues vnto all men to be no such deceitfull vvork men theire building to be no such vvood, hay, stubble, hath not beene to bring their vvorkes to the light, &amp; to submit yt &amp; themselues, to be measured by the golden reed of Gods word, therby iustifying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, conuincing and perswading others: But in stead of this, they first imprison all such as make anie scruple or question of theire doings: yea all such as but speake against them, they shut vp in close pryson, there to continewe vvithout bayle or mainprice, all the daies of theire life, except they submit &amp; recant: Some they cast into most noisome &amp; vile dungeons, without ayre, foode, bedds, or so much as strawe to lye vppon, keeping them from theire vvyues, children, trades labours, to the vtter vndoing &amp; affamishment of them, their

wyues, &amp; children; Others they lade, with as manie yrons as they can beare; som others they a while produced to the Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, there indicting them as recusants vppon the Statute made for the Papists; publishing them by theire prynt with priuiledg Anabaptists, Hereticks, Schismaticks, Sectories, Donatists, Conuenticlers, seditious, turbulent; sparsing abrode through all the land certeine Articles of theire owne deuising against them, to bring them into hatred vvith the vvhole land. vvher vnto also they haue not spared theire toungs, in theire pulpits, where euery one of theire priests might forge what opinion he lyst against them, &amp; confute it with the same mouth, in theire name: and all this, vvithout once producing them, to anie chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian triall vvhere they might haue place giuen them, to defend themselues, &amp; produce theire reasons, or once endeuoring to perswade or confute them by anie one place of scripture; Yet not content with all this, they can take no rest in themselues, or thincke theire kingdome safe, vntill they haue deuoured the pray they haue taken, &amp; rydd them out of the way, vvhich vvil not bow downe, &amp; vvorship the Beast, &amp; his image. And he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reunto (hauing no hope to accomplish theire bloudy purpose, by the common law of the land, seing they can finde no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against these men, except it be in the law of theire God) they of late contriued this new spanish conference, sending certeine of theire select souldiours vnto them into theire prisons, there by way of conference to fish from them som matter, vvherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon they might accuse them to theire holy fathers the BBs, who theruppon might delyuer them, as conuicts of heresie vnto the secular povvers. But blessed be God, that in these points, hath hevved theire hornes shorter in the beginning of her Ma<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. reigne, not allowing that to be heresie, which they should so pronounce, but what they by the scrip. should so proue: againe no heresie to be capitall or punished by death, but what by the first. 4. Councells, &amp; by the scriptures, was so adiudged: els had they by this, shed more innocent &amp; christian bloud, then euer theire predecessors did in this land before them. But now, as they will at no hand, be drawen vnto this peaceable &amp; chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian triall, to haue these matters decided &amp; iudged, by the word of God; so haue they not gayned that they sought by these theire messengers, who (through the power of God) were intangled in theire owne vvords, not being able to spurne against the pricks, or to get such matter at the hands of these prysoners as they sought: Which, they espying, followed not the sute half so hote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they were inioyned, comming but twice, vvhereas they ought to haue com tvvice euery vveeke, at the least: At which
<pb facs="tcp:1354:3"/>
tymes, how they behaued themselues, let such as were present report; and also such as read these conferences iudge, vvhat cause they haue to exclaime, &amp; accuse of heresie &amp;c. such as call them to the testament of Christ, &amp; would haue theire whole Church, &amp; all theire proceedings therin, buylt theruppon. Which course they are so far from receauing, as they open theire mouthes bouldly into a most high blasphemie, against God, &amp; his tabernacle, &amp; them that dwel in the heauen; theire handes they haue armed to viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, theire feete are swift to shed bloud, seeking by all subtile &amp; indirect meanes to suppresse the truth. Wherfore, so much the more is it the dutye of euery true serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Christ, euen by all meanes to publish the same; vvhich hath caused me at this tyme, to exhibit these things vnto the reading &amp; view of all men; not regarding the blame that I ame like to sustaine at all hands therfore, so som may reape anie good ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: Yet see I not whie anie should iustly be offended vvith this my doing, seing therby no vvrong is don to anie man. As for these prysoners that are named, &amp; had to do in this busines, there is no cause they should be offended, seing they vnder theire owne handes haue made relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereof vnto the Church, &amp; haue (for so doing) the practise of the Apost. Acts. 4. ver. 23. as also of owre late martyres in Q. Maries dayes, in the lyke cases. The credit of these vvrytings, I partly refer to the conscience of the men that vvrote them, as they vvill answere the contrarye before that great Iudg; but cheifly, to the testimonie of the vvitnesses present &amp; to the indifferent consideration of anie man, that vvill compare the arguments &amp; answeres, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent subiect of the discourse. As for the other side, if nothing should be published, vntill theire consent were had, there should neuer anie of these things com to light. But if they thinke themselues iniuryed, let them set downe the particulers vvherin, or, for the further satisfying of all men, let them yet at length condiscend to som christian &amp; free conference, where both sides may haue lyberty to produce theire reasons, a true record of them be kept, by faithfull &amp; indifferent notaries, ech side be allowed to haue a copie therof, &amp; time to consider of vvhat is passed accordingly. Thus might the thruth, sone, &amp; peeceablye be knovven, vvhere the vvord of God may be judg betvvixt them: from vvhich, vvho so departeth, &amp; vvil not be reduced, let him to his vvne perill, vndergoe such censures, &amp; iudgments as are due to his error &amp; syn.

            <head>A brief answeare to such Articles as the Bishopps haue giuen out in our name, vpon which arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles their Priests were sent and injoyned to Confer with vs in the seuerall prisons wherin we are by them detayned.</head>
            <p>HOw charitablie soeuer theis forged positions conningly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>triued, may seme to be framed, in respect of the sclaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous priuiledged pamphletts, heretofore dispersed through the whole land, by the enemies of Christ &amp; suppressors of all righteousnes, to bring vs in contempt with all men; yet if we consider the end, &amp; more sereously vvay the present drift of theis BBs, theire priests, and new reconciled Reformists, set a worke in this busines, we shal finde they neuer went more craftely about the spilling of owre innocent bloud. For they in theire secret consultations hauing collected theis articles, haue allso togeather vvith them constituted &amp; commaunded certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne theire priests, twise euery weeke, during this Lent, to offer vs priuate conference in way of examination, or auriculer confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to fish farther cause of accusation vppon theis poincts; vvhose testimonie &amp; verdict of suborned vvitnesses, they think to frame to their bloudthirstie appetites; vve in the meane tyme not suffred, eyther to set downe owre ovvne positions, neyther before equall vvytnesses to ansvver or discouer theire false alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. Wherfore vve thought it good (being all close pryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) to relate vnto all men that desire the truth, ovvre simple iudgments in theis doctrines, vvherat they thus snarrle; vve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting still most desirous of anie christian or equall conference before indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vvitnesses set dovvne &amp; recorded, if vve might obteine the same vppon the dispence of ovvre lyues; yea the God of heauen knovveth, hovv vvilling &amp; ready vve are to be instructed or corrected in anie thing vvherin vve err, vvhen it shalbe shevved vs by the booke of God.</p>
            <p>First then vnderstand, that theis accusers affirme theis to be ovvre positions, vvhich they haue framed of theire ovvne braine, vvithout ovvre knovvledg, much lesse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent. Secondly they pronunce vs nevve sectories, although vve hold no other thing in iudgment or practize, more then Christ &amp; his Apostles haue taught vs in the Scriptures, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by theire exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples &amp; deathes; And vvhether Christs Testament in theis mens antichristian lavves &amp; ordinances, fetched from Rome, or deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by themselues, be novv to be holden nevve doctrines, let all men consider. Thirdly they call vs Recusants, hauing neither forsaken the fellovvship of the true Church or least member of

Christ that vvalketh in the Communion of the faith, submyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himself to be guyded by Christs lavves &amp; ordinances, nor refused anie truth approued vnto vs. Only vve, according to the Commandment of God, haue forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all sprirituall fellovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship vvith theire false Church, as also the inuetions &amp; popery, yea all the execrable marchandize of that ministery &amp; confused Babell, euen that vvorld of vvickednes; Out of vvhich the Lord dravve fourth all his elected.</p>

               <p>THe Lords prayers vve take to be those prayers vvhich himself offred to his father, in his ovvne person, as he vvas man vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earthe, according to his present occasions, &amp; the will of his father poured fourth. The forme of prayer gyuen to his Disciples &amp; to all posterities by the record of the Euangelists, we hold &amp; acknowledg most holy Canonicall scripture, to be vsed of all Churches in that vse, and to that end for which owre Sauioure gaue it: Namely, to be the perfect patterne &amp; rule of all owre prayers, vvhether deprecations, supplications, thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyuing &amp;c. Not that we are bounde to the very vvords say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer, or asking all things therin conteined euery tyme we pray, nether that the words red or sayd ouer by rote can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a prayer, seing all prayer must proceede of Gods spyrit from owr owne harts according to owre present necessities: So that where he calleth it the Lords prayer he falsefieth the text, seing Christ neuer did or could vse it as his owne prayer; For there is petition made for remission of synnes, he neuer trespassing; And where he saith we hold it vnlawfull to be vsed publiquelye in the Church for a fet forme of prayer, he sclaundereth vs; vve graunt it to be the absolute, perfect, &amp; only forme of all true prayers. If anie demaund further, vvhether vve may vse the vvords therof, eyther wholy as they are set downe, or anie sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of them in prayers, we answer, by explication, or applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tending to edifying &amp; expressing owre present estate, vve may. The same questions may be demaunded of the prayers mentioned in the Psalmes &amp; dyuerse other scriptures, to which vve aunswere, that we restraine no man of the vse of anie parcell or sentence of Scripture, rightly applyed; Yet herevppon is not iustified eyther theire fyue tymes saying ouer of theire Pater Noster in theire English morrow masses, nor yet theire supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious repetition of theis words in the conclusions of theire prayers after or before theire sermons, vvhen as they say they knowe not vvhat to aske, and therfore pray as Christ hath
<pb facs="tcp:1354:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>

               <p>FOr such formes of prayer as are Canonicall, such as be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to vs by Gods spirit in his word, we haue already in the former Article set downe the true &amp; holy vse of them to be for instruction &amp;c. But, that anie man should thrust his deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses into the worship of God &amp; christian assemblies, we wonder at theire ignorant presumption, and much more that they dare be so bold as to set &amp; stint the holy ghost, what, vvhen, &amp; hovv manie vvords to vtter in prayer; So that your annuall, monthly, dayly, morning and euening prayers, vvherin you bynde mens consciences to the prescript repetition of your ovvne vvords as an offring to God, vve hold them by the euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Gods booke not only a babling, but apochriphall &amp; Idolatrous, contrary to the second Commaundme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, bringing the vvrath of God vppon the imposers &amp; receauers; For by theis Idolls you take avvay the vvhole lyberty, fredome, &amp; true vse of spirituall prayer; yea you stop the springs of the lyuing fountaine vvhich Christ hath sealed in his Church.</p>

               <p>The Church of England receaueth none to their sacraments but such as make publike declaration of their faith; therfore consisteth not of, or alloweth any profane people &amp;c.

<pb facs="tcp:1354:10"/>
I answered the papists also had their confessions, as the <hi>Creed &amp; Pater noster,</hi> which they repeated daily in their meetings, yet could they not for that verball confession be accompted the true Church.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hutchinso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> said the popish Church was the Church, though with manie corruptions; &amp; when I demanded whither the true Church or no, he said they were the Church of God.

<q>Your parish assemblies neuer published their conuersion of life vvith knovvledg &amp; fruites of repentance, seeing they had no doctrine to call them before they vvere all vvithout exception receaued; yet are all they &amp; their seed of your Church; therfore you receaue and allovve the profane &amp;c.</q>

               <p>Mr. Greenwood, you know the last time that I was with you, I prooued vnto you that Ihon Baptist receaued to his baptisme the Phariseis &amp; the Saduces, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in the 3 of Math. which you did not agree vnto. The proofes that I brought were manie.

               <p>It is verie true that we dissented in this doctrine, &amp; I disproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued all your alligations then brought to prooue that they were baptised; I will not stand now to call into question our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference then had; only for that this was not then set downe in writing, I beseech you if you remaine still of minde that they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, set yt downe vnder your hand, &amp; I will either assent vnto yt, or denie yt for iust cause.</p>

               <p>I will answere that of Luke, &amp; take him in his owne wordes; so he wrote with his owne hand thus.</p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hutchinson saith the 7. of Luke doth not prooue that these Phariseis mentioned Math. 3. or that none of the Phariseis were baptised. The argument drawen from that place is of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie particulars, &amp; the place of Luke is not generally but indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely conceiued.</p>
               <p>Againe wheras Greenwood prooueth by the 7. of Luke, that the Scribes &amp; Phariseis mentioned in the 3. of Math. came not to be baptised or (vvhich is the other part or Ihons ministerie) to heare his doctrine, but to gaze on him, &amp; to see him as a specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, yt is contrarie to the words of Math. 3. <hi>ad baptismum suum</hi>; And therfore the Phariseis mentioned in the 7 of Luke cannot be vnderstood of the Phariseis Math. 3.</p>
               <p>To the other, that Ihon Baptist ought not to call them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vipers, though yt need no answere, yet yt is false because

               <p>Whiles I was about to write myne answere to these things, Mr. Hutchinson would needs be gone, promising againe at his next co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to prooue the Church of Rome the true Church: so I was constrained to set downe myne answere after-wards, which is this. Our sauiour Christ in the of Luke setteth downe two sorts of people which came to Iohns ministerie, the one of such as heard &amp; obeid his doctrine, &amp; were baptised, the other of such as heard &amp; saw, but obeid not his doctrine, neither were baptised: Of which sort chiefly the Scribes &amp; Phariseis are note vnrepe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tant despisers; Therfore I meruell Mr. Hutchinson could so falsifye my words to excuse himself of open error, &amp; affirme that I should say the Phariseis did not heare but onlie gaze vpon him, seing I said they did heare but did not obey neither were baptised. Further in the 7 of Luke, our Saviour speaking inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitelie &amp; generallie of Ihons ministerie, &amp; of the Phariseis contempt, &amp; that they were not baptised of him, yt were open contradiction to say they were baptised, &amp; iniurie to the holie ghost except you can shew by expresse words that some of them were baptised by Ihon. As for Nichodemus, he was not called to the faith by Ihon, much lesse baptised by him. To the last point, Mr. Hutch. his examples of Christs reproof of Peter, or of his other Disciples &amp;c. as also Paules reprehensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, doth rather confirme my former assertions them infringe yt, seing they were reprooued for the present co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting &amp; stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in sin, &amp; not vpon their repentance. So that still I affirme yt were contrarie to all the scriptures to call them generations of vipers, who had publikelie made confession of their sin, till they againe transgressed, wherof there is no mention either of their conuersion or transgressing after the confession of these Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seis Math. 3. But at the first this controuersie might haue beene ended with this, that Ihon receaued none to be baptised, but such as were wonne by doctrine, &amp; made publike confession; So that either the Phariseis were not baptised, or els they repented: &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heere is no shelter for Mr. Hutchinsons euasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to prooue by then example that all the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d might in one day be receiued to their sacraments at the beginning of her Ma<hi rend="sup">ts</hi>. reigne, without knowledg &amp; true conuersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; so remaine a Church of Atheists &amp; idolaters euer since.

               <p>For Somes booke I disclaimed it, and sayd the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iniured me: For anie propositions that I hold I was desirous to set downe myne owne propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and neuer required either the BB<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. or Do.

               <p>Then did you see the Bishops offer me the greatest wronge that I suppose was euer offred to anie Christian in anie age.

               <p>There is no comparison betwixt hipocrits &amp; Schismaticks, the one whilest he stadeth making shew of the true faith both by life &amp; profession, so far as we can iudge; the other making open breach of faith.

Bride, as it consisteth of a confuse multitude of all sorts of people, mingled togeather in one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, standing vnder a false ministerye in Idolatry &amp; disorder, is not a true established Church of Christ, and therfore not such as anie true Christian ought to ioyne vnto in theire prayers &amp; Sacraments, as they stand in this estate.</p>
               <p>Here Mr. Andros moued that seing the question was agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, &amp; the time now far spent, we might depart vntill an other tyme: But I seing much companie gotten in, and nothing more heard against me then this propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, desired them to say som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what vnto it in that tyme that remayned.</p>
               <p>First therfore Mr. Androes found much fault with my proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as disordered &amp; vnlearnedly set downe, and therfore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued no answere. I sayd that if it were true it suffised me, and vnlesse they could disproue it it must still stand in force against them. Here we had also much adoe about owr order of reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whither it should be after their schole maner, by Logicke or no. I desired to reason after a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maner, according vnto truth, though not in logicall formes, where after some discourse of the necessitie &amp; vanitie of the arte of logicke, I said I would not bynde the maiestie of the Script. to logicall formes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about we should haue more vaine cauilles, and spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more tyme, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about the discussing of the question; and that my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science could neither be conuinced or instructed with anie syllogismes so much as with the weight of reason &amp; force of truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1354:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>Wherefore at length they condiscending vnto me, denied with one consent my whole proposition as false &amp; vntrue.</p>
               <p>I also denied theire proposition as altogeather false, and willed them to make profe of it. But still vrdging me to proue myne, I condiscended so to doo.</p>

Theire antichristian &amp; vnlawfull ministerye, 3 Theire false &amp; idolatrous maner of worshipping of God, and of theire whole ministration both of the word and Sacraments &amp;c. 4. And theire popish &amp; antichristian order &amp; ecclesiasticall gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. From all which seuerall heads infinite reasons may be drawne.

               <p>Your question is to no purpose neither is your assertion true; The Iewes had not two kinds of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, They did not excommunicate the heathen. And in that they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred the companie of the Publicanes in ciuile conuersation whilest they admitted them to the Temple, they synned.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Let him be vnto thee as a beathen &amp; a Publicane.</hi> Is ther not two kinde of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munications mentioned amongst the Iewes, one to the heathen, another vnto the Publicane?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>BAR.</speaker>
               <p>No; there is no excommunication of the Iewes mencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: The heathen they could not excommunicate, because they were neuer in communion with them: The Publicanes they did not excommunicate, because they still admitted them vnto the Temple.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ANDR.</speaker>
               <p>I will shew you in Scripture that the Gentiles were not suffred to enter into the Temple; Therfore they were excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate: And the other was a ciuile discommuning.</p>

               <p>It should seeme you know not what excommunication is. They were neuer admitted to enter into the Temple, Therfore they were not excommunicat; For none can be excommunicat but he that hath bene in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion. But the heathen was neuer in Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As for this ciuile discommuning of such as are still held members of the Church, it is a most vngodly deuise; For to cast out or abhor in owr commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meats such as the Lord receiueth vnto his Table, were verie vnchristian.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ANDR.</speaker>
               <p>You vnderstand not the place; Did not owr Sauiour Christ there speake of excommunication, willing them to haue such as refused to heare the Church in detestation, as the Iewes held theire heathens &amp; publicanes, whom they excommunicat.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>BAR.</speaker>
               <p>Oure Sauiour there speaketh not of excommunication of the Iewes, but of the excommunicat Christians, willing all his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to shunne &amp; eschue such as heare not the Church, as the Iewes did the heathens &amp; the Publicanes, to haue neither spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall nor ciuile communion with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>m. But what is all this to the purpose, what answere do you make to my former reason?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>HVTCH.</speaker>
               <p>Which reason? You haue as yet made none, but proued the same whith the same.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>BAR.</speaker>
               <p>This reason. All the people of the Land were receiued into the Church at one instant; had this ministrie &amp; these Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp;c. without being called vnto faith &amp; repentance by the preaching of the gospell. Therfore they were receiued into your Church without true faith and repentance, because it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to haue true faith &amp; true repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance without the preaching of the gospell going before.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>No, he was called by the preaching of Phillip, and had more knowledg then anie of these people, or well nigh anie of theire teachers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had, being all generally plunged in apostacy &amp; Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry immediatly before.</p>

But that
<pb facs="tcp:1354:20"/>
the greatest <hi>Rabbine</hi> of those times might well haue asked the question, seing it is so commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a thing in the Prophetts, to haue figured manie things that came vnto Christ in theire owne persons, as appeareth euery where in the booke of psalmes, and also in this prophecy, and almost in all other. Is it not said in this prophet, <hi>Behold, I &amp; the children that thou hast giuen me, are as signes &amp; vvonders in Israell.</hi> might not this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then be well asked whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prophet spake it in his owne person or of an other?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>ANDR.</speaker>
               <p>It was a most ignorant question. Could anie beare or be broken for owr transgressions but Christ only?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>BAR.</speaker>
               <p>But the Prophet might be led as a sheope vnto the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp;c. And therfore the question was according vnto know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and such as without knowledg could not be moued; Or vnlesse it were knowne, that text not be vnderstood. This <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuche</hi> was a godly &amp; zealous Proselite before Phillip met with him.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>What, will you say godly before he had the knowledge of Christ?</p>

               <p>The verball confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is prescribed &amp; vsed in the Church of England, is not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to enable the people that say it, or say <hi>Amen</hi> vnto it, vnto the ministrie and Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Christ; Neither could they make anie true or sincere confession, without the preaching of the word going before, to call them therevnto.</p>
               <p>Vppon this issue we for that tyme ceased; They affirming this verball confession in this maner sayd, to be sufficient to enable all the people so saying it ouer, And I for the reasons aboue said, denying the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hutchinson put vp the paper wherein these Arguments and propositions were wrytten into his bozome, but promised me a Copie; vvherevnto I condiscended, so that vppon the next conference I might keepe the paper.</p>

                  </gap> He affirming them to be all one; I, to be very dyuerse; the one signifying, vicinity; the other, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of habitations; he alledging the ancyent vse; And I
<pb facs="tcp:1354:21"/>
both the ancient &amp; present; affirming all to be corrupt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Androes also in reasoning with me oft swore by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, for which I reproued him for swearing vnlawfully &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his faith an Idole. But he said I knew not what an oth or an Idole meant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Androes also vsed this word <hi>Luck.</hi> I sayed there was no fortune or <hi>luck</hi>; but all things came to passe by the prouidence of God. To prooue <hi>Luck</hi> he torned in my Testament to the 10. of Luke ver. 31. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp;c. And torned in a leafe vppon the place, and as he was going out willed me to consider of it. vvhich is no more then to come to passe, although sodainly or vnloked for to vs, yet by the direction &amp; prouidence of God vnto vs; without which a sparrow falleth not vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground.

            <p n="12">12. Being pressed that Christs spirit was in the hands of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Luke. 23.46. his bodie in the graue, therfore he could not after his death descend into hell. To this Do.

            <p>There remayned an Argument at our last conference without answere, which was this.</p>
            <q>None can be called to a true profession of faith, vvithout the preaching of the gospell going before; But all the people in these parishes vvere receaued into your Church vvithout the preaching of the gospell going before; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they vvere receaued vvithout a true profession.</q>
            <p n="13">13. Do. Androes here denyed the <hi>minor.</hi> &amp; said the people were not receaued into theire Church &amp; had the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto them before they had bene taught half a yeare. Being demaunded what the people in the meane while were to be esteemed, whether faithfull or idolatrous, whether me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or not members of theire Church; he said, they were neither to be esteemed faithfull nor vnbelieuers, neither members nor not members, but they where all this while in membring.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Being demaunded what those preachers were to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whither ministers or not ministers vnto this people, they answered that they were ministers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument.</hi> 1. <hi>There can be no minister but vnto a flocke; But here by your ovvne saying vvas no flocke at this tyme Therfore these could be no ministers vnto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. They here denyed the <hi>Maior,</hi> &amp; affirmed that there may be a minister without a flocke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1354:23"/>
               <hi>Argument.</hi> 2. <hi>A shepheard can be no shepheard ouer goates or svvyne, but only ouer sheepe; The ministerie of Christ ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be set ouer infidells, or ouer anie people to take chardge or cure ouer them, vntill those people be called vnto, &amp; haue made profession of the faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>But here the people vvere not as then called vnto, neither had made profession of the faith: Therfore the ministerie of Christ could not at that tyme be set ouer them, in that estate.</q>
            <p n="16">16. They still denied the <hi>Maior,</hi> &amp; gaue this reason therof, because the vnbeleeuers might heare the ministerie of the Church.</p>
            <p>Wee graunted that the vnbeleeuers might heare the ministerie of the Church, but from hence it followeth not that they had interest in the ministerie before they were members of the Church; It is one thing to heare the ministerie of the Church, &amp; an other thing to be a member of the Church.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Then they brought Pauls example to proue that a ministerie might be set ouer infidells, because he was said to be the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Gentiles, &amp; all the Apostles willed to goe and teach all nations.</p>
            <p>To this it was answered, that Paul stood no minister neither tooke gouernment or chardge ouer anie hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then which were not called to the faith, &amp; ioyned to the Church, still putting difference betwixt teaching the heathen the truth, &amp; exercising a ministerie ouer them.</p>
            <p n="18">18. They alledged 1 Pet. 1. that the Apostle there tooke chardge &amp; care ouer strangers.</p>
            <p>Yt was answered that those strangers were Iewes, called to the faith, dispersed through manie regions, as the next verse. 1 Pet. 1.2. &amp; Iames 1. sheweth.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Paul wrote himself a father of the Corinths. <hi>though ye haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie teachers, yet haue ye but one father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yt was still answered that those Corinthians were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument.</hi> 3. <hi>There can be no communion betvvixt the beleeuers &amp; vnbeleeuers; therefore the infidells can haue no communion vvith the Church in the ministerie thereof, or in anie spirituall action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being demaunded by them what we meant by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, we answered, such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion as is spoken of <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>in doctrine, in prayer, in the sacraments, in mutuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication in all Christian duties,</hi> &amp; how none were receaued to this communion, before they were ioyned as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers vnto the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1354:23"/>
               <hi>Argument.</hi> 4. <hi>There can novv be no Pastor ouer anie people by the rules of Christi testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but vvhere a mutuall couenant is made betvveene the Pastor &amp; the people, he bounde to teach, guide, &amp; gouerne them, they againe to obey him in the Lord: But the infidells haue made no such couenant vvith the Pastor; Therfore &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="20">20. Do. Androes said, the Pastor ought not to gouerne; that he himself was a Pastor, yet no guyde or gouernor of the flocke; and that in the Church there were gouernors ouer the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, as Bishops.</p>
            <p>We answered that the word Bishop or Ouerseer vvas a generall name, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to the Pastor, teacher, &amp; El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, vvhich name importeth gouernment &amp; care. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Do. Androes here said, that the vvord bishop was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnto either the Pastor, teacher, or Elders, but vnto other higher gouernors.</p>
            <p>We answered, that vnto their ministerie the name of a bishop did not indeed accord, but only vnto their Lord bishops, &amp; desired some proofe of this their assertion out of the word of God.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Vnto vvhich they answered, that all their ministerie vvas by positiue lavves.</p>
            <p>We then said that it must needs follow, that all their religion &amp; vvorship was pollitick also, &amp; that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie vvhich Christ hath not prescribed in his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament is antichristian.</p>
            <p>At lentgh, after manie bitter &amp; reprochfull speaches against vs, vve returned againe to our former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, &amp; framed this Argument vnto the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument.</hi> 5. <hi>The people novv are to make choice &amp; proofe of their Paestor: But thei vvithout the faith cannot make choice of theyr Pastor: Therfore &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here they said that this &amp; allowre other positions were fond, vaine, &amp; foolish; &amp; this was all the answere vve could get of them.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hutchinson at the breaking vp requyred me Henry Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to set downe some reasons whie I refused to ioine vnto their Church, that the people present might be satisfied; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon I set him downe vnder mine hand as followeth.</p>
            <p>The reasons vvhie I Henry Barrow cannot ioine with the Church of England, yeilded by me the 13. of the 4. Moneth.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:1354:24"/>1. The people as they stand are not called orderly to the faith, but stand mingled togeather in confusion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ministerie set ouer them is not the true ministerie of the gospell which Christ hath appointed to his Church in his testament.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The administration &amp; worship of this Church is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ecclesiasticall gouernment, Courts, officers &amp; Cannons are not according to the testament of Christ, but new &amp; antichristian.</p>
            <p>Vntill all these points be eyther approoued by the word of God, or reformed, I cannot consent to ioyne vnto this Church in this estate.</p>
