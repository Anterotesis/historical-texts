            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet at the last wandring <hi>Erato,</hi> with her sister <hi>Terpsichore</hi> perceiuing me with such diligence to trauise that Maze, they willing to helpe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of my mynd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> said thus vnto me: <q>
                  <l>Come forth thou wandring wight this way,</l>
                  <l>Doo followe vs outright:</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Wherewith they leadyng me vnto the fountayne <hi>Permestus,</hi> I without any further determination, gallopped through the rest, whiche when leysure shall geue you leaue to reade, ceasse then to thinke on the <hi>L.

And if you chaunce to see the Meter, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not so well polished, as beseemeth, then remember, that they whose falles I haue here penned, were not of late tyme, but suche as lyued presently after the Incarnation of Christe: and I haue not thought it decent, that the men of the olde worlde shoulde speake with so garnished a Style, as they of the latter tyme.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, you may, if you please to consider, that Souldiers, of whiche I am one by profession, wee be not alwayes lusking in our Forte or Castle, but be as tyme and occasion wyll permyt, here to day, wee knowe least our selues, where to morrowe. And I wyll ensure you, the most part of these my Princes dyd pleade their causes vnto me, euen in the Sea, a place in fayth, not meete to penne Tragedies. And as for bookes, I was altogether destitute: for


<pb facs="tcp:4830:4"/>
when I, to please my fantasie, trauayled (as you knowe) I could not beare about with me a librarie but for cariage sake, contented my self with these foure: With the thirde <hi>Decade</hi> of <hi>Titus Liuye,</hi> with <hi>Boswelles Concordes of Armorie,</hi> with <hi>Monsignor de Lange,</hi> that notable Warriour, &amp; with the vnperfect <hi>Mirrour for Magistrates:</hi> whiche bookes made nothing to this purpose. I had not those Chronicles whiche other men had: my Memorie and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention were vnto me in stead of <hi>Grafton, Polidore, Cooper,</hi> and suche like, who dyd greatly ayde other men. And last of al you must consider, that the other part of the miseries of those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Princes were written, I sittyng on a Rocke in the Sea, not in <hi>Spaine, Italie, Fraunce, Scotlande,</hi> or <hi>Englande,</hi> but in <hi>Garn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie</hi> Castle, where although there be learned men, yet none whiche spende their tyme so vainely as in Poetrie. So that the complaintes of these men were written (as I say) where the want of helpe dyd diuersly daunt me with despayre. You haue greatly requested me by your last letter, to make vnto you a Discourse of the Ile of <hi>Garnzie,</hi> and howe it is possible for the Castle to be a place so pleasaunt for habitation, as I haue reported it, seeing it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the Sea, separate from any lande. Good Syr, to write thereof (so manyfolde be the commodities and thinges woorthy the writyng of) woulde rather require a good volume, then a peece of an Epistle. Let it therefore suffice for this tyme, that I by writyng vnto you some fewe lines of the Couernour, I may briefely declare what the gouernement and commodities be. The right woorshipful Maister <hi>Thomas Leighton</hi> is her Maiesties Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunt there.</p>
            <p>Syr, I doo remember, howe constant <hi>Constantine the Great</hi> was in Religion, and howe that noble Emperour mynded the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation thereof. You knowe howe carefull <hi>Licurgus</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> were for making of good Lawes, and ministring of iustice. And Histories doo recorde, howe passing happye <hi>Epaminundas</hi> was in al his affayres: But what a seemely sight is it, to see al these vertues so to concurre in one man, that hee who shoulde, compare hym with them, should, I wyl ensure you, doo hym great iniurie?


<pb facs="tcp:4830:5"/>
for (that I may briefly conclude) vndoubtedly a few such men as he is, being plaste at a Princes elbow, were sufficient to keepe the most ruinous common weale that is, from ruine and destruction. And now, iudge you the commodities of the Countrey, by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Gouernour, for as <hi>Seneca</hi> sayeth:
<q>
                  <l>Where Gouernours be good, and rule their charge aright,</l>
                  <l>Without an ebbe, there flowes the flood, which vertuous minds delight.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And heere I doo turne me from these thinges, vntill by talke with you, I may dilate more at large therof, and returning my selfe vnto my former purpose, I haue not thought it conuenient to write the complaynts of these men, with so obscure a stile as some other haue done, but with so playne an exposition, that he who doth reade them shal not neede to be <hi>Oedipus,</hi> for euery playne <hi>Dauus</hi> shall by reading them, easely vnderstand the Authours drift. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Memorie</hi> bee all the helpers that I haue, therefore I haue ordayned them, as the chiefe workers of my wyll. <hi>Higgins</hi> vsed (I know not what) <hi>Morpheus,</hi> the God of dreames, But I dreame not: the other had <hi>Baldwine</hi> for their hearer, but I haue diligent <hi>Inquisition,</hi> who can finde out al things, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, who knoweth al thinges, for the Arbiters of my matter. Take you therefore, the fruites of these my idle howres, sent vnto you with a good wyll, and according vnto the trust reposed in you, keepe these trifles from the view of all men, and as you promysed, let them not raunge out of your priuate Study. And thus wishing vnto you honour and long lyfe, I ende, the .15. daye of Maye, An. 1577.</p>
