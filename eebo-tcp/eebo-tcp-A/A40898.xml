         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

my <hi>Lord,</hi> your caſe is hard; but what ſhall wee
ſay? <hi>'tis the fortune of the wars;</hi> and there you know
(as in a common ſcuffle) many an <hi>honeſt</hi> man, that
ſtands by, and means no <hi>harm,</hi> gets a knock, as
well as thoſe who begun the <hi>quarrel;</hi> and this your
Adverſary <hi>himſelf</hi> (who confeſſes to have had the
mannagement of the whole buſineſs againſt you)
ſeems to me clearly to acknowledge, as the ground
of your <hi>Sequeſtration:</hi> For, in anſwer to an <hi>objection</hi>
made on your <hi>Honours</hi> behalf, by your friends, in the
<hi>Narrative,</hi> by them publiſhed, hee (your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary)
doubting of the weight and validity of the
<hi>teſtimonies</hi> produc'd againſt you, ſayes, (in the
fourth particular anſwer, page 22. of his book) <hi>that
the time when your eſtate was ſequeſtred, was, when the
Commonwealth was deeply imbroiled in wars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And then goes on, and ſayes, (in the next page)
that</hi> in ſuch times and caſes, they have many conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as the reaſon of their actions, which thoſe who
<pb facs="tcp:40606:3"/>
are without doors, <hi>(that is, your Honour, and your
friends, who were not of the Parliament)</hi> neither
know, nor apprehend, nor are to take upon them ſo to
do: <hi>So that here (you ſee) is</hi> Club-law, <hi>you muſt
bee</hi> ſequeſtred, <hi>becauſe the Commonwealth was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil'd
in wars; and your Honour (being out of
doors) muſt neither</hi> know, <hi>nor</hi> apprehend <hi>('tis too
far above your reach) the</hi> reaſon <hi>why;</hi> nor are you
to take upon you <hi>('tis preſumption)</hi> ſo to do: <hi>For
hee tells you (page 2.) that</hi> true Engliſhmen, have
uſed to have Parliaments, and their Acts, as being the
judgement of the whole Repreſentative of the Nation,
in more veneration and eſteem, than to bee put into the
ballance, with the contradictory aſſertions, of any private
or byaſs'd ſpirits.</p>
            <p>And truly (my Lord) upon this ground, we may
well queſtion, <hi>whether you bee a true Engliſhman,</hi>
or no, who being ſwayed by your own <hi>private</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and byaſs'd with a deſire after your <hi>own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate</hi>
again, ſhould dare <hi>now</hi> to move any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the actions of that Parliament, which (as he
tells you in the ſame page, anſw. 6.) <hi>upon the proofs</hi>
by him alledged, and (becauſe they were not full
enough) <hi>for reaſons beſt known to themſelves, in time
of general imbroilments, order'd your eſtate to bee
confiſcate.</hi> So that ſtill (my Lord) you muſt take
the <hi>fortune of the wars;</hi> and though your Honour,
and all out of doors, know <hi>no reaſon</hi> for it, yet they

            </p>
            <p>But will your Honour give mee leave (as a true

Reader, I muſt tell you, wee are fallen into thoſe times,
wherein moſt peoples <hi>Religion</hi> (I mean the wiſe ones)
lies in making <hi>faces,</hi> and courting the <hi>riſing intereſt,</hi>
at leaſt waiting an <hi>opportunity</hi> ſo to do: In the mean
while, the <hi>queſtion</hi> growes high, and <hi>Romes</hi> intereſt
(by the ſubtilties of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> working amongst us)
is very much <hi>promoted,</hi> and that by our <hi>own</hi> hands,
men pretending (which is ſtrange) to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
perſwaſion; for now the <hi>queſtion</hi> is not (as among
the Separatiſts) whether our <hi>Pariſhes are true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
but whether wee have had any true Churches <hi>at
all</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> till theſe late years, that they were
brought in by the <hi>Sword</hi> in the late <hi>Army,</hi> or thoſe
who accompanied them; and it's very like (if the Lord
prevent not) <hi>Magiſterially,</hi> and Dictator-like (almoſt
in <hi>Cathedra)</hi> to bee reſolved, <hi>That wee neither
have, nor had true Churches, or Miniſters among
us,</hi> and that wee muſt renounce our <hi>Ordination,</hi> take
it up from the <hi>people,</hi> and ſo make all new, after a
<hi>mode,</hi> which yet our eyes, nor the eyes of our <hi>Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
have ever ſeen, or their <hi>eares</hi> ever heard of. To
effect this, have thoſe Emiſſaries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no doubt, ſtirred up, and ſet on foot theſe obſtrepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Quakers,</hi> (though the generality of them ſuſpect
no ſuch matter) to cry down our <hi>Churches, Miniſters,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40606:7"/>
and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> to whom they have now <hi>drawn</hi> in,
heads and pens more ſubtil and able, who, <hi>aliud agentes</hi>
(as it were) do that for <hi>them,</hi> which they themſelves
(in their own perſons openly) were not <hi>able</hi> to effect
or accompliſh, who doth not with fear and ſadneſs
(that doth conſider) <hi>foreſee</hi> that lamentable <hi>reſult,</hi>
that's like to follow upon the <hi>conteſts</hi> raiſed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
between our brethren of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and
<hi>Independent</hi> perſwaſion, and which by the <hi>heat</hi> and
oppoſition of perſons of ability, (on both ſides) are like
to grow <hi>more</hi> high than ever: But if my poor <hi>low</hi>
voice might bee heard between them, and Oh, that the
Lord would perſwade them to hear, I ſhould ſay as
<hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot, Let there bee no ſtrife between
you, for you are Brethren;</hi> and I ſhould beſeech
them in <hi>Joſephs</hi> language to his Brethren, <hi>Fall not out
by the way:</hi> But if I cannot bee heard, I make this
<hi>proteſtation,</hi> diſclaimer, and prayer, <hi>Lord, let not my
ſoul come into the ſecrets, and let mee never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the delicacies of thoſe men, who make
Schiſmatical ſeparation,</hi> deſtroying thoſe <hi>Churches</hi>
and Miniſtery, wherein, and by whom (bleſſed be God)
thouſands have been <hi>converted</hi> and ſaved; and who
are <hi>willing</hi> to reform, and conform, according to what
is revealed in the <hi>Scripture;</hi> Sure I am, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(the Miſtreſs even of fools) hath made it <hi>good</hi>
unto the world, that <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and Government in
the <hi>Church,</hi> hath (ever ſince the reformation from
Popery) kept the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> free from He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
and Blaſphemy <hi>getting head</hi> among them; and if
there were danger of an <hi>inrode,</hi> and an incurſion, by
the <hi>abuſe</hi> of Government, hee ſhall come little ſhort of
an <hi>Ideot,</hi> (and wiſe men will eaſily acknowledge it)
<pb facs="tcp:40606:7"/>
that doth not <hi>perceive,</hi> that no Government at all, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one being left to his own fancy) will <hi>much more</hi> do
it. It's a ſtrange piece of <hi>madneſs,</hi> not to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>inforcing</hi> men to Religion, and <hi>tolerating
all Religions,</hi> to the hazzarding of the <hi>true:</hi> Or if
(putting a difference) <hi>Matchivilianiſme</hi> ſhall ſo far
prevail with any, as that, ſo they can ſecure their <hi>own
intereſts,</hi> they care not for the <hi>concernments of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, and his Goſpel.</hi> As for my own former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings
(by the help of the Preſs) I have but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to <hi>diſcover</hi> theſe <hi>upſtart</hi> enemies, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
to the <hi>truth,</hi> who <hi>privily brought in damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought
them.</hi> By occaſion whereof, I have raiſed up this

only at whoſe <hi>impoſtures</hi> in this kinde, the <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume</hi>

vomited forth from it, in most <hi>unchriſtian</hi> railings,
lyings, and reproachings, who yet withal, pretends to
<hi>higher</hi> meaſures of <hi>Saintſhip,</hi> and perfection, than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
which conſidering (and well knowing the man,
and his practiſes) I concluded this with my ſelf, that if
wee might judge of the <hi>conſcience,</hi> honeſty, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, by <hi>this</hi> man in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
wee may well aſſert this, viz. <hi>A man may bee
as vile a perſon as any under heaven, and yet a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Quaker,</hi> which (after a brief diſcourſe of the
converſion and perfection of Quakers <hi>in general)</hi> I
have endeavoured to <hi>demonſtrate,</hi> from the <hi>practiſes</hi>
and doings of him in <hi>ſpecial;</hi> and this in his dealings
in the matters of the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Love;</hi>
the ones <hi>Eſtate,</hi> and the others <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The materials I have built my diſcourſe with, (in the
<pb facs="tcp:40606:8"/>
matter of the Lord <hi>Craven)</hi> are two printed pieces,
the one entituled, <hi>A true and perfect</hi> Narrative, <hi>of
the ſeveral proceedings, in the caſe concerning the
Lord</hi> Craven, wherein are ſet forth the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
together with the Indictment, Tryal, and
<hi>Conviction</hi> of <hi>Faulconer,</hi> of Perjury, in that infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
upon which the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> Eſtate was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred,
which piece was printed and publiſhed by the
<hi>friends</hi> of the <hi>Lord Craven;</hi> the other is a piece, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
<hi>The Lord</hi> Cravens <hi>Caſe, &amp;c. with a ſhort
examination</hi> of that former Narrative; and this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
was written by <hi>Biſhop himſelf,</hi> in excuſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of himſelf and <hi>Faulconer,</hi> of which book, hee
printed ſo few, and ſo diſpoſed of them, as that I could
not get one, either <hi>here,</hi> or at <hi>London,</hi> until (by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence)
I was <hi>directed</hi> to ſend to <hi>himſelf</hi> to borrow it.
And this I did, becauſe in his Pamphlet againſt <hi>mee,</hi>
hee quotes it, and <hi>refers</hi> to it, for clearing (as hee
thought) of his <hi>innocency;</hi> which if hee had <hi>refuſed</hi>
to lend mee, I intended to <hi>acquaint</hi> the world, that hee
had quoted his book to <hi>clear</hi> himſelf, which could not
bee <hi>come by,</hi> which (it may bee) hee feared, and
therefore ſent it mee; or otherwiſe, by the <hi>diſpoſing</hi> of
Divine Providence (the time being come for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his deep hypocriſie) hee was <hi>over-ruled</hi> ſo to
ſend it. For his own <hi>Confeſſions</hi> (therein contained)
and <hi>Faulconers Confeſſion</hi> upon his death-bed, of
that perjury, (which <hi>Biſhop</hi> would in his book free him
from) being <hi>conferred,</hi> and compared, the whole <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,</hi>
and whence it <hi>aroſe,</hi> and how it was <hi>carried</hi> on,
is manifeſtly <hi>diſcovered;</hi> as in the diſcourſe following,
to which I have <hi>added</hi> a little of his dealings againſt
Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> to let him, and the <hi>world</hi> ſee, whether hee
<pb facs="tcp:40606:8"/>
bee not alſo a <hi>blood-ſucker.</hi> Could I have gotten his
other book, called, <hi>A Short Plea, &amp;c.</hi> which hee alſo
publiſhed againſt Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> I doubt not but thence I
ſhould have made a <hi>further</hi> diſcovery of him; but hee
dealt as ſubtilly in this, as in the former, printed ſo <hi>few,</hi>
as that they cannot bee gotten. But I ſuppoſe what I
have <hi>done</hi> is ſufficient; the <hi>improvement</hi> I make of
the whole, is this, to let the world ſee, how <hi>deeply</hi> and
cloſely wickedneſs may lye <hi>lurking</hi> in our natures, and
what a deſperate evil <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> is, that a man may
<hi>continue</hi> in ſuch wickedneſs <hi>unrepented of,</hi> and yet
think himſelf a <hi>Saint,</hi> and to have attained to <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
If by what I have herein done, I may bee inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to bring <hi>him</hi> to repentance, or his caſe may bee

time,</hi> in <hi>any thing,</hi> but to be perfect in the meaſure of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>grace,</hi> and in the <hi>practiſe</hi> of every <hi>duty.</hi> I ſuppoſe this
is ſo plain a diſtribution of <hi>humane</hi> perfection <hi>abſolute,</hi> as
is very clear and obvious. And if our Adverſaries mean
<hi>leſs</hi> then this, they fall in with <hi>our</hi> Doctrine, and then they
<hi>quarrel</hi> and charge us <hi>wrongfully.</hi> Now if I ſhall ſhew
from <hi>Prophotical</hi> and <hi>Apostolical</hi> Doctrine (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
from the Doctrine of Chriſt) that <hi>perfection</hi> in
either kinde, (Doctrinal or Practical) is not in this <hi>laſt</hi>
ſenſe in <hi>this</hi> life attainable, then the <hi>Quakers</hi> are found to
be <hi>out</hi> of the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and are <hi>hypocrites</hi> and <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars;</hi>
and it will not need <hi>many</hi> words to prove either. And
firſt for <hi>Doctrinal Perfection,</hi> that we cannot here attain
that <hi>full meaſure</hi> of knowledge allotted us, that <hi>one</hi> place
of the Apoſtle is a ſufficient teſtimony, <hi>1 Cor. 13. 9, 10.
We know in part, and we Prophecie in part, but when that
which is perfect is come, then that which is in part ſhall be
done away.</hi> And ver. 12. <hi>For now we ſee through a glaſs
darkly, but then face to face; Now I know in part, but then
I ſhall know, even as I am known.</hi> If any ſhall be either ſo
<hi>ſimple</hi> or <hi>perverſe,</hi> as to queſtion whether the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeak
this of our <hi>imperfect</hi> ſtate in <hi>this life,</hi> in point of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
I ſhall not think him worthy of an anſwer; the
<hi>clearneſs</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> will ſufficiently argue ſuch a mans
<hi>imperfection;</hi> And as for <hi>Practical</hi> perfection, that we
cannot here attain <hi>ſuch</hi> a meaſure of holineſs, as <hi>not to ſin
at all,</hi> at <hi>any time,</hi> in <hi>any thing,</hi> but that we may be <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi>
perfect in the <hi>meaſure</hi> of <hi>every</hi> grace, and in the
practiſe of <hi>every</hi> duty. I ſhall not need heap teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40606:11"/>
a few places will ſufficiently evidence this <hi>truth,</hi>
without any further argumentation, <hi>1 Kings 8. 46. There
is no man that ſinneth not. Prov. 20. 9. Who can ſay I have
made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin? Eccleſ. 7. 20.
There is not a juſt man upon earth, that doth good and ſinneth
not.</hi> Theſe are the teſtimonies of <hi>Solomon.</hi> More might
be produc'd from the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, take onely two
from the <hi>New.</hi> The firſt from St. <hi>John, 1 John 1. 8. If we</hi>
(I <hi>John,</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> to whom he wrote) <hi>If we ſay
that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not
in us.</hi> The next from St. <hi>James, Ja. 3. 2. In many things</hi>
(not in a <hi>few only) we offend all.</hi> So that here we attain
not a <hi>ſinleſs perfection,</hi> we ſhall not here be, I ſay, fully
like Chriſt in <hi>holineſs</hi> or <hi>knowledge,</hi> this is reſerved for
hereafter; and this the ſame <hi>St. John</hi> atteſteth, <hi>1 Jo. 3 2.
Beloved, now are we the ſons of God, and it doth not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
what we ſhall be; but we know that when he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> when
we ſhall ſee him (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes before, <hi>face to face)</hi> then
our <hi>imperfect</hi> meaſures ſhall be made <hi>perfect.</hi> That which
there follows in <hi>John</hi> (and other places produced for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection)
intend it, and preſs it <hi>(viz.</hi> abſolute perfection)
as our <hi>duty</hi> and the matter of our <hi>endeavour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus from <hi>Canonical</hi> truth I have ſhewed you the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection</hi>
of our perfection <hi>here:</hi> And what ground our
<hi>Adverſaries</hi> have, to plead their <hi>exemption</hi> from the ſame
condition, I cannot diſcern. Suppoſe we ſhould <hi>grant</hi>
them to be led by the immediate and infallible teachings
of the un-erring Spirit, let them then tell us, <hi>who are the
liars, Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> or they?
Or was that true which <hi>they</hi> affirm'd of <hi>themſelves</hi> and
<hi>all men,</hi> that they are ſinners? And is this, which <hi>theſe</hi>
men affirm to the <hi>contrary,</hi> true alſo? Or was it <hi>truth</hi>
then, and is not ſo <hi>ſtill?</hi> Doth new <hi>light</hi> make the old a
<hi>lie?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 4.</note> Or doth the Spirit ſpeak <hi>contraries?</hi> No, <hi>let God be
true,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 12. from 5, to the 10.</note> 
               <hi>and every man a liar;</hi> and that I am ſure is a <hi>ſinner.</hi>
And for our parts, if we <hi>boast,</hi> we will (with the Apoſtle)
<hi>boast and glory of and in our infirmities,</hi> not that we are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40606:11"/>
               <hi>ſinners,</hi> (that's our burden) But that God for Chriſts
ſake <hi>is righteous and juſt to forgive us our ſinnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 9</note> when we
confeſs them, and that Chriſt by his grace, will <hi>cleanſe
us from our ſins,</hi> and all iniquity; That ſo his <hi>ſtrength</hi> might
be perfected, and manifeſted, and magnified in our <hi>infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
With this further. That if we were ſo <hi>perfect,</hi> as to
be free from ſinning on <hi>earth,</hi> we ſhould not need Chriſts
interceſſion in <hi>heaven;</hi> nor ſhould wee need <hi>to pray</hi>
daily (as Chriſt taught his Diſciples) <hi>father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25</note> And therefore wee ſay, <hi>Bleſſed bee God for
Jeſus Chriſt in heaven:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Io. 2. 1, 2</note> who ever lives to make <hi>interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
for us. And who, when wee <hi>ſinne,</hi> is there <hi>our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,
and the propitiation for our ſinnes;</hi> and thereby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſave us (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to the uttermoſt, to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:</hi>
till all bee perfected, and if the Quakers will
not for <hi>themſelves</hi> joyn with us in this Chriſtian confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
let them ſpeak out, and ſay ſo: And wee know
what to ſay to them, and if they will joyn, let them ceaſe
to condemn us, for the acknowledgement of our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>And thus have wee argued <hi>human</hi> imperfection, by
an argument <hi>ad rem.</hi> And now wee ſhall prove it by
arguments <hi>ad hominem;</hi> Even the <hi>Quakers</hi> themſelves.
And diſcover the <hi>imperfection</hi> and unſoundneſs of their
<hi>pretended perfection,</hi> and conſequently their <hi>Hypocriſy.</hi>
And firſt from the manner of their <hi>converſion,</hi> and then
from the matter or quality of the <hi>perſons converted.</hi> And
thirdly from their <hi>converſion it ſelf.</hi> And this, firſt a
little from the converſion of the Quakers in <hi>generall:</hi>
And then of my quaking adverſary in <hi>particular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt of the manner of the Quakers converſion <hi>in
general,</hi> and that which I ſhall here obſerve is from the
<hi>ſuddenneſs</hi> of their converſion, and I may adde the <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
of their converſion. And firſt from the <hi>ſuddenneſs</hi>
of it, it may render it juſtly ſuſpected, for ſuppoſe a
<hi>drunkard,</hi> or a ſottiſh <hi>Buffoon,</hi> a fellow that makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a <hi>Fool</hi> (an ape) to make prophane perſons merry
(for ſome ſuch among us have turned Quakers) ſuppoſe I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40606:12"/>
ſay, ſuch a one, ſhall <hi>all of a ſudden</hi> leave his <hi>drunkenneſs,</hi>
or leave his <hi>apiſh converſation,</hi> and (without any more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do)
become a Quaker, ſhall wee call this converſion?
Its a ſaying of that great Lecturer of nature <hi>Hipocrates,</hi>
that <hi>omnes repentinae mutationes, ſunt periculoſae:</hi> All ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<hi>changes</hi> or alterations are <hi>dangerous:</hi> They forebode
no <hi>good,</hi> but <hi>evil.</hi> Theſe <hi>ſudden leaps,</hi> are from <hi>violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
Nature in its regular courſe is more <hi>lent</hi> and <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi>
making its progreſs from one <hi>degree</hi> unto <hi>another;</hi>
And although ſometimes there are found ſuch <hi>violent</hi>
motions in nature, yet they are very <hi>rare,</hi> but alwaies
<hi>doubtful,</hi> this is true in <hi>religion</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſudden Converts are (if not <hi>miracula) mira gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi>
wonders. As wee ſay of <hi>late</hi> converſion, from the
inſtance of the <hi>Theef</hi> upon the Croſs; <hi>One was ſo conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that none might deſpair, and but one, that none might
preſume.</hi> So of this ſudden Converſion, they are <hi>Rare.</hi> A
<hi>Paul</hi> or ſo, That (as hee himſelf ſaies, <hi>1 Tim. 1. 16.)
Chriſt might in him ſhew forth all long-ſuffering, for a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,</hi>
to incourage others to come into <hi>God,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
they were <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> and grievous ſinners. But
I ſay, <hi>Theſe patterns are rare.</hi> As one <hi>Job</hi> was made a
pattern of <hi>Patience.</hi> Such diſpenſations being not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary;
For as wee ſay, <hi>Nemo repente fit peſſimus,</hi> none
come to the height of wickedneſſe at <hi>once,</hi> ſo <hi>Nemo repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
fit optimus:</hi> A man comes not to his ſtature of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
on a <hi>ſudden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>ſeveral</hi> ages in Chriſt: There are little <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
young men,</hi> and <hi>Fathers, 1 John</hi> 2. 12, 13. And
there is a <hi>growth</hi> in <hi>Grace,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 18. as well as in <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to the <hi>appearances</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> in <hi>true</hi> converſion,
there is a <hi>previous</hi> and precedaneous act of godly ſorrow,
which works <hi>repentance</hi> and true <hi>humiliation;</hi> whereby
the ſoul (being caſt down under the ſenſe of its former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
waies and ungodly converſation) is made humble,
<hi>meek,</hi> and <hi>lowly;</hi> judging and condemning it ſelf as the
<hi>vileſt</hi> of all others: Or at leaſt <hi>as vile</hi> as any. And thence
(by the power of the ſpirit fetching ſtrength from Chriſt,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40606:12"/>
by faith) comes up <hi>by degrees,</hi> to ſome ſtature and
growth in him, till hee come up to his appointed mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
But theſe perſons (as wee have obſerved them)
do <hi>per ſaltum, skip</hi> from the loweſt degree of <hi>baſeneſs;</hi> to
high meaſures of <hi>perfection,</hi> in a moment, all of a <hi>ſudden.</hi>
But ſome may ſay, how can you tell whether they have
not been <hi>ſo</hi> humbled, or truly <hi>repented?</hi> The ſin and <hi>evil
converſation</hi> was <hi>open,</hi> but the <hi>repentance</hi> may be <hi>ſecret.</hi>
We ſee a <hi>change,</hi> an alteration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I'le ask then this queſtion (and let it be ſeriouſly
conſidered) May not <hi>Satan</hi> be contented that a perſon
leave a <hi>baſe,</hi> a wicked converſation; that a man ceaſe to
be a <hi>drunkard,</hi> (or the like) that he may become an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,</hi>
a <hi>Blaſphemer?</hi> Is it not his advantage? Doth not
the devil gain <hi>Proſelites</hi> by ſuch <hi>Converts</hi> as theſe are?
Oh ſayes a poor ſimple honeſt-hearted Chriſtian, who
judges by appearance, and ſuſpects no evil, What a
<hi>change</hi> is here wrought in this man? Surely this muſt
needs be by ſome <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> power of
Gods Spirit, it is good therefore to be of his <hi>Religion,</hi>
whereas the man hath but <hi>ſhifted ſpirits. One</hi> or <hi>two</hi> are
gone out, to make way for <hi>more</hi> and <hi>worſe.</hi> Is not this
the meaning of that Parable, where an unclean ſpirit (it
may be a <hi>whoriſh</hi> one,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 43, 44, 45.</note> or a <hi>drunken</hi> one) being gone out
of a man, comes again and findes his old habitation (as
there) <hi>ſwept and garniſhed,</hi> ſwept from his former filthy
luſts, and garniſhed with <hi>ſpecious</hi> ſhews and pretences of
piety (indeed an hypocrite) empty of true grace, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it thus, concludes, there's a fit <hi>dwelling</hi> for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and then goes and takes ſeven devils more, <hi>worſe</hi>
then himſelf, devils of <hi>pride, cenſoriouſneſs, faction, railing,
lying, hereſie, blaſphemy,</hi> and all theſe enter and take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
and ſo the man's <hi>worſe</hi> then ever, <hi>his latter end is
worſe then his beginning:</hi> So that you cannot call this
mans <hi>change,</hi> a <hi>converſion,</hi> though there be an <hi>alteration.</hi>
But yet to ſhew the <hi>uncertainty,</hi> and (for the moſt part)
<hi>hypocriſie</hi> of theſe <hi>ſudden</hi> changes, and to make an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
in that which may <hi>appear.</hi> Suppoſe a perſon hath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40606:13"/>
got an eſtate by <hi>cheating,</hi> cozening, bribery, forgery, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
extortion, oppreſſion, <hi>or the like,</hi> and this perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and ſo a <hi>witneſs of the truth, even of that
Chriſts appearing the ſecond time, and without ſin unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
as my friend <hi>George</hi> hath it in the Title Page of
his railing Pamphlet; and you muſt ſuppoſe this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Chriſt the ſecond time without ſin,</hi> to be ſo in <hi>him,</hi> or
elſe <hi>he</hi> cannot be a witneſs, which he ſayes himſelf to be.
Now I ſay, ſuppoſe <hi>ſuch</hi> a perſon become a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and ſo
an eminent <hi>Saint,</hi> of the higheſt form of the <hi>Quakers mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi>
and hath not made <hi>reſtitution,</hi> nor given <hi>ſatisfaction</hi>
for that eſtate ſo wickedly, impiouſly, and villanouſly
gotten, can any one in the world ſay, this man hath <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,</hi>
that he is <hi>converted,</hi> or a true Chriſtian? Will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one dare to ſay other of ſuch a one (if he profeſs to be
<hi>godly)</hi> then that he is a moſt wretched hypocrite and
diſſembler? and ſuch perſons we finde among them;
and therefore the very <hi>ſuddenneſs</hi> of their Converſions,
with ſo little evidence of <hi>truth,</hi> doth juſtly render it <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,</hi>
eſpecially if you conſider the <hi>violence</hi> of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in which they are hurried. We have another ſaying,
that <hi>nullum violentum eſt perpetuum,</hi> what is <hi>violent,</hi> is not
<hi>laſting.</hi> And ſurely, if we obſerve their <hi>violent</hi> unuſual
and uncivil actings, <hi>following</hi> (or rather <hi>going along)</hi> with
their <hi>ſudden</hi> Converſions, we may eaſily conclude the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſs</hi>
of them. For as for the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (which
they ſo highly pretend to) it was not of <hi>their</hi> temper:
<hi>He did not</hi> (as was Prophecied of him) <hi>ſtrive,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>nor cry,
neither did any man hear his voice in the ſtreets: He did
not quench the ſmoaking flax, nor break the bruiſed reed;
He did no ſin, neither was there guile found in his mouth;
when he was reviled,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 22, 23</note> 
               <hi>he reviled not again; when he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he threatned not, but committed himſelf to him that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
righteouſly.</hi> And how contrary this peoples <hi>demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
is, and how unlike this <hi>pattern,</hi> 'tis eaſie to diſcern:
Never were there ſuch bold, open, and unparallel'd <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
and <hi>Revilers</hi> in the world as <hi>theſe</hi> are, as if they were
the <hi>Maſters of Scolding,</hi> and <hi>Billingſgate</hi> Profeſſors; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40606:13"/>
which is <hi>remarkable,</hi> their rage and malice is thus violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belched out, <hi>moſt</hi> againſt the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi>
by which we diſcern whoſe <hi>Scholars</hi> they are, and whoſe
<hi>work</hi> they do: The malice of <hi>Satan</hi> hath been alwayes
moſt againſt <hi>Christs Miniſters;</hi> and therefore hath his
practiſe been, by his <hi>inſtruments,</hi> to ſlander and caſt dirt in
<hi>their</hi> faces, that by <hi>calumniating</hi> their <hi>perſons,</hi> he might
hinder the acceptation of their <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and this with
ſingular confidence and boldneſs and (no doubt) by this
means they gain with ſome people: They have learnt
that <hi>Machivilian</hi> Maxime, <hi>Calumniare audacter, aliquid
haerebit;</hi> Lie, calumniate, ſlander, and do it <hi>boldly,</hi> and
with <hi>confidence,</hi> and ſome of it will ſtick, it will <hi>take</hi>
with ſome or other; according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Proverb,
<hi>If all enter not, half will.</hi> And indeed it will not be <hi>believed</hi>
(but by obſerving perſons) how much bold, confident,
and <hi>peremptory</hi> aſſerting and holding out an <hi>Opinion,</hi> or
<hi>Relation</hi> (though falſe in it ſelf) will take, and prevaile
with ſuch <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>unexerciſed</hi> people, who cannot
<hi>judge,</hi> and put a difference between <hi>words</hi> and <hi>matter:</hi>
And it's <hi>ſtrange</hi> to ſee, how in matters of <hi>debate</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
they will determine of his <hi>ſide</hi> that is moſt <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi>
and carries on his cauſe with moſt words and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
Nay, moſt <hi>certain</hi> it is, that the very <hi>Title Page</hi>
of a Pamphlet, boldly ſtuff'd and languag'd, ſhall be a
<hi>ſufficient</hi> confutation and ſatisfaction to many, againſt
that <hi>perſon</hi> or <hi>ſide</hi> they fancy not; ſo that <hi>ſenſe,</hi> or <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe,</hi>
truth or falſhood, their Adverſaries (ſay they) is
anſwered and confuted, though poſſibly they <hi>read</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one nor tother; or if they do, they do not <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi>
them; and ſo from the <hi>bold</hi> revilings of their <hi>lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
take up a <hi>prejudice</hi> againſt both our Doctrine and
perſons: But as for the <hi>latter,</hi> we can be contented to be
reproached for <hi>Christs</hi> ſake, and the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and we can
with comfort read and think upon theſe words, <hi>Bleſſed
are ye when men ſhall revile you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>and perſecute you, and ſhall
ſay all manner of evil of you falſly for my ſake, rejoyce and
be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40606:14"/>
ſo perſecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi> And in
the ſteps of theſe their <hi>railing</hi> Fore-fathers do this people
<hi>tread,</hi> much unlike our Lord and Maſter <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi>
True it is, wee finde him <hi>angry,</hi> and much diſpleaſed
<hi>ſometimes,</hi> but 'twas with <hi>two</hi> ſorts of perſons, thoſe
who <hi>profaned</hi> the publike place of <hi>worſhip,</hi> and thoſe <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi>
who under ſpecious pretences of <hi>more</hi> holineſs and
<hi>higher</hi> perfection than others, devoured <hi>Widdowes</hi> houſes,
and made void <hi>Gods</hi> Commandements, teaching, that
Children were free from <hi>honouring</hi> their Parents, upon
their <hi>Corban,</hi> ſome religious pretences, and that now
they were <hi>free</hi> from doing any more for their <hi>Father</hi> or
<hi>Mother,</hi> contrary to that Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
thy Father, and thy Mother.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> ranks them
that do not bleſs their Mother,<note place="margin">Pro. 30. 11. 12. 13.</note> with them that <hi>curſe</hi> their
Father: And who are they? Proud <hi>ſelf-conceited</hi> hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.
I'le give you all together, <hi>There is a generation that
curſeth their Father, and doth not bleſs their Mother; There
is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not
waſhed from their filthineſs; There is a generation, oh how
lofty are their eys, and their eye-lids are lifted up.</hi> And ſurely
theſe things have never been <hi>exemplified</hi> in any age more,
than in this preſent generation of <hi>Quakers,</hi> wherein, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretext of <hi>more</hi> holineſs, piety, mortification, ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
voluntary humility, abſtinences, and the like, they
<hi>put forth</hi> ſo much pride, ſcorn, rancour, cenſoriouſneſs,
ſelf-exalting other-men condemning <hi>practiſes,</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was the like known (or heard of) by <hi>any</hi> people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heaven. With ſuch as theſe <hi>(Profaners</hi> of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
places of worſhip, and <hi>diſſembling hypocrites</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
all others) I finde our Lord dealing very <hi>roundly,
whipping</hi> the one out of the Temple, and <hi>denouncing</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and dreadful <hi>woes</hi> and <hi>judgements</hi> againſt the other:
But as for all <hi>other</hi> ſorts of ſinners, I finde him manifeſting
much <hi>tenderneſs</hi> towards them, being meek and gentle,
benigne and gracious, <hi>eating and drinking with Publicans
and ſinners;</hi> which reads mee this leſſon, that <hi>Profaners</hi> of
Gods Worſhip, and <hi>hypocrites,</hi> are to be dealt with more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40606:14"/>
ſeverely and ſharply than others. And the ſame courſe
doth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> direct his Scholar <hi>Titus</hi> (a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter)
to take with <hi>unruly and vain talkers, and deceivers,
who ſubvert whole houſes, teaching things that they ought not,
for filthy lucres ſake,</hi> Titus 1. 13. <hi>Rebuke them ſharply, that
they may be ſound in the faith:</hi> And therefore if theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be found to be <hi>hypocrites,</hi> and we deal <hi>plainly</hi> with
them; if they call our plain dealing <hi>railing,</hi> we will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
our Maſter in bearing his <hi>reproach,</hi> for doing the <hi>ſame</hi>
work that hee did, and his Apoſtles enjoyned us, and leave
it to him to <hi>judge</hi> between us.</p>
            <p>And for mine <hi>own</hi> part, if any man ſhal be diſpleaſed with
mee, for telling people of their <hi>ſins,</hi> and neglect of their
<hi>duties</hi> (as deſiring their amendment) keeping my ſelf
within the bounds of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>ſoberneſs</hi> (of which thoſe
who are guilty of <hi>baſe</hi> cowardiſe, flattery, or <hi>unworthy</hi>
compliance; nor thoſe who <hi>kick,</hi> becauſe their ſores are
touch'd on, ſhall be my <hi>Judges)</hi> I ſhall not account my
ſelf to have diſcharged my <hi>Miniſtery</hi> faithfully, if ſome
be not <hi>angry.</hi> Sore eyes cannot endure the light, and a
<hi>toothleſs</hi> Miniſter will beſt pleaſe a <hi>careleſs</hi> and a <hi>ſecure</hi>
people; and if they will have ſuch <hi>Teachers,</hi> the beſt way
(which they have pretty well learn'd) is to get ſuch that
muſt live upon their <hi>almes,</hi> that they and theirs may
<hi>ſtarve,</hi> if they will not <hi>flatter</hi> them; and which (I am
confident) is not the leaſt of <hi>Satans</hi> deſign at <hi>this</hi> time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Nation. I write not this in reference to my own
<hi>condition,</hi> for I bleſs <hi>God,</hi> I am otherwiſe <hi>honeſtly</hi> provided
for; and the ſhutting of peoples <hi>Purſes,</hi> ſhall not ſtop my
<hi>mouth</hi> from <hi>ſpeaking</hi> what my Lord and Maſter <hi>commands</hi>
me: And as the Apoſtle (in another caſe) ſo I in this,
could wiſh that all other Miniſters in the Nation were as
I am, for then I ſhould hope we ſhould have a <hi>better</hi>
people, I mean for the general; and as for thoſe <hi>reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
which <hi>ſome</hi> would caſt upon mee, I can, and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in this, that it is not for any <hi>falſe</hi> Doctrine, or <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous</hi>
converſation, or for any thing of <hi>perſonal</hi> or <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi>
concernment, but for home, and plain, and faithful
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40606:15"/>
applications, from <hi>zealous</hi> and hearty oppoſition againſt
<hi>faction, hereſie,</hi> and <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> and againſt unworthy and

who will not eaſily be rouzed: And if any ſhall hence
apprehend themſelves <hi>juſtified</hi> in the like reprehenſions
towards mee, I prevent them with this propoſal; when
they ſhall finde mee devouring Widdowes houſes, or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining

<hi>callings)</hi> when they finde me (and they can prove it)
preaching <hi>falſe doctrine</hi> and <hi>hereſie,</hi> when I do any of theſe
things, let them call me <hi>hypocrite,</hi> and deal <hi>ſharply</hi> with
me, I will not call it <hi>perſecution.</hi> And ſince I am thus fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
upon this particular, give me leave to write a word
or <hi>two</hi> unto it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> charge us (and according to their guize
and guile) make loud <hi>out-cries</hi> on us for <hi>Perſecution:</hi> But
I appeal to all the world, who are the Perſecutors; Do
not <hi>they</hi> diſturb, revile, and perſecute? Are not <hi>we</hi> in
our rightful poſſeſſions and imployments? And did, or
do <hi>we</hi> go or run after them, to hinder or diſquiet them?
Do we deſire any thing of them, more than that we and
our people might meet and ſerve God peaceably, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our rule? And may we not require it of our <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates?</hi>
And is it not their duty, to ſecure and protect
<hi>us and themſelves</hi> from tumults, frights, and fears? Muſt
they revile and reproach <hi>us,</hi> and our <hi>doctrine,</hi> and render
us vile at <hi>their</hi> pleaſures? Muſt all they ſay be <hi>good</hi> and
<hi>warrantable?</hi> And muſt our juſt defences of our ſelves,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40606:15"/>
calling, and <hi>worſhip,</hi> be perſecuting and railing, <hi>becauſe
they ſay ſo?</hi> Was there ever ſuch a breed of peremptory
Controllers of <hi>words, Lawes,</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> as theſe are?
Muſt all the world bow down and kiſs <hi>their</hi> feet, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<hi>James Naylor,</hi> upon their bare and <hi>un-grounded</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations?
And if at any time, any of them do ſuffer <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,</hi>
or the like, what is it for? Is it for <hi>Religion,</hi> or
conſcience ſake? Who meddles with them upon that
account? Is not their <hi>ſuffering</hi> for riotous diſturbances in
our <hi>Publique Worſhip?</hi> And if they ſay their <hi>conſcience</hi> or
<hi>light</hi> leads them to it, and therefore they muſt be ſuffer'd,
and not puniſhed, which if we do puniſh, 'tis <hi>Perſecution.</hi>
I ask, What if their <hi>light</hi> lead them to take away our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
as well as our <hi>good name,</hi> muſt they (becauſe they
pretend conſcience) be let <hi>alone</hi> and ſuffered? Or if they
ſuffer, is it <hi>Perſecution?</hi> I leave it to all ſober men in the
world to <hi>judge,</hi> and who are not willing to be led <hi>blinde-fold:</hi>
Nor is this a <hi>groundleſſe</hi> or a blinde <hi>ſuggeſtion,</hi> that
ſuch a thing as this may be; for did not the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi>
in <hi>Germany</hi> heretofore do the ſame, upon the like preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
Did they not rob, and take away the eſtates of all
that were not of their <hi>Faction,</hi> becauſe forſooth they
were the <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>ungodly?</hi> And was not this the level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
principle of <hi>that thing,</hi> which my opponent <hi>George</hi>
in his imaginary <hi>Throne of truth,</hi> page 104. calls a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and highly magnifies? Whoſe ſpeech was that to
the Officers of the Army at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> concerning that
<hi>Parliament</hi> (if we muſt ſo call it) <hi>That they did fly at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and property, inſomuch, that if one man had twelve Cowes,
they held, that another that wanted Cowes ought to take a
ſhare of his neighbour: And</hi> (as he moſt conſideringly
ſaid) <hi>Who could have ſaid any thing was his own, if they
had gone on?</hi> And bleſſed be God for their diſſolution.
And thus much of the <hi>Quakers perfection,</hi> from their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi>

            <p>And now a word or two of the <hi>matter</hi> (the ſtuffe)

they uſe to call an unprofitable and <hi>empty fellow,</hi>
a <hi>Fungus,</hi> which is a <hi>Muſhrom.</hi> He that will be informed

other evil qualities of them, you ſhall finde ſome of

<hi>kill</hi> and ſmother Bees, to drive them out of their <hi>Hives,</hi>
and bereave the poor <hi>Bees</hi> of their meat, houſes, and
lives: And in ſome places they ſerve, ſayes he, to carry
<hi>fire</hi> from place to place, and which being open'd, ſend
forth a thin powder like to <hi>ſmoak,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This of the Puck foiſts, which is one kinde of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrom.</note> which is very noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome

<hi>Ill weeds</hi> (we ſay) <hi>grow apace;</hi> not ſo good herbs,

not be miſtaken, I do not any way <hi>judge</hi> or limit the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi>
in his operations upon ſouls to be converted, either
for the <hi>matter</hi> (the perſons to be converted) or the <hi>manner</hi>
(the ſuddenneſs of it) for he is a <hi>moſt free,</hi> and a moſt

ſo ſudden, violent, and ſo general, eſpecially with
ſuch as have been <hi>groſly</hi> ignorant and ſcandalous; he doth

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40606:17"/>
               <hi>change</hi> is not <hi>converſion.</hi> The Scripture tells us of ſome

               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 15.</note> and that ſome ſhall <hi>turn away</hi>

               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 4.</note> and ſhall be turned unto <hi>fables,</hi>

            <p>Much more might be, and hath been elſwhere ſpoken

it here again be minded (to evince the <hi>unſoundneſſe</hi> of the
Quakers <hi>converſion,</hi> aad thence their <hi>imperfection)</hi> the effect
or end of <hi>Goſpel converſion</hi> is, to change and alter men
both in minde and manners, and to bring them to that
Goſpel temper prophecied of and promiſed, Iſa. 11. 6. 7.
8. <hi>The Wolfe ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard
ſhall lie down with the Kid, and the Calf, and the young Lion,
and the Fatling together, and a little childe ſhall lead them,
&amp;c.</hi> So tame and gentle ſhall they be, walking lowly and
meekly, under the ſenſe of former vileneſs, with humble
acknowledgements of their own <hi>unworthineſſe,</hi> of ſuch
grace they have received, not boaſting, exalting, or
(Phariſee like) lifting up <hi>themſelves</hi> above others, with
<hi>a ſtand further off, I am more holy then thou:</hi> Whereas
the Quakers <hi>change</hi> is of a quite contrary temper, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they were before: How meek, how milde, how
gentle ſoever, they <hi>now</hi> become fierce, and heady, and
raging, running up and down like mad dogs and tygers,
barking, biting, ſuarling, raving, and railing at all others;
nay, even <hi>women</hi> and <hi>maidens,</hi> (the ornament of whoſe
ſex is a meek and quiet ſpirit) changing their <hi>natural</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 4.</note> become (not ſpiritual, but) unnatural, uncivil, and
<hi>immodeſt,</hi> lifting up their voices in the very ſtreets and
<hi>publike</hi> Congregations: So that had that conceit of thoſe
Phyloſophers, of <hi>Tranſmigration</hi> of the ſouls of men and
women into beaſts been true, we might have thence fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
another, and that is, that the ſouls of <hi>beaſts</hi> had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migrated,
and ſhifted themſelves into the bodies of <hi>women
and</hi> maidens, and informed them, it being otherwiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
impoſſible (ſure not imaginable) that that more
<hi>modeſt</hi> and milder ſex ſhould ſo far forget themſelves, but
not to ſeek after ſuch uncertain light (indeed falſe) for the
ground of this miſcarriage. The true light of <hi>Scripture</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:40606:18"/>
tells us,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 25. 26.</note> that thoſe <hi>who change the truth of God into a lie, the
Lord in juſtice gives them up to vile affections,</hi> and paſſions,
ſo that even <hi>women change the order of nature into that
which is contrary to nature,</hi> as this people do: So that from
the <hi>manner</hi> of the Quakers converſion, the <hi>matter,</hi> and
the <hi>end</hi> and term, we may well conclude, their <hi>change</hi> is
not <hi>true converſion,</hi> but unſound and rotten, and then they
are not perfect. Thus of the Quakers <hi>in general.</hi>

(notwithſtanding all his unworthy dealings with me)
<hi>gladly</hi> receive him into my <hi>boſome;</hi> but for the preſent,
and as yet he appears to be, I look upon him with a <hi>heart</hi>

For truly, as I look upon <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> as a dreadful

to them; for the Lord hath ſeveral wayes to deal
with <hi>Goſpel</hi>-deſpiſers and contemners, who receive not
the truth with a love of it. When I read my opponents
Pamphlet <hi>(oculo currente)</hi> as we ſay,<note place="margin">Throne of Truth, page 100.</note> and with a <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial</hi>
eye, I met with his <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Lord Craven,</hi> (with the iniquity whereof I knew
he had been highly charged) I made a ſtand, and <hi>ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi>
obſerved it; and I do confeſs I was ſomewhat <hi>aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed</hi>
at that bold and daring Appeal, which he therein
makes unto the all-diſcerning eye of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> of
his innocency and integrity, which made me (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the <hi>notoriouſneſſe</hi> of the fact, and of his being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with it) to read <hi>again,</hi> and to conſider whether there
might not be ſome equivocation in the language and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
which not appearing to me, I then began to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40606:18"/>
think, that poſſibly he might not be <hi>guilty,</hi> this being an
age, wherein many things are charged upon many men
very ſlightly and ungroundedly, and ſometimes very
falſly: But when I more <hi>cloſely,</hi> and with a more obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
eye, read <hi>again</hi> his writings, and took notice of his
<hi>practiſes</hi> and <hi>devices,</hi> his juglings, wreſtlings, prevaricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and pervertings of my plain <hi>ſenſe</hi> and meaning; his
putting of <hi>blindes</hi> and fallacies upon his Reader, (which
artifice poſſibly he learned of his Maſter the Jeſuite, whom
he ſerved till he was diſcovered.) And when I obſerved
his <hi>railing</hi> and reviling language, with his malicious and
revengeful tendencies, I then ſaw, that as he had dealt
with a ſhameleſs forehead in <hi>this</hi> matter, ſo he had done
in <hi>that alſo;</hi> and that he was a perſon of a profligate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and that there was ſome <hi>mental reſervation</hi> in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation;
or that (which I moſt incline to believe) he is a
man of a moſt ſupernaturally, and God-forſaken-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd
heart, and ſeared <hi>conſcience.</hi> And I affirme, that if
we may judge, and take an eſtimate of the Conſcience,
honeſty, and perfection of the Quakers <hi>in general,</hi> by this
man in <hi>particular,</hi> we may ſafely ſay, <hi>that one may be as vile
a perſon as any under heaven, and yet be a perfect Quaker.</hi> For
certainly, he that ſhall dare to make <hi>ſuch</hi> an appeal to the
all-ſeeing eye of God, of his <hi>innocence,</hi> and ſhall be <hi>guilty,</hi>
will dare to do <hi>any</hi> thing. But the Proverb is verified;
<hi>She that will dare to play the Whore, will dare to deny it;</hi>
Cuſtome is a ſecond nature: So that, in what a man is
<hi>accuſtomed</hi> unto, it is a hard matter for him to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:

            <p>For to come to his <hi>dealings</hi> and practiſes, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
(and to conſider) what <hi>he</hi> begins with, how vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(and like the bragging ſouldier in the Comedy) how

he lift up the hands of that <hi>blaſpheming</hi> wretch, <hi>James

<hi>What law hath he broken? Or what offence againſt man

(and in part puniſhed) as a <hi>horrible blaſphemer:</hi> It's
free to this man <hi>(Geo. Biſhop)</hi> to arraign and cenſure the
actions of the Parliament; but, is <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Champion of
the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> before whom none of the Prieſts could
ſtand, as <hi>George</hi> ſayes? And was his light ſo clear (ſo
infallible; ſo ſure?) How comes it to paſs that this <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſon of the morning,</hi> is like <hi>Lucifer</hi> ſo caſt down, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40606:19"/>
darkned, by that <hi>woman</hi> and her company,<note place="margin">Martha Simons.</note> with all their
filthineſs and deceit, as he phraſes it, page 5. beg. What
<hi>Spirit</hi> was that: and what <hi>darkneſſe</hi> was that which he
ſpeaks of, page 4. that <hi>clouded</hi> him? When <hi>began</hi> it?
And is it not <hi>ſtill</hi> upon him? And how came it to paſs,
that being <hi>delivered,</hi> he became dark <hi>again?</hi> (page ead.)
Theſe things would be known, that ſo wee might ſay,
<hi>when James</hi> is in the <hi>dark,</hi> or when he is in the <hi>light,</hi> that
ſo we might not be miſtaken in him; for we muſt not be

thoſe, who (notwithſtanding his, and his fellow <hi>Foxes</hi>
diſclaimes) did, and do <hi>ſtill</hi> own <hi>James Naylor.</hi> But
to let this paſs, (for he is not worth inquiring after) by the
wiſdome of God that fore-ſees all things (ſayes he, page
5.) it was ſo <hi>ordered,</hi> that there was found (among the
papers that were about <hi>James Naylor)</hi> one paper where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that <hi>ſpirit</hi> (good or bad) the <hi>woman</hi> and her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<note place="margin">Martha Simons.</note> and their practiſes were <hi>expreſly</hi> diſcerned and
judged.<note place="margin">This was the Letter ſent from <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> to <hi>Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor;</hi> mentioned both in my Narrative, and <hi>Geo.</hi> anſwer. In which Letter they diſclaim, and judge <hi>James Naylor,</hi> and his crew, as deceivers.</note> But now mark <hi>(horrendum facinus)</hi> the falſe
and miſchievous ſpirit of the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> that publiſh'd that
Narrative, <hi>and his foul and diſhoneſt dealing, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
he is in his relation: The Prieſt out of devilliſh wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs</hi>
(Georges <hi>words) forges ſuch a word, as had it been
truly ſo, might have rendred</hi> George Fox <hi>a blaſphemer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his own hand; and this is ſuch a fact, that words need
not further to expreſs it, which in its very face is ſo manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wicked and abominable, a wickedneſs not found in the
roll of thoſe evils, which the Apoſtle mentions, ſhould make
the laſt daies perillous; and 'tis manifeſt, this act is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this, and more, page 7, 8. of his Pamphlet, and
part of the 9. To all this out-cry, by way of anſwer, one
would have expected, that one ſo <hi>eminently</hi> perfect in
charity as <hi>George</hi> is (for if hee have not charity, hee is
nothing, hee is not what hee pretends) would have
judged the beſt, which is one main property of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
it would have taught him, as v. 5. not to be ready to
think evil of another,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 1, 2.</note> and not to have <hi>triumph'd</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40606:20"/>
in my ſin, and made ſo <hi>many</hi> words of it; and to
<hi>aggravate</hi> it ſo highly; Charity would have ſuggeſted
this, or the like, <hi>Poſſibly through his (the Prieſt) and his
Scribes neglect, or miſtake, or the hand of the Clerk (from
whom hee received the Copy of that Letter) being obſcurely
written, there being not much difference between theſe two
words (own and am) as they may be written, might miſlead
both, or either of them.</hi> Or, <hi>it may be a miſtake of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the Prieſts over-ſight in correcting.</hi> Or (if none of
this could have pleaded my excuſe, to clear me from ſo
great a crime as foul forgery) he might have (in reaſon)
<hi>conſidered</hi> me from his <hi>own</hi> condition, before he became
ſo ſingularly illuminated. For I ask, was he never (in
the time of his darkneſs and ignorance) guilty <hi>indeed</hi> of
forgery? (of which hereafter) Or was it not, becauſe
he had been ſo often criminous in ſuch practiſes, that hee
ſo <hi>eaſily,</hi> ſo readily, and ſo <hi>(confidently</hi> charges others. I
leave it to his <hi>light</hi> within him: But (to ſatisfie every
honeſt perſon) the truth is, <hi>It is juſt ſo</hi> (as I have ſet it
down) <hi>in the Copy of the Letter, which I received from the
hands of the Clerk, who took the examination,</hi> and that as
<hi>plainly</hi> written, as any words in the world, which Maſter
<hi>Dorney</hi> will acknowledge, and which the Copy it ſelf
will juſtifie, which I have to ſhew to all that deſire it. As
for the Letter it ſelf, it was ſent up to <hi>London</hi> to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and there continues. And (as Mr. <hi>Dorney</hi> ſaid
upon ſight of the Copy) it might be ſo <hi>as I have expreſt
it</hi> (for ought hee knew) in the original, which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be or no, in this caſe is not <hi>material,</hi> I am clear, I
did not <hi>forge</hi> it; and yet upon this <hi>baſe</hi> doth he build the
<hi>great</hi> weight of his diſcourſe, charging and re-charging
(like a doughty Captain) again and again, in <hi>ſeveral</hi>
places of his Pamphlet, making this his great <hi>Achilles.</hi>
And ſo much in <hi>diſcharge</hi> of that great calumny which
he makes ſo much uſe of. And I wiſh him to conſider,
whether hee did not <hi>willingly</hi> take it up, as a matter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
mee, when as (probably) hee might bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
I followed my Copy. For ſure I am, I have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40606:20"/>
been <hi>divers</hi> times asked (before the publication of his
ſcurrilous Pamphlet) how it was in my preſident, or
copy: To which I gave ſatisfaction, if he did it <hi>wilfully,</hi>
the Lord humble him, and forgive him.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſayes (page 9.) that what I have
publiſh'd in my Narrative (p. 10, 11.) of the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of <hi>Martha Simons,</hi> is enough to prove mee, my
deſign, and title, and book, to be a <hi>lie.</hi> Surely he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
highly upon the blindneſs, ignorance, or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of his <hi>Reader;</hi> for it clearly demonſtrates, that
<hi>Fox,</hi> and his Crew, were againſt <hi>Naylor,</hi> and his; and ſo
that they were not all guided by <hi>one</hi> ſpirit, or at beſt, by
<hi>that</hi> ſpirit which is the ſpirit of diviſion, which was <hi>part</hi>
of the deſign and title of my book, and ſo <hi>not</hi> a lie. But
that which ſticks much in the Captains teeth, and puts
him to picking (from page 11. of his Pamphlet, to 24.)
is the <hi>Quakers confuſion</hi> with which I charge them. And
truly, I believe, had he been left at <hi>large,</hi> to chooſe his
<hi>own</hi> teſtimonies, and to have <hi>ſuborn'd</hi> and produc'd his
<hi>own</hi> witneſſes, he would perhaps have pack'd his matter
handſomer, and more to his own purpoſe; but being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
<hi>to my</hi> relation, how miſerably is he <hi>be-dabled</hi> and
confounded, in ſeeking <hi>confuſion</hi> where it was not, in my
book.</p>
            <p>The ſum of all that matter is this, for I could not bring
you into <hi>every</hi> ſtinking corner of his diſcourſe, but help
you to view it, and him at a <hi>distance,</hi> leſt the noyſomneſs
of it ſhould <hi>offend</hi> you. I did (in my Narrative) by way
of <hi>dilemma</hi> (which what kinde of argument that is Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
know) propoſe <hi>two</hi> things, by way of ſuppoſition,
but poſitively affirming <hi>noither:</hi> But if either were true,
(as one of them muſt, the matters propounded being
apparent) I had my <hi>end</hi> upon them. The matter thus,
There was <hi>oppoſition</hi> and <hi>witneſs bearing</hi> (that's plain, and
confeſt, not only by words of mouth and writing, but
alſo by blowes and ſore beating) between <hi>Fox,</hi> and his
followers, and <hi>Naylor,</hi> and his. Now, ſay I here's <hi>oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
manifeſted and declared, Party againſt Party, in <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:40606:21"/>
I conſider'd the <hi>Quakers, (Fox</hi> and <hi>Naylor,</hi> and
all of them one and another) as pretending to be led
by <hi>one</hi> and the ſame <hi>unerring ſpirit;</hi> and that, as they ſaid,
they were all <hi>one;</hi> but here was <hi>diviſion,</hi> and daggers
drawing (as it were) one againſt another; I look'd upon
them in <hi>general</hi> as deceivers, their fruits diſcovering it.
This <hi>oppoſition</hi> (if true) I concluded could not conſiſt
with <hi>unity</hi> and oneneſs, to which they pretended I had
no way to <hi>determine</hi> the matter, but thus: This oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theirs (ſay I) was either <hi>reall, i.e. Fox</hi> and his
Crew were <hi>realy</hi> and <hi>indeed</hi> diſpleaſed, and did <hi>judge
Naylor</hi> and his, or they were <hi>not indeed</hi> diſpleaſed and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
and this <hi>oppoſition</hi> and quarrel might be <hi>but</hi> from
the teeth outward and to <hi>blinde</hi> the world; one of <hi>theſe</hi>
two muſt of neceſſity be granted; if the <hi>former, ſc.</hi> that it
was a <hi>reall</hi> quarrel, then their brags of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> was a <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> a
cheat, and they <hi>deceivers,</hi> and impoſtors that way. If the
latter, ſc. If their <hi>oppoſition</hi> were but <hi>feigned,</hi> they were
cheats and liars that way, in <hi>pretending</hi> oppoſition where
it was <hi>not</hi> reall.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>either</hi> might be <hi>true,</hi> I gave divers grounds
or reaſons, not <hi>determining</hi> for either, but <hi>abſolutely</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
<hi>one,</hi> which was ſufficient to <hi>my</hi> purpoſe, which
was, to <hi>diſcover</hi> their impoſtures and deceivings: And
yet hereupon ſo <hi>ſimple,</hi> or ſo—is this fellow, as to cry
out, <hi>Is not the matter granted,</hi> and <hi>the Prieſt grants it?</hi>
when as 'tis eaſie to diſcerne, I do but argue <hi>exhypotheſi,</hi>
and by way of ſuppoſition. Thus, if ſo, then they are <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi>
(notwithſtanding their profeſſions of unity) if
thus (as it may be) then (notwithſtanding their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
oppoſitions) they are <hi>ſecretly</hi> agreed, and they are
<hi>one,</hi> either way, Impoſtors. And this diſcovers his <hi>deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
in thoſe fourteen pages: And yet we ſee how ſimply
he pleaſes himſelf at the end of his thirteenth page, and
the beginning of the fourteenth, vapouring and bragging
with high language, as if my diſcourſe in that matter,
were nothing but <hi>confuſion</hi> and contradiction. I am not
willing to put my ſelf to ſo much paines to write it out.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40606:21"/>
And here I might end with his 24. page for the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But there are <hi>ſome</hi> things I muſt take notice of, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his blindes and juglings with his <hi>Reader,</hi> and his moſt
miſerable begging a thing in <hi>queſtion;</hi> nay, <hi>utterly</hi> denied
him. In the fourteenth page, (and ſo on, to part of the
twentieth) hee ſeems to mee to deal with his <hi>Reader</hi> as a
cunning <hi>Thief,</hi> who over-taking a <hi>ſimple-hearted,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
Traveller, and not well acquainted with the way,
falls in with him, and entertaines him with a <hi>long</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and (unawares to the man) draws him out of
the way, to rob him: So doth hee make a large ſtory of
<hi>Moſes</hi> leading <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of his tranſactions
with <hi>Corah</hi> and his company; and of <hi>Aarcus</hi> buſineſs
with <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> and other ſuch like matters,
and of the <hi>oppoſition</hi> between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and of <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Barnabas, &amp;c.</hi> and asks, Whether, becauſe of theſe
oppoſitions and conteſts between the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> party,
(the one being in the right, and the other in the wrong)
Whether therefore the <hi>Quakers,</hi> becauſe of their <hi>oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
be a pack of <hi>cozening</hi> Impoſtors, and lying Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks:
And he ſayes, if my argument be good, or of
force <hi>to prove the Quakers confuſion, and that the one true
infallible ſpirit by which they are led, is a Babel, bauble, cheat,
an Impoſtor, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe of <hi>Foxes</hi> and <hi>Naylors</hi> oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Then he ſayes, Moſes <hi>and the Iſraelites, who kept
faithful with God, and the Law, &amp;c. muſt bee ſo too.</hi> And
upon this ſcore, calls me <hi>high blaſphemer, and arrogant
Prieſt, &amp;c.</hi> Before I make anſwer, I muſt obſerve the
wretched, perverſe, and prevaricating ſpirit of this man,
and how <hi>unworthily,</hi> and indeed <hi>diſhoneſtly</hi> hee wreſts and
changes my expreſſions at his pleaſure: For where (in
all, or any part of my book) did I ſay, that the one <hi>true
infallible</hi> ſpirit, by which the <hi>Quakers</hi> are led, is a <hi>Babel,</hi>
bauble, cheat, an Impoſtor (as hee would make mee to
ſay page 15. of his Pamphlet) All that I ſaid was, that
their <hi>pretences</hi> to be led by that Spirit, was a <hi>Babel, &amp;c.</hi>
And I <hi>deny</hi> that they are led by the one <hi>true infallible</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
And now I ſay further, the Spirit by which the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:40606:22"/>
are led, is a <hi>Babel, &amp;c.</hi> And now to the matter in
queſtion: And ſeriouſly (Reader) I'le tell thee truth,
when I obſerved his reaſoning (if I may give it ſo good
a name) I could not chuſe (though alone) but <hi>ſmile,</hi>
and was affected, I cannot well ſay, whether more with
the ſimplicity of the man in his own underſtanding (in
reſpect of his darkneſs) or with <hi>ſomething elſe,</hi> whereby
hee would <hi>impoſe</hi> upon the ignorance of ſome <hi>ſilly</hi> Reader,
in all, and every one of thoſe <hi>inſtances</hi> produced by him,
which is to this end, <hi>ſc.</hi> to evince this truth, (for I'le do
him all the right in the World) <hi>That good men may diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and not be Impoſtors,</hi> as did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Paul</hi>
and <hi>Peter, &amp;c.</hi> wherein he might have ſpared himſelf,
and Reader, a great deal of labour. For I readily grant,
That becauſe <hi>ſome</hi> ſin, therefore <hi>all</hi> ſin, is no good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But what's this to the <hi>Quakers?</hi> Doth this clear
<hi>them</hi> from being <hi>Impoſtors?</hi> Wee ſay, whether they <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi>
or not agree, they are <hi>both</hi> wrong, both <hi>deceivers:</hi>
May not Knaves fall together by the ears? Doth their
<hi>falling out,</hi> make either ſide honeſt? Suppoſe the <hi>Quakers</hi>
and the <hi>Ranters</hi> (who pretended to as high a principle,
even the ſame) ſhould <hi>fall out,</hi> would that juſtifie <hi>either?</hi>
No, no, my friend <hi>George</hi> (or who ever helpt him) is out;
they ſhall not get that by <hi>begging,</hi> which they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>prove;</hi> nor will wee ever grant them, that <hi>either (Fox</hi>
or <hi>Naylor)</hi> are in the right, or to be believed: True it is,
had <hi>either (Fox</hi> or <hi>Naylor)</hi> been in the <hi>Truth,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi>
was, and <hi>Paul</hi> was, <hi>and thoſe</hi> other <hi>Worthies</hi> (whom hee
inſtances) theſe allegations had been to purpoſe; but
<hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Naylor both,</hi> being <hi>Deceivers,</hi> all this matter of
<hi>Georges,</hi> is beſides the cuſhion.</p>
            <p>And I cannot but note one thing, how <hi>bold</hi> this man is
with <hi>all the Quakers</hi> that are not of his perſwaſion, as if
hee had <hi>monopoliz'd</hi> the Spirit of Truth and Infallibility,
he brings in <hi>Naylor</hi> and his Party, as <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the <hi>Calf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,</hi>
and <hi>Fox</hi> and his Party, as <hi>Moſes;</hi> the one <hi>ſinning,</hi>
the other <hi>reproving;</hi> for if this be not his meaning, hee
produces that, and his other inſtances, to no purpoſe:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40606:22"/>
So that hee would have <hi>Naylor</hi> the <hi>Calf,</hi> and his Party,
thoſe that <hi>worſhip</hi> him. Are all the <hi>Quakers</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
of his minde? If not (as ſure it is they are not) where
is ſtill their unity? And they may well queſtion <hi>George,</hi>
as <hi>arrogating</hi> and aſſuming unto himſelf (and <hi>Foxes</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers)
the ſpirit of ſtability and ſetledneſs: In <hi>derogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of <hi>Naylor</hi> and his Adherents, as he doth in page 20.
whom they deny, <hi>as being under the ſpirit of darkneſs,</hi>
page 21.</p>
            <p>And whereas hee (ſillily) ſeems to triumph over us
<hi>Prieſts</hi> (as hee calls us) becauſe wee do not <hi>hypocritically</hi>
and lyingly (as they do) pretend to bee led <hi>infallibly,</hi> by
the Spirits diſcovery of new doctrines to us, as were the
Apoſtles: Let him know, that wee are led and guided
by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> into the knowledge and belief of thoſe
truths which were ſo revealed, by <hi>belief</hi> whereof, wee
attain <hi>ſalvation,</hi> (and as many as by our preaching im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
and follow the ſame truths with us) without more
or further revelations. And wee affirm, and prove, that
<hi>ſo</hi> preaching, our <hi>people</hi> ought to hear us, and wee are to
be <hi>believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But doth not the <hi>Reader</hi> perceive the <hi>blinde,</hi> that <hi>George</hi>
would put upon him? Doth hee not diſcern the <hi>end</hi> of
that long diſcourſe, whereby hee would draw him out
of the way to <hi>cozen</hi> him, that hee might not look after
the <hi>matter</hi> that was of great concernment, and incumbent
upon <hi>George</hi> (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> great Advocate) to have
<hi>undertaken</hi> and diſcharged? But of that <hi>ne gry quidem</hi> (as
wee ſay) not a word: That which an <hi>underſtanding</hi>
Reader would reaſonably have look'd for, was, that
<hi>George</hi> would have done them this ſervice, to have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
how this can ſtand with <hi>truth, That the Quakers are
all at an agreement, and led by one Spirit of truth;</hi> When as
<hi>Fox,</hi> (one great Apoſtle, (who alſo hath many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers)
ſhall charge <hi>Naylor</hi> (another great Apoſtle,
who alſo hath many followers) that <hi>hee and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are joyned againſt the truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">As in that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Letter.</note> 
               <hi>and that he trained up a
company againſt it, and that their iniquity doth encreaſe,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40606:23"/>
and that accompanied with wilfulneſs and ſtubbornneſs.</hi> Is
this to bee <hi>one</hi> in the truth, when <hi>one</hi> conſiderable Party
are joyned againſt the truth? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And another thus bear
witneſs againſt them, and yet they ſtubbornly perſiſt. If
<hi>George</hi> now could have unfolded this <hi>riddle,</hi> hee ſhould
have been the <hi>Quakers Oedipus,</hi> or their great <hi>Apollo,</hi> to
<hi>reſolve</hi> all their doubts, and help them at a dead lift, but
not being able to do it, hee decoyes his Reader <hi>out of the
way,</hi> and tells him a long ſtory, of nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
And yet a little further, it would be known, for
the information of all <hi>Quakers</hi> in general (for I ſee I muſt
bee their friend) What is, or was <hi>James Naylor's</hi> ſin
and wickedneſs, that ſuch <hi>high</hi> teſtimony is born againſt
it, as that the matter muſt come to blowes: Wherefore
do theſe <hi>infallible</hi> ones thus judge him, and his company,
(who are not a few) and ſpirit? It is not (it ſeemes)
for his and their <hi>blaſphemous</hi> practiſes, for which the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
did cenſure him, for this teſtimony was born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and the ſin <hi>witneſſed</hi> againſt, was long before
<hi>James</hi> riding in pomp. No, this <hi>Fox</hi> and his Crew can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of, and ſo become <hi>participes criminis,</hi> guilty of the
ſame crime, <hi>witneſs Foxe</hi>'s, and others papers publiſhed
in print, for extenuation and <hi>vindication</hi> of <hi>Naylor, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
the <hi>Petitions</hi> of thoſe eminently godly and conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſons, who <hi>interceded</hi> for him with the Parliament;
and <hi>witneſs Biſhop</hi> himſelf, page 3. who asks, <hi>What Law
hath it been made appear to the Nation that</hi> Naylor <hi>hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?</hi>
And then highly aggravates his ſuffering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled:
So that in this, the <hi>Prieſt</hi> will grant they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.
But ſtill wee are to ſeek what was <hi>James</hi> his ſin,
Was it; becauſe that woman <hi>(Martha Simons)</hi> ſtruck him
<hi>dumb,</hi> and made him <hi>ſilent;</hi> ſo that hee hath not ſince
ſpoken in <hi>publike?</hi> Why, Is not this <hi>now</hi> in faſhion among
them generally? Their <hi>ſilent</hi> meetings, wherein like <hi>Pigs</hi>
and <hi>Swine</hi> they come together, and <hi>grunt,</hi> and ſnuffle, and
ſo depart.</p>
            <p>Wee read in the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> ſometimes of a <hi>mad</hi> and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>devil,</hi> that no man could <hi>tame, Mark</hi> 2. 3, 4. And
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40606:23"/>
               <hi>Matthew</hi> ſayes he was ſo fierce,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 28.</note> that <hi>no man might paſs by
that way.</hi> And ſometimes wee read of a <hi>dumb,</hi> a ſilent
<hi>devil,</hi> ſo called, becauſe hee made thoſe hee poſſeſſed
<hi>dumb</hi> and <hi>ſilent,</hi> ſo that they were not then free to ſpeak.
And it ſeems the <hi>Quakers</hi> muſt <hi>witneſs</hi> theſe various diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations,
as a part of their perfection. This then is not
<hi>James Naylors</hi> ſin, <hi>George Fox,</hi> or <hi>Biſhop,</hi> ſhall do well (in
charity) to acquaint the World of <hi>Quakers</hi> with it, that
they may avoid it, leſt they come into the ſame condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and to greater <hi>confuſion,</hi> and hee bee more puzled;
wee ſhall expect it, when <hi>George</hi> gets up into his Throne
again; and if it bee that <hi>Bastard</hi> that <hi>James Naylor</hi> was
<hi>charged</hi> with, let them deal <hi>plainly</hi> with the World, for
there is (ſince the publication of my Narrative) ſome
further diſcoveries of it, more fully; as in a book entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>The Grand Impoſtor examined,</hi> printed for <hi>H. Brome,</hi>
at the <hi>Hand</hi> in <hi>Pauls-Church-yard.</hi> As alſo another entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>An exact Hiſtory of the Life of</hi> James Naylor, <hi>with
his parents, birth, education, &amp;c.</hi> printed by <hi>Edward Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
in <hi>Green-Arbour,</hi> both publiſhed by one <hi>John Deacon,</hi>
wherein there is alſo mention made of a <hi>Maid,</hi> ſeduced to
be a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and got with childe, by one <hi>Dueſbury,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<hi>Quaker,</hi> which was confeſſed by her ſelf, who alſo
affirmed, that <hi>Naylor</hi> did ſolicite her to lie with him; and
poſſibly this may bee it, for <hi>George</hi> doth not deny it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Text, nor Margin, nor doth hee ſay, <hi>it is a lie,</hi> as
hee doth page 6. in the behalf of <hi>Howgil,</hi> whoſe mouth
<hi>Martha Simons</hi> affirmed ſhee had ſtopped: <hi>It was a lie</hi>
(ſaith hee) <hi>for his mouth was never ſtopped by her, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
open to declare againſt her, and their deceit</hi> (that is,
<hi>James Naylor,</hi> and his company.) They were <hi>Deceivers</hi>
then, and the Matter of their deceit would be known.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not ſtay here, for my friend <hi>George</hi> hath,
page 24. ſomething further to ſay to mee: And I muſt
acknowledge, when I took a ſurvey of his <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and
following forces (for what is paſt, was (it ſeemes) but
his forlorn.) And having a deſire to gather up as much
as I could together, (to eaſe my ſelf and my Reader of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40606:24"/>
               <hi>impertinencies,</hi> and tautologies) I was confounded with
his diſorder. True, in his page 25. he begins with my Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
page, but in the very next page, he leaps to page 30.
31. And in the <hi>next,</hi> to 44. of my book; and then in his
page 28. to the 30 of mine, and 39. and then <hi>preſently</hi> to
the 30. again, and ſome ſeven lines after, back again to my
17. then to my 45. and within <hi>two</hi> pages after, to my <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
to the Reader, and inſtantly to page 48 of my book,
and ſhortly after to my title page <hi>again,</hi> and ſo runs (Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like)
skipping up and down, that it would <hi>tire</hi> any man
in the World to follow him, ſpeaking to the <hi>ſame</hi> things
in <hi>ſeveral</hi> places, as if hee did it on purpoſe to make <hi>work</hi>
for one that had nothing elſe to do, but to be ſo idle as to
follow him. And truly, if his skill in Martial affaires
were no better, to <hi>order</hi> and muſter his forces, hee is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to bee a Captain to lead <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkies,</hi> than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
creatures. And I am half jealous, that this was
done by him upon deſign, to take up ſo <hi>much</hi> of my time
and leiſure to follow him in his <hi>Serpentine</hi> motion, that I
might glut my reader with theſe litigations, that ſo hee
might have leſs ſtomach to what I have to ſay to <hi>George</hi>
in particular. And therefore, as to my Narrative and
relation, for the truth of it, I ſay thus much in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
That when <hi>hee</hi> hath ſaid, and <hi>I</hi> have ſaid, wee muſt
leave it to the judgement of thoſe who live here in this
City, to conclude of the truth of either: And I have ſaid
Only thus much further, I deſire it may be obſerved, that
in my Epiſtle to the Reader, I did profeſs I had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
all the letters, nor all the examinations and page 4.
I expreſly ſaid, I ſhould give in <hi>ſo many, &amp; ſo much of their
letters and papers, as was pertinent to their diſcovery, and no
more,</hi> as being unwilling to make my book ſwell too
much in bulk and price; ſo that if I have not inſerted <hi>all</hi>
that might have been, and <hi>George</hi> would have: I am not,
(I cannot) therein be found a <hi>liar,</hi> becauſe I have not
gone againſt my promiſe; for I did not propoſe, nor <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi>
an exact and full relation of all things concerning it,
as I have expreſt my ſelf. Sufficient it is to mee, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40606:24"/>
there is <hi>nothing</hi> therein contained, but what is <hi>truth,</hi> which
was that I promiſed, and have performed. And as to
the order of time (wherein things were acted) when I
came to a cloſe in that particular, I told my Reader, page
59. that I had not been <hi>exact,</hi> to obſerve the <hi>order</hi> or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
of time in every particular; for (as I there
ſay) <hi>I intended not an exact Diary,</hi> but had been careful
to give in the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> in truth, and reality, which (as in
Gods ſight) I was careful to obſerve and do: if any thing
therefore be <hi>ſhort</hi> or <hi>miſ-timed,</hi> it doth not follow that I am
a <hi>liar</hi> and deceiver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as hee (moſt uncharitably and
unchriſtianly) charges mee with; to all which I ſay,
the Lord rebuke him, and give him repentance for it; and
theſe two things being obſerved, will ſerve to anſwer <hi>much</hi>
of his cavils and <hi>reproachings</hi> of mee: But yet I muſt not
paſs over <hi>all</hi> ſo lightly, but I ſhall make anſwer to <hi>ſome</hi>
things, which I conceive of concernment, in <hi>ſpecial,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the reſt as not worth the troubling my ſelf, or the
Reader with; and in this I ſhall ſtudy <hi>brevity,</hi> and in
them obſerve, how <hi>ſhort</hi> this man comes of that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<hi>perfection</hi> which hee pretends to.</p>
            <p>And paſſing by his <hi>railing,</hi> and ſending mee to the <hi>lake,</hi>
to be tormented with the <hi>devil</hi> and his Angels (who hee
ſayes is my <hi>father</hi> and <hi>portion)</hi> I ſhall make a ſtand a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
at his charge againſt mee in his page 27. concerning the
Oath of <hi>Laurence Raymond:</hi> And herein I ſhall diſcover
the wretched nature and practiſe of this <hi>Quaker</hi> and his
fellow, I having heard that this <hi>Laurence Raymond</hi> had
heard that <hi>blaſphemous</hi> and unchriſtian expreſſion ſpoken
by <hi>Audlands</hi> Wife, <hi>That whoſoever did think to be ſaved
by that Jeſus Chriſt that died at Jeruſalem, ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;</hi>
and being aſſured from his own mouth of the
truth of the relation, I did ſome time after (that theſe
Wretches might be diſcovered) deſire the <hi>Magistrates</hi>
to ſend for this young man, and to take his <hi>teſtimony</hi> upon
oath, for greater ſatisfaction, as occaſion ſhould require,
which accordingly (at their own leiſure) they did, I not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſent, or ſpeaking <hi>any further</hi> with the young man
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40606:25"/>
in it. Now this teſtimony, my friend <hi>George</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate,
becauſe in my Narrative, the <hi>place</hi> (where the
words were affirmed and expreſſed by the young man in
his depoſition to be ſpoken) were left out, which to be
done upon <hi>deſign</hi> (as hee affirmed) I <hi>utterly</hi> deny, nor
can, or could there be any <hi>deſign</hi> in it, for any thing that
did appear to mee, for I doubted not, nor had <hi>heard</hi> any
thing, that might <hi>occaſion</hi> mee to doubt of the <hi>truth</hi> of
his oath, either in the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> (which was that I onely
look'd at) or the <hi>circumſtance,</hi> which was not by mee
much conſidered, which poſſibly made mee <hi>leſs</hi> wary, and
obſervant of the omiſſion in that, as of <hi>another</hi> paſſage,
and <hi>non-moment anous</hi> ſentence, in <hi>Foxes</hi> letter to <hi>Naylor;</hi>
of which <hi>George</hi> took notice, but it would not afford him
ground to <hi>cavil</hi> upon, as this it ſeems doth. And for the
Readers ſatisfaction here, I deſire him to know, that the
diſcourſive and declarative part of my <hi>Narrative,</hi> was
wholly written to him (who coppied them out again for
the Preſs) with mine <hi>own</hi> hand: But as for thoſe letters,
examinations, and other things, which I had in <hi>looſe</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
I only marked the place in my diſcourſe, where
they were to be <hi>inſerted,</hi> leaving it to him to inſcribe and
write them; and in <hi>haſty</hi> examination, I might (as it
ſeems I did) paſs over, and not take notice of an <hi>omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
eſpecially in a matter of <hi>circumſtance,</hi> which my
thoughts were not, as I ſaid, ſo much upon; as here the
<hi>main</hi> thing intended to be declared was, that ſuch words
<hi>were</hi> ſpoken by this <hi>Quaker:</hi> And as for the truth of the
oath in every particular, which this Caviller would ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
by this <hi>nicity,</hi> I did (upon the <hi>publication</hi> of his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,
and <hi>obſervation</hi> of this paſſage) repair to the young
man <hi>(Laurence Reymond)</hi> and there I diſcovered a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
piece of <hi>jugling,</hi> and wretched practiſe of theſe <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi>
for ſhewing to him what <hi>George</hi> had written, and
asking him what hee could ſay unto it, in that hee had
charged him as a <hi>liar,</hi> and forſworn. Hee made mee this
anſwer, that <hi>Holliſter</hi> had got him over into his ſhop, and
had been <hi>tampering</hi> with him, to intrap him, or draw him
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40606:25"/>
from his <hi>teſtimony,</hi> affirming it was falſe, uſing many
words to that purpoſe, till the young man was <hi>weary,</hi> and
left him; but then aſſerted and maintained the truth of
what is contained in his oath, <hi>in every particular,</hi> as hee
doth ſtill, inſomuch that <hi>Holliſter,</hi> ſeeing hee could not
prevail before hee left him, threatned him, that the <hi>plagues
of God</hi> would, or ſhould over-take him, as they had done
(as hee affirmed.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cowliſhaw,</hi> for taking a falſe oath, (as hee call'd it) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Quakers</hi> formerly, and this the young mans
Maſter (Mr. <hi>Stephens)</hi> told mee, the youth informed
him of, ſo ſoon as hee came from <hi>Holliſters.</hi> Now my
Reader muſt know, that Mr. <hi>Cowliſhaw</hi> (ſince his oath
taken as aforeſaid) is <hi>failed</hi> in his trade; and I wiſh it
may not bee the caſe of <hi>many</hi> an honeſt man beſides him.
And it's ſtrange it ſhould not, in ſuch times as theſe are
of <hi>dead</hi> trade in general. But mark the bold, daring, and
uncharitable <hi>preſumption</hi> of theſe wretched <hi>Quakers,</hi> who
ſtep up into the Judgement Seat of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and
aſſign the <hi>particular</hi> cauſes of his diſpenſation; as if thoſe
upon whom the Tower of <hi>Siloa</hi> fell, were greater ſinners
than others, becauſe of that hand of providence; or as if
his oath were falſe, becauſe of this accident. No, hee
<hi>ſtill</hi> owns the truth of his depoſition alſo. And divers <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
there are in this City, who can atteſt much to the
<hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it: But ſee the malicious ſpirit of theſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
and yet further, ſeeing they could not draw off this
young man from the <hi>truth</hi> of what hee had depoſed, nor
get any advantage (by tampering with him) againſt
<hi>mee</hi> (which was the thing intended; for <hi>Holliſter</hi> then
told him, hee had a hand in a book to that purpoſe:)
Now not being able to compaſs their <hi>ends</hi> upon him, <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>
by <hi>Holliſters inſtigation</hi> (I believe) (for I ſuppoſe the
young man is almoſt as much a ſtranger to <hi>Biſhop,</hi> as to
my ſelf, who never ſpake with him but twice, and that
upon this occaſion) <hi>Biſhop,</hi> I ſay, <hi>falls</hi> to reproach this
young man, and to <hi>ſtain</hi> his reputation, as one of <hi>evil</hi>
courſe, and bad converſation, from which hee would
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40606:26"/>
needs have us believe, <hi>Quakeriſme</hi> had reſtrained him;
and to which (ſince hee left quaking) hee affirms hee is
<hi>again</hi> returned, page 28. of his Pamphlet; How far the
young mans Father is concerned in this (a perſon of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,

revengeful, and <hi>lying</hi> ſpirit of theſe deluded, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
wretches; I do affirm, that both from his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
and Neighbours (perſons I am ſure of better credit
than <hi>Holliſter</hi> or <hi>Biſhop)</hi> I received a moſt ample and full
<hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the youths moſt ſober, piouſly conformable,
and good converſation; By which wee may ſee, what
ſpirit theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> are of, and how ready they are to
<hi>reproach</hi> all that are not <hi>with</hi> them; A Generation of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and Adders, that when they cannot reach the <hi>head,</hi>
will bee biting at the <hi>heels</hi> of thoſe who come near them,
and <hi>muſt</hi> vent their venome one way or other, ſo that
(notwithſtanding his cavillings) the young mans <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
ſtands good againſt him, that theſe blaſphemous
words were ſpoken, <hi>as is alledged;</hi> Nor muſt his denyals,
(no nor of many more) paſs for currant, or bear weight
againſt a poſitive affirmation, ſo <hi>ſolemnly</hi> confirmed: Nor
is blaſpheming <hi>language</hi> of the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſo ſtrange or rare,
as hee would make; for it is but the <hi>ſame,</hi> which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by one <hi>Simon Dring,</hi> another of them, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
which allegation <hi>Biſhop</hi> would alſo enervate, and
null, becauſe I do not name <hi>him</hi> to whom the words were
ſpoken; and from thence, ſayes it is <hi>of my own invention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>But now (for ſatisfaction) I let him know, it is one
that is not aſhamed to appear in the face of <hi>Captain Biſhop,</hi>
and it is Mr. <hi>Timothy Parker,</hi> whom, I ſuppoſe, he will
not deny to bee a perſon of credit, and who is ready to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

whereunto the <hi>Quaker</hi> replied, <hi>What can that blood bee
worth, which was ſhed ſo long ago.</hi> This (for ſubſtance)
will bee made good, both parties I know very well; and
this <hi>Quaker</hi> not one of the <hi>dull,</hi> ſimple, or ſottiſh <hi>ſort</hi> of
them (who know not the worſt of their own opinions)
but one of an <hi>ingenuous</hi> education, and of abilities more
than ordinary, in compariſon of the <hi>generality</hi> of them,
one acquainted with the <hi>myſteries</hi> of their own iniquity,
and <hi>blaſphemous</hi> Doctrine. And this not much unlike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
(but a <hi>Shee Quaker,</hi> yet not of the ſimpleſt rank)
who being confer'd with by one who had heard <hi>much</hi> of
their opinions, and asking her by whom ſhe hoped to bee
ſaved, ſhe anſwered, by Jeſus Chriſt: By what Jeſus Chriſt,
ſaid hee? By that Jeſus Chriſt that died at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaid
ſhee: What (replied hee) by that Jeſus Chriſt that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that is now in heaven? Yea, ſaid
ſhee: Whereat hee ſomething <hi>wondring,</hi> and yet ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
ſome <hi>equivocation,</hi> (or mental reſervation) Where,
ſaid hee, is that <hi>heaven?</hi> In <hi>mee,</hi> ſaid ſhee, and ſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the juggle.</p>
            <p>Now who (but one who knowes them throughly)
but would have been <hi>ſatisfied</hi> with her firſt anſwers? And
who would have thought it <hi>needful,</hi> to have carried on the
<hi>queſtion</hi> any further? And ſo in the former, any honeſt,
ſimple, well meaning heart (that is not acquainted with
their colluſions) would have been <hi>ſatisfied</hi> with the firſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40606:27"/>
anſwer: But you ſee how hard a matter it is for <hi>every</hi>
one to diſcover them, and how loth they are, that what
they hold ſhould bee <hi>fully</hi> known, leſt it ſhould (as it
deſerves) render them <hi>abhorred,</hi> by all honeſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
And hence alſo you ſee, how <hi>little</hi> they are to bee
believed in what they ſay, having reſerved meanings to
themſelves, and ſpeaking contrary to the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of thoſe
expreſſions, which are <hi>commonly</hi> uſed amongſt Chriſtians.
And now, as the reſt of his <hi>niblings</hi> at my Narrative, and
obſervations thereupon, I ſhall leave the truth to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the examinations <hi>themſelves,</hi> which hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
impeach; nor will his affirmations, negations, or
wreſtings, any way <hi>impair.</hi> And for matter of <hi>fact,</hi> in
the riſe, growth, and ſetling of theſe people among us, I
appeal to thoſe who were <hi>eare</hi> and <hi>eye-witneſſes</hi> of theſe
things.</p>
            <p>And for his <hi>atheological</hi> cavillings, and Scripture wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and miſapplyings, I refer to thoſe who are <hi>judicious</hi>
in ſuch matters, to conclude between us, onely there are
ſome <hi>few</hi> things, wherein I muſt obſerve unto my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the <hi>malicious</hi> and <hi>revengeful</hi> temper of this man in his
dealing with mee. I confeſs, neither the perſon of my
Opponent, or the <hi>things</hi> are (in themſelves) worthy of
the thoughts of any <hi>ſerious</hi> man; and I ſhould therefore
have paſt it over, but that I minde my <hi>ingagement</hi> and
promiſe, which is, to let the world ſee (in the inſtance of
my adverſary) that the <hi>converſion</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of a
<hi>Quaker,</hi> (if to bee eſtimated by this mans.) is very <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound,</hi>
imperfect, and rotten, notwithſtanding all their
outward <hi>ſhewes,</hi> and ſpecious pretences; any man (even
with half an eye, as the ſaying is) my eaſily diſcern,
(by the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of his language) that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
all along, and throughout his whole Pamphlet, is
to render mee (all the wayes hee can) <hi>obnoxious</hi> to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and the <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> of others that are above mee,
wherein (beſides his malice) his <hi>impotence</hi> is diſcerned,
in that being not able to <hi>revenge</hi> himſelf upon mee, hee
would bring mee within the reach of <hi>others,</hi> who might
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40606:27"/>
do it for him. And ſee how hee goes out of the wayes of
<hi>truth</hi> and <hi>honeſty</hi> to do it; (ſo revengeful is hee) yea,
out of the way of his <hi>own</hi> profeſſion (ſo impetuouſly is
hee <hi>hurried</hi> in his rage and paſſion; for but minde his
<hi>Courtſhip,</hi> giving flattering titles, and having <hi>reſpect to
perſons</hi> (as they call our due tenders of reverence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to our Superiours) in page 27. <hi>Juſtice</hi> Fell, <hi>a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
grave man, one of the Judges of the Nation, and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
of the Dutchy of Lancaſter:</hi> Well, what of all
this? Why ſayes <hi>George</hi> to mee, <hi>Art thou aſſured hee will
put up all this?</hi> Oh, ſayes hee, <hi>the inſtance is ſo foul and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and ſo fill'd with ſcoffs and jeers, that thy wickedneſſe
therein is hard to bee expreſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus hee there. Oh lamentable! Is it not pitty that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man (much more a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and if
you will, a Prieſt) ſhould commit ſo <hi>great</hi> a crime?
Surely it can be no leſs than betraying Mr. <hi>Love</hi> to death,
or ruining ſome <hi>great</hi> mans eſtate, by baſe practiſes, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,</hi>
bribery, or ſome ſuch thing? No, but 'tis as bad:
Why, what is it? Oh hearken, and wonder! In page
31. of my <hi>Narrative,</hi> I produc'd Judge <hi>Fells</hi> wife (as
one bearing witneſs in the behalf of <hi>James Naylor)</hi> and
(here's my <hi>ſin</hi> which hath rais'd all this out-cry) I ſaid,
<hi>ſuch diſcerning folks cannot eaſily bee miſtaken.</hi> Ah poor
impotent creature, how hath rage, and malice, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and envy <hi>beſotted</hi> him? Is not this man guilty of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
mens perſons in admiration for advantage, that hee
might have advantage againſt mee? Or doth hee mock
the <hi>Judge,</hi> in giving him theſe titles, ſo much contrary to
their quaking principle? The Lord help him to ſee the
<hi>baſeneſs</hi> of his Spirit. But yet, why doth hee add an, &amp;c. to
the criminous words quoted by himſelf? Why, ſurely,
to let the world ſee, that his <hi>malice</hi> out-bid and out-brib'd
his <hi>conſcience;</hi> for being convinced in himſelf that the
<hi>words</hi> quoted, would not bear ſo high a charge againſt
mee, as of a crime ſo <hi>great, the wickedneſs whereof can
hardly bee expreſt,</hi> hee would have it underſtood, that
the danger lay in the word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which if it do, 'tis none
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40606:28"/>
of <hi>mine.</hi> And let any one in the world read my book, and
ſay, whether they can finde any thing <hi>elſe</hi> in that whole
matter, to bee charged as an <hi>offence</hi> upon mee: And is
this ſuch an <hi>offence,</hi> ſo heinous, ſo grievous? to ſay iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically,
<hi>that ſuch diſcerning folk as Judge</hi> Fells <hi>wife, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eaſily bee miſtaken:</hi> What's this to the Judge? May
not a <hi>wiſe</hi> man, a <hi>good man,</hi> have a <hi>ſimple,</hi> a perverſe, or
a <hi>quaking</hi> wife, which is not in his power to remedy, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to <hi>reſtrain</hi> her from their <hi>aſſemblies;</hi> hee cannot
change her judgment: As for the Judge <hi>himſelf,</hi> I med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
not, I do not <hi>know</hi> him, I have not <hi>heard</hi> (to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance)
other than <hi>well</hi> of him: Well, the Lord
forgive my adverſary, and humble, and alter him: Sure
I am, this is far from that <hi>ſimplicity, charity, goodneſs,</hi> that
was, and is in Chriſt Jeſus. Hence <hi>ex ungue leonem,</hi> by
this paw of the Lion (or rather hoof of ſome more ſilly
creature) judge of the man; or if you will, you may
take him both wayes: A <hi>Lion,</hi> or a <hi>Bear,</hi> for his <hi>rage</hi> and
<hi>fierceneſs,</hi> and a more ſottiſh beaſt, for his <hi>ſillineſs.</hi> I
have diſcovered the venom of his teeth, in this the more
<hi>fully,</hi> to ſave my ſelf and thee (Reader) ſome <hi>labour,</hi> in
being as brief as poſſibly I may, in the following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
and the next is, his endeavour to <hi>traduce</hi> mee, with
traducing the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of our City. And whereas I
plead their <hi>excuſe,</hi> in that, by their <hi>lenity</hi> at firſt, (over
and above what other places in the Nation exerciſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
theſe croaking frogs) they gave them too much
<hi>incouragement</hi> to neſtle amongſt us, imputing this (as
juſt cauſe I had) to their too much <hi>fearfulneſs,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been formerly over-topt, and over-born, by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſwaying
power, by the <hi>uſurpation</hi> of inferiour Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
exerciſed upon them; and looking upon this as a
part of their weakneſs and <hi>infirmities,</hi> which (becauſe
of the common frailty incident to all men, even the beſt)
I did (as being in the body, and <hi>ſenſible</hi> of the ſame frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
Chriſtianly and ſoberly <hi>alleviate,</hi> (not juſtifie) how
does hee moſt <hi>Phariſaically</hi> and proudly fall, both upon
<hi>mee,</hi> and <hi>them</hi> in it? And becauſe I ſay (and ſay now)
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40606:28"/>
that the <hi>beſt Magiſtrates have their ſpots, defects, and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
hee concludes them to bee <hi>no Magiſtrates of God,
but men of ſin, evil doers, and the born of the devil,</hi> page 34.
But becauſe this (nor any thing in my Narrative) would
afford matter to <hi>incenſe</hi> them; hee runs abroad, licking
up the <hi>vomit</hi> of every malicious and venomous <hi>Spider,</hi> to
belch it out againſt mee; and this lyingly too, <hi>(more ſuo)</hi>
for hee ſayes, <hi>that I endeavoured in the Pulpit to render
them vile and odious;</hi> one while likening them to <hi>Jupiters</hi>
log<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to <hi>George on horſeback,</hi> and reproaching them
with the abilities of <hi>Tom Pain,</hi> which hee puts in great
letters, as if I had mentioned his name in the Pulpit. But
what a bold and daring wretch is this, to judge of my <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi>
and endeavours, as if they were to render the
Magiſtrates <hi>vile and odious?</hi> When being call'd to preach
unto them, upon a publike occaſion, for adminiſtration of
Juſtice: The Lord knows my heart, my endeavour was
to render them <hi>honourable and precious,</hi> by <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſſing them
to diſcharge their duty; and to that purpoſe, I told them,
that <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> ſhould not bee as <hi>Jupiters</hi> log, which by
lying ſtill, and doing <hi>nothing,</hi> made the frogs bold with it,
and to leap upon, and make <hi>ſport</hi> with; and that they
ſhould not bee as the picture of <hi>George on horſeback,</hi> with
his arm and ſword alwayes lifted up, but never ſmiting;
telling them further, that if the bare name, ornaments, and
accoutrements of a Magiſtrate were <hi>ſufficient,</hi> then that
poor creature (that was then walking up and down in
their preſence) might make a Magiſtrate; but I utterly
deny, that I <hi>likened</hi> or <hi>compared</hi> them with, or to either,
or <hi>named</hi> him. And of this, all thoſe who heard mee
with their right ear, muſt bear mee witneſs. But what
will not a malicious perſon do to <hi>revenge</hi> himſelf, though
hee do it never ſo impotently? But indeed <hi>(George)</hi> did
I deal ſo plainly with them, even the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and that
to their <hi>faces,</hi> and being their Chaplin too, and having
many large <hi>dinners</hi> and feaſtings from them, beſides my

I have <hi>fair words and adviſings from them?</hi> (all this in his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40606:29"/>
pages 37. 38.) Why ſure (friend) it ſeems the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
were ſo honeſt, that they did not chuſe a Chaplin
to <hi>flatter</hi> them, they had divers years experience of mee,
and my temper: And further, it's clear from hence, I am
no <hi>reſpecter of perſons,</hi> which I am ſure amongſt you is
accounted a <hi>vertue,</hi> and a high piece of your <hi>perfection,</hi>
though in a perverted ſenſe: And is it now a ſin (a vice

the end of his Pamphlet, page 103. and ſo onwards, hee
falls to the ſame malicious work <hi>again,</hi> charging mee
of abuſing that reverend <hi>Parliament,</hi> concerning which I
have ſpoken already, of which, and ſuch like, I deſire ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to ſpeak more onely this, Wee may well gueſs what
a <hi>pure</hi> convention it was, when ſuch <hi>pittiful</hi> fellowes, as
his fellow <hi>Hollister</hi> ſhould bee a principal member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>And wherein (as <hi>George</hi> phraſes it) page 45. he taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as much (yea more) of the power and glory of <hi>this</hi>
world (oh lamentable world!) than any in this City,
which hee ſayes, hee might <hi>ſtill</hi> have had, could hee bow
down and worſhip; bow down to whom, to him whoſe
noſe <hi>George</hi> would have held to the grinde-ſtone? Hee
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40606:29"/>
and his fellow <hi>Holliſter</hi> will not then, it ſeems, <hi>bow down,</hi>
nor worſhip, not ſo much as civilly; a ſtiff-necked and
ſtubborn generation: Thus wee may ſee, what it is, to
lift up the head of a <hi>dunghil</hi> brood, how <hi>highly</hi> they will
ſwell, and how hardly they will bee reduc'd again: And
truly I cannot here (upon this occaſion) but think, how
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>-like, <hi>Dennis Holliſter</hi> did ſtrut it, and
pride himſelf in his ayery Kingdome; and how hee did
ſcorn and deſpiſe all the oppoſite party in that Aſſembly:
Read his words, in a Pamphlet publiſh'd by him againſt
that Congregation (or Church) in this City, whereof
hee was once (till turn'd Quaker) the <hi>Leader;</hi>
               <note place="margin">And well may hee call them ſo, which I ſhall elſwhere diſcover.</note> the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of which Pamphlet is this, <hi>The Skirts of the Whore
diſcovered, and the mingled people in the midſt of her. In a
Letter ſent by</hi> Dennis Holliſter <hi>to the Independent baptized
people, who call themſelves a Church of Chriſt in</hi> Briſtol, <hi>but
are found to bee a Synagogue of Satan; together with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
letter written by him to</hi> Thomas Evens, <hi>a Teacher a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, who before ſeveral witneſſes hath often denied
himſelf to bee a Miniſter of the Goſpel.</hi> This, and more is
<hi>Dennis</hi> his title.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe him in his <hi>heights,</hi> and hear his <hi>language,</hi>
page 13. 14.<note place="margin">Such as were ſo high, as that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</note> 
               <hi>For my own part, I muſt deal plainly, and tell
you, the beholding and obſerving the unrighteous actings,
and deceitful hypocritical dealings of many of the eminent
members, and other high pretenders to Religion, whilſt I ſate
with them in Parliament, and other chief places of Councel
and truſt in the Nation</hi> (brave words) <hi>was one of the firſt
things that put mee upon conſideration what the root of that
profeſſion</hi> (of Anabaptiſme, I ſuppoſe hee means) <hi>ſhould
bee, from whence ſuch ſowre grapes, and fruits of bitterneſs
proceeded;</hi> and ſo on, telling them their own ſufficiently.
And then hee lets them know, <hi>that hee has known what it is
to bee accounted ſomething among thoſe called Churches, and
what the preferment of</hi> Pharoahs <hi>Court is,</hi> (wee know
whom hee means) <hi>and the great things of</hi> England; <hi>and
that hee had a nature prone enough</hi> (which wee all well
know) <hi>to imbrace the ſame,</hi> but that his <hi>peeviſhneſſe</hi> was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40606:30"/>
as great as his <hi>pride,</hi> which made him ſide with that <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
which acted by thoſe <hi>levelling</hi> principles I formerly
mentioned, which gave juſt occaſion to his <hi>Highneſs</hi> to
ding many of them down to the <hi>dunghil,</hi> from whence
thoſe vapours were exhaled, which yet hee in his pride,
(ſuch is his ſtomack) calls a <hi>ſuffering affliction with the
people of God,</hi> rather than to enjoy the pleaſures and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of <hi>England,</hi> which belike then were in their hands;
and if hee could have bowed down, hee ſuppoſed hee
might have <hi>ſtill</hi> enjoyed (and <hi>George</hi> thinks ſo too) even
for ever: For then (no doubt) the <hi>fifth Monarchy</hi>
would have been erected; but it ſeems they were not then
infallibly inſpired; for then they carried their <hi>Bibles</hi> to
their <hi>Parliament,</hi> there to ſeek out the pattern, but
there it ſeems it was not to bee found exactly; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now (throwing away their Bibles, and) being more
immediately guided by the Spirit (of bloud,<note place="margin">The Levellers ſtandard being now diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion)
they betake themſelves to their weapons, to
build and raiſe their Kingdome, which poſſibly may bee
the reaſon why ſo many <hi>Bricklayers</hi> and <hi>Carpenters</hi> (and
ſuch like perſons) turn <hi>Quakers,</hi> in hope of imployment,
it may bee of <hi>preferment;</hi> and why not, as well as <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinello,</hi>
a poor Fiſher-boy in <hi>Naples,</hi> or <hi>John of Leyden,</hi> a
Taylor in <hi>Germany,</hi> who made themſelves <hi>Regents,</hi> by
the aſſiſtance of the rude rabble, the one upon <hi>civil,</hi> the
other upon <hi>religious</hi> pretences? But (to meddle no more
with this Parliament) in the next place (malice making
him very induſtrious) hee renders mee obnoxious to the
<hi>Protector,</hi> and his Councell, which needs no long anſwer.
For whereas I had ſaid nothing againſt them, hee would
make mee criminous by way of <hi>inference</hi> and inſinuation,
and the like, concerning <hi>Major General Desborow,</hi> (to
whom, for advantage, hee will afford a title of honour)
whom hee ſayes I <hi>intimated</hi> to have been eaſily and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievouſly
inſtrumental to wicked, ungodly, and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
practiſes; 'tis wonder hee did not directly charge
mee: But let any man read what I have therein written,
and ſay, wherein have I <hi>abuſed</hi> him. And thus much I
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40606:30"/>
ſay, (as to that) as I hope the <hi>Major General,</hi> and others in
power, did not by their lenity <hi>intend</hi> to countenance ſuch
practiſes before: So now (ſeeing what their lenity may
produce) they will not bee ſo <hi>eaſie</hi> to bee intreated for the
future, which was that (and all) I aimed at; and the
like envious dealing hath hee in the matter of <hi>Colonel
Scroop,</hi> and there hee charges mee with <hi>flattering</hi> him:
So that let mee ſpeak how I will, I muſt (it ſeems) bee
concluded an <hi>offender.</hi> But (hee alledges) I had ſpoken
againſt him, why, what of this? Becauſe I deal plainly
with a man when I finde hee doth <hi>ill,</hi> may I not therefore
<hi>commend</hi> him when hee doth <hi>well?</hi> Is not this an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ingenuity? I hope hee will pardon mee this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
And truly, had I not apprehended him <hi>really</hi> to
have diſclaimed theſe <hi>Quakers,</hi> (as I <hi>then</hi> believed hee
did) I ſhould not have made that <hi>honourable</hi> mention of
him.</p>
            <p>And I confeſſe, had hee been ſtill here in power over
us, I might well have been thought, in ſo doing, to have
<hi>flatter'd</hi> him; but it is well known, when hee was here, I
did it not, and leſſe reaſon to do it <hi>now,</hi> in that he is <hi>abſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt here obſerve what <hi>George</hi> ſayes concerning
him, which very much tends to the <hi>justifying</hi> of my Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
concerning the riſe, growth, and ſetling of the
<hi>Quakers</hi> among us, by the over-topping, and over-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Magiſtrates, and making them <hi>Cyphers,</hi> by a
forraign power, ſo that they could <hi>not</hi> reform things,
though they had a will to it; for page 106. <hi>George,</hi> ſayes
hee <hi>(Col. Scroop)</hi> was ſo far from denying the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
to ſpeak publikely, that hee ſaid to <hi>Dennis Holliſter,</hi>
by name, that <hi>if the Magiſtrates did put them in
priſon one day, hee would put them out the next,</hi> which no
doubt <hi>Dennis</hi> acquainted them with, for their incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which very likely made them ſo <hi>bold</hi> and daring,
and to out-face (as they did) the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and not
to care for their commands to depart the City: How will
revenge and malice blinde a man to tell all, which hee had
better forborn? As for the remainder <hi>(ejuſdem farinae)</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:40606:31"/>
which follows, it is a further diſcovery of the ſame <hi>ſpirit</hi>
which I ſhall paſſe over, intending (as the Lord ſhall give
time and opportunity) to give a full and <hi>diſtinct</hi> anſwer
to the particular of <hi>Thomas Evens;</hi> for as for <hi>Morgan
Lloyd,</hi> whoſe doctrine he ſayes I had <hi>reproached,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, hee ſayes, hee ſent mee a ſober note, to
reaſon with mee publikely in my <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> (as hee
calls it) which I refuſed. To that, I ſay, it's not ſo, I
did not <hi>reproach</hi> his doctrine, for I knew not what it was,
nor heard it; that I took offence at (and juſtly) was,
that any man ſhould <hi>intrude,</hi> and thruſt himſelf, yea,
force himſelf into <hi>my</hi> Pulpit, upon a day, and at a time,
which was not aſſigned for <hi>Publike Lecture,</hi> whereas
himſelf, and <hi>Erbury,</hi> had not long before made a kinde of
a publike conteſt, to the diſturbance and <hi>unſetling</hi> of the
people in another Congregation; <hi>Erbury</hi> at that time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſufficiently known to bee tainted with <hi>unſound</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and <hi>Lloyd</hi> himſelf much diſliked. And truly (to
ſpeak my minde in this matter) if <hi>Morgan Lloyds</hi> note
had been, or were to that purpoſe, I ſuppoſe, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
that in theſe <hi>brawling</hi> and heretical times, ſhall enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
motions for <hi>publike</hi> conteſts, with ſuch as run up and
down, and make it their <hi>buſineſſe</hi> to wrangle, and contend
in things <hi>doubtful</hi> and uncertain, ſhall not provide for his
own <hi>peace,</hi> nor the peoples <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> in the truth, by
giving <hi>them</hi> entertainment. If the <hi>doctrines</hi> wee teach
were unſound, or our ſelves not able to diſcharge our <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
it would bee a favour for ſome to come and help us,
when <hi>orderly,</hi> and peaceably ſent, or called; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
for men of <hi>unquiet</hi> and rambling ſpirits, to <hi>impoſe</hi>
themſelves upon us, is neither Chriſtian nor <hi>civil:</hi> And I
conceive, thoſe who are careful to preſerve the people
from <hi>infection,</hi> do not well to encourage (much leſſe to
invite) them.</p>
            <p>Nor are the people competent <hi>Judges</hi> in doubtful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and are (as I ſaid before) much ſwayed by the
<hi>impudence</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> of a bold and daring Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:40606:31"/>
I have now but two or three things more to ſpeak to,
and ſo I ſhall come to deal, by way of <hi>charge,</hi> upon my
Adverſary, wherein I ſhall have ſo much matter, as
that I muſt of neceſſity avoid all debates, and altercati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with him, in matter of <hi>doctrine,</hi> and this upon a
double account:</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe their doctrines, judgement, and way of
arguing, are <hi>ſufficiently</hi> known, and anſwered already,
and I am not willing to draw the ſame Saw of contention
<hi>everlaſtingly,</hi> not caring for the laſt word in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, leſt by taking up too much time in
thoſe things, of which the reader may be elſe-where <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſatisfied, (as in Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>blegs</hi> moſt ſober
and Chriſtian anſwer, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ford,</hi> and others)
I bee prevented of what I <hi>principally</hi> intended, which is
to diſcover the <hi>hypocriſie</hi> and unſoundneſſe of a <hi>Quakers</hi>
converſion, and to exemplifie it, in this man in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
which you ſee I have in <hi>part</hi> performed, by diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his railing, lying, and <hi>malicious</hi> dealing, in which
trade hee ſtill continues; and therefore, page 47. hee
charges mee, that I would have joyned my ſelf as a
member of <hi>Hollisters</hi> Congregation, but finding by <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi>
with him, that there was no place for my <hi>imperious,</hi>
proud, and <hi>pragmatical Maſterſhip</hi> over them, they heard
no more of mee in that particular, till the ſtate of things
were <hi>changed,</hi> and then I became an adverſary to <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Churches,</hi> and to that in <hi>Briſtol</hi> eſpecially; this is the
<hi>full</hi> of the charge. This ſtory I aſſure my ſelf hee had
from <hi>Dennis:</hi> But how doth hee know that <hi>Dennis</hi> ſayes
truth? To this, I oppoſe this true relation, when <hi>Thomas
Evens</hi> came firſt to this City, (I deſiring to know him ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
had a purpoſe to invite him to my houſe to dinner,
and underſtanding that hee would bee at the houſe of
<hi>Robert Purnil</hi> in an evening, went thither, where I met
him, and moſt (I think) of that Congregation, at an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of <hi>Religion,</hi> where I continued, Mr. <hi>Evens</hi> being
the man that then exerciſed, wherein ſomething being
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40606:32"/>
delivered <hi>unſound</hi> and erronious, I forbore (for divers
reaſons) to ſpeak to it, till moſt of the company were
diſmiſſed, when (conceiving it convenient) I told
him of that erronious doctrine which hee had delivered,
and ſpake fully to it; to which Mr. <hi>Evens</hi> making nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>anſwer</hi> nor <hi>excuſe.</hi> Mr. <hi>Purnil</hi> (for now I am not
ſpeaking to, or of <hi>Quakers)</hi> and therefore let me uſe our
ordinary and civil language) with many good words
approved of what I ſaid, and ſpake ſomething in excuſe
of Mr. <hi>Evens.</hi> Whereupon, <hi>Moon</hi> (being preſent) with
much affection uſed theſe words, <hi>Why ſhould not</hi> Maſter
Farmer <hi>bee one of our Congregation?</hi> (for I had never
met them formerly) which was ſeconded thus by Miſtreſs
<hi>Nethway:</hi> Aye, Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> if you would bee one of
our Congregation, you may bee choſen <hi>Paſtor</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
which words (the very thoughts of the matter
being ſtrange to mee) I do profeſſe, made mee wonder?
which produc'd this reply from mee, Choſen Paſtor Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
<hi>Nethway!</hi> What mean you? To which (after
ſome other words) ſhee ſaid, ſhee was told, that if I
might bee choſen <hi>Paſtor,</hi> I would joyn with them, which
I <hi>denying,</hi> and ſhee affirming again that ſhee was told ſo,
but would not tell mee by whom (but 'tis eaſily ſuppoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able)
I then preſently appealed to Mr. <hi>Purnill,</hi> then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
to witneſs for mee to the contrary, to whom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
(in diſcourſe) I had declared <hi>ſeveral</hi> times, that I
could not <hi>joyn</hi> with them, which hee at that time witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
and this to bee a truth, I appeal to that <hi>light</hi> and
truth of <hi>God</hi> that ſhines in his and their conſciences, and
which I hope they will not dare to ſtifle, (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that diſtance which is now between us.) And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
why I would not <hi>joyn</hi> with them, were, becauſe they
performed their <hi>Lords</hi> day duties in <hi>private houſes,</hi> to the
prejudice of the <hi>publike,</hi> (which I ever honoured (as I
ſhall declare in another diſcourſe, Chriſt aſſiſting mee.)
And for that they had no <hi>lawfully</hi> conſtituted Paſtor to
take the charge of them: True it is, I ſhould likely have
joyned with them, had thoſe <hi>two</hi> hinderances been remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40606:32"/>
And to this purpoſe I did divers times ſolicite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>N. I.</hi> a <hi>rightly</hi> conſtituted and able Preacher, to take
the <hi>charge</hi> of them, promiſing my ſelf to ſit down as a
<hi>private</hi> member, only exerciſing my <hi>publike</hi> Miniſtery, by
way of preaching, which hee refuſed; and this I doubt
not hee will teſtifie.</p>
            <p>And further, to make it appear, that I <hi>deſired</hi> not to bee
their <hi>Paſtor,</hi> being conſcious to my ſelf of the weight of
that work, and my <hi>unfitneſs</hi> in divers reſpects, I did (in
an occaſional diſcourſe with ſome of them) declare my
<hi>unfitneſs,</hi> which is ſo <hi>true,</hi> that one of them (now a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker)</hi>
did ſince (by way of reproach) upbraid mee with
my <hi>own</hi> acknowledgment, ſo that then I had no intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of joyning with them; and ſince that, I gaining fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
light, in matter of <hi>Churches,</hi> and their appendant
queſtions, and they drawing more and more towards
<hi>Anabaptiſme,</hi> I more and more declined, and <hi>diſowned</hi>
them.</p>
            <p>And whereas hee ſayes, <hi>I became an adverſary to ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Churches, when the ſtate of things were changed:</hi> I
ask, to what were the times changed? or <hi>from</hi> what?
Not from that way of ſeparated Churches, but more to
it: If I did it then, then I did it not to ſerve the <hi>times,</hi> but
to ſecure my <hi>conſcience.</hi> But wherein did I? or did I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
appear an enemy to ſeparated Churches? Why doth
hee not ſhew <hi>wherein?</hi> But of this, more in another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>And ſo much in anſwer to that ly of <hi>George,</hi> and his
Maſter <hi>Dennis:</hi> Another there is of the ſame <hi>Forge,</hi> I am
ſure; and that hee ſpeaks to page 59. 60. And again
(being chafed with the buſineſs of the Lord <hi>Craven)</hi>
page 109. where hee joynes them both together: The
charge is this, from both places, That I earneſtly <hi>ſolicited</hi>
ſome then in power, for turning out of <hi>Nicholas,</hi> one of
my brethren, <hi>Conſtant Jeſſop,</hi> by name, for his differing in
judgement in ſome particulars, urging as an argument for
this purpoſe, that <hi>till then the City would not bee in quiet,</hi>
into whoſe place (by <hi>diligent ſeeking)</hi> I did climbe, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40606:33"/>
domineered ever ſince over his people, and him, <hi>as the iſſue
of that proſecution;</hi> and that I <hi>forced</hi> my ſelf upon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to this day, by procuring an order from <hi>above;</hi> and
that thereby I got my ſelf out of <hi>poor Thomas, into rich Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this whole ſtory is a moſt wilful miſtake (as its
grounded upon what I urge, page 49. of my Narrative)
and in this I appeal to his light within; for that perſon
(and thing) which hee cannot but know I meant, was
this, that <hi>Holliſter</hi> and his company (then domineering)
threatened the Magiſtrates, and the reſt of the Committee
(who were not of their <hi>faction)</hi> that if they might not
have him whom they ſent for out of <hi>Wales</hi> to bee their
Teacher, one of no breeding, and that hath ſince often
denied himſelf to bee a Miniſter, (and is now turned <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſt)</hi>
to bee one of the <hi>publick Lecturers</hi> in the City,
they would turn out of the City a godly and <hi>Orthodox
Miniſter,</hi> who had been impriſoned, and ſuffered much
more than any of them, (for his good affection to the
Parliament) hee differing that time in judgement in
ſome particulars, and ſo they had their end, which (as
is well known) hath proved a <hi>reproach</hi> and ſcandal to
this City, from many <hi>ſtrangers</hi> that come hither, and take
notice of it.</p>
            <p>Now this perſon (hee knowes very well) was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Paul,</hi> for as for Mr. <hi>Jeſſop,</hi> hee was never committed
to priſon upon my occaſion: Is this man now a true
Convert? Is hee not a manifeſt <hi>prevaricator?</hi> And did
hee it not on purpoſe to bring in that <hi>ly,</hi> and malicious
ſlander of his fellow <hi>Hollister?</hi> Whom to bee a lyar, a
piece lately publiſhed by thoſe who were his fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
(with his Teacher aforeſaid) doth <hi>amply</hi> teſtifie;<note place="margin">The Church of Chriſt in Briſtol recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her vail.</note>
and which I my ſelf alſo have had ſufficient experience of
oftentimes, inſomuch that I deſired one, a Miniſter of this
City (who was then wont ſometimes to viſit him) to
tell him from mee, <hi>that his ſhop was a forge of lies:</hi> And
for the matter of Mr. <hi>Jeſſop,</hi> I ſhall give a true and <hi>full</hi>
account of it (ſo far as concernes my ſelf) thereby to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40606:33"/>
               <hi>diſcover</hi> theſe lyars to the world. It's well known (up
on the death of the late King) what <hi>endeavours</hi> there
were by the then <hi>Parliament,</hi> for ſetling the Nation in
<hi>peace:</hi> In order whereunto, there was an <hi>engagement</hi>
drawn up, and required to bee <hi>ſubſcribed</hi> by all perſons:
And it is <hi>as well</hi> known in this City, how oppoſite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Jeſſop,</hi> aforeſaid, (together with that other Brother)
was thereunto; and what <hi>expreſſions,</hi> concerning that
matter, were uſed by them, both in <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
I need not mention: By which means there was much
<hi>averſeneſſe</hi> in many of this City to this <hi>ſettlement,</hi> they
being honeſt men, and having a great <hi>influence</hi> upon the
people: At this, I (thirſting for a ſetled peace) was
<hi>much</hi> offended, and did endeavour, with themſelves, <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately</hi>
to take off their <hi>oppoſition,</hi> and <hi>publikely</hi> to ſettle
the people, declaring my diſlike of their doings. With
this, and the like expreſſions: that if they (the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers)
did apprehend thoſe <hi>actions</hi> of State (whereby they
endeavoured a ſettlement) as <hi>evil,</hi> they ſhould go up to
<hi>Weſtminster,</hi> and declare it to thoſe who had the <hi>power,</hi>
and not trouble the <hi>people</hi> with thoſe things, which they
had no <hi>ability</hi> to amend, or <hi>power</hi> to withſtand; and for
that their doings would but raiſe an <hi>impotent</hi> diſguſt and
oppoſition, with the <hi>publike</hi> prejudice; further, telling
them of an evil which I had <hi>formerly</hi> obſerved, and was
now by them <hi>practiſed,</hi> that men would preach <hi>Court</hi>
Sermons in the City, and <hi>City</hi> Sermons at Court, which
I conceive an <hi>unprofitable</hi> kinde of preaching, when our
Sermons are not <hi>ſuited</hi> to the capacity and condition of
our <hi>Auditors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, as to the <hi>matter</hi> alſo, I alwayes conceived
it, (and do ſtill) as ſavouring too much of the <hi>beyond-ſea</hi>
temper, for <hi>Miniſters</hi> to meddle with State matters:
Of which ſee a large diſcourſe, entituled, <hi>A Caſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
concerning Miniſters, medling with State matters;
in, or out of their Sermons, reſolved more ſatisfactorily than
heretofore,</hi> which was then written by Mr. <hi>John Dury,</hi>
one of the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of Divines, a man of a peaceable
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40606:34"/>
and <hi>publike</hi> ſpirit, and one with whom Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> and
Biſhop <hi>Davenant,</hi> had ſeveral endeavours formerly, for
ſetling peace in the <hi>Churches;</hi> which book was licens'd
by Mr. <hi>Joſeph Carril<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> containing about twenty five ſheets
of paper; ſold at the <hi>Star</hi> in <hi>Corn-hill,</hi> 1650.</p>
            <p>But to go on, they ſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> perſiſt in their way, during
which time, Mr. <hi>Craddock</hi> coming to this City, and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as I was informed) at <hi>Holliſters,</hi> I went thither,
(which I ſeldome uſed to do) to deſire Mr. <hi>Craddock</hi> to
preach for mee at <hi>Thomas;</hi> but hee not being then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and <hi>ſtaying</hi> for him, <hi>Holliſter,</hi> and myſelf, talking of
the times, and ſeveral matters, and (among others) of
their <hi>oppoſitions</hi> in publike, I did then ſay, it was not <hi>fit</hi>
to bee ſuffered, ſo to <hi>hinder</hi> a ſettlement, and to <hi>alienate</hi>
mens affections; and this was all, and this (as you ſee)
but <hi>occaſional:</hi> And before that <hi>ſpecial</hi> occaſion was given
by Mr. <hi>Jeſſop</hi> himſelf, for his removal, in a <hi>Sermon</hi> which
hee preached afterwards, upon which, and for which,
hee was <hi>outed;</hi> and of which, I knew not, nor had any
hand in, <hi>one</hi> way, or <hi>other,</hi> either by writing, ſpeaking,
or ſuggeſtion to any perſon <hi>what ſoever:</hi> Nor did I ever
ſpeak with <hi>Holliſter</hi> at any time, after that <hi>occaſional</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
aforeſaid, concerning it; and what I did ſpeak,
having reſpect to that other Brother, as well as Mr. <hi>Ieſſop;</hi>
which <hi>outing</hi> and <hi>baniſhing</hi> from the City, was ſo far
from <hi>my</hi> expectation, and ſeemed to mee ſo <hi>rigorous,</hi>
that I <hi>publikely</hi> taxed and declared againſt their hard
dealing, as is (I doubt not) well known to divers that
heard mee, the notes whereof I have ſtill by mee; ſo
that my <hi>declaring</hi> againſt their rigorous and harſh proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
raiſed the <hi>ſpleen</hi> of that froward adverſary <hi>Holli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
againſt my ſelf, and procured that <hi>ſcandal</hi> upon me;
I confeſs I then thought it fit they ſhould bee <hi>ſilenc'd</hi> from
<hi>oppoſing</hi> Authority, and <hi>hindring</hi> (as much as in them
lay) the ſettlement of the <hi>peace</hi> of the Nation; (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this City is no inconſiderable parcel) but baniſhment
from it, was <hi>far</hi> from my thoughts.</p>
            <p>And whereas my Adverſary alledges, that I urged as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40606:34"/>
an argument to this purpoſe, <hi>that till then, the City would
not bee in quiet:</hi> If hee ſay that I uſed theſe words to
<hi>Holliſter,</hi> (for I never ſpake with any other, nor him,
other than as aforeſaid) it is very falſe: But this I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
ſome of theſe words were ſpoken by mee,
to, and miſtaken, (to ſay no more) by Mr. <hi>Ieſſop</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
upon this occaſion. A few daies before the time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
for his departure, I met him upon the <hi>Tolzey,</hi> and
ſuppoſing that much of <hi>Holliſters</hi> heat againſt him, was
for his zealous aſſerting of <hi>Presbyterial</hi> diſcipline, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to <hi>Independency,</hi> (of which hee had treated much
in his Lectures) I endeavoured to perſwade him to an
<hi>accommodation</hi> and compliance, (as not thinking the
quarrel worth ſo much contention) and offering my ſelf
to <hi>mediate</hi> between them; (as being indifferent in that
matter) but M. <hi>Ieſſop</hi> ſtiffly perſiſting in his way, (and
knowing <hi>Holliſters</hi> temper, who was then in his heights)
I told Mr. <hi>Ieſſop,</hi> that then there was no <hi>quietneſs</hi> to bee
look'd for among us, which words, how they have been
<hi>miſapplied</hi> by ſome, let it bee conſidered by them who are
concerned.</p>
            <p>And for Mr. <hi>Ieſſop,</hi> I deſire him to <hi>remember,</hi> that hee
and I parted not in diſcontent each with other, which no
rational man will conceive could bee, if I had ſpoken
thoſe words in ſuch a manner as I am charged. And Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Ieſſop</hi> may further remember, (if hee pleaſe) that I
went to Mr. <hi>Youngs</hi> to ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Ingelo,</hi> (who was
there at a marriage that morning) to procure him to
<hi>mediate</hi> the matter, in behalf of Mr. <hi>Ieſſop,</hi> for his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
but Mr. <hi>Ingelo</hi> was (a little before) gone his
journey towards <hi>London,</hi> ſo that my intention was fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
and (as I perceived afterward) would have been
ſo, notwithſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I after underſtood, the quarrel
was <hi>old,</hi> and inveterate againſt him in <hi>ſpecial,</hi> as appeared
by their <hi>violent</hi> proſecution. For whereas his ſentence
was, to depart <hi>ten miles</hi> off the City, they followed him,
with their rage, as far as <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> thirty ſeven miles
diſtant, hindering <hi>there</hi> his entertainment; which deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40606:35"/>
of theirs ſo far provok'd my <hi>ſpirit,</hi> (in his behalf) as
that I drew their <hi>odium</hi> upon my ſelf, as aforeſaid. And
whereas it's further charg'd, that I did promote the <hi>outing</hi>
him, to <hi>in</hi> my ſelf into <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and that I forc'd my ſelf
upon them, and that I <hi>procured</hi> an order, &amp;c. this is ſo
falſe, that there is not the leaſt <hi>ſhadow</hi> of truth in it, more
than this, that I am now <hi>in.</hi> But it's well known (and
will bee acknowledged) that above half a year (and
more) after Mr. <hi>Ieſſop</hi> was gone, and the Church lay
<hi>void;</hi> and notwithſtanding I was divers times deſired by
ſome of the Pariſhioners to preach the <hi>Tueſday</hi> Lecture,
and <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> Lecture,<note place="margin">And it was neer a year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee was gone, e're I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted it.</note> or either; I <hi>refuſed</hi> it, and did
endeavour to ſettle my ſelf at the <hi>Colledge,</hi> (as being
loath to take a Paſtoral charge) which thing by the help
of Mr. <hi>Aldworth,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hodges,</hi> (and other friends of
mine in the then Parliament) I did <hi>effect</hi> and compaſs,
and had 150. pound <hi>per annum, ſetled</hi> upon mee by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and which is ſince ſtill paid to him who doth there
<hi>officiate;</hi> and one Sermon I preached in <hi>order</hi> to it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>chief</hi> of the Pariſh of <hi>Nicholas</hi> (perceiving I
would remove from <hi>Thomas)</hi> the occaſion I will not
mention, becauſe I am not willing to offend any: They
calling a <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſtry,</hi> ſent the <hi>principal</hi> of them unto mee, to
deſire mee to come to them, which I (acknowledging
their love and reſpect) <hi>refuſed;</hi> but they ſtill urging me,
I took time to conſider, and about a week after they came
unto mee again accordingly, and obtained their deſire;
and afterwards they drew a <hi>Petition,</hi> ſubſcribed by them,
and <hi>many</hi> of the Pariſhioners, intending to preſent it to
the <hi>Committee</hi> here, for my eſtabliſhment; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that this Committee here, had no power to do
it, they ſent up to the <hi>Committee above,</hi> and effected it;
and ſince I am (in a ſort) inforc'd to it, I ſhall declare
the two principal reaſons of my acceptation: The one
was, I was perſwaded by them, (and many other of my
friends) that in regard <hi>moſt</hi> of the inhabitants neer and
about the <hi>Colledge,</hi> were perſons of another judgement
than my ſelf, in <hi>civil</hi> matters, I ſhould have little <hi>converſe</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:40606:35"/>
or comfort among them, but rather the <hi>contrary;</hi> nay,
ſome did ſuggeſt to mee, that my ſettlement there, was
procured by ſome who bore mee no <hi>good will,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to make mee weary, and ſo to leave the City; but
that I ſatisfied them, the matter was of my <hi>own</hi> ſeeking,
and endeavour; and the other reaſon was, that going
ſo <hi>far</hi> out of the City, I ſhould not have any opportunity
of any <hi>Church communion,</hi> and Chriſtian fellowſhip,
with any conſiderable number, of which I was <hi>convinc'd</hi>
to bee a duty, although I was then unwilling to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
the burthen of a <hi>Paſtor.</hi> And indeed, conſidering
that ſome honeſt-hearted Chriſtians in <hi>Thomas</hi> Pariſh
(with whom I had there communion) did ſtill deſire it;
and hoping that divers of <hi>Nicholas,</hi> (having formerly
been exerciſed in it) I ſhould finde them more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
<hi>complying,</hi> than thoſe who had been a long time
ſtrangers to it, I did the more willingly imbrace it; but
as for the advantage, in removing from <hi>poor Thomas,</hi> to
<hi>rich Nicholas,</hi> (as the Calumniator phraſes it) let him,
and the world know, that upon theſe grounds I removed
from the <hi>rich Colledge,</hi> to <hi>poor Nicholas;</hi> nor was it the
poverty of <hi>Thomas</hi> (though poor enough) that made
mee leave them; nor was it (or could it bee) filthy
<hi>lucre,</hi> or ſordid <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> that drew mee to <hi>Nicholas,</hi>
which could by no reaſonable man bee imagined, would
amount to what was ſetled upon mee at the <hi>Colledge.</hi> And
ſince I muſt boaſt, (but 'tis to ſecure the credit of my
Miniſtery, that it ſuffer not damage in any thing, I will
do it a little further. (having good witneſs of the truth
on't) After I had conſented to come to <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and
came to give them a meeting at their <hi>Vestry;</hi> although I
knew, that with much <hi>difficulty</hi> they raiſed, what ſome of
them had ingaged unto by <hi>bond,</hi> to M. <hi>Jeſſop,</hi> and which,
as I have heard, was not above eighty pound <hi>per annum;</hi>
yet when they ask'd mee, <hi>what would content mee for my
labour,</hi> ſo far was I from ſeeking my ſelf, as that I told
them, <hi>I would not make a bargain for preaching the Goſpel,
but that I would do my duty, and leave them to do theirs;</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:40606:36"/>
and how richly it hath been performed by them, (I ſpeak
not of all) I am <hi>aſham'd</hi> to mention: Sure, not beyond
<hi>poor Thomas,</hi> nor ſo much (by two parts in three) which
M. <hi>Jeſſop</hi> now reaps, as I am informed; and which place
was ſetled upon <hi>him,</hi> upon my commendations of him
to M. <hi>Strong,</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and which M. <hi>Strong</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to let him know, had hee not been prevented by
death, <hi>heu premature,</hi> if hee hath not done it formerly:
But much good may it do <hi>him,</hi> and much good may he
do <hi>them:</hi> I envy no mans gain or preferment; nor will the
inhabitants of <hi>Nicholas</hi> ſay, I contend with them in <hi>that</hi>
matter, although I have cauſe enough to take notice of
their neglect (yea, and ſin) in this particular. For I
dare ſay, there are few handy-crafts men that work upon
ſo ſmall incouragement; for, I ſuppoſe, their calling
feeds their family.</p>
            <p>I have been the large in this matter, becauſe ſome
perſons are, and have been as willing to <hi>take up,</hi> and
ſpread this ly and calumny, as others have been to <hi>raiſe,</hi>
and make it: And truth it is, I ſhould hardly have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to anſwer his <hi>railing Pamphlet,</hi> but to ſatisfie
the world in theſe two laſt particulars, and to wipe off
the aſperſion of baſe <hi>forgery,</hi> which my ſoul abhors;
and to make good what I promiſed, concerning the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of this <hi>Quaker,</hi> to which I'le haſten with all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>As for his charging of ſeveral Trades upon mee, it is
but the lickings up of the <hi>excrements</hi> of <hi>William Erburies</hi>
black pudding,<note place="margin">A book ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, written by <hi>W. Erbury,</hi> wherein hee would prove mee to bee a black pudding: In which fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Pamphlet, moſt (if not all) of theſe things are.</note> whereby, I ſee, <hi>George</hi> was very hungry,
and wanted <hi>matter</hi> to <hi>feed</hi> upon, being, it ſeems, troubled
with that diſeaſe, which Phyſitians call, <hi>Caninus appetitus,</hi>
The dog-like appetite, which makes them huge <hi>greedy,</hi>
and to catch at any thing; but I wiſh his <hi>after-meſs</hi> may
do him more good, than the <hi>Pudding it ſelf</hi> did <hi>Erbury:</hi>
For a few daies after hee had publiſh'd it, he went home,
and died; whether hee died for <hi>ſhame,</hi> or what it was, I
know not, nor dare I ſay this was the cauſe, or occaſion
of it; no, God forbid, I ſhould preſume to meddle with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40606:36"/>
the <hi>ſecrets</hi> of the Almighty, or to <hi>judge</hi> any man: But
I mention this, becauſe a hare-brain'd fellow came (as
himſelf ſaid) to revenge <hi>Erburies</hi> death upon me, which
I no wayes promoted; but probably this poor fellow
might take up the thoughts, upon what hee might hear
ſome ſober perſons ſpeak of it: But bee it what it will,
<hi>George,</hi> it ſeems, having <hi>ſwallowed</hi> it, muſt vomit it up
again the ſecond time, that the world may ſee his foul
<hi>ſtomack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, ſee how the vapours of it (whilſt there) had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
his <hi>brain,</hi> and be fool'd his <hi>intellectuals?</hi> Did ever
any man in the world underſtand, being a member of an
<hi>Independent</hi> Church, or of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church, to bee
a <hi>trade?</hi> And it is a <hi>trade,</hi> when a man in the former
troubles ingages, <hi>for a time,</hi> in ſome publike ſervice, (as
moſt active ſpirits did) and then lay it aſide: <hi>Is this a
trade?</hi> How many trades has <hi>George</hi> had then? And for
a man living in the Country (as I did) to practiſe Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
(being thereunto lawfully licens'd by the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> upon tryal, and examination) I ſay,
for a man ſo living in the country, (and having a houſe
fitted for ſuch a purpoſe, no other convenient houſe being
there to bee had for a pleaſant dwelling) Is it a <hi>trade,</hi> if
a man make malt there for a time? Doth not many a
<hi>Gentleman,</hi> many a <hi>Miniſter</hi> do ſo? And did I not (ſo
ſoon as I could get there a more pleaſant dwelling) give
it over? And being a <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> do men call that <hi>a trade?</hi>
Or is it a trade (being ſo) to apply ones ſelf to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
experiments of <hi>Chimiſtry,</hi> in order to the ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
himſelf to deal in his profeſſion, with more <hi>ſecurity</hi>
and underſtanding? (without which, Phyſitians are no
better than Empericks) Or is it a <hi>trade,</hi> if a man living in
<hi>London,</hi> (as a Phyſitian) the Earle of <hi>Berkshire</hi> keep an
Office in his houſe, for that which is not a Monopoly,
but a <hi>priviledge</hi> granted to him by the Law of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and no man forced (nor attempted to bee forced) to
it; no, nor <hi>intended</hi> to bee forced, which I know, and
write for the honour of that Noble and ingenious <hi>Earle,</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:40606:37"/>
under whom I had no imployment in it, bee having his
<hi>Clerks,</hi> and Regiſters, and other Agents under him? And
for the other things mentioned, <hi>Are they trades?</hi> Are
they mechanical? Are any bound <hi>Apprentices</hi> to them?
Are they handicrafts men? Are they not callings and
imployments for perſons of <hi>liberal,</hi> and (in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure)
<hi>learned</hi> educations? The meaneſt of them, (I mean,
in reſpect of abilities) is that of Chamberlain; and of
my deſire to it, I may poſſibly elſe-where give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
in another diſcourſe, upon another occaſion, (if
God permit) and yet that is not a <hi>trade</hi> neither, but, as
hee himſelf calls it, an <hi>Office,</hi> and not unworthy of an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious</hi>
perſon; ſo that none of all theſe are trades, nor
were they, nor are they any calling, the <hi>honourable</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> excepted: Of my call and entrance
whereunto, I ſhall (I hope by Gods bleſſing) give a
ſatisfying account to the world: And as for the other,
which I only own as my calling, (in reference to my firſt
imployments) I look not on them as <hi>ſeveral</hi> callings,
having all relation to <hi>one</hi> and the ſame office; namely,
the <hi>Chancery;</hi> in the laſt whereof, <hi>viz.</hi> one of the Clerks
of the <hi>Chappel of the Rolls,</hi> (if the Lord had not deſign'd
mee to another, and <hi>better</hi> imployment, and driven mee
thence by a long and <hi>conſuming</hi> ſickneſs, which drove me
into the country, and ſet mee upon the ſtudy of Phyſick)
I had aboad, and continued: But both in that, and the
former, which hee termes a <hi>Subſcriber</hi> in the Six Clerks
Office; (which is a notorious lye) for though there be
<hi>Subſcribers</hi> there, yet I was <hi>never</hi> one of them, (having
never been any mans ſervant) I ſay, in both thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
I kept my Clerks <hi>under</hi> mee, being liberal imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherein men of the <hi>beſt rank</hi> in their countryes,
(ſome of them <hi>Eſquires,</hi> and Juſtices of the Peace) had
a ſtation.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>firſt,</hi> which I reckon as the meaneſt,
which hee lyingly and reproachfully calls a <hi>Ticket-maker,</hi>
in the <hi>Subpen:</hi> Office, (there being no ſuch diſtinct im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
there) but that <hi>George</hi> had a <hi>ſpiteful</hi> and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40606:37"/>
ſtomack; I was not then and there ſo <hi>inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
a perſon, but that a Gentleman of the <hi>Six Clerks</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
who knew mee well, and who had but <hi>one onely
daughter,</hi> and heir to a hundred marks <hi>per annum,</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
beſtowed her in <hi>marriage</hi> upon mee; and that not
by <hi>ſtealth,</hi> or unwillingly, but upon <hi>writings</hi> between us,
with whom wee liv'd afterward in houſe together, till he
<hi>died,</hi> and then made mee <hi>Executor</hi> of his Eſtate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal.</p>
            <p>But here wee may ſee, how <hi>malice will multiply;</hi> and
that <hi>Georges</hi> meaſure of <hi>Perfection</hi> (both in wit and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty)
is very ſmall: Nor doth all this any whit take
off the <hi>exception</hi> againſt <hi>mechanical</hi> undertakers, who
from either <hi>Coblers Stalls,</hi> or <hi>Taylors Shop-boards,</hi> ſtep up
into the Pulpit, without any juſt <hi>call,</hi> or <hi>competent</hi> abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
(either <hi>natural,</hi> or acquired) but a good memory,
whereby they can only <hi>deliver,</hi> what they have from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens <hi>Sermons,</hi> not being able to <hi>maintain</hi> what they
ſay, more than another well inſtructed and <hi>ordinary</hi>
Chriſtian may do, which yet is not ſufficient for a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;</hi>
and ſhould ſuch a <hi>Miniſtery</hi> bee countenanced, (to

next Generation;</hi> which no ſober and underſtanding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
but will have reſpect unto, and which, no doubt, the
<hi>Jeſuites</hi> look at; and therefore have no little influence in
upholding <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>unletter'd</hi> perſons among us. But
now after all this lying ſtory of ſo many <hi>trades,</hi> I'le tell
one ſtory (but a ſhort one) which this occaſioned. One
telling a <hi>Gentleman</hi> (a Juſtice of Peace) who hath known
mee long, and my manner of living, of this paſſage of
<hi>Georges,</hi> charging ſo many <hi>imployments</hi> upon mee, in
ſuch a ridiculous way; (by numbring them up) Yea,
but ſayes the Gentleman, <hi>Can Captain</hi> Biſhop <hi>ſay that
Mr.</hi> Farmer <hi>had plaid the knave in any of them all?</hi> And
hee knowes <hi>George</hi> almoſt as well as I do. And now (as
in my Narrative, page 37. 38.) And hee in his Throne
of lies, page 95. 96.) behold the impoſture, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor,
<hi>George Biſhop</hi> (whoſe name I am loath to fully
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40606:38"/>
my ink and pen with) but I muſt crave leave to do it:
Him whom they call <hi>Captain Biſhop.</hi> This man (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the former letter of defiance againſt <hi>Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor)</hi>
is charg'd by mee with complying with <hi>Naylor,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hee writ a letter in his behalf to ſome in the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and thereupon I charge him with colluſion and
jugling. And how doth hee diſcharge it? why truly,
(like himſelf) doing the ſame thing again, by faining,
foiſting, and packing (at which hee is non-parel) I hope
hee hath not his fellow in <hi>England:</hi> And thus hee doth it,
hee <hi>feignes</hi> (upon information, as hee pretends, but who
informed him, hee doth not tell us, whether his own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
or any other) that the <hi>Mayor,</hi> Aldermen, &amp;c. had
prepared a <hi>Petition,</hi> intended to bee preſented to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
concerning <hi>Naylor;</hi> (which is true) <hi>wherein we</hi>
(ſaith hee) <hi>who in ſcorn by the world are called</hi> Quakers,
<hi>are highly charged and accuſed:</hi> If hee mean himſelf and
<hi>Fox,</hi> it is a lie; for they are ſo far from being <hi>highly</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and accuſed, as that they are not therein charged, or
accuſed <hi>at all:</hi> And hee deſires his friend (if hee bee
free) to move, that the <hi>accuſers,</hi> and the <hi>accuſed,</hi> may
bee heard face to face, leſt the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould condemn
the accuſed unheard, upon the bare accuſation of their
Adverſaries: And then hee ſayes, what a ſad thing that
will bee, if they ſhould <hi>ſlay</hi> the innocent, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
And this is the effect of the Letter.</p>
            <p>Now, who are they that are accuſed? None but <hi>James
Naylor,</hi> and his Crew; not any of his (wee) <hi>Fox,</hi> &amp;c.
unleſs they will thruſt in themſelves againſt our minde

carrying two faces under one hood, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?
What a <hi>Monſter</hi> would this man appear to bee, if
one ſhould but open the carkaſs of this baſe Petition, and
let the world know the truth of things, as wee in this
City know it? The generalitie of the <hi>godly, faithful to the
cauſe of God,</hi> the <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> people of the Nation,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40606:41"/>
amongſt whom the Petitioners, and their friends, bore no
<hi>ſmall ſhare.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>Epithites</hi> of himſelf, and the
Petitioners; now I will not name them, becauſe peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſome of them are, or may bee honeſt hereafter.</p>
            <p>But Country-men, and fellow Citizens, you know
them all: And ſay, Would not you think the worſe of
your ſelves a good while after, if you ſhould bee found in
the company of many of them: I ſpeak to you of my
Countrymen, who are not <hi>Athieſts, Ranters, Church, and
Ordinance-forſakers,</hi> and haters, drunkards, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters,
Sots, and Scoundrels: To you I ſpeak, would
you not bluſh to bee found among ſuch <hi>Saints?</hi> Oh how
<hi>eaſie</hi> it is to become a <hi>Saint?</hi> 'Tis but petitioning for
<hi>George Biſhop</hi> to bee a Parliament-man, and then a <hi>Saint</hi>
preſently; and then <hi>Quakers</hi> (as many of them now
are.) All theſe <hi>Saints</hi> came together, to the buſineſs of ſo
great weight and concernment, as the Election of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes</hi>
to ſit in Parliament, for the carrying on, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
&amp;c. So the Petitioners, and <hi>one</hi> of the men to do it,
and that theſe <hi>Saints</hi> had nominated (which was only in
their purpoſe) not ſo much as nominated in the place of
chuſing, leſt they ſhould have been laught out of it: And
as in their Petition (as they ſay choſen) which is a manifeſt
falſhood, was this St. <hi>George;</hi> Oh high arrogance, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency!
I want words: What a frontleſs man was
this, to have ſuch a conceit of <hi>himſelf?</hi> And how ſottiſh
and ſimple were theſe fellow-Saints, as once to <hi>think,</hi> that
the Inhabitants of this <hi>City</hi> had ſo far forfeited their <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
and would ſo far forfeit their <hi>Charter,</hi> as to chuſe ſuch
a one for ſuch a work? As ſure as can bee, had wee cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
him, my <hi>Lord Protector</hi> would have appointed a
<hi>Guardian</hi> over the City, as a company of <hi>Lunaticks</hi> and
mad men.</p>
            <p>And ſee the <hi>unworthineſs</hi> of this fellow, and the <hi>baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of his ſpirit: In their Petition they go on, (and you
muſt ſuppoſe them to be in a meek, humble poſture, with
very meek and <hi>gentle</hi> hearts towards <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs)
your Petitioners bowels being even preſſed down with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40606:42"/>
grief, know not where (as to men) to eaſe their hearts,</hi>
(poor wretches) <hi>but in pouring forth their groans and
ſighes into his Highneſs boſome, whom they had owned, &amp;c.</hi>
for the <hi>true intereſt</hi> of the Commonwealth, but now
would hold his noſe to the grinde-ſtone, as going about
to promote a <hi>falſe intereſt. George,</hi> your Countrymen
know you well enough. But yet for all this, ſee how
ſweetly wee expreſs our ſelves (not as hypocrites, who
diſſemble and flatter) and go on: <hi>If it ſhall pleaſe God</hi>
(good hearts) <hi>to ſtir up the bowels</hi> (his Highneſs) <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you, to bee affected with theſe proceedings,</hi> (in putting
by <hi>George</hi> from being a Parliament-man) <hi>and your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners
condition, which indeed concernes your own being,</hi>
(yea, and it ſhould appear ſo, had hee and his complices
power in their hands) <hi>for their enemies (i.e. Georges,</hi> and
the Petitioners) <hi>are yours, and ſo you will finde it, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
ſhould ever give an opportunity.</hi> But you <hi>George,</hi>
(who I doubt not had the great hand in drawing this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition)
you are a moſt <hi>ſpecial</hi> and loving friend to his
<hi>Highneſs:</hi> Fie <hi>George,</hi> fie, wilt thou not bluſh when thou
ſhalt think of thy fellow-Citizens reading this Petition,
who know thee ſo well? I would not have taken this
pains, but to let the world ſee, what <hi>Saints</hi> you <hi>Quakers</hi>
are, being mindful of my title page, and promiſe.</p>
            <p>And now to go on, and ſee how <hi>George</hi> can free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the matter of the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> which, ſayes hee,
(page 98.) <hi>I ſeem occaſionally to bring in, but chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
thereby to aſperſe his name, and wound his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
in that I ſay (page 37. of my Narrative) <hi>that hee
was the great Agent in breaking and tearing the Lord</hi> Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<hi>eſtate in pieces.</hi> Why <hi>George?</hi> What is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
Is it an aſperſing of your name, and a <hi>wounding</hi> of
your reputation, to ſay, that you were the great Agent
in breaking and tearing the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> eſtate in pieces?
Doth it <hi>touch?</hi> Are you ſore thereabouts? (Ah guilt,
guilt! This worm of conſcience.) But ſtand, ſtand I ſay,
I muſt touch you, and handle you there a little more?
Poſſibly I may bee inſtrumental for your good, to open
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40606:42"/>
the <hi>ulcer,</hi> and let out the <hi>corruption,</hi> which lying there in
thy conſcience, and impoſtumating, might deſtroy of a
ſudden. Come, ſtand, better <hi>now</hi> than hereafter: Oh!
how ſhould I rejoyce, that I might bee inſtrumental to
help him to a ſight of his ſin, and ſo to true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</p>
            <p>To proceed, the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> eſtate is broken in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that cannot bee denied; but, ſayes <hi>George,</hi> it was
confiſcated by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> and the act was not
his, but <hi>theirs:</hi> And how can that act bee charged upon
<hi>mee,</hi> who had not to do in the <hi>paſſing</hi> thereof? Well, I
ſhall ſhew you <hi>how</hi> by and by: But in the mean time, let
mee ask you <hi>George,</hi> Is it not <hi>poſſible,</hi> that a Parliament
(upon miſ-information) may do that which in its ſelf is
unjuſt, and <hi>they</hi> not ſo in doing it? I pray God deliver
this Nation from the <hi>guilt</hi> of unjuſt actions, both in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and manner. Suppoſe you, (or ſuch a one as you)
having accidental diſcourſe with another, about a <hi>third</hi>
perſon, and hee you diſcourſe with, ſhould let fall <hi>ſome
words</hi> concerning that third perſon, which you at the
preſent take no notice of, (or at leaſt) <hi>ſeem</hi> not ſo to
do, which yet you do; (for otherwiſe you cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
them unto another) and thoſe words you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to another; upon, and concerning which <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
and <hi>words,</hi> you confer between your ſelves; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
they might bring ſome advantage to <hi>ſome
body,</hi> (being well improved, and handſomely manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
having power in your hands) and ſo being <hi>order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
you ſpeak with your firſt man again, and form up
his <hi>accidental</hi> diſcourſe, which hee judged not worth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing (as to the prejudice of that <hi>third</hi> perſon, to
injure whom, hee was not bribed or corrupted, nor bore
any malice towards) you <hi>draw</hi> up, I ſay, that diſcourſe
into an <hi>information</hi> of a crime, by handſome contrivance,
reduce it into an oath, with your <hi>own hand,</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
form a <hi>charge</hi> againſt the <hi>third</hi> perſon, to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
both of his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance;</hi> and this <hi>charge</hi> you
preſent to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and they take cognizance of it,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40606:43"/>
and order it to bee <hi>inquired</hi> into, and examination to bee
had upon it; and you (having the tranſacting of the
whole buſineſs) ſo mannage it, as that (it may bee) it
appears to them (by that which is before them) hee is
<hi>guilty,</hi> and ſo adjudge him: Are they <hi>guilty</hi> who ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
him, although (poſſibly) hee may <hi>not</hi> bee guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
No, ſurely, the guilt lies on <hi>thoſe</hi> who <hi>miſ-repreſent</hi>
him unto them: You well know friend, that Judges
proceed not in Judgement upon their <hi>own</hi> knowledge,
they act <hi>(ſecundum allegata &amp; probata)</hi> as things are
proved unto them. And how many perſons and eſtates
have been ruined upon baſe, and wicked, and <hi>deſigned</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations,
is too well known to the world? And
whereas you ask mee, whether I have not been a Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
for Sequeſtrations in <hi>London,</hi> in the time of, and by
authority of <hi>Parliament.</hi> I anſwer, yes; and yet I can
charge <hi>you</hi> for tearing and breaking in pieces mens eſtates;
and do you, if you can, (or any man elſe) charge <hi>mee</hi>
for doing the like, and I'le make them reſtitution, whom
I have ſo injured, if any ſuch there bee, as ſure I am there
is not.</p>
            <p>I'le tell you <hi>George,</hi> my buſineſs there, was not to bee
an <hi>Informer</hi> againſt any man, neither did I ſo; nor was
it to poſſeſs my ſelf of any mans eſtate (either goods or
money) the Committee had both their <hi>Collectors</hi> and
<hi>Treaſurers</hi> to that purpoſe, I have ſate there many a
ſcore of times <hi>Chair-man</hi> in that Committee. As alſo
the <hi>Lord Steel,</hi> now the Lord Chancelour of <hi>Ireland)</hi>
hath done the like; this hundreds (and many in this
City) know: I was not their <hi>underling,</hi> or <hi>Clerk,</hi> (as you
were) to ſit bare to your <hi>Maſters,</hi> they had ſeveral
Clerks (better, and honeſter than you) and under-Clerks,
to that purpoſe; no <hi>(George)</hi> my buſineſs was,
to ſee <hi>right</hi> done between the Parliament, and thoſe who
were their enemies, not to <hi>make</hi> them enemies, who
were not, but to ſee juſtice done on thoſe who <hi>were,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>information</hi> brought in unto them; and this
is the rejoycing of my heart at this moment, <hi>even the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40606:43"/>
of my conſcience,</hi> that I was alwayes fearful of
<hi>making</hi> thoſe offenders, who were not; and if I <hi>inclined</hi>
to any ſide, it was to the ſide of <hi>mercy.</hi> And I appeal
to the <hi>God</hi> that ſearcheth hearts, that this honeſt and
old principle <hi>(do as thou wouldſt bee done by)</hi> ſate and
wrought upon my ſpirit, when <hi>informations</hi> was brought
before us: And I have often had this thought upon my
ſoul, when mens <hi>whole eſtates</hi> have lain in queſtion, and
even bleeding before us; <hi>what would I have done, if this
mans caſe had been mine own, or mine had been his:</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
I have had a reſpect unto them, ſo far as the
buſineſs wherewith (upon oath) I was intruſted, would
bear and permit mee; and this not of fear, or favour, nor
for <hi>gifts,</hi> or bribes, either before or after: I did not think
all that might bee gotten, either to my ſelf, or the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
might bee well gotten; I did alwayes reckon,
that <hi>injuſtice</hi> and oppreſſion, was the way to bring <hi>guilt</hi>
and <hi>judgement</hi> upon the Parliament and Nation, and to
make all their endeavours fruſtrate, and to turn it into
a curſe: And I doubt, ſuch as you, are not a <hi>little</hi> guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of being <hi>Jeroboams</hi> companions, who made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to
ſin grievouſly, and this by falſe and perverted informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and that ſuch things were not <hi>unuſual:</hi> And how
much <hi>Judges</hi> may bee abuſed by baſe practiſes, if thoſe
who act <hi>under</hi> them deal not righteouſly: I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in ſeveral particulars, that came within my <hi>own</hi>
knowledge, whilſt I was in that Committee, wherein
had I readily complied with the commands of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
and obeyed their orders, which had been ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly
procured (by wicked ſuggeſtions of thoſe, who
ſought their own advantages, and not the Nations wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare)
many innocent perſons had been ruined: This to be
a truth, I could (I ſay) make appear by <hi>ſeveral</hi> inſtances
undeniable, but that I am loath to charge my diſcourſe
with any thing that is <hi>forreign,</hi> and that might make it
unneceſſarily tedious. And as for my ſelf, (in reſpect
of any gain that I reaped by that imployment) let mee
tell you <hi>George,</hi> I did not make that my aim, I bleſſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40606:44"/>
my <hi>God</hi> for it; nor can I (or any man elſe) ſay, that
I have made any addition to my eſtate by it, either in
land or money; for what I earned, I expended in <hi>their</hi>
ſervice; and this will appear to the world, when my
<hi>God</hi> ſhall take mee hence, of whom it will (or may) be
ſaid, as once was ſpoken of one I well knew, (who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in an imployment, by which many others grew rich)
<hi>Hee was an honeſt man, for hee died poor:</hi> This I ſpeak, in
reſpect of any <hi>addition</hi> to my eſtate, ſince that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
No <hi>George,</hi> I have neither <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or <hi>Deans</hi> and
<hi>Chapters Lands,</hi> nor <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Queens,</hi> or Delinquents
<hi>lands:</hi> And as for moneys, I am beholding to my friends
to provide for my wife and children, ſo little have I been
graſping after the world, whatever elſe may bee mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
otherwiſe; and whether you <hi>George</hi> can ſay
this, doth <hi>appear</hi> to the world by your <hi>manner</hi> of living,
(without your trade) which you would not do before,
and by what will bee declared afterward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore
to go on, Whereas you charge mee page 100. with light
ſcoffing, and ſlanderous ſtuff<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that by <hi>dark</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the buſineſs of <hi>Faulconer,</hi> of ſet purpoſe to
wound your reputation, and to reproach the truth which
you witneſs.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now therefore (to do you right) ſpeak no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<hi>darkly,</hi> and by way of intimation, but <hi>expreſly,</hi>
plainly, in words at length, and not in figures, by which
I ſuppoſe every one that <hi>runs</hi> may read what a <hi>Saint</hi> you

thereunto, neither fearing the face of any man, nor

hee.</p>
            <p>Here is you ſee (Reader) a bold, high, daring, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>appeal</hi> of his <hi>innocency,</hi> in the matter of the Lord
<hi>Craven,</hi> and of his <hi>honeſty</hi> and uprightneſs in all other
particulars, in the time of his <hi>publike ingagements.</hi> Now,
what if it ſhall appear, (notwithſtanding all this) that
hee <hi>(George Biſhop)</hi> who made this dreadful proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
did not only <hi>know</hi> of indirect proceedings in <hi>that</hi>
matter, but that hee alſo was one (a chief one) that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them, and that (as to this matter) <hi>Faulconer,</hi> who
died in priſon for perjury, was (in compariſon of him)
an honeſt and innocent perſon: If I ſay all this ſhall
appear, will you <hi>believe,</hi> that hee doth <hi>believe</hi> there is a
<hi>God,</hi> that ſearcheth hearts, and tryes reines, and brings
every work to judgement? Or can you bee perſwaded,
that hee rightly entertains that Article of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
though hee ſeems to do ſo.</p>
            <p>And before I give you an account of what I have to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40606:45"/>
deliver unto you, that you may know the <hi>daring</hi> ſpirit
of this man, and how <hi>little</hi> reſpect and reverence there is
in him of the <hi>Almighty;</hi> and that it is an eaſie and
light thing with him, to make <hi>ſuch appeals</hi> to God as this
is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let mee minde you of the</hi> like <hi>in that his Pamphlet,
which I think few men in the world (beſides himſelf)
would</hi> offer, <hi>and by</hi> that <hi>judge of</hi> this. <hi>Whereas in my</hi>
Narrative, <hi>I charge him and</hi> Holliſter, <hi>and</hi> other of their
relations and adherents, <hi>that they joyn'd themſelves to the
wretched</hi> Quakers <hi>upon</hi> faction, humour, and diſcontent.
<hi>In page 44. hee makes this</hi> appeal <hi>and proteſtation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Another of <hi>Georges</hi> prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations.</note> I do
here, for clearing of my conſcience, and the ſatisfaction of
all the ſober-minded, to whom this may come, and for the
ſtopping of thine and all ſlanderous mouths, in the dread and
preſence of the living and eternal God, who is Judge of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth, before whoſe Judgement-Seat, thou, and wee
muſt all appear, that every one may receive the things done
in his body, according to that hee hath done, good or bad. In
my own, and the name of thoſe ſervants of the Lord whom
thou reproacheſt, declare and affirm, that neither faction,
diſcontent, diſaffected humour, pride, affected-ſingularity,
(which are all of them thy ſlanders) nor any other thing,
was the cauſe of our joyning unto them. <hi>But having many
of us, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo goes on, ſpeaking of waiting in the uſe of
outward means, &amp;c. how <hi>God</hi> had now viſited them, by
the Miniſtery of theſe men, and how hee had reach'd
by his Eternal Power <hi>to that of himſelf in them,</hi> and ſo
they became joyned to the Lord, and to the <hi>immortal
word, &amp;c.</hi> And ſeeing him who is inviſible, &amp;c. they
hunger no more, nor thirſt, nor wonder, as heretofore,
&amp;c. ſpeaking <hi>highly</hi> of their high attainments, as if they
were now <hi>perfect,</hi> ſo that neither faction, humour,
pride, &amp;c. nor <hi>any other thing,</hi> but the mighty and <hi>pure
work of God,</hi> was the ground of their becoming <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi>
ſo ſayes <hi>George.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now if hee were to bee cleared by <hi>Compurgators,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40606:45"/>
(viz.)</hi> ſuch as ſhould upon their <hi>conſciences</hi> affirm, that
what hee here ſayes, they are perſwaded is true, he would
finde very <hi>few</hi> (if any beſides <hi>Quakers)</hi> that would dare
to do it.</p>
            <p>For ſuppoſe hee might bee believed for <hi>himſelf,</hi> who,
or what man in the world (that truly fears God, and
knows what it is to make appeals to his moſt glorious
Majeſty, and with what righteouſneſs and judgement it
ought to bee performed) would, or can dare to make
ſuch a proteſtation <hi>in the behalf, and in the name of others,</hi>
as hee here doth? If hee had ſaid, hee had <hi>believed,</hi> or
been <hi>perſwaded,</hi> or the like, that <hi>they</hi> did it not upon
ſuch grounds, or motives, but upon a pure account,
(which is impoſſible in this buſineſs) it had been <hi>tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
but thus expreſly, fully, unlimitly, <hi>as fully for them</hi>
(whoſe hearts hee cannot know) <hi>as for himſelf,</hi> to call
the living and <hi>eternal God</hi> to witneſs in this manner, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
him to be one of a <hi>preſumptuous ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for a further diſcovery of his Atheiſtical impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in this kinde, do but read the report and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thoſe who were <hi>familiarly</hi> acquainted with
<hi>Holliſter,</hi> for whom this daring man doth thus proteſt,
hee being by mee charged in ſpecial for turning <hi>Quaker</hi>
upon <hi>faction and diſcontent,</hi> before ever I ſaw their book,
which was but lately publiſhed; it is a book publiſhed
by, and in the name of that Church (as they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
whereof hee was a member, or rather <hi>Master,</hi>
till hee fell away to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and <hi>drew away</hi> from
them (as they ſay in their Epiſtle to the Reader) eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or nineteen <hi>with him;</hi> in the tenth and eleventh page
of which book, they ſay, they did obſerve in what <hi>height
of diſcontent</hi> hee came home, (from that thing call'd a
Parliament) and continued in <hi>that poſture</hi> (viz. of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content)
till a new Religion came (which was the
<hi>Quakers)</hi> which (ſay they) <hi>preſently,</hi> within few daies
or weeks, hee imbraced.</p>
            <p>So that I can (nor I think will any conſidering man)
look upon him no otherwiſe than as one of thoſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40606:46"/>
               <hi>Knights of the Poſt,</hi> (as they call them) who will ſay
or <hi>ſwear any thing;</hi> and this to let you ſee the ſpirit of the
man.</p>
            <p>And now to proceed, hee profeſſes, and (as you
ſee) boldly proteſts his <hi>innocency</hi> in the matter of the
<hi>Lord Craven,</hi> and <hi>Faulconer;</hi> nor hath hee uſed, nor
doth hee <hi>know</hi> of any indirect proceeding in that <hi>whole</hi>
buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Now that my Reader (who is a ſtranger in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
may go along with mee with underſtanding; I
ſhall (as briefly as I can) lay the whole buſineſs before
him: The <hi>Lord Craven</hi> (having been for many years
(long before the troubles in <hi>England)</hi> reſident in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and imployed in their ſervice) having a command
under the <hi>Prince of Orange;</hi> the Scots King going to
<hi>Breda,</hi> the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> came thither in attendance upon
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> during the Scotch Kings reſidence
at <hi>Breda,</hi> divers officers (ſouldiers) formerly in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the King his Father (being in great diſtreſs, and
like to periſh) drew up a <hi>Petition</hi> for relief of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities:
Now <hi>Faulconer</hi> aforeſaid, having been a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
(a Major) in the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſervice, and being
(as upon his death-bed hee confeſt) in a poor deſperate
condition, and going over to <hi>Breda,</hi> (as a Spy) ſtrikes in
with theſe <hi>Cavileers</hi> as one of them, and was intreated
by them to draw the aforeſaid <hi>Petition,</hi> which hee did;
in drawing whereof, <hi>Faulconer</hi> moved, that they might
Petition the <hi>Scotch King,</hi> that they might bee entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him to fight againſt the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
by the name of <hi>barbarous and inhumane Rebels;</hi> but thoſe
<hi>honeſt</hi> Cavaleers anſwered, that they were <hi>ſouldiers of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi>
and it was <hi>uncivil</hi> language, and they would not
have it in; and ſo the Petition (being drawn up by
<hi>Faulconer,</hi> according to their minde) was delivered to
the <hi>Scotch King,</hi> who, it ſeems, promiſed to conſider
them.</p>
            <p>About three weeks after, the <hi>Scotch King</hi> (being to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from <hi>Breda</hi> next morning, theſe Cavaleers)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40606:46"/>
anſwerable relief, (according to the former Petition,
and the Kings promiſe) they drew up <hi>another</hi> ſhort Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
to put him in minde of his <hi>promiſe;</hi> and meeting
the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> there, (who they knew to bee a friend
to ſouldiers) they entreat him to further that their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hee knowing nothing of the former; nor did it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> promoted this ſecond Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which if hee had, there was not any thing offenſive:
but the Scotch King went away next morning, without
giving any relief to the Petitioners, as Captain <hi>Briſco,</hi>
one of them ſweats, at <hi>Faulconers</hi> tryal, inſomuch that
<hi>Faulconer</hi> (being diſcontented that hee got no moneys)
ſaid, (as hee was going into the Town) <hi>This is a horrid
thing, that wee ſhould bee in this caſe, to follow a thing, they
call a King, Goddam me, I will go into England, and do
all the miſchief I can,</hi> as Col. <hi>Drury</hi> (another of the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners)
informed, at <hi>Faulconers</hi> tryal: of which afterward.</p>
            <p>Now that you may better know what a manner of
perſon this <hi>Faulconer</hi> was, and how fit for any deſperate
undertaking; it was at his tryal ſworn againſt him, that
hee <hi>drunk a health upon his knees to the devil,</hi> in the open
ſtreets at <hi>Petersfield;</hi> and that then hee uſed theſe words,
<hi>I have ſpent my brothers eſtate, and my own, I will never
want money, for whilſt there is any in the Nation, I will
get one way or other, and I will doe ſomething
of infamy to bee talkt of, that the name of</hi> Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner
<hi>ſhall never die.</hi> One <hi>James Greham</hi> ſwore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, that after the ſiege of <hi>Exeter,</hi> in a Cellar, there
hee the ſaid <hi>Faulconer</hi> put into <hi>Grehams</hi> hand a two and
twenty ſhillings piece of gold, ſwearing, <hi>Dam him blood
and wounds, hee would bugger his ſoul to hell.</hi> Another
ſwore, that <hi>dam him, and ſink him</hi> were his uſual expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
One <hi>Bradley</hi> teſtified, that hee heard <hi>Faulconer</hi> ſay,
<hi>our Saviour Chriſt was a baſtard,</hi> and a Carpenters ſon,
and carried a basket of tools after his Father: Mr <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Dyer</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> (being produced as a witneſs) did
declare, that <hi>Faulconer</hi> confeſt to him, that hee had ten
pound of a man, by procuring one to perſonate Captain
<hi>Biſhop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:40606:47"/>
Thus a Citizen deſiring <hi>Faulconer</hi> to get Captain <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>
to do a buſineſs for him, hee promiſed <hi>Faulconer</hi>
twenty pound, ten pound in hand, and ten pound after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
<hi>Faulconer</hi> got one to perſonate Captain <hi>Biſhop,</hi>
and to go along with him to the Citizen, which man ſo
perſonating Captain <hi>Biſhop,</hi> promiſed the Citizen (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of Major <hi>Faulconers</hi> good ſervices for
the publike) to afford him his beſt aſſiſtance in effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what was deſired in his Petition, and ſo <hi>Faulconer</hi>
got the ten pound.</p>
            <p>It was alſo proved, that <hi>Faulconer</hi> was committed to
Goal, in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> for ſuſpition of felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and thence, by order from the <hi>Lord Chief Justice
Rolls,</hi> to <hi>Newgate;</hi> and that hee had been committed to
<hi>Ailsbury Goal,</hi> upon ſuſpition of felony, robbery, and
murther.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Faulconer</hi> having been over at <hi>Breda,</hi> (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forſaid)
and returning into <hi>England, George Biſhop</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Clerk to the Committee for <hi>informations)</hi> has to do
with him, from whence hee receives <hi>information</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>plots</hi> and deſignes of the <hi>adverſe</hi> party to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But (to come to the buſineſs) the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi>
(having a great Eſtate in <hi>England</hi> of Land, beſides brave
houſes, one in particular, that coſt twenty thouſand
pound the building, beſides brave and gallant woods
and timber) being thus beyond Sea, and never acted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

<hi>A true and perfect Narrative of the ſeveral proceedings

            </p>
            <p>Now if this information of <hi>Faulconer</hi> bee the onely
material teſtimony, upon which the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> eſtate
was ſequeſtred; and that <hi>Faulconer</hi> in this information
was <hi>perjured and forſworn,</hi> and this bee a <hi>falſe</hi> informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then this will clearly follow, that there was <hi>indirect</hi>
proceedings in ſome body, in this buſineſs; and that
this information of <hi>Faulconers</hi> was, and is <hi>falſe,</hi> and hee
perjured in it, and <hi>forſworn,</hi> appears by two moſt <hi>preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
teſtimonies, neither of them to be denied. Firſt, by
his legal <hi>tryal,</hi> and conviction. Secondly, by his <hi>own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi>
on his death-bed: For <hi>Faulconers tryal and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
of perjury, (in, and for this very information)
that appears by the Records thereof; for the Lord <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi>
friends prefer'd an Indictment of perjury againſt
him in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> which Indictment
was found againſt him, one Sir <hi>Henry Blunt</hi> being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the Jury: Delayes were uſed to hinder <hi>Faulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
pleading to it, notwithſtanding the Proſecutors for
the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> had procured a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> to bring
him to the Bar to plead to the Indictment, which hee
ſailing, they procure another <hi>Habeas Corpus;</hi> hee yet
gets further time, and a peremptory day aſſigned by the
Court, or elſe <hi>Judgement</hi> to bee entred againſt him. And
the very laſt day (when needs muſt) and <hi>not before,</hi>
when the laſt rule was out, hee pleaded, <hi>not guilty.</hi> Now
<hi>Faulconer</hi> having pleaded not guilty, a <hi>Jury</hi> is ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

               <hi>guilty of perjury,</hi> in this very matter againſt the Lord
<hi>Craven,</hi> the whole proceedings whereof you have fully
related in the <hi>Narrative</hi> before mentioned. This tryall
and conviction of <hi>Faulconer,</hi> was <hi>May</hi> 20. 1653. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Faulconer</hi> was committed to the Upper Bench pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in <hi>Southwark,</hi> where hee lay till hee died. Now for
the ſecond evidence of <hi>Faulconers</hi> perjury, in his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
(upon which the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> eſtate was ſequeſtred
and ſold) you have here the ſad and lamentable <hi>confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>

quickly inſerted,</hi> and I (the Lord pardon me) ſwore

of the Petition, and the Petition which <hi>Drury</hi> produced

<hi>Drury</hi> did ſay, that the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> would not bee

                        </p>
                        <p>And truly theſe great ſins, ſince they perfectly came

perplexed my ſoul, ſo, that I many times wiſhed
that the Lord would expiate them, by taking my life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,

                        </p>

               <p>I Thought here to have given thee in, the atteſtation of

when it was ſigned: Alſo ſome <hi>further</hi> teſtimony
of other practiſes of this <hi>Quaker;</hi> and how poor <hi>Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner</hi>
to his dying day, cryed out againſt that Rogue
<hi>Biſhop,</hi> (for ſo it is languaged to mee.) But in regard
the hearing of the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> Caſe in Parliament, is
not yet paſt, (although they have taken cognizance of
it already, and have appointed to enter further upon it,
the beginning of their next Seſſion) I ſhall therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
not doubting thou wilt hear further of it, by ſome

               <p>So that here is (you ſee) manifeſtly, undeniably, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt

What's this to Captain <hi>Biſhop?</hi> Hee declares in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Lord, before whom hee feares, and who
ſearcheth the heart, and tryeth the reins, and brings e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
work to judgement, <hi>that hee is clear and innocent
therein;</hi> and that hee hath not uſed, nor doth <hi>hee know</hi>
of any indirect proceedings in this <hi>whole buſineſs of</hi> Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>and</hi> Faulconer. Well, God ſend him a good delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
at the day of Judgement; and to that end, I
heartily beg for him the grace of <hi>true repentance,</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
through the blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhed at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And
to further this work for his conviction, wee ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to <hi>try,</hi> and examine him here; and clear I am, that
if any <hi>Jury</hi> in the world (of diſcreet, ſober, impartial
and underſtanding men) were to paſs upon him, they
would give in this Verdict, <hi>That hee</hi> (George Biſhop)
<hi>doth know of many indirect proceedings, in the matter of the
Lord</hi> Craven <hi>and</hi> Faulconer; and that hee <hi>(George Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop)

the evidence,<note place="margin">This book was written by <hi>George,</hi> partly to teſtifie the proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and to juſtifie <hi>Faulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
                  </note> there is a book publiſhed, entituled, <hi>The

A true and perfect Narrative of the ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
in the caſe concerning the Lord</hi> Craven, &amp;c.
which is the Narrative before quoted, wherein are all
the proceedings againſt <hi>Faulconer.</hi> Now this book <hi>(the

1653.</hi> and that this book was written by <hi>George
Biſhop</hi> himſelf, I ſuppoſe hee will not deny, though no
name bee to it; the book is ſaid to bee written <hi>on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the Commonwealth,</hi> and this expreſt in great Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters:
I would now but ask <hi>George</hi> this queſtion, why
hee (of all men in the world) being but a Clerk or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
(call him what you will) to a Committee,
ſhould <hi>undertake</hi> this private and perſonal quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> in the behalf of poor perjured
<hi>Faulconer,</hi> and the Commonwealth? I ſhould think,
that a Clerk or Secretary, (if an honeſt man, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial)
when hee had performed the d<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> of his place,
ſhould have ſate him down, and not eſpouſe any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
quarrel (unleſs hee were particularly concerned in
it)</p>
               <p>But ſayes <hi>George,</hi> that Pamphlet tends to the blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and their <hi>Miniſters;</hi> ſo hee, page
1. of his book (for ſo I ſhall call it all along, as I have
occaſion to quote it;) and therefore hee puts pen to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and writes that book. Mark, <hi>the Parliament, and
their Miniſters,</hi> are blemiſhed: Who thoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi>
are, (at leaſt one) wee ſhall ſee anon; 'tis the ſecureſt
way to <hi>ſave ones ears,</hi> to joyn in the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
with the <hi>Parliament it ſelf:</hi> But the Parliament
may bee <hi>honeſt,</hi> though their Miniſters may bee <hi>knaves;</hi>
and therefore <hi>George</hi> preſently ſayes, that that book of
his, is not <hi>purpoſely</hi> to Apologize for the Parliament; well
then, it is for ſome body elſe, he would not have writ it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40606:51"/>

words.</p>
               <p>Well then, ſtop a little here, and (though wee break
order in the form of proceedings in legal tryals) you
Gentlemen of this Jury, who are to <hi>give your verdict,</hi>
in this matter of <hi>George Biſhop,</hi> I pray take notice; <hi>Geo.</hi>
you ſee, upon his oath, (it was at <hi>Faulconers</hi> tryal) <hi>clears</hi>
Faulconer <hi>of corruption or malice againſt the Lord</hi> Craven,
Poor man, hee intended no ſuch thing <hi>at firſt</hi> againſt
him; no, <hi>Faulconer</hi> was altogether a ſtranger to the
Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> and ſince hee came over, hee confeſt to
ſome of good credit, <hi>that the Lord</hi> Cravens <hi>deportment at</hi>
Breda (where this horrible treaſon ſhould bee by him
committed, and for which his eſtate is ſequeſtred) <hi>was
altogether inoffenſive, as to the Commonwealth of</hi> England;
and that hee <hi>(Faulconer)</hi> underſtood nothing of the ſaid
buſineſs, (namely, of that dreadful Petition, for which
hee was ſo ſequeſtred) <hi>more, than that a conſideration was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40606:52"/>
defired, to hee had of the preſent wants and great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
of the Petitioners.</hi> This you have in the fourth
Petition preſented to the Parliament, on the behalf of
the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> in the <hi>Narrative</hi> aforeſaid, page 19.
Aye, theſe were their words, will <hi>George</hi> ſay. But I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<hi>they offered to prove them</hi> to the Parliament, if they
might have been admitted. But to ſecond this, I'le
ſhew you what <hi>George himſelf</hi> ſayes in his own book for
<hi>Faulconers</hi> honeſty, ſimplicity, and harmleſneſs, (as to
the Lord <hi>Craven)</hi> and this upon <hi>Biſhops oath,</hi> (if it bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing worth) page 13. line the laſt but 10. he ſayes,
<hi>that when</hi> Faulconer <hi>gave him accounts of deſignes agaiſt
the Commonwealth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſame hee hath again, in page 42, 43.</note> 
                  <hi>hee ſaid nothing to him of the Lord</hi>

(upon which the eſtate was ſequeſtred) <hi>nor notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many diſcourſes with him, ſaid hee any thing, till about

who were at</hi> Breda <hi>with the King, not thinking of the Lord</hi>
Craven, Faulconer <hi>reckoned the ſaid Lord amongſt the
reſt, and being asked, ſaid ſomething of that buſineſs, which
Captain</hi> Biſhop <hi>not much valued then.</hi> Thus hee. How
this was improved, you ſhall ſee afterwards; ſo that
here <hi>Faulconer</hi> is cleared of any <hi>intention</hi> of miſchief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Lord <hi>Craven;</hi> the man (poor <hi>Faulconer)</hi> is
yet honeſt in this matter. But yet you ſee, hee was <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
perjured and forſworn. How comes this about?
Oh ſee what a fearful <hi>temptation</hi> 'tis to bee in poverty and
want! it will put an <hi>honeſt</hi> heart into great <hi>ſtraits.</hi> I
now think upon that prayer of honeſt <hi>Agur,</hi> (Prov. 30.
8, 9) <hi>Give mee not poverty, leſt I bee poor and ſteal, and
take the name of my God in vain:</hi> Poverty is a ſore tryal,
even to a <hi>good and honeſt</hi> heart; but when it ſhall meet
with a <hi>wretched</hi> and profligate ſpirit, what will it not put
him upon? I minde that dreadful expreſſion of poore
<hi>Faulconer,</hi> before expreſſed, whilſt hee was <hi>ranting</hi> and
drinking healths to the devil, <hi>I have ſpent my brothers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
and mine own, I will never want money, for whilſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40606:52"/>
there is any in the Nation, I will get it one way or other,
and I will do ſomething of infamy to be talkt of, the name
of</hi> Faulconer <hi>ſhall never die.</hi> Oh how dreadfully did the
Lord ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to this poor creature! And what a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
thing is it for ſuch a poor <hi>wretch</hi> to fall into
the hands of ſuch as will make uſe and <hi>advantage</hi> of his
<hi>low condition?</hi> Why, you will ſay, what's the matter?
Do you ask what's the matter? look back upon <hi>Faulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
confeſſion, and there hee tells you, <hi>hee was provoked
to ſwear falſly:</hi> How? read the laſt words of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
<hi>Captain</hi> Biſhop <hi>kept mee low, with ſmall pittances,
ſo that I was at his bow.</hi> At his bow! what to do? Hee
(Faulconer) <hi>made a demur at thoſe words, barbarous and
inhumane rebels,</hi> (whether they werein the Petition or
no, which hee did not then remember, but now did)
and ſo (it ſeems) <hi>ſcrupled to ſwear</hi> to them; and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Biſhop</hi> ſaid, <hi>if you leave that out, you do nothing;</hi> and
(ſo ſayes hee) I'le let it paſs: Being <hi>ſpeedily</hi> brought
before the Committee, <hi>where I falſly ſwore it;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<hi>Captain</hi> Biſhop <hi>kept mee low, with ſmall pittances,
that I was at his bow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What think you of this Sirs? Is this <hi>direct,</hi> juſt, <hi>honeſt
proceedings,</hi> to provoke a poor man in want to <hi>ſwear with
a ſcrupling conſcience,</hi> and to that which now <hi>appears</hi> to
bee falſe? Hee was reſolved, it ſeems, hee ſhould ſwear
ſomething to the purpoſe. Do you want any <hi>more</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?
This is enough, you will ſay, but if you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more, produce it, and pray tell us, <hi>How do you conceive
this game began?</hi> Why, I'le tell you, what <hi>George</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſayes, as hee goes on, in page 13. lines 3 laſt, and ſo on
to 14; and the ſame alſo, page 42, 43. of his book, when
<hi>Faulconer</hi> (as before) in that <hi>accidental</hi> diſcourſe with
<hi>Biſhop,</hi> (five moneths after <hi>Faulconers</hi> coming over)
had mentioned the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> being at <hi>Breda</hi> with the
King, and had ſpoken <hi>ſomething</hi> of the Petition, which
made all this ſtir, which <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſaid, <hi>hee did not much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
then.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee goes on, and tells you, that though hee did not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40606:53"/>
much value it then, yet <hi>hee acquainted ſome of the Councel
of State therewith, and they ordered him</hi> (the ſaid <hi>Biſhop)
to ask him</hi> (namely <hi>Faulconer) further about it; who
thereupon took his information; hee</hi> (the ſaid <hi>Faulconer)
judging it then alſo</hi> (as <hi>Geo.</hi> himſelf ſaid) <hi>not to bee worth
any thing;</hi> poor <hi>Faulconer</hi> ſtill continued his <hi>good</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my Lord <hi>Cravens innocency;</hi> but well (or ill) fare
a good (or a bad) head and heart, that can make <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
of nothing, and bring <hi>ſomething</hi> (a great eſtate)
to <hi>nothing;</hi> 'twas a huge ſin to bee ſo rich, and yeeld no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>contribution</hi> to the Parliament: Who thoſe
were of the Councel of <hi>State</hi> that you <hi>(George)</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it, if you did acquaint any with it, (for I know
not how to believe you) I do not know. But ſure they
had more skill in <hi>Chimiſtry</hi> than ever I had, or <hi>deſire</hi> to
have, that they could make ſo <hi>great</hi> a tranſmutation upon
ſo little matter: I doubt they were ſome ſuch as I met
with, when I was in the Chair of the Committee for <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtrations,</hi>
when an information being brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
one, and the <hi>Proſecutors</hi> preſt for a Sequeſtration
of his eſtate in <hi>London,</hi> (being money) the party living
in the country; all that could bee proved againſt him,
was but <hi>words,</hi> declaring ſome <hi>malignancy</hi> of ſpirit againſt
the <hi>Parliament:</hi> Some of the Committee inclining to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter
him, I told them, that by our Ordinance wee
could not do it, for <hi>words</hi> alone, without ſome action:
<hi>What,</hi> (ſayes one of the Committee) the <hi>Parliament
wants money, and hee hath it;</hi> but wee ſtopt it; it's a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
thing to bee rich in troublous times. But <hi>George,</hi>
you would ſeem to put that <hi>which you lookt upon as no
great matter,</hi> (of which notwithſtanding a great matter
is made) you would put it <hi>upon ſome of the Councel of
State:</hi> How the matter was ſecretly contriv'd, I know
not, nor will I <hi>enquire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now Sirs, you that are to give judgement upon
<hi>George,</hi> you ſhall hear how this information was <hi>taken,</hi>
and by whom, and how. It was proved at the tryal, by
<hi>Biſhops own acknowledgement,</hi> that hee <hi>himſelf</hi> prepared
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40606:53"/>
                  <hi>Faulconers information,</hi> before the Commiſſioners (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom hee was ſworn) were ſent for. (of this again
afterwards) And <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſaid again, <hi>I prepared the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
which hee made oath of,</hi> page 40. of the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now ſee</hi> how <hi>it was prepared; and for that, hear
poor</hi> Faulconer <hi>upon his death-bed. Look back to his
confeſſion:</hi> After twenty weeks ſickneſſe <hi>(ſayes hee)</hi>
my body being low, and in much haſte, being much infeebled;
and above three quarters of a year after I came over Sea; ſo
that <hi>(as hee ſolemnly proteſts)</hi> hee did not well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
whether theſe words, barbarous and inhumane Rebels;
<hi>(which as I ſhew'd you before, hee motioned to have
put into the Petition, and might therefore have ſome
confuſed remembrance of them) I ſay,</hi> hee could not well
then, in haſte <hi>(as hee ſayes)</hi> remember, whether they were
expunged or no.</p>
               <p>But now mark; <hi>Thoſe words</hi> (ſayes hee) <hi>being once
named by mee, they were as quickly inſerted, and I (the
Lord pardon mee) ſwore it.</hi> The poor man, after a long
time, and much weakneſs, <hi>taken haſtily,</hi> (and ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately)
<hi>mentions thoſe words,</hi> (of which ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
motion had been) <hi>and they are ſuddenly catcht at</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as hee ſayes, but <hi>once named</hi> by him) and are <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
put in for him to <hi>ſwear</hi> to. Ah <hi>George, George!</hi> poor
<hi>Faulconer,</hi> 'tis too late to pray for, or to <hi>ſay</hi> any thing
to him, hee ſtands, or is fallen to his own Maſter: But
<hi>George,</hi> what haſt thou to anſwer for, eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that when the poor wretch, his heart ſeemed to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi>
and that hee <hi>demurred and ſcrupled</hi> at the words <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
hee ſwore them, (and having met with an honeſt,
tender-hearted, conſcientious man, might have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his crying ſin) for which (poor creature) his name
is infamous) that thou ſhouldſt tell that poor neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
creature, (whom thou hadſt thereby at thy bow)
<hi>that if hee left out that, hee did nothing;</hi> and ſo hee went
on, and perpetrated his villany: Well <hi>George,</hi> well,
<hi>Quake,</hi> or not <hi>Quake,</hi> 'tis dreadful: Ah poor <hi>Faulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner!</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:40606:54"/>
Ah poor <hi>George!</hi> the Lord convert thee, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
thee: I profeſs, (in the ſight of God) I beg it
<hi>heartily,</hi> I deſire not thy condemnation; but theſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
cannot yeeld <hi>comfort,</hi> nor a ſafe and ſecure <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
though poſſibly <hi>quiet</hi> for a time. Readers, you
that are to give your judgment upon this man, when I
have done with him, is not here <hi>indirect dealing?</hi> But I
pray ſtand by a while, and hear what I ſhall <hi>further</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogate
him in: You <hi>(George)</hi> declare in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Lord, &amp;c. that you do not know of <hi>any indirect
proceeding</hi> in this whole buſineſs of <hi>Craven</hi> and <hi>Faulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
which how true (or rather how falſe) it is, appears
ſufficiently already, too much. But I ask you further,
<hi>Faulconer</hi> ſayes, <hi>monoy and liberty were promiſed him,
though not performred:</hi> Though hee were not bribed with
money <hi>before hand,</hi> yet it was promiſed him, and <hi>liberty</hi>
too.</p>
               <p>Let mee ask you, who promiſed this? Did not you?
who (as you ſay your ſelf) had the tranſactions of the
<hi>whole</hi> buſineſs; I doubt not you can tell; and why was
it promiſed him? no doubt, that hee might not flinch
from his oath: And why did hee write a <hi>Pamphlet</hi> in his
own vindication? (which upon his death-bed hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
as falſe) but that (as hee ſayes) <hi>hee was told by
under actors, that until hee did that, hee could not think his
friends would ſupply him, as they would, if that were done:</hi>
And did not you (Captain <hi>Biſhop)</hi> ſend him that Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet?
But I pray, why was not that money <hi>paid</hi> him
which was promiſed? <hi>Thomas Dier</hi> (who was your Clerk,
as was ſworn in Court at <hi>Faulconers</hi> tryal) paid him by
<hi>your</hi> direction, <hi>twenty pound</hi> at one time, and about <hi>thirty
pounds</hi> more at other times, <hi>in ſeveral portions;</hi> and that
<hi>Faulconer</hi> confeſt to him, that hee had <hi>twenty pounds after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;</hi>
and that being demanded <hi>what it was for,</hi> hee
would not tell him, ſaying, I <hi>will not ſpeak to that, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſpeak to that.</hi> Why, was not the money promiſed
him <hi>now</hi> paid. And when as <hi>Faulconer</hi> was (as is before
expreſt) impriſon'd in <hi>Newgate,</hi> upon ſuſpition of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40606:54"/>
and felony, did not you write a Letter to the Lord
Chief Juſtice <hi>Rolls,</hi> ſignifying, what a ſervant <hi>Faulconer</hi>
was to the Commonwealth? and how much depended
upon the <hi>upholding</hi> of his credit, and teſtimony? And
when as the Judge ſlighted ſuch applications unto him,
ſaying, <hi>if hee were innocent, that would prove his best vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication:</hi>
Don't you know what was done, and how
unquiet you were, till hee was <hi>inlarged?</hi> Was not <hi>Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit</hi>
made, that hee was imployed upon publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments?
and did not <hi>Faulconer</hi> give it under his hand,
what ſervices hee had done for the publike, and how he
was the <hi>chief</hi> witneſs againſt the Lord <hi>Craven?</hi> And
was it not ſo carried, that there was <hi>ſlack</hi> proſecution of
the Indictment; and when <hi>Faulconer</hi> was ſet at liberty
upon Bail, to appear at next <hi>Seſſions</hi> at <hi>Newgate,</hi> they
never appeared, and ſo the matter ended? which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>honeſty,</hi> to pervert, or obſtruct
Juſtice, and whether this bee not <hi>indirect proceedings,</hi> let
all the world judge.</p>
               <p>To this you anſwer, page 41. and ſay, <hi>For</hi> Faulconer
<hi>to bee releaſt without tryal, fixes no crime upon him; and an
honeſt man may bee committed upon ſuſpition.</hi> True, but
you ſhould have ſuffered him to come to <hi>tryal;</hi> and
ſure hee was no <hi>honeſt</hi> man that hindred it, it was a
crime, and a great one, in him that hindred it; you
know who it was <hi>George:</hi> It ſeems the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> muſt
bee a <hi>Delinquent,</hi> and a man for the purpoſe muſt bee
countenanc'd againſt Law and Juſtice: but I ſay, why
was not his liberty procured him <hi>now?</hi> and the money
promiſed, paid him <hi>now?</hi> Oh! the buſineſs was <hi>done,</hi>
the eſtate <hi>ſold,</hi> let him <hi>hang,</hi> let him <hi>ſtarve</hi> now. It may
bee the ſum promiſed was too great, and they could not
<hi>agree</hi> who ſhould pay it, the eſtate being ſold: Ah poor
<hi>Faulconer!</hi> how art thou <hi>befool'd?</hi> no marvel thou cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
out againſt <hi>Biſhop</hi> to thy dying day. But let mee ask
you further <hi>(George)</hi> concerning your <hi>indirect</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
the <hi>direct</hi> proceedings againſt <hi>Delinquents</hi> was,
that the informations were taken before the <hi>Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:40606:55"/>
at their uſual place of ſitting, and ſet down in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
by the <hi>ſworn Examiner</hi> thereunto belonging, who was
thereby ingag'd, to bee a perſon juſt and <hi>indifferent</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Commonwealth, and party accuſed: And
was not this <hi>indirect proceeding,</hi> that you ſhould frame
the Oath and Information <hi>before hand,</hi> in your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and in ſuch a <hi>manner,</hi> as aforeſaid,
<hi>catching at haſty and inconſiderate words</hi> (which were the
only material words) and then ſend (as you did) for
the Commiſſioners at <hi>Haberdaſhers</hi> Hall, to your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
who (knowing you to bee Clerk to the <hi>ſecret</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
(and ſuppoſing you had ſome ſecrecy of State
to communicate unto them) came, and there you ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to them <hi>Faulconers</hi> oath, ſo ready drawn, to bee
ſworn to; and hee was there (contrary to the ordinary
and direct way of proceedings, upon ſome little alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made by them upon their examination) ſworn to it,
I know how <hi>ſmoothly</hi> you wipe your mouth, (or rather,
how you would wipe your Readers <hi>noſe)</hi> and how
ſlightly you come off in this matter, page 43. of your
<hi>book,</hi> ſaying, <hi>that becauſe of the ſeaſon, and the danger of
diſcovery, the Commiſſioners of Sequeſtrations were deſired to
come to</hi> White-Hall, <hi>and there took his depoſition:</hi> What
you mean by the <hi>ſeaſon.</hi> I know not; but indeed, the <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of diſcovery</hi> was conſiderable. But would you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter
a mans eſtate in <hi>hugger mugger</hi> (as wee uſe to ſay)
'tis honeſtly ſaid, though not honeſtly done, that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
you ſent for the Commiſſioners to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> to
take the information, <hi>becauſe of the danger of the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Go too <hi>George,</hi> go too, are you <hi>innocent?</hi> are not theſe
<hi>indirect</hi> proceedings? I ask you again <hi>further,</hi> when the
<hi>Indictment</hi> for Perjury,<note place="margin">Narr. page 16.</note> was brought againſt <hi>Faulconer</hi> in
<hi>London,</hi> where the Bill was <hi>found</hi> by the <hi>Grand-Jury,</hi> and
Colonel <hi>Drury</hi> (before mentioned) being ſerved with a
<hi>Subpena</hi> to appear at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> to give in further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
againſt <hi>Faulconer,</hi> in the behalf of the Lord <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
did not you take away the <hi>Subpena</hi> from him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40606:55"/>
                  <hi>How durſt you be examined againſt the Commonwealth,
and not acquaint mee firſt therewith?</hi> Further, ſaying, Mr.
<hi>Mayor</hi> (meaning the Lord Mayor) <hi>had better have done
ſomething elſe, than to have ſuffered that Indictment to bee
found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And did not you <hi>(George Biſhop)</hi> thereupn imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
call for a Meſſenger, and commit the ſaid <hi>Drury</hi>
to the cuſtody of one <hi>Middleton,</hi> (a Meſſenger to the
Councel of <hi>State)</hi> who forthwith carried away <hi>Drury</hi>
a priſoner to the <hi>Strand,</hi> to the houſe of the ſaid <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton,</hi>
where the ſaid <hi>Drury</hi> was kept in ſtrict cuſtody,
from <hi>Munday,</hi> when the Indictment was found, till
<hi>Saturday,</hi> that the <hi>Seſſion</hi> was <hi>paſt,</hi> that no further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
could bee had againſt <hi>Faulconer,</hi> at that time, by
reaſon of <hi>Druries</hi> reſtraint, who had <hi>Faulconers</hi> own
hand-writing to produce againſt him, and being the
moſt <hi>material</hi> witneſs againſt him; <hi>and before the next
Seſſions, the Bill for the ſale of the Lord</hi> Cravens <hi>eſtate was
paſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were not theſe <hi>indirect</hi> proceedings towards the Lord
<hi>Craven,</hi> to hinder and obſtruct the diſcovery of <hi>Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coners</hi>
perjury? (upon whoſe oath the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
was ſequeſtred) was this <hi>direct,</hi> and honeſt, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>carriage?</hi> Are you innocent? To excuſe this, you
<hi>ſhuffle</hi> ſo miſerably, and catch at ſuch <hi>ſtrawes:</hi> In your
book, page 34. and 35. that I cannot but commend your
<hi>wit,</hi> (though not your honeſty) in printing ſo few of
your books, that every one cannot ſee how poorly you
come off in your anſwers. And I take it as a great <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi>
(I hope for your good) that I was ſo <hi>directed,</hi>
as to ſend to your <hi>ſelf</hi> for one of them, and which (I
thank you) you ſent mee, it is no doubt from that
hand (which as you rightly ſaid before) orders <hi>all things,</hi>
that you were <hi>over-ruled</hi> ſo to do; and I wiſh that this
<hi>diſcovery</hi> of you <hi>to</hi> your ſelf, (from your ſelf) I mean
your own book (in great part) may bee for your <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi>
and converſion: And becauſe your book is not
to bee had eaſily, I'le give in the <hi>weight</hi> and ſubſtance of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40606:56"/>
your anſwer; (for the whole is very long) and if you
ſuppoſe I do you wrong in <hi>concealing</hi> any thing thereof,
that may tend to your <hi>vindication,</hi> print your whole book,
and let them ordinarily bee had, and if any <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Reader will ſay I have injured you, I will be content
to bee <hi>accounted</hi> as you are.</p>
               <p>You ſay, that <hi>Drury</hi> being a Papiſt, a Traytor, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
upon a Warrant from the Councel of <hi>State,</hi> and
in ſafe cuſtody, and being examined by you of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<hi>ſhould</hi> have been continued in ſafe <hi>cuſtody,</hi> but that
(upon his ſad complaint, that hee had neither money
nor friend, to relieve him there, and that hee muſt needs
periſh) you gave him his <hi>Parol,</hi> (which in Engliſh is)
as I ſuppoſe, you let him go at <hi>liberty,</hi> to return when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Drury</hi> having acquainted you, that he had
been ſworn at <hi>Guild-Hall London,</hi> and given in evidence
to the Grand Jury againſt <hi>Major Faulconer</hi> there, and
examined upon part of what hee had been examined by
you before. I perceive your meaning Sir in theſe laſt
words: But I pray (before you go any further) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>you</hi> had examined him before in <hi>one part,</hi> was it
unjuſt that my Lord <hi>Craven</hi> ſhould examine him (or
cauſe him to bee examined) on <hi>another part,</hi> to cleare
himſelf? Doth, or ſhould <hi>your</hi> examination, take him
off from being examined by <hi>others?</hi> They did not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
him of <hi>ſecrets</hi> or myſteries of <hi>State,</hi> but of <hi>Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coners</hi>
perjury, and your <hi>myſteries of iniquity.</hi> Well,
but then you were a man in power, and hereupon you
ſay, that <hi>(Drury)</hi> ſhewing you the <hi>Subpena,</hi> you asked
him, whether hee told them that hee was under the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the <hi>Councel of State,</hi> and under examination of
<hi>their Committee</hi> of Examinations. <hi>As to that particular,</hi>
amongſt others, (but I muſt tell you, hee was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their examination <hi>to that particular of</hi> Faulconers <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury)</hi>
hee anſwered, no. Then you ſay, you asked him,
<hi>why hee had not acquainted you with the</hi> Subpena <hi>before hee
went to</hi> Guild-Hall, <hi>and was ſworn</hi> (yea, there was his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40606:56"/>
fault) <hi>ſince hee was a priſoner under examination, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Parol?</hi> To which (as you ſay) hee giving no <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi>
anſwer, but that hee knew not what the buſineſs
was, and ſuch like; <hi>when as</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could not have been drawn without the conſent of, and
converſe with</hi> Drury; (yea, ſtill there was the ſin) <hi>and
who, you ſay, was the chief witneſſe upon which it was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it being prepared and found that day.</hi> (and had hee
not been committed by you, <hi>Faulconer</hi> had been convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
that <hi>Seſsions,</hi> of that perjury, which was afterwards
proved, and himſelf confeſſed.)</p>
               <p>But you go on, and ſay, <hi>That you perceiving thereby
how hee did prevaricate, and how things were done in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
and combination againſt the State.</hi> But ſtay, Was it
a deſign againſt the <hi>State,</hi> that the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
ſhould bee cleared? Oh baſe! Yes, now I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
my ſelf, it was; for then the <hi>deſign</hi> againſt the
<hi>eſtate</hi> of the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> (in all likelihood of Juſtice)
might have proved <hi>ineffectual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you go on, and ſay further,</hi> that you not knowing
what other inconvenience might come to the State by his
<hi>(Druries)</hi> further liberty, ſince hee had made that uſe of
it, aforeſaid, reproved him therefore, <hi>(with that high
language againſt him, and the</hi> Lord Mayor <hi>(as before)
which you do not deny)</hi> received the <hi>Subpena</hi> from
him, and taking of his Parol, returned him into cuſtody,
from Munday evening, to the Friday following. <hi>And was it
not to</hi> Friday evening <hi>following, as well as from</hi> Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
evening <hi>before? which you reckon up with a four
nights, and</hi> no longer, <hi>and I ſay</hi> four dayes too, <hi>ſo long,
that no</hi> proceedings <hi>could bee expected that</hi> Seſsions <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Faulconer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>laſt</hi> day of the <hi>Seſsions,</hi> being no time for ſuch
proſecutions, but calling over the <hi>Goal,</hi> and concluding
former buſineſſes; and then you ſay, <hi>upon information of
the poverty of</hi> Drury, <hi>and that hee had no money to pay for
his diet and lodging,</hi> which you knew well enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and have acknowledged, when you gave him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40606:57"/>
for his ſupper, and would not commit him, leſt hee
ſhould perish. And now (you ſay) <hi>in meer charity,</hi>
(when there was no opportunity for him at Seſſions)
<hi>hee had his liberty upon his Parol again, and enjoyes it.</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
wretch! And did you in <hi>charity</hi> commit him?
Fie upon ſuch baſe hypocriſie. And then you go on
with a company of blinde ſuppoſals, to argue the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability</hi>
of your committing of him, to the end, to
obſtruct the proceedings againſt <hi>Faulconer,</hi> which are ſo
childiſh, (and coming in but by way of additional aid, to
your former anſwer, which is your chief buckler, but a
ſilly one) I ſhall not <hi>trouble</hi> my ſelf, and the Reader
with, which if you think any thing worth, print it, and
I'le bee your <hi>bondman,</hi> if it any way help you; nay, if it
don't <hi>further</hi> diſcover your folly; and I would have <hi>writ</hi>
it, but that 'tis as <hi>long,</hi> as <hi>impertinent;</hi> and this is enough.
And your main anſwer, which how it clears you, let all,
or any man of <hi>common</hi> reaſon judge: And ſay, is <hi>George
Biſhop</hi> innocent in this matter?</p>
               <p>And one thing more I finde charg'd againſt you <hi>George,</hi>
which I ſuppoſe is an <hi>unjuſt and indirect</hi> practiſe,<note place="margin">Narr. page 40.</note> and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by you in the matter of <hi>Craven</hi> and <hi>Faulconer:</hi> And
in the Margin of the <hi>Narrative</hi> (where this matter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
is ſpoken to) there is written, <hi>Obſerve;</hi> and
'tis obſervable, 'tis short, but home, and therefore print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in another Character, in theſe words, <hi>By way of digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
obſerve, that</hi> Druries <hi>and</hi> Briſcoes <hi>informations, which
Captain</hi> Biſhop <hi>had taken, above twelve moneths ſince, and
which tended to clear the Lord</hi> Craven, <hi>hee concealed, till
this hour, that hee produc'd the ſame in Court, and never
tranſmitted theſe two mens examinations to the Parliament,
though before the Bill of Sale did paſſe, hee did tranſmit</hi>
Bardſeys <hi>and</hi> Kitchingmans <hi>re-examinations, taken by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and which hee apprehended made againſt the Lord</hi> Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here now is a heavy charge; and certainly theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
(if true) are</hi> very indirect, <hi>and hee cannot bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent:
But hear him ſpeak for himſelf, and I'le give
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40606:57"/>
you every word: And thus hee begins, page 44. of his
own book,</hi> What Captain <hi>Biſhops</hi> imployment <hi>was,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſpoken, his duty was to take, and to keep ſuch infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
as concerned the Committee, and to do with them
according to their, or the Councels, or the Parliaments or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
but neither the Council nor Committee ordered him to
tranſmit them to the Parliament, though they were not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of them, and ſeveral times ſhewed by him to ſome of the
members of the Councel, and to the Committee; nor did the
Parliament call for them, or what papers concerning the
Lord <hi>Craven</hi> were in the cuſtody of the Councel or Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,
nor take the depoſitions into debate, after the firſt vote
of confiſcation; and whether thoſe examinations advantage
the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> let the reader upon conſideration of what
is already mentioned, and argued thereupon, judge. <hi>Nay,
but</hi> George, <hi>let mee put in a word or two by the way; it
had been very</hi> honeſt <hi>and fair for you, to have put down
their</hi> examinations themſelves, <hi>that the reader might</hi> judge
<hi>upon them, for wee can't ſee them, nor muſt wee take</hi>
your <hi>word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you go on,</hi> Nor were any papers at all tranſmitted
by him, <hi>(meaning himſelf</hi> G. B.) to the Parliament, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for or againſt the Lord <hi>Craven;</hi> for <hi>Bardſeys</hi> exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
when hee had taken it, hee ſent it in to the Councel,
for <hi>Bardſey</hi> to make oath thereof, which after hee had made,
it was put preſently into the hands of one of the members
<hi>(viz.) Mr. Gourdon</hi> to report to the Parliament, who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it, and lodged it with <hi>Mr. Scobel,</hi> it being not returned
to Captain <hi>Biſhop;</hi> and for <hi>Kitchingmans</hi> re examination,
hee tranſmitted no ſuch thing, nor was any ſuch taken whilſt
the Committee for examinations was in being, <hi>Kitchingmans</hi>
information being depoſed by him at Haberdaſhers Hall.</p>
               <p>Now I pray, what's all this to the purpoſe? doth this
<hi>excuſe</hi> you? will you give mee leave to interrogate you?
If you will not anſwer chuſe, let the <hi>reader</hi> judge: You
took ſuch informations from <hi>Drury</hi> and <hi>Briſco,</hi> did you
not? 'Tis plain you did; Did not their depoſitions <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi>
and acquit the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> and prove <hi>Faulconer</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:40606:58"/>
perjur'd? 'Tis plain they did: Had not <hi>Drury</hi> the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
draught of the <hi>Petition,</hi> under <hi>Faulconers</hi> own hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing,
which at his <hi>Tryal</hi> was produc'd, and hee could
not deny, and which hee confeſt upon his death-bed,
to bee the <hi>true and right Petition?</hi> This is moſt certain, it
<hi>cannot</hi> bee gain-ſaid; the teſtimonies of theſe two men
ſo vex you, that in your book, page 12. you do what
you can to beſpatter them as <hi>incompetent</hi> witneſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Cavaleers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas you ſay, <hi>your duty was to take and keep
ſuch informations as concern'd the Committee, and to do with
them according to their, or the Councels, or the Parliaments
orders.</hi> Did any of them order you to ſuppreſs or <hi>conceal</hi>
the teſtimonies of <hi>theſe</hi> two men? If they did, tell us who
they bee, and wee'l ſay of them <hi>almoſt as much</hi> as wee
do of you? You ſay <hi>ſome of them</hi> did know of them; like
enough <hi>ſuch a buſineſſe as this could not bee ſo mannaged,
but by the knowledge</hi> (and ſomewhat elſe) <hi>of more than
one:</hi> It's plain that <hi>Faulconer</hi> was a perjur'd wretch in
his <hi>teſtimony;</hi> hee was <hi>convicted</hi> of it by two, nay, <hi>three</hi>
ſeveral Juries, of men <hi>ſworn to give true judgement;</hi> and
upon his death-bed hee confeſt it, and his conviction was
upon the teſtimony <hi>chiefly,</hi> if not onely, of theſe two
men, who were the <hi>principal</hi> actors in the buſineſs of that
Petition at <hi>Breda,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Narr. page 35.</note> which gave colour to the Lord <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi>
ſequeſtration; and <hi>Drury</hi> at <hi>Faulconers</hi> tryal ſaid,
that what teſtimony hee then gave to the Court, hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>you</hi> with, when hee was examined by <hi>you,</hi> and
no doubt <hi>Briſco</hi> the like; and no queſtion had the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in general</hi> known of theſe teſtimonies, they would
not ſo readily have <hi>ſequeſtred</hi> the Lord <hi>Craven;</hi> nor
would any <hi>honeſt man</hi> (adviſe who would) have <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt</hi>
ſuch teſtimonies, which would have diſcovered
the truth, and prevented <hi>injuſtice,</hi> which is the curſe
and ruine of a <hi>Nation,</hi> and the way to render <hi>Parliaments</hi>
(which ſhould bee our greateſt ſecurity) our greateſt
<hi>plagues,</hi> in committing or <hi>countenancing</hi> ſuch actions. And
whereas you would <hi>choak</hi> your conſcience, and <hi>cheat</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:40606:58"/>
your reader with this pretext, <hi>that ſome of the Parliament
did know of theſe teſtimonies, and that you were not ordered
to tranſmit them.</hi> I ſay again, <hi>No honeſt man</hi> (that had it
not in <hi>deſign</hi> to ruine the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> eſtate) but would
have made them known; or if hee had been command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the contrary, would have ſcorn'd to ſerve <hi>unworthy</hi>
ends to any mans <hi>ruine:</hi> Come <hi>(George)</hi> come, you
muſt not magnifie <hi>Parliaments,</hi> as if they were infallible in
themſelves, eſpecially when <hi>Knaves</hi> are proſecutors,
and as bad are <hi>agents</hi> or Miniſters under them; and hee
that ſhall readily obey their <hi>unjuſt</hi> commands, knowing
them ſo to bee, (while there is time and opportunity to
offer ſomething to the contrary) ſhall inſtead of <hi>honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
them, do them the greateſt diſſervice in the world,
<hi>(viz.)</hi> wrong the innocent. I'le give you an inſtance or
two within my knowledge; there were in the hands of
<hi>Sir Robert Rich,</hi> then a Maſter of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> (put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his cuſtody upon a ſuit depending in that Court) 204
Diamonds, with many other rich things of <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>pearl,</hi>
and writings of great value, upon an information given
in to the Committee for <hi>examinations at Weſtminſter,</hi> that
they were the goods of a <hi>Lord,</hi> then in armes againſt the
<hi>Parliament;</hi> thoſe goods were ordered to bee taken out
of the hands of Sir <hi>Robert Rich,</hi> and put into <hi>my</hi> cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
(which were the only goods of any Delinquent, or
ſuppoſed Delinquent that ever were in my cuſtody) it
being none of my buſineſs, as I have before declared:
But this was by an <hi>extraordinary</hi> order, Theſe things (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by an exact inventory before witneſſes) being thus in
my hands, there came a peremptory <hi>order</hi> to mee, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them out to bee ſold, as the goods of a <hi>Delinquent;</hi>
but I being ſatisfied by Sir <hi>Robert Rich,</hi> (who was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Gentleman) that they were brought into his
cuſtody, in the behalf (as I remember) of divers children
and Orphans, I delayed the obſervance of the Order,
till thoſe who were concern'd (who they were I know
not) had opportunity to <hi>clear</hi> them; &amp; at laſt (by order)
I re-delivered them to Sir <hi>Robert Rich,</hi> from whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40606:59"/>
them. Now ſhould I have <hi>readily</hi> obſerv'd their
Orders, Orphans had been <hi>ruin'd,</hi> and the Parliament
inſtrumental to an Act of <hi>injuſtice;</hi> And that <hi>all</hi> that are
members of <hi>Parliament,</hi> are not <hi>alwayes</hi> ſuch as they
ſhould bee. I'le give you one relation more, There comes
an information to our Committee in <hi>London</hi> againſt a
perſon for Delinquencie, preſſed and urged very hard for
a ſpeedie ſequeſtration; the reaſon of the <hi>haſte,</hi> I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
afterwards to bee, becauſe the party concern'd (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Lawyer) was in the <hi>circuit,</hi> and the proſecutors
would fain have had him ſequeſtred <hi>before hee knew on't;</hi>
upon hearing the information and witneſſes, I perceiv'd
the bottom of the buſineſs to bee revenge, and private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
(to ſay no worſe) their haſte added to my jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
and I was therefore the more <hi>ſlack</hi> in furthering it.
The next day (as I remember) one comes to mee to
my houſe, from the Proſecutors, to offer me gold to ſpeed
the buſineſs. It would bee too tedious to tell you every
circumſtance, I refus'd it.</p>
               <p>After this (now mark) one of the houſe of
<hi>Parliament,</hi> comes to mee to my houſe, with recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
from others of them, to <hi>preſs</hi> mee on; I gave
him civil entertainment, but grew more <hi>reſolv'd</hi> in the
buſineſs. After this, an eminent man in the Parliament
came to our <hi>Committee,</hi> and preſt it, and told us, it was
a buſineſs that many in the <hi>Parliament</hi> took notice of,
and that if wee did not do it, they would take it into
hearing themſelves: I ask'd that Gentleman whether he
came to <hi>threaten</hi> us, and told him wee were upon our
oaths, &amp;c. So that hee went away in <hi>diſcontent.</hi> Upon
this (very ſpeedily) an order comes to us to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Committee of <hi>Lords and Commons</hi> for Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to give an account for our non-proſecution; a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel</hi>
in the Army was hee that promoted it, and it was
backt (as I perceiv'd after) by divers members; my
ſelf appear'd <hi>alone</hi> in behalf of the Committee, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Councel (beſides the Councel for the State) to
ſpeak for them: It was as great a Committee of <hi>Lords
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40606:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Commons,</hi> as I ever remember, to have ſeen at any
time, I ſo mannag'd the matter, (well knowing the
<hi>baſeneſs</hi> of the buſineſs) that it was refer'd back again
to us, <hi>where wee never heard more of it,</hi> inſomuch that
the <hi>Colonel</hi> came afterward to my houſe to ſpeak with
mee, but by providence I was not at home, but he (as
my family and neighbours told mee) <hi>threatned</hi> to bee
revenged upon mee, but by Gods goodneſs (in whom
I truſt) I heard no more of him; now had I <hi>yeelded</hi> in
this matter, an <hi>honeſt</hi> Gentleman might have been <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd,</hi>
for if wee had ſequeſtred him in <hi>London,</hi> (though
hee had not much there) they would preſently have
ſent down into the <hi>Country,</hi> and done the like there:
The perſon is one of <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>honor,</hi> afterwards a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>that Parliament,</hi> and of the cloſe Committee, or
ſafety, (I have forgotten the title) and is <hi>now</hi> a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of this <hi>preſent Parliament,</hi> one ſo cordial to the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
intereſt,</hi> that I do profeſs, whom I afterwards ſaw
him (upon his return from the circuit) my heart <hi>rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi>
that I had ſo <hi>appeared</hi> for him, whom (upon my
own knowledge) was ſo true a friend to the <hi>Parliament,</hi>
for I well knew him before by ſight, but did not know
him by <hi>name,</hi> to bee the perſon proſecuted. I could tell
you further <hi>(George)</hi> of others whom I have reſcued from
the jawes of ruine, upon <hi>Parliamentary proſecutions,</hi> and
that upon baſe and packt knavery, followed with perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and by ſome of our own Officers, which I my ſelf
have <hi>diſcovered,</hi> and cauſed them to bee turned out: So
that <hi>George,</hi> you muſt not <hi>ſculk</hi> and hide your head un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſhelter of the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And for the reſt that
followes in your <hi>anſwer</hi> and excuſe, the reader will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceive you do but <hi>quibble</hi> and <hi>trifle</hi> upon forms and
circumſtances, which makes nothing to the ſubſtance of
the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſhall not need to mention your zeal and earneſtneſs
at the</hi> tryal <hi>of</hi> Faulconer, <hi>in his behalf, nor your reflecting
upon the</hi> Judges <hi>in theſe words, page 15. of your book,</hi>
The Judges in the iſſue ſumm<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> not up the evidence, <hi>which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40606:60"/>
they ſhould have done. As for the</hi> Jury, <hi>you beſtow this
upon them, in the ſame page,</hi> The Jury (of the affections
of whom for the Parliament, wee cannot yet underſtand)
neither took any notes, nor ask'd a queſtion, yet in a very
ſhort time were agreed in their verdict, and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gave it into the Court, that <hi>Faulconer</hi> was guilty of the
perjury mentioned in the Indictment: <hi>And then you go
on, and ſay,</hi> That a man indeed, without divining, might
have told which way the cauſe would go, by the countenances
of the Jury, all along the tryal of the cauſe, as was taken
notice of by many honeſt men, ſuch as you are, no doubt.
<hi>And then you ſadly complain thus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>George</hi> is huge angry that <hi>Faulconer</hi> is found guilty of Perjury.</note> But this is what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
honeſt man may expect in caſes wherein the State is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
when the unpardoned traytors, whom with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril

of a State in times of great danger, in the field, and under

thereof, ſhall after the enemie is overthrown and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
bee permitted to come into <hi>England,</hi> when they can no

in ſuch Traitors own cauſes, as to their lives, as hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to one of the States witneſſes <hi>(Faulconer)</hi> in the very
caſe now in queſtion. <hi>And ſo you flirt upon the Jury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
page 47. I will not comment upon it, becauſe I
haſten to an end: But the man is very angry with</hi> Judge,
and Jury, and Witneſſes, <hi>(and as before) with the</hi> Lord
Mayor, <hi>as no friends to the State, that</hi> Faulconer <hi>was
found perjur'd, which yet hee himſelf hath</hi> confeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<hi>to bee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why is <hi>George</hi> ſo angry, it ſeems hee is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in it; for though hee act for <hi>good affection to the
State,</hi> yet its reaſon that hee ſhould bee <hi>conſider'd;</hi> and
therefore in my information from <hi>London</hi> (by a hand
that is able to make good his undertakings) I am thus
told, that hee <hi>(George)</hi> repaired to <hi>Drury houſe,</hi> and
contracted for about 300 pound a year of the Lord <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi>
Land, where, and when this <hi>argument</hi> was uſed,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40606:60"/>
that hee might bee favourably dealt with, and conſidered
in the <hi>purchace,</hi> for that <hi>hee was the man that brought the
Commonwealth ſo great an eſtate, and that but for him, the
Lord</hi> Craven <hi>had not been put into the Bill of Sale:</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
hee was favourably dealt withal: But Maſter
<hi>Baker,</hi> Surveyor General to the Truſtees, then repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the ſaid <hi>Captain Biſhop</hi> for ſo ſpeaking, the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
whereof was (it ſeems) like to prove ſo <hi>great,</hi> (as
well it might) that hee relinquiſht the contract; and
when (in the laſt Parliament but this) this contract was
laid to his charge, by the Committee of Parliament, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to hear the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> caſe, and hee urg'd to
anſwer, <hi>whether hee did contract or not:</hi> How (ſayes my
information) did hee <hi>prevaricate and ſhuffle</hi> with the
Committee, and <hi>put off an</hi> anſwer, till hee did ſee there
were thoſe preſent, that were ready to produce the
<hi>contracts</hi> out of the book, and then (to his <hi>ſhame,</hi> and
admiration of the Committee) hee did confeſs <hi>at laſt,</hi>
hee did contract, for a conſiderable part of the Lord
<hi>Cravens</hi> eſtate, but that hee had ſince that time <hi>declined</hi>
the ſame: So that for all your pretences of <hi>publike</hi> inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
you drove on a deſign of your own <hi>private;</hi> and if
the way had been honeſt, you might have done it, and
you need not have <hi>declin'd</hi> it; and to back this, and ſo an
end. Did not you write to a Gentleman, an <hi>acquaintance</hi>
of mine and yours, (one imployed for the publike) to
inform you of the quality and worth of a Mannour of
the <hi>Lord Cravens,</hi> call'd the Mannour of <hi>Hinton Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
in Sommerſet-ſhire; and did not you afterward (in
your Study) at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> tell him, <hi>that you inquired
after it, for that you expected that the Parliament ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
your good ſervice you had done for the State, in ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
the Lord</hi> Cravens <hi>eſtate?</hi> Or words to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>And now Sirs, you that are to give your judgement
upon <hi>George Biſhop,</hi> upon the whole matter, what ſay
you? Is <hi>George</hi> clear and innocent? Hath hee not <hi>uſed?</hi>
nor doth hee not <hi>know of any indirect proceedings in that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40606:61"/>
whole buſineſs of</hi> Craven <hi>and</hi> Faulconer? of which hee
makes ſuch a bold appeal to the Almighty: Say, is it
any matter, whether hee bee a <hi>Quaker</hi> or no, or what he
is? And if wee may judge of the <hi>conſcience,</hi> honeſty and
perfection of the reſt by him, may wee not <hi>conclude,</hi> as I
undertook to make good, <hi>That a man may bee as vile a
perſon as any under heaven, and yet a perfect Quaker?</hi> If
hee had <hi>repented</hi> of it, and (what in him lies) made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution)
it had been <hi>ſomewhat,</hi> I ſhould have ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
for who will upbraid a man with that, for which
hee hath <hi>repented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But hee ſtill (like a Quaker) juſtifies</hi> himſelf, <hi>as if he
had done no evil; and I eaſily perceive the</hi> bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h <hi>under
which hee</hi> hides <hi>himſelf, and thinks no body</hi> ſees <hi>him:
For after his</hi> proteſtation, <hi>hee ſayes,</hi> Hee has had a large time
of tryal, wherein hee hath neither wanted enemies for the
ſake of truth, nor they malice and opportunity to lay to his
charge, could they finde, or were there any thing to be found
againſt him.</p>
               <p>Simple fellow! I wonder hee could mannage ſo <hi>great</hi>
a buſineſs, with ſo <hi>little wit;</hi> becauſe the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi>
friends did not indict <hi>him,</hi> but <hi>Faulconer,</hi> therefore hee
<hi>ſillily</hi> concludes, they could finde or ſay nothing againſt
him. Doth hee not know, that it was for the Lord <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi>
advantage, to <hi>lay all</hi> the blame upon <hi>Faulconer,</hi> and
to charge him with the <hi>malice</hi> of it, (as well as with the
<hi>fact)</hi> that ſo they might <hi>convict</hi> him of <hi>perjury,</hi> which
being done, and hee to his <hi>conviction,</hi> having ſince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
it by his own <hi>confeſsion;</hi> and you having
<hi>confeſt</hi> ſo much, and taken ſo much upon your ſelf, to
clear <hi>him</hi> of the malice, (all which they knew not, till
you confeſt it.) Now all this, (as afore conſidered)
they know what to ſay to you: By the <hi>Law</hi> (it ſeemes,
and as the <hi>Judges</hi> gave their opinion) bare <hi>forſwearing</hi>
ones ſelf, doth not bring a man within the compaſs of
the Law againſt <hi>perjury,</hi> unleſs alſo it bee done <hi>maliciouſly</hi>
and wilfully.</p>
               <p>And now to deliver <hi>Faulconer</hi> from the crime and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40606:61"/>
of <hi>perjury, George</hi> (at the tryal) diſcovers the
<hi>riſe and ground</hi> of all this buſineſs, freeing <hi>Faulconer</hi>
(upon his own oath) of any <hi>intention</hi> of evil and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
againſt the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> (as knowing nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>him,</hi> that might render him <hi>culpable,</hi> or any way
ſequeſtrable, as you heard before) but <hi>George</hi> (having
conſulted with ſome body elſe) by handſome contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
and <hi>mannagement,</hi> hath brought it to <hi>this</hi> you now
ſee; and by this confeſſion of <hi>Georges</hi> at the <hi>tryal,</hi> and
<hi>Faulconers</hi> at his <hi>death-bed,</hi> it is now <hi>apparent</hi> by whom
it was begun, and effected, even by him, who (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee confeſſes) <hi>had the mannagement of the whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now if there were a <hi>Starchamber</hi> Court, or any
place of tryal for <hi>ſuch</hi> practiſes, they know whoſe <hi>eares</hi>
and <hi>eſtate</hi> to require in <hi>part</hi> of ſatisfaction. In the mean
time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let the <hi>world</hi> judge of your <hi>innocency: George,</hi> you
have a fair eſtate in <hi>land,</hi> plate great ſtore, rings and jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
and cabinets, and brave hangings, &amp;c. you can live
without the honeſt calling of a <hi>Brewer,</hi> which you could
not do before; you have not been a buſie <hi>Biſhop</hi> to no
purpoſe, you have your <hi>reward;</hi> but take heed, it bee
not <hi>in this life only:</hi> It may bee you may come to a reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning,
and give an account here for all theſe things, but
ſure <hi>hereafter:</hi> The preſent <hi>Parliament</hi> hath taken cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> cauſe, and it is to bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
they will proceed ſo <hi>juſtly</hi> and impartially, that the
guilt of <hi>injuſtice</hi> and oppreſſion, ſhall not lie at the doors
of the <hi>Parliament of England,</hi> and ſo become the ſin of the
<hi>Nation,</hi> and draw a curſe upon the <hi>whole,</hi> for the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a few. However, look you to your light within,
and let mee tell you thus much, if it do not <hi>ſtare</hi> you in
the face, and <hi>fright</hi> you, 'tis a ſign you are <hi>blinde</hi> and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened.
I was deſired to ask you, who did trepan <hi>Colonel
Andrewes</hi> into a deſign, for which hee loſt his <hi>life,</hi> when
as hee had given over all thoughts of <hi>engaging,</hi> till hee
was moved thereunto by a <hi>Trepanner,</hi> as hee declared
before his death? And who it was that <hi>trepan'd</hi> Sir <hi>John

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40606:62"/>
                  <hi>trepan Mr. Love,</hi> and ſome of that party? Theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are <hi>propoſed</hi> by thoſe who are no <hi>babes</hi> in the world,
and yet honeſt; and they ſay, this <hi>Biſhop</hi> can (if hee
will) give ſatisfaction in. You know <hi>George</hi> what theſe
things mean, and I know what the <hi>laſt</hi> means; and they
adviſe mee, to read a book concerning Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
and his death, written and pen'd by you, and they
ſay, <hi>it will give the reader further ſatisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you have dealt as <hi>craftily</hi> in the printing of <hi>this,</hi>
as of the <hi>former,</hi> printed ſo <hi>few,</hi> and kept, or given ſo at
your <hi>own</hi> diſpoſe, that I cannot get it; and I am not ſo
<hi>free</hi> to ſend to you for <hi>this,</hi> as the former, becauſe you
do not quote it <hi>againſt</hi> mee. But yet what I finde from
other pieces I have met with in this matter, I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to you, and the world, and this the rather, to
ſhew you what an <hi>hypocrite</hi> you are, in charging us <hi>Prieſts</hi>
(as in ſcorn you call us) with <hi>blood-thirſtineſs,</hi> and my
ſelf in particular, as in the title of your Pamphlet: you

                  </hi> I ſuppoſe, e're I

               </p>
               <p>And in the diſcourſe of this, I ſhall diſcover the <hi>ground</hi>

by you,</hi> That you were a zealous proſecutor of Mr. <hi>Love</hi>

                  </gap>hat you proſecuted

wherein you endeavour <hi>maliciouſly</hi> to kill him twice,
and the <hi>latter,</hi> with more cruelty than the <hi>former,</hi> kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his good <hi>name,</hi> and (what in you lies) making him

to <hi>undervalue,</hi> debaſe, and diſparage that <hi>comfort</hi> and

and this upon ſeveral accounts, which I will not <hi>recount,</hi>
to avoid tediouſneſs, one <hi>only</hi> I'le mention, to ſhew your
ſpirit of <hi>envy</hi> and bitterneſs, it is the Animadverſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the firſt Section, page 34. <hi>Mr. Love,</hi> (ſay you) <hi>it's
more than probable, was not only vehemently exhorted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
importuned, but even ſolemnly, by all the ſacred
intereſts of high Presbytery, conjured by his Clergie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
to die like a valiant and reſolute Champion of the
cauſe, and not to bewray the leaſt grudging of any fear or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
for any thing hee had acted upon the ſervice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
leſt it ſhould bee ſaid of Presbytery, her glory was
ſtained and betrayed by the cowardiſe of her firſt-born.</hi> And
page 38. <hi>Here wee have the ſecond part of the Theatrical
flouriſhes of Mr.</hi> Loves <hi>confidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much might bee animadverted, but I forbear; you
have a ſtrange ſpirit, that his <hi>comforts and confidence in God,</hi>
trouble you. And then you go on to charge <hi>him</hi> with
<hi>hypocriſie</hi> and <hi>lying,</hi> and other baſe imputations all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
beſpattering, and beſpotting, and ſullying him (as
you can) even to his laſt. I know what <hi>flight</hi> touches
of charity you have now and then, and at the <hi>cloſe</hi> of
that Pamphlet, which are inconſiſtent, with that you had
<hi>charged</hi> him before, as that hee acted the part of a moſt
unchriſtian <hi>Calumniator,</hi> upon the Scaffold, <hi>in the very
approaches of death,</hi> page 38. But page 46. you moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianly

                  </gap>e, whereas in purging himſelf (hee means Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Love)</hi> from the aſperſion of lying, hee ſaith thus,
<hi>I hope you will believe a dying man, who dare not look God
in the face, with a lie in his mouth;</hi> intimating (ſay you)
as if his being ready to die, was a <hi>bridle</hi> in his lips, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
him from <hi>lying:</hi> The truth is, (according to that
principle of his, that <hi>hee whoever once truly believed, can
never by any ſin or wickedneſs whatſoever, looſe the love
and favour of God:</hi> His being ready to die in conjunction,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40606:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with a perſwaſion of his Saintſhip, ſhould rather bee a
temptation upon him, to lie, or commit any other wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe,
than an ingagement upon him to <hi>refrain</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>I have done with that; but I pray, that you may finde
<hi>more</hi> favour and mercy from <hi>God,</hi> than hee found from
you; and to that end, let him grant you grace to <hi>repent</hi>
of theſe ſpightful and moſt cruel proſecutions. As for
your Proſecutions of him in his <hi>life,</hi> and of his <hi>tryal,</hi> I
ſhall not enter upon the ſtory of, although I have relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of it, it would prove too large an undertaking; nor
will I inſiſt upon your <hi>rotten</hi> and unſavoury language of
the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> whom in ſcorn you call his
<hi>Clergie companions,</hi> you were fairly diſpoſed for <hi>quaking</hi>

and do therefore endeavour to extenuate it from

lay before the Reader; and thus you give it forth,</hi> The
time when the Parliament gave judgement upon his estate,
<hi>(that's right, not upon his perſon, that had not offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)</hi>
was, when the Commonwealth was deeply imbroil'd in
wars, and deſignes lay every where to blow up this Nation in
all parts thereof; their Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Scots
drawn into the field after their rout at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> ready to
ſerve the deſperate, and great deſignes and conſpiracies laid
by <hi>Mr. Love,</hi> thoſe of the Presbyterie and the Kings Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
then ripe and readie to break forth in all parts, all of
which were the effects of that Treatie at <hi>Breda,</hi> where the
Lord <hi>Craven</hi> was often with the King, and his Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
<hi>(But doth any one perſon ſo much as ſay, that hee
came to treat, or did treat? not one)</hi> and aſſiſting his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40606:63"/>
in their Petition for relief, to bee in a capacitie to ſerve
him; <hi>(which you ſee was proved to bee a lye)</hi> and ſome
of whom ſerved in thoſe deſignes, and otherwiſe, and of
which the Parliament were ſenſible, <hi>(what was this to the
Lord</hi> Craven) and the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> had manifested to
moſt that converſed with him, his diſaffection to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Supreme Authoritie, <hi>(no ſuch thing is charg'd
againſt him)</hi> in ſuch times and caſes, have many conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
as the reaſon of their actions, which thoſe who are
without doors, neither know, nor apprehend, nor are to take
upon them ſo to do. <hi>Thus hee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The language in the <hi>laſt</hi> part of it, is <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> and
incoherent, a kinde of non-ſenſe; but this clearly is his
meaning, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the times being dangerous, (as hee
deſcribes them) have many conſiderations and reaſons
to ſequeſter the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> eſtate, which thoſe who
are not his Judges, <hi>(no nor hee himſelf) are to know or
apprehend, nor muſt enquire into.</hi> In plain Engliſh, the
Lord <hi>Craven</hi> muſt loſe his eſtate, and none muſt ask a
reaſon, why? Are not theſe ſweet doings? As hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſayes in another caſe, page 19.</p>
               <p>But to go on with the matter of Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> Mr. <hi>Love</hi>
and the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> are deſigning the Nations <hi>ruine,</hi> ſayes
<hi>George,</hi> if you may bee believed; and how honeſt you
are, even in your moſt <hi>ſerious</hi> proteſtations and appeals
to <hi>God,</hi> appears already. But if you <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> (and that's
enough with you) that Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> or the Presbytery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
the Nations <hi>ruine,</hi> you will bee ſure (right or
wrong) to accompliſh theſe. I have heard ſay hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the <hi>Marches in Wales,</hi> that a cauſe there, did
ſeldome fail for want of <hi>proſecution,</hi> and good witneſſes;
you were a notable man to make an agent there; well,
or ill fare him, who if a cauſe bee not good, can make it
ſo: I ſhall not (as I ſaid) ingage to the <hi>whole</hi> of your
proſecution againſt him, I ſhall only notifie what I finde
<hi>concerning your ſelf,</hi> in a book written and publiſhed by
Mr. <hi>Love himſelf,</hi> which (in the cloſe) hee ſayes, was
finiſhed <hi>the laſt day but one before his death;</hi> and at ſuch a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40606:64"/>
time (what every you ſay) men are moſt ſerious, and
to bee believed. The title of it thus, <hi>A clear and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vindication of the principles and practices of me</hi> Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which book, hee ſayes, hee writ for the
vindication of his <hi>name,</hi> from thoſe <hi>obloquies</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
which by the <hi>Sons of Slander</hi> were caſt upon
him, (was not this you <hi>George?)</hi> who would fain have
his <hi>name</hi> to bee buried, and rot <hi>above ground,</hi> before
his friends could bury his body under ground.</p>
               <p>In this book of his, hee <hi>complains,</hi> that whereas at
his <hi>Tryal,</hi> hee had a Notary to write for him, they took
away <hi>all</hi> the books from him, ſo that <hi>nothing</hi> might
come to <hi>publick view,</hi> but with what <hi>additions</hi> or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
they pleaſe, to his greater diſadvantage. But
hee ſayes, his hope is, that ſome <hi>faithful</hi> pen or other,
hath writ his defence, and the Witneſſes depoſitions,
which is done; and I have, and according to <hi>them</hi> hee
deſires, that his <hi>innocency</hi> bee judged, by indifferent,
and <hi>unprejudicated</hi> men; it contains ſeventeen ſheets,
very large paper, and very ſmall print; I ſhall not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with ought thereof, I ſhall only give in what I have
from Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> own book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In page 36. hee deſires his Readers, that if</hi> other
ſlanders <hi>(for hee had anſwer'd and wip'd off many)</hi>
ſhould be caſt upon him, that they would have ſo much cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
not to believe reports raiſed upon him, when hee ſhall
bee ſilent in the grave, and not able to ſpeak in his own vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And page 37. hee ſayes,</hi> 'Tis very likelie that they
<hi>(his Proſecutors)</hi> will not publiſh the depoſitions of the
Witneſſes in Court, but the private examinations taken
from them in private, and patcht together by Maſter <hi>S.</hi>
and <hi>Captain Biſhop.</hi> They were not aſhamed <hi>(ſayes
hee)</hi> to produce them, and read them in open Court. <hi>And
hee ſayes,</hi> ſome of the Witneſſes had ſo much h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>neſty left,
as to diſavow them in open Court; and therefore <hi>(ſayes
hee)</hi> believe nothing but what was ſworn in open Court,
nor all that neither, for ſome of the Witneſſes ſwore falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40606:64"/>
as <hi>(ſayes hee)</hi> I made appeare in my defence. <hi>In
the ſame page,</hi> I deſire you <hi>(ſayes hee)</hi> to take notice,
that there is a lying Pamphlet put forth, entituled, <hi>A
ſhort Plea for the Commonwealth:</hi> In which there are
many groſs lies, eſpecially in things which relate to mee,
<hi>(and which hee himſelfe is beſt able to ſpeak to.)
Hee ſayes there further, it is not</hi> fit <hi>for him to enter
the liſts with him; It becomes not, ſayes hee, a</hi> dying
man <hi>to write of controverſies, which will beget</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute;
<hi>therefore, ſayes hee, I ſhall not anſwer the
book, (though I could eaſily do it) but only ſum up
the many lyes hee relates, concerning mee. Thus
hee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And page 39. hee ſayes, hee ſuppoſes <hi>Captain Biſhop
writ that lying book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then Maſter <hi>Love</hi> goes on, reckoning up his lyes
in that book, and ſhewes wherein, and in the Margin,
writes the <hi>firſt</hi> lye.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> lye, and ſo on to the <hi>eleventh</hi> lye; It will
not bee to any purpoſe to ſet down the <hi>particulars,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
my Reader hath not the book, whereby to judge
of the <hi>truth</hi> or falſhood; I ſhall therefore content my
ſelf, to give you what <hi>obſervations</hi> Mr. <hi>Love</hi> makes upon
the <hi>man,</hi> and his lying <hi>ſtories.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In one place hee ſayes, that if <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſhould name the
perſon that ſhould ſay the thing, (there mentioned) <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one that heard the tryal, would cry out ſhame upon him,</hi>
(viz.) Biſhop, <hi>for telling ſuch a lye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Hee ſayes, another
is a <hi>groſs</hi> lye. And another thing hee charges him
with, is a <hi>loud</hi> lye; and ſayes, <hi>It is well there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
witneſſes to contradict him:</hi> And ſurely (ſayes hee)
if the Author of this book had not <hi>caſt off all feare of
God, and regard to the good name of his Brother, hee
could not bee ſo impudent,</hi> as to affirme what hee
did.</p>
               <p>To another hee ſayes, 'tis <hi>notoriouſly</hi> falſe, and <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably</hi>
falſe; and that although hee was <hi>not aſham'd</hi> to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſay of him, as hee did in the <hi>general,</hi> yet hee durſt not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40606:65"/>
inſtance in <hi>any particular,</hi> nor (ſayes hee) will any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in my life time, whilſt I can anſwer for my
ſelf.</p>
               <p>To another (hee ſayes) Hee that will bee ſo <hi>ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
to falſifie my Petitions,</hi> (which are made ſo viſible)
will not bee aſhamed to <hi>bely my words:</hi> Where hee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſayes, hee <hi>(Biſhop)</hi> charged him, that Maſter <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy</hi>
inſtructed him to ſpeak as hee did; and that it
was, <hi>that Maſter</hi> Calamies <hi>good tricks might not come to
light;</hi> both which, together with what hee charged him
before, hee ſayes, are <hi>very falſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To another, hee ſayes, hee <hi>wonders</hi> the man is not
<hi>aſham'd,</hi> to faſten that upon him, which hee did. And
again, hee ſayes, if this man (meaning <hi>Biſhop)</hi> hath
<hi>belied others</hi> in his book, (whom hee names) <hi>as hee
hath done mee, there is not one true Page in all his book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to the eleventh lye, thus; If this man were not
an <hi>Athieſt,</hi> or an <hi>Antiſcripturiſt,</hi> the example of <hi>Anani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
and <hi>Saphira</hi> might make him tremble, <hi>lest hee ſhould
bee ſtricken down dead, with a lye in his mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again, this <hi>falſe and deceitful man,</hi> would make
the world believe, that this were proved againſt mee;
and then concludes this matter thus, <hi>Theſe, and many other
falſhoods might bee found in this book,</hi> if I ſhould make a
through ſearch into it: Hee calls it (ſayes hee) a <hi>ſhort
Plea,</hi> but I may call it, <hi>a long lye:</hi> And 'tis not, ſayes
hee, for the honour of the <hi>preſent Government,</hi> to have
a <hi>common lyar</hi> to bee a Pleader for their <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And amongſt all theſe lyes, (thus generally hinted)
I have reſerved one in <hi>ſpecial,</hi> wherein Mr. <hi>Love</hi> charges
him not (onely with <hi>lying)</hi> but alſo with <hi>forgery,</hi>
which hee brings in thus, page 38. <hi>And becauſe I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
about my examination, before the Committees, and
may bee more abuſed after I am dead,</hi> therefore I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to <hi>diſcover</hi> that <hi>jugling and baſeneſs</hi> of Mr. <hi>S.</hi>
and <hi>Capt. Biſhop,</hi> about my examination, <hi>which I thought
never to have made publick.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:40606:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Whiles I was examined (ſayes hee) before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
<hi>that pragmatical fellow, Captain</hi> Biſhop, (who I
ſuppoſe wrote this lying book) <hi>did put in ſix or eight</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note>
                  <hi>lines into my examination, which I never ſaid;</hi> hee ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that I would bee ſo meal-mouth'd, as not to read
it, or to put my hand to his <hi>forgery,</hi> without any more
ado; but I did (to his ſhame) <hi>make him blot out, at
leaſt, ſix lines in my examination,</hi> which was but very
ſhort. Some of the Committee did ingeniouſly ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
that <hi>I did not ſpeak ſuch words as Captain</hi> Biſhop
did put in: By his <hi>abuſe</hi> of mee, who would not bee <hi>abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>
by him, I cannot but think, <hi>how hee injured other
men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee goes on, I did refuſe to put my hand to it, ſeeing
I was abuſed by <hi>Captain Biſhop;</hi> but told them, if they
would give mee a <hi>Copy</hi> of it, I would ſubſcribe my <hi>hand;</hi>
but they denied mee a copy, which made mee ſuſpect,
they did not intend to deal <hi>fairly</hi> with mee, as I found
true after: And then goes on, to ſhew <hi>wherein,</hi> and that
to <hi>their</hi> conviction, and concludes thence thus; <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I beſeech the Reader not to believe any thing that ſhall
come forth, either pretended to bee my examination, or the
examinations of other men againſt mee;</hi> they are but the
<hi>forgeries</hi> and <hi>contrivements</hi> of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and <hi>Captain Biſhop.</hi>
And well might M. <hi>Love</hi> think how this <hi>Biſhop</hi> injured o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, and that in the like kinde.</p>
               <p>I have one <hi>inſtance</hi> more, under the hand of a godly,
reverent, and faithful <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> now being
well known to moſt of the Inhabitants of this <hi>City,</hi> and
many in <hi>London,</hi> ſo to bee, who writes to mee, that
being to bee <hi>queſtioned</hi> about Maſter <hi>Loves</hi> buſineſſe (as
hee was, and impriſoned) <hi>Biſhop</hi> (ſayes hee) was <hi>Clerk
to the Committee</hi> of Examinations, and wrote down <hi>all</hi>
that I ſaid; <hi>and added divers things, thereby endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to inſware mee;</hi> for which I ſharply reproved him,
telling him, that I knew his <hi>birth</hi> and breeding, and
therefore I did <hi>ſcorn</hi> to bee examined by <hi>ſuch a one as hee
was;</hi> at which, both hee and the Committee were much
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40606:66"/>
                  <hi>offended,</hi> threatning to uſe much <hi>ſeverity</hi> againſt me, but
the Lord <hi>reſtrained</hi> them.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>George</hi> ſay, Are not you a blood-ſucker?
Were not the <hi>lives</hi> of theſe men at the ſtake? Was not
one of them <hi>actually</hi> put to death? I'le ſay nothing of
the <hi>man,</hi> I need not, hee was known well enough in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
his death is bewail'd by <hi>thouſands,</hi> and his name

bluſhing? Is there any wickedneſſe ſo great, that ſuch a one
may not bee well conceived to bee ready to act? Is ſuch a
one a Miniſter of the Goſpel? Words need not further to
expreſſe ſuch an act, which in its very face is ſo manifeſtly
wicked and abominable, a wickedneſſe not found in the Roll
of thoſe evils, which the Apoſtle mentions ſhould make the

ſome other of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were dealt withal, as <hi>Love</hi> was,
it would never bee <hi>well?</hi> I hope I ſhall one day get that
book of yours, which you writ againſt him (mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

who have ſeen it; tell mee, it moſt fully ſets forth the
fierceneſs, and bitterneſs of your ſpirit, not only againſt
<hi>him,</hi> but that you ſhew your <hi>rancour</hi> and malice therein,
againſt many of the ſervants of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe names are
yet precious in the Churches, and the memory of whom
will <hi>live,</hi> when your name ſhall rot and <hi>periſh;</hi> or if it bee
mentioned or remembred, it ſhall bee with <hi>abhorrence</hi>
and deteſtation, as infamous as poor <hi>Faulconers</hi> is. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but <hi>remind</hi> that paſſage of yours in your <hi>Throne,</hi> page
34. where, becauſe I ſaid the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> had their ſpots
<hi>and failings,</hi> you ſay, they are no Magiſtrates of <hi>God,</hi> but
men of <hi>ſin,</hi> and the <hi>born of the devil:</hi> If ſpots and <hi>fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
do (in your judgement) render them <hi>thus,</hi> Oh!
what are you? mind that <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. beg. <hi>Therefore thou art
inexcuſeable, O man, whoſoever thou art</hi> (Jew or Gentile,
Ranter, or Quaker) <hi>that judgeſt; for wherein thou judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf; for thou that judgeſt
doſt the ſame things.</hi> (nay, infinitely worſe) <hi>But wee are
ſure the Judgement of God is (according to truth) against
them which commit ſuch things; and thinkeſt thou this, O
man, that judgeſt them who do ſuch things, and doeſt the
ſame, that thou ſhalt eſcape the Judgement of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Reader, in this poor <hi>wretch,</hi> you ſee what a <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>

that hee will not <hi>then</hi> commit? So <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. ver. 24. to the

               <p>And ſee alſo, how the <hi>Lord</hi> doth punish hatred and
<hi>contempt</hi> of his Miniſtry and ſervants, and <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> from
the truth, with <hi>hardneſſe</hi> of heart, and <hi>blindneſſe</hi> of mind,
giving them over to believe <hi>lyes, 2 Theſ.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12.
What a <hi>ſottiſh</hi> piece is this poor man become, to turn

(Countryman) come, there is hope in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> concerning
this thing, there is ſtill <hi>balm in Gilead;</hi> the blood of <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> shed at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (though above ſixteen hundred
years ago) is as efficacious, as <hi>prevalent,</hi> as ever. Come
man, leave <hi>quaking,</hi> don't trample upon, and deſpiſe the

and pray to God, perhaps the thoughts of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy heart,</hi>
(and the wickedneſs of thy <hi>hands,</hi> and the blaſphemies of
thy <hi>pen and tongue) may bee forgiven thee.</hi> Don't deſpiſe
the riches of <hi>Gods goodneſs,</hi> and forbearance, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering
towards thee; know, that <hi>the goodneſſe of God</hi>
(in this patience of his, in not cutting thee off) <hi>is to lead
thee to repentance.</hi> Conſider friend, there is a day coming,
wherein the <hi>Lord will bring to light the hidden things of
darkneſs,</hi> and will make manifeſt all ſecret <hi>plots,</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
and under-hand counſels; Repent, whiles 'tis
called <hi>to day,</hi> leſt thy heart bee more and <hi>more</hi> hardened,
through the deceitfulneſs of ſin; treaſure not up <hi>wrath</hi>
by impenitence, and hardneſs of heart; one <hi>true</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
tear, will avail more <hi>now,</hi> than <hi>millions</hi> of yellings
and howlings <hi>then;</hi> our <hi>Jeſus</hi> is able to ſave <hi>perfectly,</hi> and
to the uttermoſt, all thoſe who come unto the Father
through him, meet him whom thou ſlighteſt, and make
him thy friend.</p>
               <p>And for a <hi>cloſe,</hi> know and conſider, that if you go on
in ſin <hi>wilfully and impenitently,</hi> (after you have received
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40606:67"/>
the knowledge of the truth) and that you deſpiſe the
blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there remains no <hi>more ſacrifice</hi> for ſin,
but a <hi>fearful looking for of judgement,</hi> and of fierce indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which shall <hi>devoure</hi> the adverſaries. And now
<hi>from henceforth,</hi> let none of theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> trouble mee,
I have done with this generation; but if they will bee
<hi>troubling,</hi> let them know, <hi>I will not bee troubled:</hi> And as
for any further anſwers, replies, contendings, or deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
with them, or him, being well <hi>aſſured</hi> that my
ground work (on which my diſcourſe and <hi>diſcovery</hi> is
founded) will ſtand <hi>firm:</hi> I declare this, as my <hi>Coronis,</hi>
my farewel to <hi>Quakeriſme:</hi> As for their <hi>doctrines,</hi> or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
(in this, or any other of their Pamphlets) I think
them not worth the <hi>reading</hi> (much leſs the anſwering)
by any <hi>ſerious</hi> Chriſtian, eſpecially that hath <hi>publick</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
indeed, not of <hi>any</hi> one that hath ought elſe to
do, but to make a <hi>long</hi> voyage to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> to fetch only
<hi>Apes and Peacocks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conclude therefore with holy <hi>Auguſtine, Tales judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

what I have written, to bee ſpoken <hi>againſt;</hi> thoſe things
(which being matter of <hi>fact)</hi> have clear <hi>teſtimonies,</hi> and
(being matters of <hi>doctrine)</hi> have clear arguments and

to agitate them <hi>alwayes,</hi> upon the cavils of <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
