            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the holy Scriptures had
not told us, that <hi>Rebellion</hi>
was as the sin of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
we have had cause
enough to believe it;
when in the evil days of
our last twenty years unhappy Wars and
Confusions, we have seen so very much
<pb facs="tcp:48997:3"/>
of the folly and madness of that <hi>Soul,</hi> as
well as Kingdom <hi>Destroying-sin,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
all that traded therein to have met
with <hi>Circes,</hi> &amp; the fate of <hi>Vlysses</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and to have been almost transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
into Swine, who muzling in the
earth, and looking for some filth agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their bruitish appetite and diet,
can without any remorse or pity of better
things, turn and overturn, spoyle and
trample upon the fairest flowers; and
are at the best no otherwise to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then as men bewitched, or hugely mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by their own <hi>Fancies,</hi> and arrived to a
degree beyond Fanatiques, and as near
unto madness as the most outragious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
of <hi>Bedlam:</hi> when as in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the long and unhappy Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the year 1641. it was their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Out-cry, that the Laws of <hi>England</hi>
were their Birth-right, and they should
be most miserable if they did not enjoy
them; could after that, without any just
cause, take Arms to defend and preserve
them; and employ themselves, their
Wives and Children in a procession or
<pb facs="tcp:48997:3"/>
               <hi>Pageant,</hi> to dig and make Out-works
and Fortifications about the City of
<hi>London,</hi> to secure their Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
when in effect they did but
keep them out; and after that, engage
themselves, and as many as they could
enforce unto it by an illegal League and
<hi>Covenant</hi> to maintain them, and yet after
the Kings <hi>Murther,</hi> by that rebellious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
and the consequence of it, and
a Declaration made and published by
those that called themselves a <hi>Parliament,</hi>
that those Laws were most suitable to the
good and constitution of the Nation,
could in the <hi>Hirecano</hi> of their pretended
Reformation of the same Laws, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
and driven on by a <hi>Mechanick</hi>
party that did not understand them, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
all they could to subvert and
take away those very Laws, as they
had done the Lives of many, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
of most of those of the Kings party;
who really and not hypocritically fought
for them and their King, and adventured
all they had in it; and in that furious,
ignorant, and <hi>self-seeking</hi> humour of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48997:4"/>
could like nothing but what
came out of their own groundless imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
the Discipline and Orders of the
Church were looked upon as <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;</hi>
the Laws were pretended to be
chargeable, dilatory and <hi>Antichristian;</hi>
the equitable sense of Laws and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
of their own framing and picking
out, were more (as they said) to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
then the better or learned Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of them: the inward spirit and
intentions of men were to be the Rule of
all our Justice and Actions: old Customs
and Constitutions were to pass away, and
be laid by, and the new Inventions and
Notions acted (as they foolishly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
by a more <hi>Divine Light,</hi> were to
take place, and rule in the stead of them.
In order whereunto, the common people
were taught in all their discourses to make
that which before they had taken so much
care of, to be as a By-word or Reproach;
the Law it self must be called a <hi>Cheat;</hi> and
the Lawyers,<note place="margin">Constitut. Othoboni in Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</note> whom the Heathen could
stile <hi>Sacerdotes Justitiae,</hi> and our Christian
Fore-fathers <hi>Laudabile genus hominum qui
<pb facs="tcp:48997:4"/>
in Campo Justiciae tanquam Athletae militant,</hi>
so hated and threatned, (except at such
times as they had need of them) as it was
some danger to wear a Gown; and one
of their mighty Mechanick Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
threatned to pull off their Gowns,
and hang them up in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi>
amongst the <hi>Scotch</hi> Colours. The
Judges were many times threatned to
be pulled out of the Courts, and
from their Tribunals; the <hi>Innes of Court,</hi>
the <hi>Nurseries</hi> of the Law, designed to
be turned into <hi>Brew-houses,</hi> Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or Garisons, and places for the
quartering of their <hi>Rabbi Red-coat souldiers.</hi>
That which was in our Law-books of
<hi>French</hi> or <hi>Latine,</hi> must be translated, and
the Writs, Process and Pleadings put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>English;</hi> and they that knew not right
reason, the Original and Foundation of
all Laws, nor the way or method of it,
would like no Laws further then their
vulgar and shallow understandings could
come up unto it: and where they might
or could reach it, found it to be no loss
unto themselves to pull down old Laws
<pb facs="tcp:48997:5"/>
and Constitutions, to the end they might
be gainers by the invention of setting up
new. Every thing but themselves were
Grievances: the Moral and Judicial Laws
of <hi>Moses,</hi> were commended and desired
to be introduced by some, and those of
<hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> by others, that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
not long before as much adored
by a factious and rebellious part of the
people, as the Rebel-<hi>Israelites</hi> did
their <hi>Golden Calf;</hi> when nothing but the
Parliament was to be the <hi>standard</hi> of their
Religion and Conscience: now seemed
unto them not to be well constituted, or
in an equal frame or <hi>Balance,</hi> but would
be much better if the <hi>Venetian Balloting-Box</hi>
were cast in amongst them, the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Officers and Commanders, many of
whom could not well read <hi>English,</hi> and
worse write it, busying themselves in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and other Heathen
Authors translated into <hi>English;</hi> and not
well observing the many mutinies, sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
dangerous and trouble some altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and changes, which the people of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
&amp; <hi>Rome</hi> had sadly experimented and
<pb facs="tcp:48997:5"/>
dearly paid for, and how those levelling
humours by necessity as well as fate fell
afterwards into the better state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Monarchy, thought nothing so
good and profitable for the good of the
people and of themselves (more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally)
then to advance and increase the
<hi>Changes</hi> of Government, which was most
commonly cast into a frame and designe
of their own interests. Every common
Souldier thought himself as wise and as
fit to frame a Commonwealth, as <hi>Lycurgus</hi>
or <hi>Solon;</hi> and pretended that their business
was not only to fight, but to be <hi>Legislators</hi>
and <hi>Superintendents</hi> of our Parliaments as
well as Laws, they were to bind and limit
them (to their silly as well as <hi>knavish</hi>)
contrivances. The Lands of the Crown,
Church and Loyal party, were to be a
part of their Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> and
they were to make what further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
they could in the altering of
Laws and Customes, hitherto, and
through many Ages, so very much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved:
put down the old Offices and
Employments, and erect new; and the
<pb facs="tcp:48997:6"/>
Citizens and men of Trade finding fault
with all but the multiplyed Deceits and
<hi>Knaveries</hi> of their own Trades; which
with the adulterating and enhauncing of
all Manufactures and Commodities, have
not onely lost and spoiled our Trade in
forreign parts, but do by the connivence
of their Companies or Mysteries, and
for want of a due execution of Laws, and
Regulations of Falshoods, yearly cozen
and cheat the people at home, as much
as amounts to some Millions of Sterling-money,
or a great deal more then doubles
our Taxes, and not understanding the
right reason, just ends and intentions of
our Laws, nor distinguishing betwixt the
right use and abuse of Laws, of the which
onely the <hi>Cozening</hi> part of the people are
guilty, neither contented to have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so much as they had done by the Law
and its residence at <hi>London,</hi> could not
be satisfied unless they could pull it
all in pieces, and make a Merchandize of
it; and believed a Citizen in a <hi>Committee</hi>

the <hi>Tinder</hi> to the greatest of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
<pb facs="tcp:48997:6"/>
to be as grand a <hi>States-man</hi> as the
late Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> or as if he had been
bound Apprentice to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and served
out his time in the compiling of his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs:</hi>
and their multiplying costly Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
at 6 <hi>s.</hi> and 8 <hi>d.</hi> or ten shillings a piece
for a few lines, to be as great a blessing
and refreshing to the people, as the land
of <hi>Promise</hi> was to those that had endured
a forty years tedious journey thorow the
wilderness; and when as too many of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were, and are by their tricks of
Trade, the grand &amp; superlative grievances
of the Kingdome, could at the same time
raise their false and groundless clamours
and scandals against the King, the Church,
and the Laws; because he would not quit
his Regalities, and suffer a rebellious and
prevailing part of the people to enslave
the residue: and our Religion and Laws
did forbid it. In the midst of which Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies,
whilst the Trades-men did drive on
the soldiers, many of whom had been their
Run-a-gate or Cast-off Apprentices; and
the soldiers were driven on and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by some Lecturers, &amp; men of <hi>extempore</hi>

Non-sense rather then Divinity; and the
<hi>Devil</hi> leading them with his new lights,
and false expositions of Scripture, and a
gaining ungodly part of the people were
busie in plundering and oppressing the
loyal, honest, small and remaining part
of them, and used our excellent Laws
and Customes as the <hi>Bactrians</hi> are said to
do by their Parents when they are sick or
aged, and set their <hi>Canes Sepulchrales,</hi> dogs
kept on purpose to tear and devour them:
it would have been a wonder how any of
the most refined <hi>Right Reason</hi> or Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our Laws, could rest in quiet,
when the Graves of some of our <hi>British</hi>
and <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings were in a most unchristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
and barbarous manner opened and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed,
and their dust and bones cast
into the Air and High-ways, and the Book
of God it self suffered a kinde of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome,
in their suspecting the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and covering the sense and meaning
thereof with ridiculous Notions, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
Interpretations.</p>
            <p>Or that a very innocent and legal part
of the Kings Revenue so well employed
<pb facs="tcp:48997:7"/>
in the support and administration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
should escape a disturbance: and
therefore the Fines which were usually, &amp;
through many past Centuries and Ages,
paid in Chancery upon all Original Writs
in personal Actions, wherein the debt or
damages demanded exceeded <hi>forty pounds,</hi>
must have its share in the suffering under
those grand and continued persecutions of
<hi>Truth, Loyaly</hi> and <hi>Right Reason,</hi> and be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by an Act of a Factious part of the
people, supposing themselves to be the
Commons of <hi>England,</hi> assembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and sacrificed but to the pretended
Liberties of the people, to the intent to
leave them as little as they could of their
Liberties in greater matters: which being
with other of our good Laws &amp; Customs,
worried and cryed down by the causless
out-cries and clamors of those that better
understood their own evil purposes &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
in it, then the Original institution,

<pb facs="tcp:48997:8"/>
the <hi>Cicatrices</hi> and skars of the wounds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they formerly languished; and
as the imagination being once hurt is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
ever after free from those melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicque

so did those of a necessity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
our Laws, or of supposed evils or
grievances in them, beget an ill opinion in
the minds of the <hi>people,</hi> where yet it sticks
so much, as some well-meaning and good
men are not so willing as they should be
to abandon the causless suspitions and
prejudices which they had entertained of
them: and those illusions, and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately-received

kept up in too many the humour of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to overthrow those and many
other of our good Laws &amp; Constitutions;
which if Understanding or Knowledge

will appear to deserve a better usage.</p>
            <p>The more then ordinary misapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
whereof, by those that build upon no

its Legal, Original and Right Use, hath
summoned my Duty to our Soveraign and

his Laws to hinder what I may the unjust
Censures and ill-advisedness of some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who are as ready to cast away their
own good, as those who to avoid a little
cold which their delicacy and a surfeit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
peace and plenty cannot perswade
them to endure, can think it to be no small
part of prudence to tear up and burn the
planks of the Ship wherein they are sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at Sea, and far from the Shore, and run
the inevitable hazard of perishing by the
fury of a cooler Element; and that I might
satisfie such as mislike the payment of
Fines in Chancery upon some Original
Writs, and that it hath for many Ages
past been a most Legal and useful part of
the Crown-Revenue, without any the
least of grievance to the people, or our
so often reiterated <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or any
other our Laws or Liberties; and shew
them that the usefulness and Legality of
it, is not taken away, or diminished, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a part of it is paid, or goeth to the
support of the Lord <hi>Chancellour</hi> or Lord

by moderation and equity the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and justice of the Laws, many times
too unconscionably made use of, or put
in execution by the people, one upon the
other, who are to be enforced and kept
from being over-severe, or taking unjust
advantages one upon another, which hath
taught the most of Nations to look upon
that high and superlative Officer of <hi>State</hi>
as greatly necessary; and to give him
allowances becoming so great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
a charge and employment: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as the very thrifty and prudent
Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the use and dignity of that great
Officer in most of the Kingdomes and
Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the necessity of his
honourable support, do think it requisite
to allow their <hi>gran Cancelliero</hi> a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
out of the Publick stock.</p>
            <p>And that it cannot be a grievance that
the <hi>Master of the Rolls,</hi> and Cursistors in
<hi>Chancery,</hi> are allowed some part of that
small part of the Kings Revenue for their
<pb facs="tcp:48997:9"/>
support and encouragement, which would
be more chargeable to the people, and be
more unequal, and not consist so well with
the Rules of Justice, if it should be raised by
any other way, or contrivancce, to give
them a recompence proportioned to their
cares and labours.</p>

who in the times of our unhappy Wars and

that for our <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it self, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in the ninth year of the Reign of King <hi>H.</hi> 3.
and wherein <hi>nulli vendemus Justitiam</hi> is provided
and ordained, the people of <hi>England</hi> did give to the
King the <hi>fifteenth part</hi> of all their Moveables: that
in the levying of Fines for common assurance, there
is and hath been anciently a <hi>Dat. Domino Regi,</hi> mony
given or paid to the King <hi>pro licentia concordandi,</hi>
in the Court of Common Pleas at <hi>Westminster:</hi> that
for private Acts of Parliament at this day as well
as heretofore, Fees to the Speaker of the House of
<hi>Commons,</hi> and the Clerks thereof, are usually paid
without any sale of Justice, or contradiction sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of that branch of <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> that in the
Statute of 18 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and the Oath thereupon given
to the Judges, that they <hi>shall take no gift or reward,</hi>
nor <hi>any Fee of any person,</hi> there is an exception, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be meat, drink, or of small value.</p>
            <p>For by the same reason that Fines upon some
Original Writs, (for they are but upon some few)
are supposed to be a selling of Justice, the <hi>Cursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi>
Fees ordained by the Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi>
the second, in <hi>anno 13. E.</hi> 1. to be but a penny
for every Writ, which the price of victuals and
way of livelyhood (which is now a great deal more
then formerly) considered, amounts unto as much
as <hi>ten pence</hi> for every Writ; and will not now
buy as it would do then, the <hi>sixtieth</hi> part of an Ox,
which was then valued but at <hi>five</hi> shillings: and
the Fees of the Virgers, and the <hi>Chyrographer</hi> in the
Court of Common Pleas, and all those many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fees ordained by Act of Parliament, would
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48997:18"/>
be (as they are not) a selling of Justice, and a
breach of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and unwarrantable.</p>
            <p>And howsoever those due and warrantable Fees
which are paid to Clerks and Officers of Courts,
and the Fines which are paid upon Original
Writs, (excusing greater Fees to the <hi>Cursistors,</hi>
who could not otherwise be contented with a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Fee of six pence for the writing of every Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Writ) cannot bear any proportion or resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of a Bribe, or of the Kings or any of his
Judges selling of Justice: and if it did (as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not)
being always paid by the Plaintiff, must then
conclude that all Plaintiffs must of necessity never
or seldome fail of their designes or recovery;
which dayly experience manifestly contradicteth,
nor can possibly be so understood, whenas in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Action the Defendants do pay Fees as well as
the Plaintiffs.</p>
            <p>Neither can it be any breach of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
or injury done to the clause therein of <hi>nulli vende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
Justiciam;</hi> when as the wisdom of former as
well as of later Parliaments did always foresee
and allow of a necessity of something to be paid to
the Judges, Officials or Ministers of Justice in the
obtaining or expediting of it, for a provision and
maintenance to support and encourage them in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a dispatch to the people who came for reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to the Courts of Justice, or the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>And the Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi> the second, which
was not long after the making of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
certainly just recompences to the Clerks

as may appear by the usage and course

the profits arising by his Fines upon Original
Writs in personal Actions to the Lord Chancellor
or Lord Keeper, and the Master of the Rolls, for
the support of those high and honourable Offices
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48997:19"/>
and Places which they hold, and the Cursistors for
their better encouragement in the service of the
King and his people in Chancery in their several
Orbs and employments; or otherwise the people
who will not do anything themselves without pay,
or sell their victuals to them without money, are
to pay the Cursistors such other Fees as their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance,
skill and labour shall merit.</p>
            <p>And therefore if the Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
had not informed us, that besides their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
and livelyhood then provided for them,
they had their <hi>Sportula</hi>'s, Fees and encouragements
allowed them for making of every Writ, which
with their victuals and necessary provisions made
a greater benefit, considering their then most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
single and unmarried condition, then
the <hi>Cursistors</hi> Fees and parts of the Fines do now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
unto.</p>
            <p>It will be no more improbable, that the Clerks
and Officers of the Chancery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they either
lived in the House with the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> or had
their Dyet and necessary maintenance elsewhere
provided for them, had their <hi>Sportula</hi>'s also and
Fees for their labour and care in the making and
dispatch of Writs Remedial.</p>
            <p>Then that the Secretaries and Clerks attending
upon a Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> or Keeper of the great Seal,
of the Judges, should as they now have and ought
to have, besides their Dyet, Lodging, and other
necessaries, some Fees and establishments for their
rewards in their care and dispatch of businesses.</p>
            <p>All which that Parliament which was almost

to those which they found to be rationally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
by time and ancient usage, though no O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
constitution or creating of many of them
by a Law can be found, but onely by the Authority
and power of Courts, and discretion of Judges, or
the light and guidance of common Reason, which
teacheth the Clyents themselves, or the most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

            <p>For when the Scripture it self can tell us, that
<hi>Operarius mercede dignus,</hi> the work-man is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
his hire, or to be paid for his labour; and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
it self perswades it, if the Client or party
immediately concerned, who is most properly to
do it, shall not pay it, the King is to do it by
a Stipend or Salary yearly to be paid out of the
common Treasury: which being to be furnished
or supplyed by the people, will return heavier a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
upon them, and lay a burden upon those
which should not bear it, or never in their lives
may have any occasion to sue for remedies at Law,
or be Petitioners either as Plaintiffs or Defendants
for Justice.</p>
            <p>And the Defendants, and such as are innocent,
and Victors, must in those publick Assessments
or Contributions help to bear the Princes charges,
and pay for the Plaintiffs unjust vexations, if no
Fees or <hi>Sportula</hi>'s should be taken, but a constant
and yearly Salary should be given to Officers and
Clerks; which unless it be large, cannot probably
be adaequate to the skill, industry, labours and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of the Officers and Clerks, which in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualties
and Contingencies of Actions and Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
cannot well be foreseen, or made to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
thereunto by any just measure to be
taken before hand, or any prospect which can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be made of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:48997:22"/>
And therefore a yearly Stipend or Salary being
likely to be either too narrow or too large,</p>
            <p>Will, if plentiful, or too much, violate the Rule
or purpose of Justice: or if too little, put a sinful
necessity upon the Officers to do their business la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zily
and carelesly, or stir up in them a greedy
and craving appetite, and temptation of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the advantages of all opportunities to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
those Appetites, or that which they shall sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
conceive to be a recompence for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
the wickedness and inconveniences where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
have been sufficiently held forth unto us by
what hath been seen, felt, heard and understood in
the yearly Stipends or Salaries, with a restraint of
taking any other Fees heretofore given to Officers
and Clerks, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> in our
late times of Pretences, rather then <hi>Reformations;</hi>
when those <hi>Publick Spirits,</hi> as they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
made up of the Out-sides of Holiness, did
onely gather in their prey, and a greater then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they could have done, under colour of
it.</p>
            <p>And the Plaintiff by paying and depositing that
most commonly small sum of money beforehand,
or giving of it, doth it but in the confidence of the
Justice of his Cause, and hopes to recover it of
him that did him wrong.</p>
            <p>And if his Action proves to be unjust, did but
justly pay for his abusing of the Ears of Justice by
his unjust complaint or vexation put upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
who having Costs allowed him, &amp; a means
to recover it, hath no reason to claim any share
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48997:22"/>
or part in the money paid for the Fine, if it were
a <hi>Depositum,</hi> for that it would then be as a <hi>Caducum,</hi>
or thing which neither the Plaintiff nor Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
after it is paid, can have any Title unto;
and is therefore, according to the ancient custome,
if it were not an <hi>Oblatum</hi> (which it is rather concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be) to be paid to the King: whose <hi>Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour</hi>
hath towards his support in that high and
eminent place and care of Justice under the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
one part in four allowed him, the Master
of the Rolls another part; and the Cursistor or
Clerk that makes the Original Writ, the moyety
or the other two parts. And in the highest time
of Suits in Law of that kind, when they were four
times as much or more then now, amounted to
no more then 5000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> amongst them all;
or little more then a third part of that miscalled
sum of 12000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> which some of the
Members in the Long Parliament were (by the
factious and giddy Calculations of those little
Foxes that could spoile any Vineyard they did but
bark at) well contented to believe.</p>
            <p>And must otherwise as to their support and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
have been satisfied either by the people
or the King; which as the Head and well-being of
the Body Politick, is, as in the Natural, to be
supported by the Members. And with the greater
reason in this particular of the Fines upon Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

and execution of Justice, the safe-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Records thereof; and giving cheap and

that the trespasser should pay double damages:
which the paying of costs with us, either single or

arrive unto.</p>
            <p>And is much better then, when as anciently, until
a better course and way of bringing men to justice
was found out, by establishing of fixed and certain
Courts, times and places of justice with less trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the people.</p>
            <p>They did, where they did not fouly contend or
fight it out by the bloody and direful chance of
might or power of parties, make choice of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators,
and bear their charges, (which when the
law was <hi>in Cunabulis,</hi> every one which hath
travelled but easie journies in the Civil Law,
and the Law of Nations, knows to be frequent) to
meet at an equal distance, or other convenient
place, or at their houses.</p>
            <p>Or when as it appeareth by <hi>Marculfus,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
near the time of <hi>Charlemain</hi> the Emperour,<note place="margin">Marculfus Formulas, &amp; Bignonii notae in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undem.</note>
wrote about 800 years ago; and <hi>Bignonius</hi> Notes or
Comment upon him; it was the custome in the
reign of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> that Judges being made itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
by commission to hear and determine causes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48997:24"/>
at the houses of those that complained for want of
justice, did not onely <hi>Freda exigere,</hi> take a third
part of the fine or penalty for themselves, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
their entertainments to be defrayed; but
<hi>redhibitiones,</hi> some other fees and rewards to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to them.</p>
            <p>Insomuch as some Abbies &amp; Monasteries beyond
the Seas, and our largely priviledged Abby of St.
<hi>Albons</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who were well enough sitted for
publick entertainments and Hospitality, and much
used unto it: and divers great Cities and Towns
did so little like of that trouble which those kind of
Judges,<note place="margin">Mat. Patis.</note> and their then necessary and greater trains
and retinues brought upon them, as they made
shift to obtain immunities and priviledges from
their Kings to be freed from those kind of troubles.</p>
            <p>Which may the more perswade the right usage
and reasonableness of Fees in Courts of Justice or
<hi>Chancery,</hi> where the reason and difference of Fees
in and through all ages and times, in the custome
and usage of Courts in this and all places of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,</hi>
have been grounded and made to be, 1. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the labour in writing. 2. A more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
care and skill to be taken and used, as in a Real
Action more then a Personal. 3. The quality of the
Judge. And the superiority or eminency of the
Court which granteth it. As more in Parliament,
where the House of Commons takes for the least
Order that is made 6 <hi>s. 8 d.</hi> and the House of Peers
14 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> or more, according to the length; more
in the Chancery for an Order then in the Kings
Bench or Common Pleas; and lesser Fees in the
inferior or Pipowder Courts then in the superior:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48997:25"/>
and therefore when a Justice of Peace shall take
2 <hi>s. 4 d.</hi> for his Warrant or Writ, a Writ issuing
out of the high Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> may justly claim
to be as much, that of six pence which they have
now for every Writ besides the Fine; or where it
is not fineable, being far too little, and so below
an encouragement of their labours, fidelity and
well-being, as may put them either into a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness
of doing their business as they should do,
(which when the Fines were put down, were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
experimented) or a temptation to do
things which they should not do.</p>
            <p>Or if the Fee but of <hi>six</hi> pence more should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to their Fee for common Writs, if the Fines
should be taken away, and a recompence of 700 <hi>l.</hi>
or 1000 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> granted by the King to the Lord
<hi>Chancellor,</hi> and as much to the <hi>Master of the Rolls</hi> and
their successours for what they shall be loosers by
the taking away of the Fines, it would all together
amount to a greater charge upon the people then
it was twenty years ago, when the accompt of the
Fines was a great deal more then in the last year.</p>
            <p>And if they should have so much for every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Writ, whereupon no Fine is paid, which in
<hi>London,</hi> where most Fines are paid, are not one in
every twenty; and in the Country where few fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Writs happen, are not one in every two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;
the charge thereof making many to bear the
burthen of a few, would be unequal and unjust, and
more to the subject in general, then that which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
seldome or particular cases are now paid.</p>
            <p>Which may please the peoples fancies, but will
in the end or consequence of it but delude their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48997:25"/>
imaginations; and they will really finde no more
ease thereby, then he that is to carry a bushel of
Wheat shall do, when he shall put some in his
large Pockets, some in his Boots or Stockings, or
some in a Hawking-bag at his Girdle, and carry
the rest upon his Shoulders; or one that shall be
so wise as to think a pound of Feathers to be less
in weight then a pound of Lead.</p>
            <p>Wherefore all things being as they ought to be
duely considered, and the great benefit which all
the people of <hi>England</hi> do receive by having a Court
of Chancery, and <hi>Officina Justitiae,</hi> and the several
Offices therein open, as well in the Vacations as
Terms to resort unto for their Writs Remedial, and
of course, being as a Balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> never denied to
any that want it; and not being put to peitition for
them to the King or his Lord Chancellor, as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
and originally all men did for their Writs,
or to be at much expence of money and time to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Orders thereupon; and that men of no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
judgements and experience in the Courts of
<hi>Common Pleas,</hi> did finde themselves deceived in their
opinions, when they did verily believe that when
the Fines in <hi>Chancery</hi> should be taken away, as they
were for six or seven years in the time of the late
confusion and usurpation, by an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as it was then so called, a great encrease of
business would have followed in that Court, but
could never perceive any: or if any, it was so very
small as it was not discernable.</p>
            <p>When it is well known, that Fines (when the
business was by many times or parts a great deal
more then now it is) were cheerfully and willingly
paid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:48997:26"/>
That the unwillingness of some of the people to
pay them, is by reason of an illegal track or beaten
road of suing Actions in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> which do
by Law belong to the Court of <hi>Common Pleas;</hi> and
that the Attorneys of the Court of <hi>Common Pleas</hi> do
more then needs, for their own ease and advantage,
and to trouble themselves as little as they can with
the learning of the Law, or the knowledge how to
frame an Action, sue almost as many Actions out
of that Court as their own, the cheapness of the
<hi>Latitat</hi> and other Fees in that Court being more
then is or can be in the Court of <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> if
the Fines were taken away.</p>
            <p>That the cheapness of process, and contention,
doth not seldome breed, encourage and heighten
the humor of suits and controversies, as is dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented
in ten or twelve thousand Bills of <hi>Midle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi>
taken forth to arrest men in every year in that
small county and jurisdiction, because they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
and quickly had for 18 <hi>d.</hi> apiece.</p>
            <p>And by the <hi>Broom</hi>-men (since the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies
of the <hi>Marshalsea</hi>-court, by their taking
cognisance of all manner of personal Actions
within the Virge, or twelve miles of the Kings
Courts, where neither Plaintiffs or Defendants are
of the Kings houshold) who whilst they are crying
Brooms in the streets and in <hi>Cliffords</hi> Inne, can ask
at the same time for the Office of the <hi>Marshalsea,</hi>
and for a Writ of eighteen pence, and go to
Law with one another for many times less then
the Writs cost them.</p>
            <p>And that such a cheapness may be as prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to the people, as that old Law was amongst the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48997:26"/>
               <hi>Romans;</hi> which when money was more scarce then it
was afterwards, did enact, That whosoever did strike
a man upon the mouth or face, should pay to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
beaten twenty and five <hi>Asses,</hi> which were a certain
small coyn, about the value of our <hi>English</hi> half-peny.</p>
            <p>But the wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> encreasing, and that penalty
coming to be very little, one <hi>Neratius</hi> a rich <hi>Hector,</hi> or
debaucht <hi>Gentleman</hi> of those times, finding how cheap
it was to beat men, did frequently as he went along
the streets, strike on the mouth or face such as he
thought fitting, and presently command his servant
attending him with a bag of money, to pay him the
money or recompence which the Law awarded him:
which gave the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> the occasion to repeal
that Law,<note place="margin">B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Chief Justice</hi> to punish such offenders arbitrarily.</p>
            <p>And it will not once onely, but always be more for
the good of the people, that the very ancient, rational
and legal usage now held of paying Fines in <hi>Chancery,</hi>
be continued: which cannot in a more easie and just
way be charged upon the subjects who receive a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by them. And that for a supply of the Kings now
languishing and too small a Revenue.</p>
            <p>The Courts of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> and <hi>Marshalsea,</hi> and
Office of <hi>Pleas</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> upon their Writs of
<hi>Quo Minus,</hi> which of all the Kings Courts should most
advance and least hinder his Majesties just Rights and
Revenues, if they will (as they should not) stretch their
jurisdiction further then they ought to do, and hold
Pleas, or take a cognisance where they should not,
may be ordered, as is usually done in Chancery upon
Writs retornable in the Court of <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> to
pay Fines upon such Writs, and that upon every of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48997:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
such Writs taken forth, and before they shall be seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Plaintiffs Attorney do endorse the sum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
which he demands Bayl for, or intends to declare
for, and pay to the Kings Receiver to be appointed
for that purpose, such Fines as shall be due and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
according to the rates now used in <hi>Chancery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which will the more conduce to the good of the
people, then their not paying of Fines upon some few
Original Writs, when as those troublesome and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious
Writs of <hi>Latitat Quo Minus,</hi> and Bills of <hi>Midle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi>
shall be thereby somewhat kept within their legal
bounds and limits, and not be made use of upon meer
fictions and pretences, to promote the malicious ends
and designes of ill disposed people, and the process of
those Courts abused, &amp; made the instruments of mens
oppressing one another. Not to be suffered by those
whose Oaths are not to permit any thing to be done
in disherison of the Crown. Nor to be practised by
the people, whose oaths of allegiance and supremacy
should disswade them from diminishing or taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
any of the Kings regalities or jurisdictions, when
as their fore-fathers and the days of old may tell
them and their posterities, and after-generations
will finde it, that their welfare and happiness is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the Kings; that the lessening of his legal
revenues will but lessen and inconvenience their own;
that his good is more to be taken care of then any
mans particular, by how much every mans particular
is comprehended in the universal; and that the King
cannot well protect and defend them and their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
estates, if his own shall be dayly diminished,
purloined, or kept from him.</p>
