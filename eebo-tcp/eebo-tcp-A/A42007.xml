            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>DEarly beloved of the Lord, my love is with you, and my life reacheth unto you, and with it I ſalute you all, who are <hi>gathered and choſen from amongſt the families of the earth,</hi> to be a people to the praiſe of our God, <hi>who created and formed us in the womb,</hi> and hath brought us forth in this preſent age, and hath made us witneſſes of his eternal power, and as ſpectators of his heavenly and glorious appearance in this his <hi>bleſsed day;</hi> and all this, and more then can be by word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, hath the Lord to many of us made known, ſince the day we firſt received the light of his Son Chriſt Jeſus, which he cauſed to ſhine in our hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, by which we have been brought into true fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and unity with God the Father, even we who once were <hi>ſtrangers</hi> unto him, as were our fathers all, and as <hi>Pilgrims</hi> in a ſtrange land, and as <hi>Captives</hi> in a far Country, and as <hi>Mourners</hi> without true faith or hope, being toſſed to and fro with every wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, by the ſlight and cunning craftineſs of men. And thus were we toſſed, not knowing an Anchor to ſtay us; yet there was a cry in us, as was in the Spouſe in the days of old, who ſaid, <hi>Tell me, O thou whom my ſoul lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, where thou feedeſt, and where thou makeſt thy flock to rest at noon; for why ſhould I be as one that turneth aſide by the flocks of thy companions?</hi> In this ſtate did the Lord find us, even loſt, as in a way-leſs, weary <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> without the true knowledg of him, though there was ſomething cryed in us for want of his preſence, not knowing the <hi>Meſsenger of peace</hi> was ſo near, even he that did ſhew us our wants, and our preſent ſtate;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44901:3"/>
but of that we could not learn, not knowing from whence it came, neither could we underſtand the end of its cry, at which cry we were many times troubled; but where that ſhould be manifeſt that ſhould ſatisfie it, we knew not. O then, then was the time of the Lords infinite, endleſs love extended unto us, even when we ſate in darkneſs overſhadowed with death, and the life in us was buried; then did the Lord cauſe his Word to be heard, and did utter his voice as the noiſe of <hi>Thunders,</hi> and as the ſound of many <hi>Trumpets, which Voice the dead heard, and the Lord breathed upon the ſlain,</hi> and ſaid to the earth (in our hearing) Thou ſhalt no longer cover my Royal Seed (whoſe Nature is heavenly;) for now will I manifeſt my power, and make known my mighty ſtrength, by raiſing up my ſeed, even the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> my ſervant, unto whom the Goſpel was Preached by my Spirit in his day, <hi>That in his Seed ſhould all the kindreds of the earth be bleſſed;</hi> and this will I perform for my Name and Glory ſake, ſaith the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who changeth not. And when the Lord did bring us out of the many wayes into the truth, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſeed, in which the bleſſings are manifeſt, then did he open our underſtandings by his light that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhine in our dark hearts, but we rather chooſing darkneſs, could not comprehend the light, but was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes willing and ready to entertain any thing, and from any one that would deny or lightly eſteem that which did judg us in our hearts and conſcience: And from this we would have hid our ſelves many a time, and would endeavour to heal the wound that this would give us, but this was privy to all our actions, whether they were good or evil; and in due time it was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>and iniquity was the way of life,</hi> and above all things to be minded; and it being believed in, and turned to, and received of a little remnant, the good effect of it was ſoon known, and <hi>that which was heard in the ear, was preached as upon the houſe top,</hi> and that which was known of the work of the Lord in the heart, was uttered forth in the demonſtration of the ſpirit of God, by which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>were turned from darkneſſe to light, and from Satans power, unto the power of the true and living God,</hi> and ſo was brought to the beginning of the work of the Lord in our own particulars; for we had been too long <hi>keeping others vineyards, and our own we did not keep,</hi> neither knew the <hi>vine-dreſser,</hi> but now are brought to a waiting in the <hi>light by which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret things are made known, and hidden things revealed;</hi> but when we firſt received the <hi>light,</hi> the truth, the ſpirit of God, oh! then what a ſtriving was there in our hearts, even with they two in the womb, the <hi>ſeed</hi> which was elected before the world began, and that <hi>ſeed</hi> whoſe kingdome is of this world, whereby the creature in whom this war and combat was, came into a great ſtraight, and much trouble and watching, till they or he knew the <hi>election to obtain, and the ſeed of</hi> Jacob <hi>to ariſe over all as a valiant Prince, who wrestle with God till the promiſe was obtained.</hi> This is the <hi>royal ſeed</hi> at this day, and this is the <hi>light of life</hi> by which <hi>the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things of</hi> Eſau <hi>are ſearched out,</hi> and his rough and prophane nature known. And no ſooner were we turned to the light, and were joyned unto it, in it to be one with the heavenly <hi>ſeed,</hi> which was elected before the world began, but the <hi>Dragon, Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> were in a great rage, and began to do their utmoſt, in caſting out their flouds of cruelty and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44901:4"/>
perſecution, to make an end of us, even as <hi>Herod</hi> in the time of Chriſts birth according to the fleſh, ſo was this generation at his appearance in his people, and his leading of us by his ſpirit, who, as <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog,</hi> and as <hi>Goliah the Philiſtim,</hi> and as <hi>Balak</hi> king of <hi>Moab,</hi> conſulted againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> have they violently roſe up againſt us, or rather againſt the appearance of the Lord in us, and have defied us, becauſe of our lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, and becauſe of the Lords work in us, they have ſcorned us, doing their utmoſt to deſtroy us many times, that we might not have a being upon the face of the earth. And notwithſtanding they have the honour of the world outwardly, yet (they) like proud <hi>Haman,</hi> are troubled, and are not ſatisfied to have a true <hi>Jew</hi> live in their countrey. Surely the Lord hath beheld them, and the Almighty hath taken notice, and his bowels have yearned for his peoples ſake, who have been term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>deſolate and forſaken:</hi> Oh! us hath he choſen, and and hath often filled us with new wine, and hath been ſtrength unto us in our greateſt weakneſſe, and a ſhelter to us, and a reſcuer for us, when the <hi>Dragon</hi> hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued us, and the <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> and <hi>hirelings</hi> made a prey of us, then hath the Lord brought the hearts of the faithful into ſuch a frame, (and they have waited till it was ſo) even to <hi>ſuffer the ſpoiling of their goods with joy, having an earneſt in themſelves of that durable treaſure, that the moth cannot corrupt, nor thieves ſteal away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore ye children of the Lord, who are brought to the knowledge of this, and are gathered into the <hi>everlaſting covenant of endleſs life,</hi> my love is drawn out to you, and I knowing my life is among you, I am conſtrained in my ſpirit even to write to you (even) as the dearly beloved of my father, and as children

brought up with me, we having drank together in the one pure ſpirit of the water which hath flowed from the <hi>living fountain,</hi> (according to the determinate counſel of our God) which hath been <hi>in us as a well of living water, ſpringing up to</hi> (the Lord our God) <hi>the eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And friends, thus far hath the Lord brought us, and to this day he hath been with us, even when our enemies have roſe up againſt us, who have encamped about us on every ſide, even as at this day. Therefore lift up your heads, for now is the Lord opening <hi>the everlaſting gates that the righteous nation may enter in,</hi> who keepeth the truth, and are born of the royal ſeed, for <hi>the Kingdome which cannot be ſhaken</hi> they are the heirs of, and they ſhall enjoy it, ſaith the Lord that lives for ever, though unto it they come through <hi>great tribulations,</hi> yet in them they ſhall learn <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>experience,</hi> and witneſs that <hi>living hope of which they ſhall never be aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore thou weakling, and tender mournful one, who ſometimes fears thou ſhalt not hold out to the end, thy tryals are ſo many, for thy ſake I am enlarged, thy mournings, thy ſighings, thy faintings, the ſence thereof lieth as a weight upon me, and I cannot paſs by thee, as if it was nothing to me, to ſee thee in ſorrow and grief, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within thy ſelf, <hi>didſt thou ever ſee ſuch a weak one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſuch a journey?</hi> and the true birth in thee ſaith, <hi>the Lord knows my heart, I would fain run to the end, that my God might be glorified, who hath regarded my low eſtate, and hath vouchſafed to keep me unto this day, but my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are ſo many on every ſide, and I think I ſhall one day fall, my ſtrength is ſo little, that I can cry, ſurely there is none like me, and yet I have not wanted ſupplies from my God till this day.</hi> Oh! thou child, thou tender one, who cannot forget the day of thy viſitation, thy God beholds
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44901:5"/>
thee, and if he cauſe thee to do a mans work, he will give thee a mans ſtrength, and thou ſhalt know that all power is from him, therefore caſt thy care upon him, and wait that thy mind may be kept out of all viſible things, in the poverty of ſpirit, joyning to the ſpirits cry, turning thy back upon all queſtionings, ſo wilt thou have acceſs to the Lord, and know thy approaching in the ſpirits life, to the throne of his grace with boldneſs, where thou ſhalt receive <hi>grace for grace,</hi> and into his arms will the Lord gather thee, and give thee of <hi>the milk of the word,</hi> that the little one in thee <hi>may grow as the willows by the water brooks,</hi> and though thy enemies be as the tall <hi>Cedar,</hi> and ſtrong as the mighty <hi>oak,</hi> yet will thy God bring them under, and make thee more than a conquerour, through his ſon Jeſus, that thou ſhalt ſay with gladneſs of heart, <hi>ſalvation is come to my houſe,</hi> and ſhalt feel the ſpirit of the ſon to rule in thee, whereby thou ſhalt <hi>cry Abba Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whoever thou art who hath <hi>begun in the ſpirit,</hi> thou knoweſt thou <hi>canst not be made perfect in the fleſh,</hi> therefore wait to be led by the ſpirit of the Lord, ſo thou mayeſt come to the knowledge of the <hi>ſonſhip</hi> and <hi>heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in the everlasting covenant the light.</hi> So look not at thy weakneſs, for in that will the Lord <hi>ordain strength, and out of the mouth of the babes will he perfect his praiſe,</hi> and for thy ſake thats faithful to him, he will cauſe the mountains to be removed, and the hills to melt away, and will make a ſtraight path for thy ſeet, and will lead thee in the way everlaſting, where thy <hi>peace ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a river, and his loving kindneſs</hi> to thee <hi>as the waves of the ſea,</hi> that inſtead of <hi>mourning</hi> thou ſhalt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,</hi> and inſtead of <hi>ſighing</hi> thou ſhalt <hi>ſing,</hi> and inſtead of <hi>fainting</hi> thou ſhalt be <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and in the ſtrength of thy

God, thou ſhalt praiſe him; and in the feeling of his heavenly virtue thou ſhalt magnifie him, and ſay, <hi>My lot is fallen in a good ground,</hi> on which the ſhowers from heaven fall; yea, even as the former and the latter rain in its ſeaſon. And now thou ſhalt ſee thy God hath not forgotten thee, neither is the Almighty changed, but <hi>he keepeth covenant for ever with his people;</hi> and man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſanul it, <hi>for ſaith the Lord, the holy one of Iſrael, if they could break my Covenant with the day, that there ſhould not be night and day in their ſeaſon, then might they break my Covenant with my people Iſrael, and the ſeed of Jacob my choſen.</hi> Therefore thou leaſt of the Flock be not caſt down, but look thou ſteadfaſtly to the Lord, <hi>whoſe mercies endure for ever,</hi> and his <hi>loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to his own ſeed, <hi>from generation to generation.</hi> So whatever thy tryals, temptations, or exerciſes are, let thy mind be joyned to the light, by which thou maiſt behold <hi>the Antient of dayes,</hi> as thou dwelleſt in the pure fear of him; ſo wilt thou be kept out of the toſſings, whirlings and imaginations, in the truth in which is ſtability, in which thou wilt feel the ſprings of life running to refreſh thy ſoul, flowing from the Lord who is fulneſs it ſelf, who doth all things freely; yet will he be waited upon by his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in their waiting upon him, he doth and will <hi>renew their ſtrength,</hi> mounting up in his heavenly power over all temptations, and ſnares of the ſouls ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, both within and without, to the praiſe of the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God.

            <p>And now all you my dear <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Sisters,</hi> who are in ſufferings and Priſons, and under grievous ſentences
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44901:6"/>
for the bleſſed <hi>teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> in theſe laſt dayes, my life is with you all, and my love doth flow unto you; for ye are brought into my remembrance in my Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the Lord our God, and my ſoul cries, <hi>O Lord, accompliſh thy work, and perform thy purpoſe, and bring to paſs thy ſtrange act, and exalt thy Name and Truth, and thy holy people in it over all the world and power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that as thou hast upheld in the many tryals, ſo thou maiſt be known to all thy Children, a deliverer out of all troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, my <hi>Brethren, Siſters,</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> who have known the goodneſs of the Lord, from the day of your Child-hood in his truth, how he hath cared for you, and hath been ſtrength to you in all your beſettings, and hath been your comfort in all your afflictions, even a God nigh at hand, and not a far off. Well, caſt your care upon him, ſo will he cloath you as the Lilly, and fill you with his heavenly virtue, and will make you as a Garden of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten watered; and will fence you about that your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall ſay, You ſerve not the Lord for naught, for he hath ſet a hedge about you, and hath fenced you on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide, ſo that neither <hi>Enchantment,</hi> nor <hi>Divination,</hi> or <hi>weapons formed, do proſper againſt you,</hi> becauſe the Lord is making known his power as in the dayes of old, in preſerving his Children in the flames, as he did <hi>Scha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drach, Meſhech,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> the three Children, among whom a fourth was manifeſted, like unto the Son of God, who cauſed them to aſcend in the ſight of their enemies, and to rejoyce in the Flames, as do the faithful in their afflictions at this day, who ſuffer for the Lord and his truth's ſake. And now many people of Nations are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered againſt thee, that ſay, <hi>Let her be destroyed, and let our eyes look upon</hi> Sion. <hi>But they know not the thoughts of</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And now, dear <hi>Friends,</hi> you that the Lord hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured firſt, and hath given you power to endure with joyfulneſs the Sentence of <hi>Baniſhment,</hi> for the Cauſe of our God; well, your Integrity hath affected my heart, and the hearts of many, and you ſhall not looſe your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Only be low before the Lord our God, becauſe he is your ſtrength, elſe had you fainted. And let your Prayers and mutual Cryes be unto the Lord for them that's behind. And let them that's not ſo forward in ſuffering, bleſs the Lord in preſerving ye; and none be exalted that's before, neither he that's behind be caſt down, but all, as members of the body, keep every one in his office, that God may be gloriſied, and ye in his life and love preſerved by the ſtrength given you of the Lord, in all your trials and temptations that you meet withal, that ſo all thoſe ſtroaks and ſufferings may drive you nearer to the Lord, and one unto another, that you may be <hi>as ſaviours upon mount Sion,</hi> to judge the mount of <hi>Eſau;</hi> you knowing <hi>the Kingdome is the Lords, and his ſeed ſhall poſſeſs it for evermore.</hi> So, in that which keeps ſelf in the duſt; in that abide, and in that read one another, and in that lift up your heads ye children of the Lord, for he is on our part, and at this day is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our cauſe with our adverſaries; for, <hi>he hath ſet bounds</hi>
