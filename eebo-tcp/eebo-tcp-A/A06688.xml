            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To the honourable Ladyes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> lamenting for

            <l>REmark (Madams,) remark my mourning mood,</l>
            <l>I am Religion, who was borne in blood,</l>
            <l>In blood I grew, and as I firſt began,</l>
            <l>I feare my laſt gaſp like the Pelican</l>
            <l>Shall bee in blood; for at the Worlds firſt houre,</l>
            <l>When on this earth there livde but only foure,</l>
            <l>Ev'n then for my ſake One of that ſmall band,</l>
            <l>His blood cryde vengeance at my Fathers hand:</l>
            <l>And then when men increaſde and multiplyed,</l>
            <l>I was by mortalls baſely vilifyed,</l>
            <l>For which it pleaſde my Father in his wrath,</l>
            <l>To ſend a flood that ſwallowed up the earth,</l>
            <l>Eight perſons only ſafe, (O fearefull cace)</l>
            <l>Neglect of mee deſtroyde all humane race:</l>
            <l>And yet this hideous deluge in ſhort ſpace,</l>
            <l>Was ſtreight forgot by mortalls wanting grace.</l>
            <l>Thereafter for my cauſe great warres began,</l>
            <l>That mercileſſe and cruell hearted man</l>
            <l>Did dreg the Infants from their mothers wombes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>Made ſucklings cradles to become their tombes,</l>
            <l>Raviſhing women, waſting everie Land,</l>
            <l>Burning faire buildings againſt Gods command,</l>
            <l>Defacing Temples, and monuments rare,</l>
            <l>Acting all wrath without remorſe or feare,</l>
            <l>And let mee (tender Ladyes) make complaint,</l>
            <l>It calmes a wofull heart when woes get vent)</l>
            <l>And let mee tell what wrongs, what injuries,</l>
            <l>What foule diſgraces, and what calumnies</l>
            <l>Which I have ſuffered, and all thoſe that love</l>
            <l>My Name; to heare it, it would quickly move</l>
            <l>An heart of flinty ſtone to melt in teares,</l>
            <l>To retrograde it would compell the ſpheares,</l>
            <l>Yea, it would cauſe the red Sea part aſunder,</l>
            <l>To heare my griefes, which doe ſurpaſſe all wonder:</l>
            <l>And you (chaſt Dames) let teares fall from your eyes,</l>
            <l>To heare mee tell my diſmall Tragedies:</l>
            <l>When firſt from <hi>Egypt</hi> I was put to flight,</l>
            <l>With ſix hundreth thouſand warriours of might,</l>
            <l>I was perſued by <hi>Pharao<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <l>For curſed <hi>Egypt</hi> a <hi>Canaan</hi> land:</l>
            <l>Then was I taken in a litle ſpace</l>
            <l>By <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> in moſt baſe diſgrace,</l>
            <l>And kept in bondage as a lawfull pryſe</l>
            <l>While <hi>Zedechiah</hi> wanted both his eyes:</l>
            <l>Then did <hi>Antiochus</hi> ov'r mee tyrannize,</l>
            <l>Diſchargde my offrings, and my ſacrifice.</l>
            <l>Yea, my owne countrie-men the <hi>Iewes,</hi> I meane,</l>
            <l>When as the Saviour of the world was ſlaine,</l>
            <l>Gave mee a deadly blow, and for that blow</l>
            <l>The <hi>Romans</hi> did their kingdome overthrow,</l>
            <l>Did make them ſlaves, and did them all diſperſe,</l>
            <l>Like vagabounds throughout this Vniverſe.</l>
            <l>Then after Chriſt came <hi>Arrius</hi> with his word,</l>
            <l>And in my bellie thought to have ſheatht his ſword,</l>
            <l>Yea with the venome of his ſtinking breath,</l>
            <l>(I meane his doctrine) hee infect the earth,</l>
            <l>Hee kindled ſuch a great combuſtious fire,</l>
            <l>That kindoms againſt kingdoms did conſpire,</l>
            <l>And altars againſt altars contradicted,</l>
            <l>And all that lovde mee were with death afflicted,</l>
            <l>So that in end I was perforc'd to flie</l>
            <l>From <hi>Aſia</hi> forfeare of crueltie</l>
            <l>To <hi>Europe,</hi> where I did in heart ſuppoſe,</l>
            <l>To find ſafeguard to ſave mee from my foes,</l>
            <l>No ſooner had I feeble footing got</l>
            <l>In <hi>Europe,</hi> but I was conſtraind to trot,</l>
            <l>And for to pack mee hence with diligence,</l>

            <l>To <hi>Mahumet,</hi> and to his <hi>Alcaron,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To drowne my Name in deepe oblivion.</l>
            <l>And had not GOD with <hi>Godfrey</hi> tane my part,</l>
            <l>I had beene gone in deſpite of my heart:</l>
            <l>At length to <hi>Scotland</hi> I betooke my ſelf,</l>
            <l>Where, for three hundreth yeares ſpace and an half,</l>
