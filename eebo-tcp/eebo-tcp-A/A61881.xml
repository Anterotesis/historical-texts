         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Ingenuous
READER.</head>
            <p>IT is <hi>long</hi> since, that I designed a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
enquiry into the <hi>nature of Man,</hi> and
what it is, that we call <hi>Life,</hi> and by
<hi>what means</hi> it is to be <hi>so preserved,</hi> that
we may enjoy in this World an <hi>undisturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
health,</hi> and <hi>serenity of minde,</hi> together
which those <hi>other comforts,</hi> the <hi>promise</hi>
whereof is peculiarly annexed to the <hi>fifth
Commandment,</hi> according to the <hi>Septuagint;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Honour thy Father, and thy Mother, that it
may be well with thee, and that thy days may
be long in the Land, which the Lord thy God
giveth thee.</p>
            <p>This <hi>felicity,</hi> since that God put so great
a <hi>value</hi> on it, that he generally in Scripture
makes it a <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Celestial enjoyments</hi>
hereafter, and <hi>illustrates</hi> them <hi>hereby,</hi> as
being no <hi>odious Comparisons;</hi> and since the
<hi>result</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s wisdom, regulated by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,</hi>
and <hi>experience,</hi> amounts to this;
That he hath <hi>perceived,</hi> and <hi>seen,</hi> that <hi>It

better for a man, then that he should eat, and
drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour;</hi>
upon these Considerations, I did think it
merited my <hi>peculiar regards:</hi> and howbeit
the <hi>preached,</hi> but <hi>unpractised</hi> (and in many
parts <hi>false,</hi> and <hi>fictitious</hi>) Doctrine of <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
did seem to <hi>condemn such Enquiries;</hi>
and the <hi>promulgation</hi> of them might seem
to <hi>encourage,</hi> or <hi>instruct</hi> men in <hi>Sensuality,</hi>
(a thing inconsistent with <hi>Christianity,</hi> and
<hi>that course of life,</hi> which I have followed
so, as that <hi>Presbytery it self,</hi> that is, <hi>Malice
and Dis-ingenuity heightened with all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
imaginable in men on this side hell,</hi>
could never <hi>fix</hi> the <hi>least imputation upon me</hi>)
yet I thought, I ought not too much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<hi>accidental abuses;</hi> not to regulate my self
by what <hi>seemed fit,</hi> or <hi>true to others,</hi> but
what was <hi>really so,</hi> and conformable to
<hi>God's word,</hi> and the <hi>primitive practise:</hi> both
which (if we make not the Opinions of
<hi>Monks,</hi> and men retired unwarrantably
<hi>extra seculum,</hi> to be the sole Standard of
<hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>practise</hi>) did not repugn with
my <hi>designed Speculations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The late changes in our <hi>Nation</hi> have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged
me from my <hi>former adherencies;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93331:4"/>
and I have no longer a regard, or concern
for Sr. <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> or Gen. <hi>Ludlow,</hi> then
is consistent with my sworn <hi>Allegiance.</hi>
And I think, His Majesty is of so <hi>generous a
nature;</hi> and of so <hi>transcendent a Grandeur,</hi>
that I shall as litle offend him by <hi>this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
as I shall by the <hi>following course of
my life,</hi> wherein I shall make Him all those
returns, that the most <hi>deserving,</hi> and the
most <hi>obliging person,</hi> and <hi>Prince,</hi> may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
from an ingenuous and resentive <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
and <hi>Subject.</hi> It is but fitting, that so
unparallel'd a <hi>candour,</hi> as His Majesty hath
practised, should meet with <hi>reciprocal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments:</hi>
and however it be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>fate of Kings, to do well, and to be ill
spoken of;</hi> I think it a very hard <hi>destiny:</hi> and,
though I have a very despicable opinion
of the <hi>present age,</hi> yet I hope it will not be
guilty of any such <hi>unworthiness</hi> towards <hi>our
Sovereign.</hi> I shall make it my publick
Profession, <hi>Never did any</hi> (saving, that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
violated a <hi>sworn Allegiance,</hi> nor took
the <hi>Covenant,</hi> nor subscribed the <hi>Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
never did any ever offend, or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a greater Goodness.</hi> I go not about to
extenuate my Crimes by saying, <hi>Rebellion
loses its name, where Presbytery is opposed;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93331:5"/>
or, that <hi>The attempt in me was but the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of uncommon favours received from
others.</hi> I am indebted to His Majesty for
more, then an <hi>Act of Indemnity and Oblivion.</hi>
His <hi>Liberality</hi> hath prevented my Services,
and I already have had that Honour and
Reward conferred on me, which to deserve
I must change my <hi>resolutions</hi> into <hi>actions,</hi> and
be what I intend. Were my <hi>King</hi> of a <hi>less
merit,</hi> I should fear, that what I say might
be apprehended not as the <hi>dictates of Truth,</hi>
but occasioned by a <hi>sence of Duty,</hi> or <hi>Flattery:</hi>
but he possesseth all <hi>Heroick Virtues</hi> in so
peculiar a maner, that <hi>Envy</hi> it self must say,
that it is want of <hi>Time,</hi> or <hi>deficiency</hi> of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi>
not want of a <hi>befitting Subject,</hi> which
makes me to enlarge no further.</p>
            <p>I promised my ever-Honoured and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Frind Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> an account of <hi>Chocolata:</hi>

and Opportunity might have polished the
Work, and better'd my Enquiries. If I was

almost to do any thing. I have given as
good an account of things, as I could either
from my <hi>own little tryal,</hi> or the <hi>report of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
I have represented each <hi>Authour</hi> in his

concerning the modern practise in <hi>Spain,</hi>
my intelligence is not the less true, because
the margin doth not warrant it by some
citation. Sundry Digressions are rather at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,

correct the imperfections of this; many
whereof are unavoydable to me, because I

what hath received the commendation
of others well-acquainted with the variety
of <hi>Chocolata,</hi> sold, and made in this Nation.
I have set down the ways of <hi>Ledesma,</hi> and
<hi>Zacchias,</hi> and the way, by which the <hi>Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata</hi>
is commonly made. And I have left
in the hands of an <hi>honest</hi> though <hi>poor</hi> man,
<hi>Richard Mortimer</hi> in <hi>Sun-Alley</hi> in <hi>East-Smith-Field,</hi>
both my common-<hi>Chocolata-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,</hi>
and that other of <hi>Chocolata-Royal;</hi> both
which are fitted for the use of such as are
inhealth, or not of a very weak stomach,
being made up with <hi>milde Spices</hi> of <hi>Iamai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
and such, as may securely be used by the
most healthy. They, who would have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Chocolatas</hi> made, may have recourse
to him, and rely upon his honesty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them carefully according to my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod:
which, though infinitely laborious, he
is resolved to follow. I chose him, because
I found him, of all others, tractable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
my directions, and to make what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
I pleased: he lived in <hi>Spain</hi> many
years, and is as <hi>skilful,</hi> as <hi>honest.</hi> He will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
on any <hi>Physician</hi> of note to receive his
<hi>directions,</hi> as also to inform him, (if he
would vary from my ways by <hi>any addition</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:93331:7"/>
what <hi>may be</hi> added, and <hi>what quantity</hi> to
each proportion of <hi>Chocolata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I gave him the <hi>Receipts</hi> not only as a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
for the pains and trouble I put him
to; but out of a sense of <hi>publick utility,</hi> there
being so many frauds in the making of it:
it being so <hi>ill wrought</hi> up (whence comes
the <hi>setling</hi>) besides the <hi>mixture</hi> of several
Ingredients either <hi>hurtfull,</hi> or <hi>impertinent.</hi>
The way I make my <hi>Chocolata-Royal</hi> agrees
almost altogether with that, which is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> where the
mixture of <hi>Anise-seeds, Nutmeg,</hi> and <hi>Maiz</hi>
is disused, and confined only to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Chocolata-sellers.</hi> Whilest (to give
you the words of a Learned <hi>Spaniard)
This other Composition seems to have all that
perfection, which attends the last designs, and
contrivances of Men, after many fore-going
tryals; and which is observed to displease no
body: all the change of Ingredients for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years past did but prepare way for this;
which</hi> he <hi>observed to continue in a very good
body, the Ingredients exactly fermenting, and
having an excellent scent: and the Taste is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hot, and biting, nor totally insipid.</hi> I shall
not vary any thing from my way <hi>here</hi> in
<hi>England,</hi> but perhaps at <hi>Iamaica</hi> I may
<pb facs="tcp:93331:7"/>
improve it much, both in the <hi>making it up,</hi>
(which I suppose may better be done
there, then here; but will give no reason,
till I see it to be true) and in the adding
some <hi>Ingredients;</hi> which if it succeed, I
shall take care, that <hi>England</hi> know it, and
have the benefit thereof.</p>
            <p>Because that <hi>Richard Mortimer</hi> lives so far
of, I have appointed, that his <hi>Chocolata</hi> of
both sorts shall be to be sold at Captain
<hi>Beckford</hi>'s at the <hi>Custom-house-key:</hi> the best
<hi>Chocolata,</hi> call'd <hi>Chocolata-Royal,</hi> will cost <hi>six
shillings six pence</hi> each <hi>pound,</hi> weighing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thirteen ounces, or somewhat more:
the <hi>ordinary Chocolata,</hi> weighing about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
ounces each pound, will cost three
shillings and eight pence. And in the same
place they may be furnish'd with the best
<hi>Cacao-nuts,</hi> which I could yet ever see in
<hi>London;</hi> and also with <hi>Iamaica-Pepper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall conclude with this Premonition:
that the ensuing <hi>Discourse</hi> was written at a
great distance from my own <hi>Library,</hi> in a
place, where frequent interruptions, and
diversions scarce ever yielded me an hour's
leisure entire to my self: and, as this is a
sufficient excuse for its many imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
so it must particularly <hi>Apologize</hi> for
<pb facs="tcp:93331:8"/>
several Repetitions, which will occurr; for
having not time to review what I had,
written, and being willing to omit nothing,
I have, I believe, repeated several times the
same thing. But, <hi>if it please God,</hi> I arrive
safely at <hi>Iamaica,</hi> and enjoy that settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which I promise my self from the
right Honourable the <hi>Lord Windsor,</hi> (my

how at sundry times he was treated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

time, by way of entertainment: for howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Physicians</hi> there endeavour to confine the
people to Rules, yet is it generally drunk
without regard to any: and it is there, as well
as in the <hi>Indies,</hi> all the year long. It is
drunk, by the allowance of the <hi>Physicians, once,</hi>
or <hi>twice</hi> each day: and by the prevalence of
<hi>custome,</hi> as often as there is occasion for <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,</hi>
or that one is tyred through

There is a controversy about the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

must tell my Reader, that however I have in

mentioned by Writers, and in vulgar speech;
yet now I shall speak of it as a <hi>paste,</hi> or <hi>mass,</hi>
made into <hi>cakes, lumps, rouls, lozenges,</hi> or
enclosed in <hi>boxes,</hi> (as it pleaseth the worker
to make it up) which is to be dissolved in

               <p>The <hi>Cacao</hi> and other Ingredients must
be beaten in a mortar of stone, or (as the
<hi>Iadians</hi> use) ground upon a broad stone,
which they call <hi>Metal,</hi> and is only made
for that use: but first the Ingredients are
all dryed, except the <hi>Achiote,</hi> with care,
that they may be beaten to powder, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them still in stirring, that they be not
burnt, or become black: for, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> they be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-dryed,
they will be bitter, and lose
their virtue. The Cinnamom, and the
long red Pepper are to be first beaten, with
the Anise-seed, and then the <hi>Cacao,</hi> which
must be beaten by little and little, till it be
all powdered: and in the beating it must be
turned round, that it may mix the better.
Every one of these Ingredients must be
beaten by it self, and then all be put into
the vessel where the <hi>Cacao</hi> is, which you
must stir together with a spoon, and then
take out that paste, and put it into a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
under which there must be a little fire,
after the Confection is made: but if more
fire be put under it, then will warm it,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93331:17"/>
then the unctuous part will dry away. The
<hi>Achiote</hi> must also be put in in the beating,
that it may the better take the colour. All
the Ingredients must be searced, except the
<hi>Cacao:</hi> and, if from the <hi>Cacao</hi> the dry shell
be taken, it will be the better, where it is
well-beaten, and incorporated (which
will be known by the shortness of it) then
with a spoon (so in the <hi>Indies</hi> it is used)
is taken up some of the paste, which will
be almost liquid, and made into Tablets,
or else without a spoon put into Boxes,
and when it is cold it will be hard. Those,
that make it into Tablets, put a spoonfull
of the paste upon a piece of paper, (the
<hi>Indians</hi> put it on the leaf of the plant in
the tree) where being put into the shade,
(for in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>un it melts, and dissolves) it
grows hard: and then bowing the leaf,
or paper, the Tablet falls of, by reason of
the fatness of the paste; but, if it be put into
any thing of earth, or wood, it sticks fast,
and comes not off without scraping, or
breaking.</p>

Some beat the Spices severally in a mortar,

accurately. The Spicery being thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the <hi>Cacao</hi> nuts are dryed either on a
<hi>digesting furnace,</hi> or in a <hi>kettle</hi> over the fire,
stirring and turning them carefully, that
the <hi>nuts</hi> may so dry as to shell, but not to
burn: for then the <hi>Chocolata</hi> will be bitter.
Being pill'd, or shell'd, the nuts, being cold,
will beat to a powder, which you may searce,
(as you do the Spice) which is the best way,
and practised by the best <hi>Chocolata</hi>-makers in
<hi>Spain,</hi> and by my self always. The <hi>hulls</hi>
also, many of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are beat by themselves,

to compound <hi>Chocolata</hi> ordinarily in <hi>Spain,</hi>
and by many in <hi>England,</hi> to make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Chocolata.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Gage,</hi> and <hi>Piso,</hi>
whilst they say it is better to leave out the
<hi>hulls,</hi> leave us to conjecture, that many put
them in all. Having thus prepared the
<hi>Spicery,</hi> and <hi>Nuts,</hi> they are to be mix'd, and

it. In the working, if the fire be too hot,
the Nuts will run into too great an oyliness,
or dissolution of the fatty parts, and the
<hi>Chocolata</hi> will not keep any time. If it be
too cold, it will not <hi>work,</hi> but stick to the
rowler. From whence we may judge of the
controversie, whether an iron, or stone-table
be best:<note place="margin">It doth also work <hi>blacker</hi> on an <hi>iron-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> but who prefers a <hi>stone-rowle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to preserve an <hi>equal heat,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
some parts of the <hi>Cacao</hi> nut will
be reduced to too great a dissolution and
unctuousness, and others to too little: and
this inequality must needs occasion an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
mixture of parts, and consequently a
propensity to corrupt: besides that they
are enforced to make it up too soon (it
growing too <hi>oylie</hi>) before the parts are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
mix'd. But under a thick stone-table
each degree of encreasing heat is soon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
and remedied. I must also add, that
an iron-table works the <hi>Chocolata</hi> blacker,
then doth a stone.</p>

I concluded, that it could not be obstructive,

the others (as before they seemed to

and upon any fire to heat it I observed that
Setling to arise, and incorporate with the
rest, the cream dissolving; as Urine, when
turned at the fire: and when it cooled, it
did resetle before; as the said Urines do in
like case. At the same time, as I tryed sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Experiments with paste of the one lump,
I observed, that, having boiled the water,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93331:21"/>
and dissolved the <hi>Cacao paste</hi> in it, and milled
it but a little: though upon cooling it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very fat, yet did it yield but little cream.
Another part, that was well milled, and
yielded as much cream, as covered the pipkin
all over to a moderate thicknesse, being
skimmed, and milled, and cool'd, and cream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again, I took it, and heated it till it began
to boil, and then poured it out of the pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin
instantly, and it came out so clearly,
and without any reliques of water in the
pipkin, as water doth usually glide off oyled
cloth, or other vessels, when cold water is
powred on cold grease. And this happened
upon three tryals, the water being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
unctuous by being twice or thrice
heated, and milled (for else it succeeds
not:) and to make it more conspicuous, in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts off the pipkin I could observe
some little remainders of the water slide off
in round globes, or corpuscles, as it will do off
oyled cloth, or greased vessels.</p>
            <p>From whence I thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t I might collect a
reason, why the farrynesse of the Nut doth
not annoy the stomach, being taken in drink,
as other fat, or oyl will: for it exactly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixs
with the liquor, and swims not on
the top: (in these last Experiments it was
never milled; but, having been milled some
dayes before, and cooled in the pipkin, it
was again heated, and stirred with a spoon
a little, and powred out) and if, as it cools,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93331:21"/>
part of it seem to ascend, yet doth not that
all condense into cream: but the water
under is fatty; and as it is hot, and boils,
it is still so (as appears by this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:)
which happens not so in other <hi>fat
broths.</hi> Thus, the <hi>unctuous parts</hi> not floating (as
in fat, or butter, dissolved in posset drink to
provoke, or help vomits) on the top, and
the <hi>bitterish</hi> and <hi>adstringent parts</hi> by a little
heat commixing with the other, it must be a
very great repletion can make <hi>Cacao
paste</hi> offensive to the stomach, and its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice.</p>
            <p>I took also <hi>Cacao paste,</hi> and dissolved, and
milled it well in cold water; and it did
froth, and upon standing yield a cream in as
great a proportion, as that did, which had
been dissolved in hot water, and well milled:
the cream was <hi>yellowish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and inflammable;
the <hi>setling</hi> was just as to <hi>

                  </gap>lour,</hi> and <hi>taste</hi> like
to the other: saving that, drinking of it
before it setled, I found it to be nauseous to
the stomach; so as I, who hitherto never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasted
any thing I had a mind to take, could
not much relish the drinking of it: not
that it was vehemently cold to the stomach,
but that the fattinesse of it made the water
unpleasant being cold: and it had also a
rawishnesse in it, as if the fat required boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or further Cookery; which yet I felt
not upon eating either the nuts, or paste of
<hi>Cacao.</hi> Or else it was because that the
warmth of the water causeth a more <hi>absolute
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93331:22"/>
commixture</hi> of the parts, which may prevent,
as well as of those, which may cause nauseous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Or it was because that many things
may be taken hot without offence, or distast,
which cannot be so, when cold: the heat of
the <hi>vehicle</hi> either correcting the potion, or
corroborating the stomach.</p>
            <p>I took also some simple <hi>Cacao paste,</hi> and
put it into cold water, and set it on a
<hi>gentle fire,</hi> stirring it with a spoon till it was
dissolved: I suffered it to boil gently, and
kept it all day in such a posture, that it did
either boil, or continued boiling hot, but
rather the latter. After it had stood seven

I observed they grew to a larger size, yet

them a distinct fattinesse to be seen. And
in the end, I perceived a new body to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it self in great quantities; it was not

taste, and nature participated more of <hi>mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:93331:22"/>
These fatty Particles I could not

a spoon (for I never milled them) into

were bigger then others, and at last some of
them did enlarge themselves into a size as
broad as a Groat, and of an indifferent depth,
or thicknesse: yet could I not stir these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one or more bigger masses. Whereupon
I set it to cool: and it was long before these
bodies of oil, &amp; fat, did harden, and disappear
out of their former shape: so that I thought
I had resolved it into Oil, since no Cream
was to be seen. But being called away by
business (which permitted me not the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

no Cream, nor other body to overcast the

were bigger, thicker, and broader, and

Figure. They were very solid, and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the tongue totally, as Fat, or Butter
would, or Clarified Deer's-suet, to which
they were equal in hardnesse: they had
(as I and others judged) a farewell or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

that I observed, that no dissolution could to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally

               <p>It is manifest by is effects, and other
signes, that, as to its intrinseck Qualities,
it is of a temperate Nature. Its substance
is made up of some subtle, and some gross
parts; which sort of mixture is observable
in many other products of Nature. This
<hi>Cacao</hi> nut is first beaten to powder, then
without any accessional [but a gentle heat
on a stone, or iron-table, or mortar] it is
worked laboriously into a mass, or paste.
Which, since it is done without the addition
of any other thing, it is an evident Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93331:29"/>
that there is in it a tenacious and
bituminous Substance. The mixture of

others, by eating raw, or rosted
Nuts, or crushed into confects with Sugar,
(much used by the <hi>Indian</hi> women) may
fall into tedious obstructions of the Spleen,

these inconveniencies happen, because it is

            <p>I have already shewed, that our Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in <hi>England</hi> in my <hi>self,</hi> and others,
(some being <hi>well,</hi> some being <hi>sickly</hi>) doth
not evidence the <hi>Nut</hi> eaten of it self (not

or clogging to the Stomach: and,
whereas it is attributed to the grinding,
and so commixing the parts, that it keeps
the body soluble, our Experience shews,
that even the <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whereas it is said by some, that the <hi>Nut</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:93331:30"/>
in Paste dissolved into water is of an <hi>hot</hi>
as well as <hi>moist</hi> nature: I must propose
some doubts thereto, since it is so good in
<hi>fevers,</hi> and to quench thirst at other times;
and is so repugnant to <hi>cold Stomachs</hi> (a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
calamity in hot Climates) that the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>English</hi> generally are inforced to mix
with it either <hi>long Pepper,</hi> or <hi>Iamaica</hi>-Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or <hi>red Pepper</hi> call'd <hi>Chilli,</hi> to make it
supportable to their Stomachs: and Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
otherwise of unquestionable strength, and
health, have assured me upon their own
experience, that this is <hi>true.</hi> Besides, it is
a known Experiment both in <hi>Spain,</hi> and
the <hi>Indies,</hi> that the <hi>butyrous</hi> and <hi>oily</hi> part
of the <hi>Cacao nut,</hi> being taken of, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
from the <hi>Chocolata,</hi> or otherwise
drawn, is a very great remedy against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations,
and particularly the <hi>Erisipelas,</hi>
or fire of St. <hi>Anthony.</hi> And in such appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
it is <hi>sensibly cooling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, let men debate eternally the
<hi>temperament</hi> of the <hi>Nut,</hi> they, who have
ascribed to it <hi>Qualities</hi> altogether <hi>repugnant
to nutriment,</hi> have never controverted its
incredible <hi>nutritive</hi> faculty. It is in this
that all agree. It is <hi>multi alimenti,</hi> yields
plentious nourishment, saith <hi>Hernandez;</hi>
who holds it to be <hi>temperate,</hi> or <hi>inclining
to cold and moisture. Io. de Laet</hi> saith of it,
<hi>refrigerat, &amp; nutrit insigniter,</hi> it cools, and
nourishes exceedingly. Dr. <hi>Iuanes de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denas</hi>
professeth, that it yields <hi>buen sustento
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93331:31"/>
al cuerpo,</hi> good nourishment for the body.
And <hi>Roblez,</hi> who concurs in opinion with
the other, that it is <hi>cold,</hi> and <hi>dry,</hi> declares
it to be <hi>summamente alimentoso,</hi> exceeding
nutritive. And <hi>Benzonus</hi> gives it this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
<hi>Ea Caelia sapore aliquantùm amaro
satiat, &amp; refrigerat corpus minimè tamen,

its bitterish taste <hi>satisfies,</hi> and <hi>cools</hi> the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
not intoxicating any way the Head.</q>
And it is observable, that albeit the eating
of <hi>Cullises,</hi> and <hi>Iellies</hi> continually, doth so
debilitate the Stomach, that, thorough much
use of the former, men become incapable
to digest any grosser meats: of the verity of

wherewith they give to the <hi>Chocolata</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

being extraordinary strengthning for

that it resembles the <hi>Vagnuila</hi> or <hi>sheath</hi> of a
<hi>little Sword;</hi> it much resembles the Cod of
a French-bean in length, and shape; it hath
in it a small Seed, which fills it from one end
to the other, of a blackish colour, but very
subtle parts, and scent. It is observable, that
one <hi>Spanish</hi> Writer makes it to be <hi>hot in the

dry in the first Degree.</hi> Such Contradictions
are usual in Writers of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and not
much to be regarded further, then as the
resueries of men too Methodical, or as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues

shall consult his Senses, and observe the

will by many degrees separate and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish

these powerful effects are not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents

digested, in a Country, whose Climate yields☞
an uninterrupted temperature of Heat to its
production: from whence we may once for

Painters. The same is also used in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
being of a cold Quality. Being mix'd

            <p>I have shewed the Opinion of such, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
its being cold even in the third De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:

            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Achiote,</hi> or <hi>Viza,</hi> as it is call'd by the
<hi>Indians,</hi> is used by the Natives in their
meats instead of Saffron. It is hot, and
destructive to our natural heat, it offends
the spiritual parts, it weakens the Liver,
it is beyond measure flatulent, and windy;
because its heat and moisture equals the
second or third Degree: it raiseth gross Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
it causes a tension in the <hi>Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria:</hi>
they say, it is good to ease Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers

the <hi>Chocolata,</hi> which comes from <hi>New-Spain,</hi>
and <hi>Guatemala,</hi> is fill'd with this horrible
Ingredient, Christen'd with the name of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiote,</hi>
and Physicians ought to give advice,
lest people use it in too great a quantity,
and with excess: because I am undoubtedly
assured that it insensibly consumesus [<hi>the</hi>
Spanish <hi>is not to be expressed, I think, more
fittingly</hi>] and creates in us many other
evil Distempers: and therefore it ought to
be restrained by publick Authority. I
suppose it to be hot in the third Degree,
and moist in the second: for its Quality it
is repugnant to our nature.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It may seem very strange how so learned

for <hi>Hernandez:</hi> as being evidently cooling
(though not to that Degree) and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
adstringent; though the coldness and
adstringency sensibly differ, according as it
is better or worse prepared: I mean ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the taste, for I have yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented
it no further. If we consider
its Effects, such as have been related, they
seem still to oppose <hi>Roblez,</hi> and assert its
cooling, and adstringency. As to that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
which he maketh it to have with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, the universal experience of
the <hi>Indies</hi> (and of all, that use it; suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the <hi>Achiote</hi> rightly prepared) parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
of <hi>Brasile, New-Spain,</hi> and <hi>Guatima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
in the latter of which <hi>Chocolata</hi> hath
been <hi>immemorially</hi> drunk, and in both which
places it is the general and famed Drink,
doth refute him. Nor is every thing,
that is hot and moist in the third Degree,
to be exterminated Physick, as destructive
to our nature. What Apology then can we
make for so learned and observing a man?
The principal excuse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I can make for

of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who it seems are as

observed, what is also granted by <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez;</hi>
That, however it had <hi>cooling</hi> and

effects of it, who do give it to their Patients,
to cut and attenuate gross Humours, which do
cause shortness of breath, and stopping of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine:
and so it is used for any kind of Oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and is given for the stoppings, which

<hi>Roblez</hi> attributes to

said it upon that
ground: but that

that from a parity
of Effects one may
argue a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of Causes, is
an errour in Physick. And in that he saith,

to the nature of Man;</hi> I suppose, it being
granted to have a <hi>diuretique</hi> and <hi>diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique

            <p>1. THat there ought to be a great care in
the due choice of the <hi>Cacao</hi> nut. For
there is a great variety in the <hi>nature</hi> and
<hi>taste</hi> of the <hi>Nut:</hi> some are <hi>bitterer</hi> then
others, some are more <hi>oily</hi> and <hi>nourishing</hi>
then others. Thus those of <hi>Carraca,</hi> or
<hi>Nicarag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a,</hi> were chosen by me to prepare
<hi>Chocolata</hi> for His Majesty, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that I had seen some from <hi>Iamaica,</hi> that
were very well <hi>tasted,</hi> and well <hi>cured:</hi> for
there is not only a great difference in the
growth and nature of the <hi>Nuts,</hi> but in the
<hi>curing</hi> of them; for, if they be not gathered
in due tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and well sweated after they are
gathered, and that upon Mats, not Boards,
(for the Mat dries up the sweat better, then
the Board, in which whilst they soak, the
<hi>Phl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gm</hi> is re-imbibed by the Nut, and the
<hi>oily</hi> parts not sufficiently exalted, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested)
the Nuts are not so good, as that
we should expect any great excellency from
the <hi>Chocolata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That there ought to be a great care in the
Picking, Garbling, and preparing the Nuts.
It is not sufficient to choose Nuts of a good
age, and growth; old, but not decayed:
(for these are most <hi>oily</hi>) nor to cast away
such, as are apparently corrupt: but having
dryed them (in the doing of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
you burn them not; and so <hi>imbitter</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:93331:44"/>
the Composition) you must <hi>hull</hi> them, and
then <hi>pick</hi> them, casting away all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and musty ones; for, if you be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
herein, the <hi>Chocolata</hi> will in a little
time shew it self to be musty, and decay.
I had once some new <hi>Chocolata</hi> shew'd me,
to ask my judgment of: and it seemed to
me then very pleasant, and good: within a
fortnight after, I tasted it, and it was <hi>good
for nothing;</hi> so musty was it, after it had
fermented a while by standing: yet was it
carefully kept. It is usual amongst the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colata-makers</hi>
to repute those Nuts good,
and sound, which are blackish, and not
musty, nor rotten; though upon breaking of
the Nut, in the several divisions and parts
there be in <hi>intercurrent hoariness,</hi> which will
vanish at their drying: but I suppose all
rational Persons will grant, that that is a
<hi>tendency to corruption;</hi> and any curious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server
will distinguish those Nuts from such,
as have not the least <hi>inchoated</hi> decay, by
the taste. After all this garbling, they
must be well beaten to powder, and finely
searced, or else the <hi>Paste</hi> will not be <hi>good:</hi>
for, although, in the <hi>grinding,</hi> they will mix,
and melt into a <hi>Paste,</hi> yet will not that
<hi>Paste</hi> consist of so <hi>small Particles,</hi> as when
<hi>searced;</hi> and consequently not dissolve so
well in the <hi>Potion,</hi> as otherwise it would.</p>
            <p>And after it is thus prepar'd, in the grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it there is much of Art: I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
excepted against the making it in a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93331:45"/>
Mortar, or on an Iron Table; the only way
to moderate the heat, and to preserve it from
discolouring (by the iron) or running too
fast into oyl, whereby it is made unfit to
keep; and also some parts unequally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
the <hi>Spices</hi> mix not well, and it is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated
in the making up before a sufficient
incorporation, and never ferments right,
nor attains its perfect gust.</p>
            <p>I have already spoken concerning the
way of grinding the <hi>Spice,</hi> rather then beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; and that with this caution, that the
<hi>Spice</hi> be not only ground singly over, but
after ground all together, that so the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts</hi> of <hi>each individual Spice,</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient,
may operate upon the subtiliating
of the other; besides that hereby each is
more <hi>exquisitely commix'd,</hi> then by any other
☞way can be contrived.</p>
            <p>I am of the mind, that if there be any set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at all in the <hi>Chocolata</hi> Drink, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because the Nut is faulty, being <hi>ill-cured,
unripe, new,</hi> or <hi>corrupt,</hi> and so its
parts dissolve not into oyl, but sever them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or because it is not well beaten, and
<hi>searced;</hi> or made up <hi>too hot,</hi> and so hastily
dispatched, because some parts <hi>dissolve too
much,</hi> and others <hi>not at all:</hi> or the <hi>Spice</hi> is not
<hi>well beaten,</hi> and incorporated; or by reason of
some other Mixture: for otherwise there will
not be any Setling at all, nor any such <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrious
parts,</hi> as some besides the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
do imagine. This is to be understood of the
<hi>Chocolata</hi> being <hi>hot:</hi> for, if it <hi>cool,</hi> the <hi>pores</hi> of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93331:45"/>
the water, being fill'd with a <hi>sufficient propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of Particles, do precipitate the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
Corpuscles to the bottom; as do
other liquors in the like case. To prevent
this discovery, the <hi>Chocolata-sellers</hi> mix an
egg or two or more with it, that so the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissolved,
or indissoluble parts may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the grossness of the Liquor.
The like is to be seen, when it is prepared
with Milk; which is a thicker body, and
will bear more and greater parts innatant,
then water: yet it is to be noted, that let
the best <hi>Chocolata</hi> be prepared milled, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milled,
and there will be a great discrepancy
in the <hi>innatant, supernatant,</hi> and <hi>subsiding</hi>
bodies; but in good <hi>Chocolata</hi> either there
is no <hi>setling,</hi> or <hi>remanence</hi> in the bottom
of the Cup you drink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it be indifferent
warm: or, if there be, it is not <hi>black,</hi> but
<hi>reddish</hi> and <hi>oily,</hi> and easie to be digested; the
contrary whereof is observable in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and <hi>Spanish,</hi> as well as <hi>Dutch Chocolata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since that the effect of <hi>Chocolata,</hi> as to
its <hi>nourishing nature</hi> depends upon the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o
nut,</hi> that <hi>Chocolata</hi> is best, which hath
most of it; all things else corresponding:
and that worst, as to the aforesaid end,
which hath least of it; though that be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to be supplyed by <hi>Almonds, Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts,
Pistaches;</hi> these last being <hi>more stopping,
less nourishing,</hi> and not <hi>dissolving in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
proportionably to the other.</p>
            <p>Since that the <hi>Paste</hi> must be <hi>well work'd,</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:93331:46"/>
and that the excellency of <hi>Chocolata</hi> lies
in that the parts of the <hi>Cacao nut,</hi> being
not <hi>too much dissolved into an oyl;</hi> for then
it will not keep; nor endure the heat of
your hand, or pocket (especialy in <hi>Cakes</hi>)
but melt; and yet must be kept in a <hi>box,</hi> or
<hi>place</hi> temperately hot, and free from <hi>moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi>
or it will <hi>mould</hi> and <hi>decay:</hi> or, in
that the said parts of the <hi>Cacao</hi> nut be
sufficiently dissolved; for otherwise it will
keep neither (in <hi>England,</hi> without care)
nor ferment well, and attain its delicate
taste; but yield a setling: Upon this score
it seems to follow, that neither the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in of <hi>Orange-flower water,</hi> nor <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
oyls,</hi> into it at its making up, is <hi>good:</hi>
for it hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ders it in the <hi>working,</hi> to be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
dissolved; or causeth it to <hi>dissolve too
much:</hi> nor could I ever yet see any with
those <hi>oyls</hi> in it, which would keep or <hi>carry
well</hi> (especially in <hi>Cakes:</hi>) but thsi is not
the only reason against them.</p>
            <p>For, if to <hi>Stomachs,</hi> that are in <hi>perfect
health,</hi> and of a good temper, it be <hi>prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi>
to give things too <hi>hot,</hi> and qualified
rather to <hi>dissipate</hi> then <hi>continue the vigour
of the Spirits;</hi> and such are <hi>Chymical oyls,</hi>
and <hi>hot Spices</hi> in a great proportion: hence

which is brought as the richest from <hi>Spain,</hi>

so pleased him above any, that <hi>Spain,</hi> or

so, we are to have regard to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

be new, it is not come to its Maturity, nor
attained that perfection, which is to be gain'd
by long Digestion, and Fermentation; it
being observed, that several Compounds
(which is demonstrable in <hi>Treacle,</hi> and

a long Fermentation, distinct from what
the several Ingredients new put together
have: nor is this benefit of Fermentation to
be denyed to <hi>Chocolata</hi> (though it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

well ordered, and proportioned) since we
experience it in the <hi>good Chocolata,</hi> that it

(which I suppose to be all one with
the <hi>Paniso</hi>) incorporated; and in time of
use it was dissolved in <hi>Atolle,</hi> (which <hi>what</hi>
it is I have already told) and that this
was refrigerating, and very alimentous, is
undubitable. The <hi>Achiote, Orichelas,</hi> and
<hi>Vaynillas,</hi> were not ordinary Ingredients,
but occasionally put in, as People's Stomachs
could not bear the common Composition, it
being too cold, or too Uuctuous (and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing
of the Stomach) to Persons of a more
then ordinary debility of Stomach: and
according as they were more or less weak,
so they put in <hi>more mild Spices,</hi> as the <hi>Vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nillas,</hi>
&amp;c. or the more violent, as <hi>Agies,</hi>
or <hi>Guiny-pepper.</hi> So that I, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
about the <hi>Cacao</hi> Nut, may justly
seem to decline a repetition of what I have
said. And as to more elaborate Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
abstracting from the already declared
nature of the <hi>Cacao</hi> Nut, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
already related, or hinted, it
seems impossible to declare any great thing
concerning those, since their Compositions
are unknown, and not established by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
but the conjectures of <hi>Physicians,</hi> or
ignorant <hi>Chocolata-makers,</hi> who amass what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is good, or pleasant alone, to be an
Ingredient of this Composition. Which
course is very vain and foolish, since even
<hi>Cordials,</hi> and <hi>hot things</hi> (however effectual
in <hi>swoonings,</hi> or <hi>distempers of cold</hi> and <hi>winde</hi>)

the real use of <hi>Chocolata.</hi> The <hi>Indians,</hi> as
they used it for food, and daily aliment,
prepared it as aforesaid: upon occasion of
Fevers, and other hot Distempers, they made
some little alteration of it, suitable to the
disease, and so in Fluxes, and Dysenteries,
and imbecillity of Stomach. They put no
Sugar in it, nor otherwise enriched it in that
they ordinarily fed on; and to this day
they have not encreased their way beyond

of one Grandee, or eminent Lady,
must be propagated to be the entertainment
of others, whose indispositions require it not,
or whose healthy condition cannot bear it.
For it is not to be thought, that <hi>Gusman de

dissipates wind,—and a thousand
such like prefatory Discourses to endear to
them their mischief. This is that, which
hath occasioned that variety of <hi>Chocolata</hi> in
<hi>Spain,</hi> so that scarce two houses in <hi>Sevil</hi>
make it alike. And amongst us the case is
worse, since that the mixture of Chymical

give scope to <hi>Chocolata</hi> makers,

            <p>I thought it my duty to give publick no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
hereof, to the end, that Physicians might
be acquainted with the reason of the great

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93331:49"/>
might be cautioned against the following the
particular preparations of several persons,
who have sophisticated and spoiled one of
the most excellent and healthful drinks in the
world. It is true, that Physicians say how in
Alteratives there is little mistake in the dose,
or quantity: but this respects their being
given once, or but for a short time: and so
these alterative <hi>Chocolatas,</hi> being taken but
once, or seldom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> (if the Ingredients be not
violent, nor the body Cacochymical, nor
the season sickly) may little endammage the
sound; and as little amend the sick. But, if they
be often taken, or constantly by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paste,
it is not to be doubted, but how little
error soever be, or can be committed in the
dose, a great one will be committed in the
continuance, if either the body be health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
or possessed with a distemper not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
(or repugning to) the additional In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients

they have been damnified in their health;
their Rheums have been encreased by a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquation
of the humours, the palat of their
mouths being brought down by the keenness
of the <hi>Chiles</hi> acting on the <hi>glandules</hi> about the

sleep hath forsaken them. In fine, the issue
hath been altogether contrary to their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,

recommended it, hath, as well as his Patient,
entertained an ill opinion of the Drink,
whereas they ought to blame the <hi>Chocolata</hi>-makers,
who inform them not of the variety
of Ingredients, wherewith it is made.</p>
            <p>I come now to represent the virtues of the

would not have understood of the several
rich Compositions not authenticated by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,

is to be restrained to the plain <hi>Chocolata</hi> of

(and the last more or less plain, as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
served) or of what was not discrepant
from it by the mixture of any vehement Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> but the more milde
ones of <hi>America,</hi> as the <hi>Vaynillas, Iamaica</hi>-pepper,

within no unsuitable latitude, I shall report
their Characters promiscuously.</p>

Chocolata <hi>thus:</hi> Es una de las mas saludables, y

            <p>
               <q>It is one of the most wholesome and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Drinks, that have been discovered to
this day: because in the whole Drink there
is not one Ingredient put in, which is either
hurtful in it self, or by commixtion; but
all are cordial, and very beneficial to
our bodies, whether we be old, or young,
great with child, or others accustomed to a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93331:51"/>
sedentary life. And we ought not to drink,
or eat after the taking <hi>Chocolata;</hi> no nor to
use any exercise after it: but to rest for a
while after it without stirring. It must be
taken very hot.</q> ☞ This is the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of <hi>Chocolata</hi> with <hi>Achiote</hi> in it: for <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinandez</hi>
did much approve thereof.</p>
            <p>Dr. Iuanes de Barrios <hi>speaks thus of it:</hi>
Digo pues, que es menester considerar, que al

            <p>
               <q>I say, it is to be considered, that in the
beginning, when this Drink of <hi>Chocolata</hi>
came first to be used, it was made of fewer
Ingredients, and things, then it is now
made with; because the antient <hi>Indians</hi> of
<hi>Guatimala</hi> did not put into it them, as now:
nor is that to be marvelled ar, because in
meats, and drinks, and all manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
it is Natural for them not to be
begun, and perfected at once: but this
must be done by time, and practise; till
they arrive at that height of healthfulness,
and taste, which they get at length.</q> And,
having said this, he adds, <hi>Es comoda pues ellae
sola suple el almuerso, y algunas otras comidas,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93331:51"/>
por que con ella no es menester, pan, ni carne, nì

que no ai en las otras.</hi> 
               <q>It is good alone to
make up a breakfast, and supply other victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als;
because, having it, you need no further
meat, bread, or drink: and in a moment it
is prepared, which is not to be found in
others.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Iuanes de Cardenas <hi>concludes thus of
it:</hi> Y digo, que usado con esta advertencia, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <q>Having a curiosity to see to acquaint my
self with the Rarities of the <hi>Indies,</hi> at my
being there, I went to visit my Patients,
and being thirsty I used to call for some
water to allay my drought, and defect of
vital Spirits; at length by the perswasion
of the <hi>Indians</hi> I drank <hi>Chocolata,</hi> as being
more convenient to allay my thirst. And
indeed upon the drinking of it I found my
vehement desire of drink to leave me; and,
if I took <hi>Chocolata</hi> in a morning, I found it
did much corroborate and refresh my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.
By the continual use of which
drink I, and several with me, became fat;
notwithstanding that most of the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
except <hi>Cacae-nuts,</hi> and <hi>Maiz,</hi> be hot
and dry in the third Degree, and seem more
ready to extenuate. But the reason is, for
that the unctuous and butyrous parts of
the <hi>Cacao-nut</hi> do fatten, whileft the other
Ingredients serve only as vehicles, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute
those other to the Liver, and thence
to the whole body.</q> This is the account he

               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:93331:54"/>
Mr. <hi>Gage</hi> chap. 16, tells us of it: <q>That
where it is so much used, the most, if not
all of them, as well in the <hi>Indies,</hi> as in
<hi>Spain, Italy, Flanders,</hi> (which is a cold
Country) finde, that it agreeth well with
them. True it is, that it is used more in
the <hi>Indies,</hi> then in the <hi>European</hi> parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there their Stomachs are more apt
to faint then here, and a cup of <hi>Chocolatte</hi>
well confectioned comforts and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
the Stomach. For my self, I must say,
I used it twelve years constantly, drinking
one cup in the Morning, another yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Diner, between nine and ten of
the Clock; another within an hour or
two after Diner, and another between
four and five in the afternoon, and when
I was purposed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it up late to Study,
I would take another cup about seven or
eight at night, which would keep me
waking till midnight. And, if by chance
I did neglect any of these accustomed hours,
I presently found my Stomach fainty.
And with this custome I lived twelve
years in those parts healthy, without any
Obstructions, or Oppilations, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what either Ague or Fever was. Yet
I will not dare to regulate by mine own
the Bodies of others, nor take upon m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
the skill of a Physician, to appoint, and
define, at what time, and by what Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
it may be used. Only I say, I have
known some, that have been the worse
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93331:55"/>
for it, either for drinking it with too
much Sugar, which hath relaxed their
Stomachs, or for drinking it too often: for
certainly, if it be drunk beyond measure,
not only this <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> but all other
Drinks, how innocent soever, may be
hurtfull. And if some have found it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilative,
it hath come by the too too
much use of it. As when one drinks o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch
Wine, instead of comforting
and warming himself, he breeds and
nourishes cold Diseases; because Nature
cannot overcome it, nor turn so great a
quantity into good nourishment. So he,
that drinks much <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> which hath
fat parts, cannot make distribution of so
great a quantity to all the parts: and
that part, which remains in the slender
Veins of the Liver, must needs cause Oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
☞and Obstructions. But lastly, to
conclude with this <hi>Indian</hi> drink, I will
add what I have heard Physicians of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
say of it, and have seen it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in others (though never could I find
it in my self) that those, that use this <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colatte</hi>
much, grow fat, and corpulent
by it: which indeed may seem hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
for considering, that all the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,
except the <hi>Cacao,</hi> do rather exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
then make fat, because they are
hot in the third Degree. And we have
already said, that the Qualities, which do
predominate in the <hi>Cacao,</hi> are cold, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93331:55"/>
dry, which are very unfit to add any
substance to the body. Nevertheless it
may be answered, that the many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous
parts, which have been proved to
be in the <hi>Cacao,</hi> are those, which pingue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
and make fat: and the hotter Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
of this Composition serve for a
guide, or Vehicle, to pass to the Liver,
and the other parts, untill they come to
the fleshy parts: and there finding a like
substance, which is hot, and moist, as is the
unctuous part, converting it self into
the same substance, it doth augment, and
pinguefie.</q> Hereupon he recommends it
to the <hi>English,</hi> to be drunk by them: I
shall not instance many Testimonies out of
him, to evince its general use among the
<hi>Indians;</hi> besides what he sayes in the <hi>Chapter</hi>
already cited, in his Relations of <hi>Guate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mala,</hi>
and <hi>Chiapa,</hi> the mentioneth their use
of it, more then once: and speaking of
<hi>Chiapa</hi> (chap. 15.) he hath this following
Story, which because it evidenceth the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
the <hi>Spanish Dames</hi> have of <hi>Chocolatte,</hi>
I shall insert at large.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The Women of <hi>Chiapa</hi> pretend much
weakness and squeamishness of Stomach,
which they say is so great, that they are
not able to continue in the Church,
whilst a Mass is briefly hudled over, much
less whilst a Solemn high-Mass is sung,
and a Sermon preached, unless they drink
a cup of hot <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> and eat a bit of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93331:56"/>
Sweat-meats to strengthen their Stomachs.
For this purpose it was much used by them
to make their Maids bring them to Church
in the middle of Mass, or Sermon, a cup of
<hi>Chocolatte,</hi> which could not be done to
all, or most of them, without a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
and interrupting both of Mass, and
Sermon. The Bishop, perceiving this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse,
and having given fair warning for
the omitting of it, but all without an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment,
thought fit to fix in writing
☞an Excommunication upon the Church-doors
against all such, as should presume at
the time of Service to eat or drink with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Church. This Excommunication
was taken ill by all, but especially the
Gentle-women much to heart, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
if they might not eat or drink in the
Church, they could not continue in it to
hear what otherwise they were bound
unto. The chief of them knowing what
great friendship there was between the
Bishop, and the Prior, and my self, came
to the Prior, and me, desiring us to use all
means we could with the Bishop for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
that his Excommunication so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
laid upon them, and threatening their
Souls with damning judgment for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation
of it. The good Prior and my self
laboured all we could, alledging the custome
of the Country, the weakness of the Sex,
whom it most concern'd, and also the
weakness of their Stomachs, the contempt,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93331:56"/>
that might ensue from them unto his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and many inconveniencies, which
might follow, to the breeding of an uproa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
in the Church, and in the City, whereof
we had some probable conjecture from
what already we had heard from some. But
none of these would move the Bishop; to
which he answered, that he preferred the
honour of God, and of his house, before
his own life. The women, seeing him so
hard to be intreated, began to stomach
him the more, and to sleight him with
scornful and reproachful words; others
sleighted his Excommunication, drinking
in iniquity in the Church, as the Fish doth
Water, which caused one day such an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar
in the Cathedral, that many Swords
were drawn against the Priests, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends,
who attempted to take away from
the Maids the cups of <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> which
they brought to their Mistresses: who at
last seeing, that neither fair nor foul means
would prevail with the Bishop, resolved to
forsake the Cathedral, where the Bishop's
own, and the Prebends eyes must needs be
watching over them; and so from that
time most of the City betook themselves to
the Cloyster-Churches, where by the
Nuns and Friers they were not troubled,
nor resisted, though fairly counselled to
obey the command of the Bishop; whose
name now they could not brook, and to
whose Prebends they denyed now all such
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93331:57"/>
relief and stipend for Masses, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they had used to bestow upon them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
them all upon the Friers, who
grew rich by the poor impoverish'd Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral.
This lasted not long, but the Bishop
began to stomach the Friers, and set up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Excommunication, binding all the
City to resort unto their own Cathedral
Church, which the Women would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
but kept their houses for a whole
moneth: in which time the Bishop fell dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously
sick, and desired to retire himself
to the Cloister of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> for the
great confidence he had in the Prior, that
he would take care of him in his sickness,
Physicians were sent for far and near, who
all with a joint opinion agreed, that the
Bishop was poysoned, and he himself doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not of it at his death, praying unto
God to forgive those, that had been the
cause of it, and to accept of that Sacrifice
of his life, which he was willing to offer for
the zeal of God's house, and honour. He
lay not above a week in the Cloister, and
as soon as he was dead, all his body, face,
and head did swell, that the least touch
upon any part of him caused the skin to
break, and cast out white matter, which
had corrupted, and overflown all his body.
A Gentle-woman, with whom I was well
acquainted in the City, who was noted to
be somewhat too familiar with one of the
Bishop's Pages, was commonly censured to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93331:57"/>
have prescribed such a Cup of <hi>Chocolatte</hi>
to be ministred by the Page, which poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, who so rigorously had forbidden
<hi>Chocolatte</hi> to be drunk in the Church. My
self heard this Gentle-woman say of the
Deceased Bishop, that she thought few
grieved for his Death; and that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
had no reason to grieve for him, and
that she judged he being such an Enemy
to <hi>Chocolatte</hi> in the Church, that, which
he had drunk at home in his house, had
not agreed with his Body. And it became
afterwards a Proverb in that Country,
<hi>Beware of the</hi> Chocolatte <hi>of</hi> Chiapa. Which
made me so cautious, that I would not
drink afterwards in any house, where I had
not very great satisfaction of the whole
Family.</p>

it, so he manifests a great regard to
the Testimony of <hi>Experience,</hi> which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vows
to be so favourable for <hi>Chocolata,</hi> that
there is not one, who doth drink it, and
doth not feel himself to be manifestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed,
and strengthened, as well as delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by it: and that, whereas none hath been
known to live above seven dayes by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing☜
Wine alone, one may live moneths,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93331:58"/>
and years, using nothing but <hi>Chocolata.</hi> In
fine, he himself saw a Childe weaned, which
could not be brought by any Artifice to take
any food, and for four moneths space he
was preserved alive by giving him <hi>Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata</hi>
only, mixing now and then some
crumbs of bread therewith. <hi>So powerfull a
virtue hath it to nourish, and strengthen.</hi> Nor
doth he allow it for food alone, and the
preservation of Life, but medicinally, as a
thing, that is advantageous to health; for
he gives this Character to a preparation of

            </argument>
            <p>I Think I have sufficiently (at least accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my present leasure, and the unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyable
want of my own Library, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections)
manifested the effects of <hi>Chocolata:</hi>
I shall now treat of the way of preparing it
into Drink, when any hath occasion to use
it. And because that the Composition it self
is of the <hi>Indian</hi> discovery, as I have hitherto
still directed my inquiries by searching into
their Usages and Opinions concerning the
several Ingredients, so I shall now begin
with a recital of the several ways they use to
prepare it into Drink: and for this I have
the most accurate account from<note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Mr. Gage,</hi>
(who yet seems to transcribe <hi>Ledesma</hi>)
whom I shall therefore transcribe, with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93331:60"/>
such Animadversions, as may seem perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
            <p>The manner of Drinking it is
divers. The one (<hi>being the way,
which is used in</hi> Mexico) is to take
it hot with <hi>Atolle,</hi> dissolving a
Tablet in hot Water, and then stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it, and beating it in the Cup,
where it is to be drunk, with a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linet,
and, when it is well stirred to
a scum, or froth, then to fill the
Cup with hot <hi>Atolle,</hi> and so drink
it sup by sup.</p>
            <p>This way of preparing it may seem (since
it is the way of <hi>Mexico</hi>) to have been the way,
that <hi>Motezuma</hi> treated <hi>Bernaldus del Castillo</hi>
with, when he caused to be brought forth
<hi>jarros grandes hechos de buen</hi> Cacao, <hi>con su
espuma,</hi> 
               <q>great jarrs made with good <hi>Cacao,</hi>
with its froth.</q> It is not to be questioned,
but that the pure <hi>Cacao</hi>-paste, well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
in hot water, and long, and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agitated with a Molinet, will raise a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
(but not lasting) Froth, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to what, with less agitation, is seen
where Eggs entire, or Yolks alone, are put
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93331:60"/>
in: much more perhaps it may froth, if
that Paste had <hi>Pochol</hi> or <hi>Paniso</hi> grains mixed
with it; or, if being well milled before, it
were a second time milled upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
of the <hi>Atolle:</hi> for the <hi>Maiz</hi> flower
would make it froth much; and it is from the
commixture of <hi>Maiz,</hi> or <hi>Bean-flower,</hi> (or
perhaps some other substitute) that some
<hi>Chocolata</hi> doth now froth more then others;
though the difference in the milling likewise
produce a variety. I have already explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
what <hi>Atolle</hi> is, in the beginning, and so
shall not repeat it; but onely add, that, from
this way of the <hi>Indians</hi> using it, our Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
may order it to be drunk with streined
Water-gruel, Almond-milk, or <hi>cremore ptisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi>
or any other mixture they please, that is
more, or less nourishing, as they please;
ordering the <hi>Chocolata</hi> according to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
Method: concerning which <hi>Dr.
Iuanes de Barrios</hi> gives this admonition,
<hi>Para hombres y mugeres Sanguineos no se tome
con</hi> Atole, <hi>por que aumenta la sangre; sino
con aqua, poco anis,</hi> Chile, <hi>y acucar, y mingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas
especies Aromaticas, ni cosas de olor. Y para
los Flegmaticos se haga con todos los Ingredien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
que avemos dicho, o con mas especies de lo
ordinario, y se tome mui caliente. Y en los
Melancholicos, que se haga sin</hi> Chile, <hi>poco
anis, y con coras de buen olor, y que se tome
tibio.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>For men and women of a Sanguine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
it is not to be taken with <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>olle,</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:93331:61"/>
because it multiplyeth Blood in the body;
but with Water, a little Anise-seeds, <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
and Sugar, but no Spicery is to be put in,
nor sweet scented things, for such persons.
But, for the Phlegmatick, let it be made
with all the Ingredients used in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
or with a greater quantity of Spices, then
is ordinary, and let it be taken very hot.
And, for the Melancholy persons, see it be
made without <hi>Chiles,</hi> with a few Anise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeds,
and with Ingredients of a sweet smell,
and taking it luke-warm.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Which Caution may not only direct us as
to <hi>Atolle,</hi> which is not to be made, or used
in <hi>England;</hi> but illustrates and confirms an
Animadversion of mine formerly laid down:
<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>according to the several tempers and
☞distempers of persons there ought to be framed
variety of</hi> Chocolata; and that to be given
variously, as the discreet Physician shall
propose; and this is agreeable (you see) to
the procedure of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another way of drinking <hi>Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latte</hi>
is, that the <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> being
dissolved with cold water, and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the Molinet, and the scum
taken of, and put into another vessel,
the remainder be set on the fire, with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93331:61"/>
as much Sugar, as will sweeten it,
and when it is warm, then to poure
it on the scum, which was taken of
before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so drink it.</p>
            <p>I understand not the reason of this proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure;
unless it be for ornament sake: it
looking more pleasantly being thus ordered,
then if the water were hot, and milled to a
froth with <hi>Chocolata,</hi> and so drunk. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
yet strange, that the <hi>Cacao</hi>-paste, being
milled well with cold water, will froth as
much, and yield as plentiful a scum, or cream
upon setling, as it will do if it were milled
in hot water: and I have shewed how that
cream is fat, and the water also is fatty
(though cold) in which it is milled, but it
comes not to that red colour, which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath, which is prepared hot. This
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eum being taken of, and the rest heated,
and put to it (pouring it on high) makes
it look more pleasantly on the top, then if
it were a bare solution of the <hi>Cacao</hi>-paste,
(which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will dissolve in it, so as not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
any setling almost, whilest it is
hot) and the <hi>Cacao</hi>-paste which remains
(after the froth is taken of) to be heated
dissolves sufficiently in the water by meer
heating, without milling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:93331:62"/>
Besides these ways, there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
way (which is much used
in the Island of <hi>Santo Domingo</hi>)
which is to put the <hi>Chocolatte</hi> into
a Pipkin with a little water, and to
let it boil well, till it be dissolved,
and then to put in sufficient Water,
and Sugar, according to the quantity
of the <hi>Chocolatte,</hi> and then to boil it
again untill there comes an oily
scum on it, and then to drink it.</p>
            <p>This way I was at first much pleased
with,<note place="margin">Since the writing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I did try it in some of my own <hi>Chocola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and it was very pleasing, and more <hi>rightly fat</hi> then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; but I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Spice had a more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment heat, and taste, then otherwise: which happened either because the <hi>boiling</hi> added a sharpness to them; or that the <hi>compages</hi> or body of the Composition was more laxed, then otherwise: for not being mill'd, it did not seem so well commix'd, as otherwise.</note> and upon tryal I found, that it did more
perfectly dissolve the Nut then any, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
it into a perfect <hi>fatty broth,</hi> which did
not at all offend my Stomach: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that it did not offend mine, yet I
fear, that neither the adstringent bitterness
of the <hi>Cacao-paste</hi> (which alone I drunk)
nor the aid of <hi>Achiote, Sugar,</hi> and <hi>Spices</hi>
(which may loose their virtue by <hi>boiling,</hi>
and are not used by the <hi>Indians</hi>) will render
it supportable to tender Stomachs; so <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
unctuous</hi> is the broth, or <hi>Drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:93331:62"/>
But the most ordinary way is,
to warm the water very hot, and
then to poure out half the cup-full,
that you mean to drink; and to
put into it a Tablet, or two, or as
much, as will thicken reasonably
the water, and then grind it well
with a Molinet, and when it is well
ground, and risen well to a scum, to
fill up the cup with hot water, and
so drink it by sups (having sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
it with Sugar) and to eat it
with a little Conserve, or Maple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread,
steeped into the <hi>Chocolatte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this last way Mr. <hi>Gage</hi> saith not only,
that it is the most used, but that <hi>certainly
it doth no harm,</hi> and he recommends it to
the practise of the <hi>English:</hi> he gives no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why the <hi>Chocolata</hi> may not be milled
<hi>with all,</hi> but a part of the <hi>hot water;</hi> nor do
I apprehend any, except that the <hi>vessel,</hi> in
which it is made, may be so little, as that it
may not be able to contain the <hi>whole liquour</hi>
to be milled, and prepared: for it must be
done in a pretty <hi>deep vessel,</hi> that it may
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93331:63"/>
have room to dash about the sides, without
<hi>flying out,</hi> or <hi>running over,</hi> as it is mill'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Otherwise I think no man will believe, that
there can be so equal and due commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the <hi>Chocolata-drink,</hi> if one half on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be mill'd, and the other half of water
poured to it; as if the whole were milled
together: and consequently, it cannot be
<hi>so good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore the way now used at <hi>Sevil</hi>
seems more rational, whereby it is thus
made. The <hi>Chocolata</hi>-cake in a <hi>due proportion</hi>
(that is, in my <hi>Chocolata,</hi> one ounce of <hi>Paste,</hi>
two ounces of <hi>Sugar,</hi> and eight of <hi>Water</hi>)
is dissolved in <hi>hot water;</hi> it never boiling
at the fire after the <hi>Chocolata</hi> is put in; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(say they) it will
by boiling grow<note n="b" place="margin">I am sure, that the <hi>simple Cacao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paste</hi> sowres not by <hi>boiling</hi> long, and several times; no not my <hi>compound Chocolata:</hi> but it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that the <hi>Vaynillas, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian Roses,</hi> or some other Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in <hi>Spain</hi> may upon boiling give the <hi>drink a sowrish taste.</hi> Or it may subvert the Stomach by becoming too <hi>oily,</hi> or <hi>unctuous,</hi> as I observed before.</note> 
               <hi>sowrish,</hi>
or be so depraved as to
<hi>subvert the Stomach.</hi> Then
it is well milled, that it
may grow <hi>frothy,</hi> and <hi>fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
then it is powred out
into <hi>Xicharas,</hi> or <hi>Cups,</hi>
and so drunk hot. They
give a special Caution,
that after it hath been
<hi>once milled,</hi> if it <hi>cool</hi> again, it is not to be
heated and mill'd a <hi>second time,</hi> and so
drunk. Because, they say, it <hi>corrupts,</hi> and
<hi>sowres:</hi> and herein they avouch their <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi>
and desire no reason may be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
against it. This Caution, being given
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93331:63"/>
concerning the best <hi>Spanish Chocolata,</hi> and
which most resembleth mine, I could not
omit: and I am sure either it is not true,
(though we finde a difference in broths,
when twice heated) or it must arise from some
Ingredient (I suppose the <hi>Vaynillas</hi>) and
not from the <hi>Cacao,</hi> the <hi>simple paste</hi> whereof
I took and mill'd, and kept it several days,
and heated it again; and it was neither
<hi>sowre,</hi> nor offensive to my Stomach: and
I kept it three days longer, and then heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, milled it, and tasted it, and it varyed
not its relish, but was <hi>inoffensive,</hi> and <hi>free
from sowrishness.</hi> I <hi>boiled</hi> some of <hi>mine,</hi> and
drunk it <hi>cold,</hi> unmilled, without annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
and I know a <hi>Lady,</hi> that with success
boiled it twice. Here in <hi>England</hi> we are not
content with the plain <hi>Spanish</hi> way of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Chocolata</hi> with water: but they either
use milk alone; or <hi>half milk,</hi> and half <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit-water;</hi>
or else thicken the water (if
they mix no milk with it) with <hi>one</hi> or <hi>more
eggs</hi> put in entire, or <hi>yolks</hi> only into the
water, or where milk is mingled with the
water. In which way, as it is sold in the
<hi>Chocolata</hi>-houses, there are these inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences:
if it be done with milk, it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
for milk, being <hi>hot,</hi> and <hi>standing so,</hi> to
cast up a <hi>Scum;</hi> and, if it cool, it creams: so
that, if the <hi>Chocolata</hi> be kept after it is <hi>milled,</hi>
and not immediatly drunk, either upon

or else the usual one is diluted with <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dive</hi>

thus by way of <hi>alteration,</hi> as are other
<hi>alteratives,</hi> general Medicines being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised;
and every sixth day there is either

must be <hi>moderate:</hi> and this course is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
thirty, or at least twenty days, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely
<hi>till they be well:</hi> which they will
soon know, <hi>the pale recovering their colour,

amending its colour, and consistence: and all
Symptoms either mitigating, or ceasing. But,
if the Obstructions be inveterate, and too dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to be overcome by this method, then they
prescribe every day half a dram of</hi> Rhubarb
trochiscated <hi>to be mix'd with the</hi> Chocolata,

Sweet-meats, and loaf-sugar (whereof there
was no small store) untill at length he became

               <hi>West-Indies:</hi> and however
some disallow the use of it raw, or roasted,
others do repute it less obstructive, and
more wholsom then they judge it to be.
The <hi>Nut</hi> is of an exceeding <hi>fatty substance,</hi>
being viewed in a <hi>Microscope:</hi> in a <hi>Iamaica-nut</hi>
I could observe large and spreading
Veins or streaks of <hi>white fat,</hi> which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to make the fat, which appears upon
digesting, or boiling it without milling it.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93331:71"/>
Examining the <hi>Caraca-nut</hi> by a <hi>Microscope</hi>
I could observe nothing of <hi>fatty veins,</hi> or
<hi>streaks;</hi> yet is not that <hi>Nut</hi> leaner, then the
other: I know not whether I ought to call
it <hi>oyl,</hi> or <hi>fat;</hi> and for either appellation I
may be questioned: but, give it what name
you please, I dare avow, that one ounce of
<hi>Cacao-paste</hi> well <hi>digested</hi> will yield more
<hi>fat,</hi> then a pound of <hi>fat Beef,</hi> or <hi>Mutton,</hi>
even when stewed. Besides the <hi>fat,</hi> which
never so separates from the other parts, as
to lose totally its bitterness, whereby it is
preserved agreeable, and not <hi>nauseous to the
Stomach,</hi> there is a red part, which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
contains the bitter parts: it hath been
generally reputed as an <hi>earthy</hi> and <hi>obstructive</hi>
thing; but, without doubt, it is as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as any part of the <hi>Nut,</hi> and as little to
be rejected: for it is that part, which forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the Stomach, and enables it to bear the
<hi>oyliness</hi> or <hi>fattishness</hi> of the rest of the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colata-potion:</hi>
it preserves the taste in its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
and the appetite, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be dulled by the fatty potion: and as
it helps digestion in the Stomach; so in the
Guts, it promotes Concoction there; and
corroborates them: all which is not to be
denyed to parts of that relish, as we expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
daily in herbs of a <hi>bitterish taste:</hi>
nor need we to fear its <hi>costiveness;</hi> for, as
<hi>none ever experimented</hi> such an inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by taking good <hi>Chocolata,</hi> so I think
it impossible, it should bind; since it is <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:93331:71"/>
that we owe each stool to; and
it is impossible what promotes that in the
Guts, can ever create a prejudice by too
great an <hi>adstringency.</hi> It is strange, that all
Ages and Countries finde it to agree with
them, and the effects of it are such every
where, that it alone may seem to supply all
<hi>food</hi> and <hi>Physick.</hi> I have heard and read
Discourses of <hi>Panaceas,</hi> and <hi>Vniversal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines:</hi>
and truly I think <hi>Chocolata</hi> may
as justly at least pretend to that Title, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
For indubitably <hi>Health</hi> is nothing else
but <hi>an ability to discharge the several ends, to
which Nature hath designed us:</hi> and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the preserving each <hi>individual
person</hi> in the <hi>individual constitution,</hi> which
Nature hath given him. For howbeit, that
we propose to our selves the <hi>Idea</hi> (conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to what <hi>Polycletus</hi> did in another case)
of a man <hi>exactly tempered;</hi> yet it is not the
intent of a <hi>Physician</hi> to reduce every Patient
thereunto: to the <hi>Cholerick</hi> it is his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
not disease to be so; and so for the
other <hi>complexions:</hi> and to subvert the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
temperament,</hi> is to <hi>destroy,</hi> not to cure:
and the <hi>attempt</hi> will not succeed. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a Man herein, it is necessary, that his
food be such, as digests well, begets good
Blood and Spirits: and that this <hi>Blood</hi> (in
which according to the <hi>Scripture</hi> is the
<hi>life of Animals</hi>) be depurated so by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>emunctories,</hi> as that it may qualifie the
party to exercise those acts, the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93331:72"/>
whereof is an <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>life;</hi> and
the well-performance of them, <hi>Health.</hi> It is
natural for the <hi>Blood</hi> to purge it self by
several ways; and, if that be done, all the
<hi>Operations</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and the intermissions of
any of them, will be according to <hi>Nature.</hi>
To imagine, that this can be performed by
<hi>Medicines,</hi> is an impertinent folly: the Blood
is more <hi>naturally purg'd</hi> by <hi>transpiration,</hi>
and <hi>sweat;</hi> by <hi>urine,</hi> and <hi>siege</hi> duely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd;
by <hi>spittle,</hi> and <hi>snot;</hi> then by any
<hi>Purges,</hi> or <hi>Vomits,</hi> or <hi>Electuaries,</hi> or <hi>Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy.</hi>
It is not to be done much less by one
<hi>Medicine;</hi> for though such an <hi>Arcanum</hi> were
in being, as would depurate the Blood, and
revive the decayed <hi>ferments</hi> of Nature: yet
would it require other circumstances to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
this, as a <hi>moderation</hi> of <hi>Diet,</hi> and the
<hi>six</hi> things <hi>non-natural,</hi> &amp;c. without which
it can do no more on the <hi>blood,</hi> then the
<hi>mixture</hi> of <hi>barm</hi> doth to <hi>wort;</hi> it may be
ready to produce a <hi>fermentation,</hi> but it will
not <hi>open</hi> a <hi>bung-hole,</hi> or create <hi>vents</hi> for
the <hi>Drink.</hi> Frequent <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> hastens <hi>old
Age,</hi> besides other inconveniences: frequent
<hi>Purges</hi> are much worse; for it is usual with
<hi>Nature,</hi> when taught one course to pursue
that to the <hi>discontinuing</hi> of other <hi>evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
so that, to teach Nature to <hi>disburthen</hi>
her self into the <hi>Guts,</hi> and <hi>Stomach,</hi> (neither
of which are designed for Vehicles or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles
of Excrements <hi>remaining after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion,</hi>
or <hi>cast in there</hi> by <hi>Nature,</hi> but for a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93331:72"/>
               <hi>continued Concoction,</hi> prosecuted by Nature
from first to last) is to teach her to omit
her other <hi>evacuations,</hi> which are as <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as going to stool,</hi> and (which is more) to
accustom her to disburthen her ill Humours
into those parts, the <hi>right Tone</hi> whereof
is that, whereon principally <hi>Health</hi> depends.</p>
            <p>Let us consider, how our <hi>Palat</hi> and <hi>Taste</hi>
is disorder'd by the <hi>defluxion</hi> or <hi>redundancy</hi>
of an <hi>insipid Salt,</hi> or sharp and <hi>Vitrioline</hi>
Humour: let us examine the <hi>like inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,</hi>
when they befall the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and
by this <hi>Analogy conjecture</hi> at the effects, which
arise in the Guts upon the like accidents.
And can we think it prudence to use Nature
to discharge it self into that Chanel, so
often as we do? View the World, and you
will see, that not one of those, that constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take <hi>purging</hi> and <hi>opening Diet-drinks;</hi> that
deal so much in Pills of <hi>Scammony,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such like Purges; not one of them, but
is more or less <hi>Hypochondriacal:</hi> whereas
those <hi>Country-people,</hi> which <hi>sweat,</hi> and <hi>labour,</hi>
enjoy an <hi>undisturbed health, strength,</hi> and <hi>fresh
colour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To apply all this, since the nature of
Health is such, as I have described it to be;
and that it depends upon such means, as I
have specified; it is undenyable, that there
is not any thing hitherto extant in Physick,
that may compare with <hi>Chocolata,</hi> which
is not only <hi>mony</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> but food,
and Medicine too every where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It yields
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93331:73"/>
good nourishment, with this advantage,
(wherein it surpasses all <hi>Wines,</hi> and <hi>Cordial
Spirits</hi>) that its nourishment is not only
quick, but less dissipable then theirs. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth
such Blood, as fitly depurates it self
by <hi>Stool, Vrine, Spittle,</hi> and <hi>Sweat;</hi> as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
have observed in my self: and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
must profess it to be the Assertion of the
<hi>Indian</hi> Writers, ☞ that it <hi>opens Obstructions,
provokes Vrine,</hi> and <hi>Sweat.</hi> I dispute not its
<hi>temperament,</hi> be it <hi>hot,</hi> or <hi>cold,</hi> or <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestigable:</hi>
but I shall tell my own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
consonant to the <hi>Indian</hi> Discourses.
I never could finde any such effects, when I
took it mix'd with <hi>eggs,</hi> or <hi>milk:</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I like not much <hi>either of those ways,</hi> since
the <hi>Nut</hi> there seems to differ much from it
self, when prepared alone; as I observed in
the dressing of it with the <hi>Yolk:</hi> and the
same I have observed with the <hi>white,</hi> when
commix'd the ordinary way; though I must
needs say, that I have so put in, and mill'd
the whole <hi>egg,</hi> that the <hi>whites</hi> have never
curdled, though it hath been heated twice.
But, to pursue my inquiry into the truth of
the <hi>Indian</hi> assertion, I prepared it the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
and <hi>Spanish</hi> way, and walking upon it,
I felt my self to be seised with a gentle
sweat, or moisture, and moderately to
purge by <hi>Vrine,</hi> and to <hi>expectorate:</hi> and
this I finde constantly to befall me, if I take it
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93331:73"/>
so: and it less offends the Stomach, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshes</hi>
more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then any other way. Having been
lately at a Fish-diner, I found my self not
well after it; <hi>Coffee</hi> gave me no ease: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
encreased the Distemper; till I forced
my self to vomit several times: having done
so, I went to bed (it being night) and
drunk a large draught of hot <hi>Chocolata,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
the <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> way, and I
suddenly fell into a <hi>sleep,</hi> and <hi>sweat:</hi> and so
continued all night-long, and found my
self perfectly well in the Morning. This
effect seemed more strange, because many
think <hi>Chocolata</hi> to oppose sleep, but I found
my repose then very suddain, and length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<hi>at least three hours</hi> beyond what I usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
take. Since that, I have sundry times ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it that way, <hi>going to bed,</hi> and I have
found it no way to <hi>prevent sleep:</hi> nay, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sleep better, then when I take it: and
therefore I am ready to give this Reason for
Mr. <hi>Gage</hi>'s taking it, as often as he was to
fit up; not to keep him <hi>awake,</hi> but <hi>to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his Spirits,</hi> which in the <hi>Indies</hi> need a
<hi>frequent supply of food.</hi> Or it may be said,
Since sleepiness, and natural sleep are tow
things, that <hi>Chocolata</hi> may allay <hi>splenetique
fumes,</hi> and <hi>drowsiness,</hi> and yet promote na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
sleep.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Chocolata</hi> provokes other Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
thorough the several <hi>Emunctories</hi> of
the body, so it doth that of <hi>Seed,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<hi>provocative to lust</hi> upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93331:74"/>
then that it begets good Blood;
that nourisheth much, and, as it nourishes,
separates the already inexistent superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
or varies, and degenerates into new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements,
which are to be discharged out
of the body by their several passages, one
whereof are the <hi>Spermatick vessels.</hi> If
I do call the <hi>Seed</hi> an <hi>excrement,</hi> I am sure I
have <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s authority for it: which will

treat of nothing, but what is as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
within my Profession, as within the
Subject of <hi>Casuists;</hi> and why should I be
more blamed? Is it not one of the ends of
Marriage to prevent burning? yea, is not
this the principal Argument insisted on by

Clergy?****</p>
            <p>Let us then take it for a <hi>certain Position,</hi>
that <hi>What yields the best Blood, and promotes
all naturall expurgations, is the best of Food,
and Physick.</hi> And that <hi>Chocolata</hi> is such,
appears by what I have already said. I
cannot allow it to be Provocative upon any
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93331:75"/>
other account: (if it be prepared without
any lust-full Ingredients) and it hath this
advantage above the most <hi>substantial But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi>'s
<hi>meat</hi> (the taking whereof with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
and manly exercises, is the best <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi>
preparation) that it allays, with its
milde and vegetable Oiliness, the sharpness
of the Blood, and Nervous Liquour, which
the <hi>animal Sulphureousness</hi> of the other does
not. There can be no Universal Prescript
for the promoting <hi>seminal Excretions:</hi> yet,
since it is a part of <hi>Physical Institutions,</hi> and
treated on by every <hi>English'd Institutionist,</hi> I
shall enlarge thereon, for the benefit of the
married: which is a justification always
sufficient for these kind of Discourses.</p>
            <p>I take it for granted, that there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ferment implanted in the <hi>Testicles,</hi>
and <hi>Seminal parts adjacent,</hi> whose Nature
it is, after that it hath lain digesting, and
maturing for so many years (<hi>viz.</hi> twelve
in <hi>Females,</hi> and fourteen in <hi>Males;</hi> more,
or less, according to the <hi>individual tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament</hi>)
then to exert it self, and to vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the Blood, so as the whole body, as

their <hi>Wits</hi> more <hi>ripe,</hi> their <hi>Carriage</hi> more

doubt <hi>Physicians</hi> cannot decline to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it. It chears the Spirits, begets
good Blood, and opens all the Emunctories
of the body, and passages, by which Nature
designs the <hi>ejectment</hi> of some <hi>particular Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi>
And this is to be understood of the
<hi>Cacao-paste,</hi> and <hi>milde Compositions</hi> of <hi>Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata,</hi>
in which there is nothing, that doth
beget a <hi>particular fusion</hi> in the Blood, and
a <hi>titillation</hi> inclining a man to <hi>Venery</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the <hi>natural disposition</hi> of the Person.</p>
            <p>What I have hitherto spoken had no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intent, then the support of that Nature,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93331:80"/>
which God gave us, and which, as I have
shewed out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> hath been <hi>much
impaired</hi> by the <hi>fall.</hi> I know many will be
apt to censure this Discourse, as tending to
<hi>sensuality,</hi> and the <hi>upholding carnal lusts</hi> and
<hi>desires:</hi> but I suppose the more prudent
will acquit me from any such <hi>imputation;</hi>
since that is not the <hi>use,</hi> but <hi>abuse of Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata,</hi>
and is common to it with all <hi>other
meats</hi> of <hi>good nourishment:</hi> against which I
do not hear them so to declaim, as to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict
them totally.</hi> I am not ignorant, that
there is a Doctrine of <hi>Mortification,</hi> and
that we ought to <hi>suppress carnal lusts:</hi> but I
am to learn, that this is to be understood
<hi>literally;</hi> and that we must geld our selves
like <hi>Origen,</hi> or <hi>Chastise</hi> our selves with the
<hi>Papists,</hi> and not understand all <hi>those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi>
spiritually, and like <hi>good Protestants,</hi>
defying the <hi>exercises</hi> falsely called <hi>Spiritual</hi>
by the <hi>Popish Friers,</hi> and <hi>Iesuits,</hi> who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
this <hi>literal Mortification:</hi> whilest we i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
that <hi>carnality</hi> may be subdued by
other means, <hi>captivating the Vnderstanding
into the obedience of Faith,</hi> and <hi>subduing our
wills,</hi> not <hi>breaking our backs;</hi> and <hi>denying
our lusts,</hi> whilst <hi>we preserve a Nature and
temperament given us by God.</hi> I expect the
<hi>greatest censure</hi> from those, who disclaim
<hi>Fasting-days,</hi> and <hi>Ember-weeks;</hi> who keep
<hi>Lent</hi> with <hi>Capon, Sack</hi> and <hi>roast Beef;</hi>
which is <hi>their Luxury:</hi> and what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
in others is but a different and <hi>less so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93331:80"/>
Luxury,</hi> then what they pursue.</p>
            <p>I am not any way disposed to instruct
<hi>Men in evil,</hi> and would not seem to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them therein: and, to evidence this,
I shall now speak concerning the <hi>more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
Chocolatas,</hi> which are made, or used on
purpose to <hi>augment Venereous inclinations.</hi>
The things usually designed to <hi>exstimulate
Nature</hi> to <hi>excessive Venery</hi> are very <hi>hot,</hi> and
<hi>Aromatical,</hi> and which also carry with them
an <hi>acrimony,</hi> or <hi>saltness,</hi> wherewith they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<hi>excite Nature;</hi> which being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly
provoked thereby casts out what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is next, whether it be <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
Seed,</hi> or <hi>Phlegm,</hi> or <hi>Blood</hi> impregnated
with a <hi>saliness.</hi> It is not <hi>heat alone</hi> in meats,
that doth it: for the effect of <hi>Cloves, Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namom,</hi>
and <hi>Nutmegs,</hi> or <hi>Mace</hi> is not equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to that of <hi>Pepper,</hi> or <hi>Salt,</hi> and <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats.</hi>
These last operate by introducing a
momentany or lasting <hi>saltness,</hi> or <hi>acrimony</hi>
in the <hi>Blood,</hi> which, as it circulates thorough
each part, makes <hi>different impressions,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>different Nature,</hi> or <hi>indisposition</hi> of
the part. And, if any disease introduce any
<hi>acrimony</hi> or <hi>Saltness</hi> into the <hi>Blood,</hi> the
same Persons will be much inclined to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery,</hi>
thus those, who have the <hi>Itch,</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie,</hi>
as also the <hi>Melancholick</hi> Persons are
<hi>exceeding amorous;</hi> however the last bear
those <hi>evacuations</hi> very ill; and the lying
long, and on soft beds, and living idly,
doth render Men <hi>lascivious;</hi> but these are
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93331:81"/>
not natural, but <hi>morbid inclinations,</hi> and
therefore are neither executed with that
<hi>activity,</hi> nor hath their <hi>seed</hi> that relish, or
<hi>gusto</hi> in the Womb of the <hi>Feminine consort,</hi>
that attends <hi>vigorous and active Men.</hi> For
<hi>ease</hi> and <hi>idleness</hi> retard <hi>transpiration:</hi> and
those <hi>Humours,</hi> which should issue out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the several intents, and <hi>passages
of Nature,</hi> being <hi>retained,</hi> or <hi>resumed</hi> into
the Blood again, introduce an <hi>acrimony</hi> into
it, whereby Nature is exstimulated to an
<hi>ineffectual Venery.</hi> Thus, after <hi>long Agues,</hi>
or the recovery out of <hi>Chronical Diseases,</hi> a
<hi>salacity</hi> possesses the Patient, which as it
ariseth from no other cause, then I have
already specified; so it is prejudicial to the
<hi>Person he embraceth,</hi> for hereby Diseases are
<hi>transplanted</hi> oftentimes, as the <hi>Pocks,</hi> and
<hi>Consumptions:</hi> or new ones introduced, of
which the <hi>poor woman</hi> is not <hi>apprehensive,</hi>
being ignorant of this cause lying in the
constitution of the <hi>seed</hi> of her Husband
<hi>newly recovered,</hi> or newly having fill'd his
Veins with <hi>acrimony,</hi> or <hi>saline humour,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by some <hi>late entertainment.</hi> And
when I consider seriously the <hi>multiplicity of
Distempers,</hi> which affect our <hi>English Ladies,</hi>
so as that such as were very <hi>healthy Virgins,</hi>
become very <hi>sickly</hi> and <hi>infirm Wives,</hi> and
some recover again as soon as they are <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi>
I cannot but think that many of their
<hi>Diseases</hi> may arise from the <hi>seed,</hi> which their
<hi>Husbands inject,</hi> and are <hi>fomented</hi> so thereby,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93331:81"/>
that all <hi>Physick</hi> becomes unsuccesfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do not totally refrain each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Bed. I am very confident of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of mine, that it is true: because se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
have assured me of a great discrepan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
they could feel in the <hi>seed</hi> of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
at several times, and that they were
variously affected thereupon.</p>
            <p>I shall evidence this by a notable History
of <hi>Laurentius Hofmannus, De usu &amp; abusu Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic.

decerperent, sed etiam anno sequenti paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
audirent.</hi> That is, <q>I knew a noble mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
couple troubled with a strange sort
of Indisposition, whom I successfully cured
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93331:82"/>
with <hi>Mercurius vitae.</hi> I shall report the Case,
it being rare, and unheard of. As often as
ever the Husband conjugally embraced his
Wife, which was a Person of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
beauty, and youth, <hi>she</hi> used to shiver, and
tremble, and feared nothing so much as
his <hi>amours:</hi> because that for the most part,
after that she had received into her womb
the seed of her Husband, which was very
hot, and of a most stinking scent, she used
to swoon away: for so abominably noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
was the seed of her Husband, that
it was no sooner injected, but it caused
faintings and swoonings in her: yet did she
conceive, and miscarry ten times in the
space of five years. Being demanded my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
I gave the Husband <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> and
to the Wife other suitable remedies, which
had so great an effect, by God's blessing, that
the two Noble Personages did enjoy each
other with a great deal of pleasure, and
she brought forth a living childe the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing year.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this repugnant to what we daily
observe in <hi>uterine injections,</hi> which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
operate according to the different
Ingredients, and Qualities. And if it be so
herein, how much more ought we to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the truth hereof in Seminal injections,
which as they are injected, as are the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
so they are received with much more
ardour, the conflux of Spirits thither oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioning
a greater tension and heat there
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93331:82"/>
at that time, so that the contagion pierces
deeper; as Infection is sooner caught by the
<hi>hot,</hi> and <hi>sweating</hi> (the pores being open)
then by the <hi>cold,</hi> and <hi>chill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lest the <hi>Women</hi> hereby should upbraid
the Men, and boast the hazards they run by
Marriage: I must crave leave to tell you,
that there is as great variety in <hi>their Sex,</hi> as
in ours; and that every one, that wears a
<hi>Petticoat,</hi> is not capable, nor merits the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of a Man, how beautifull soever she
may be: nay, commonly it may be said,
that the <hi>fairest Persons</hi> (where a mixture
of white and red accomplishes the face)
<hi>and the best shaped are fitter for Mistresses,
then Wives, and yield a more pleasing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
in a Balcony, or Coach, then Bed.</hi>
I shall not alledge the Reasons, though they
are irrefragable: but only add, that it were
easie to write an <hi>Apology</hi> for those, who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
marryed such, continue not their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
beyond the first moneth, or year.
It is for such that the Proverb of <hi>Hony-moon</hi>
was designed: and if any can continue a
<hi>long affection</hi> for such, either the Man is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
good,</hi> or cautious, or the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
extraordinary cunning;</hi> or else he is a
Novice, who, having no <hi>experience of the
Sex,</hi> imagines all to be as his <hi>Wife</hi> is; as
that <hi>Romane</hi> Dame supposed all Men's
breath to stink (she having never kiss'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
else) because her <hi>Husband</hi>'s did so. I
could here enlarge upon the Reasons, why a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93331:83"/>
               <hi>Man</hi> may love eagerly and constantly a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Person to the prejudice of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Lady, and assert the commendation of
<hi>Ronsard</hi> to <hi>Pasithea,</hi> or the Queen of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
whom he represents to be
<q>Of Complexion rather brown, then fair.</q>
With which agrees the <hi>choice</hi> of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
in the <hi>Canticles: I am black, but lovely.</hi>
But I shall only add, that it is an undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thing, That there is not that Variety,
or certainty of Accidents, that befall a Man,
so as to render his Embraces distastfull, or
fatal (excepting the <hi>French Pox</hi>) to any
Woman, that there is in most Women, to
render them unfitting, or unworthy the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
of a Man: so great an alteration
doth Age, Child-bearing, Sickness, and
the like, introduce into the Womb, as to its
Natural Make, or Original Ferment. Nor
are Men either to be separated for the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
of their applications,</hi> and <hi>professions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
marriage;</hi> because they <hi>live not up to
them, after it:</hi> or to be <hi>censured so bitterly</hi>
for <hi>inconstancy;</hi> because they persist not in
their first Affection, and Declarations: for
perhaps the beautifull Lady is changed; or
did by Surrender acquaint him with Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
he knew not before, nor could make:
and therefore, if he proceeded by that Rule,
which his sight and utmost enquiry gave
him, he acted as well as Man could; but he still
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93331:83"/>
might be deceived in the Conclusion: but
that, being deceived, and <hi>knowing himself
to be so,</hi> he should act, and comport himself
as if he were not so, is a constraint every
Man's Spirit cannot submit to: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is to be excused, as well as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
frailties, whereunto Humane Nature is
lyable.</p>
            <p>The truth of what hath been already said
being granted, I shall suggest two Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
therefrom, which I think inevitably
do follow: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. If it be true, that the <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi>
and <hi>ejection of Seed</hi> in
Man, (or Woman) is a <hi>natural act,</hi>
arising from the <hi>Blood</hi> depurating
it self, and the <hi>Ferment</hi> of the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerative
parts</hi> particularly opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the <hi>Blood;</hi> then ought
they no more to be <hi>forced,</hi> then those
other <hi>natural Exreetions</hi> are, of
<hi>Snot, Spittle, Urine,</hi> &amp;c. which
we do not <hi>promote,</hi> but when their
<hi>deficiency</hi> is, or may be <hi>trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some:</hi>
nor do we <hi>evacuate,</hi> but
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93331:84"/>
when we are sensible of their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If it be <hi>true,</hi> that there is a
great <hi>discrepancy</hi> not only betwixt
the Seed of one Man and another,
but betwixt the Seed of the same
Man at one time, and another; which
is occasioned as well by the <hi>Food,</hi>
and <hi>Physick</hi> he takes, as by alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of <hi>Age,</hi> or <hi>Sickness:</hi> it is
then very considerable what <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocatives</hi>
a Man takes, or a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
gives to <hi>provoke lust,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
desires,</hi> lest the <hi>Nature of
the Seed</hi> be <hi>depraved,</hi> and the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
incurr harm <hi>thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It likewise concerns the Woman to have
a particular regard to her self, that she
may with equal ardours meet the embraces
of her Husband: she must know, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his affection more is necessary then <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
promises,</hi> and <hi>joyning of hands in the
Church,</hi> or the continuing of her <hi>beautifull
aspect</hi> and shape; these may acquire, and fix
a <hi>Servant,</hi> but not an <hi>Husband:</hi> she must
therefore take care, that her <hi>Blood</hi> be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93331:84"/>
way sufficiently depurated, upon which
depends the Vigour of <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Minde;</hi> to
the effecting whereof more is requisite, then
I can now propose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Active Complexions</hi> are only to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
what <hi>they are:</hi> all forcing destroys
them. These therefore must have a <hi>milde</hi>
and <hi>temperate</hi> sort of <hi>Chocolata;</hi> not enriched
with any sort of <hi>Pepper,</hi> but that of <hi>Iamaica,</hi>
nor any other <hi>Spice,</hi> then of the <hi>West-Indy</hi>
growth. They need not <hi>natural heat;</hi> and
the aforesaid Composition will sufficiently
<hi>enliven</hi> them: but, if any debility of Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
or accidental weakness befall them,
they may vigorate the <hi>Chocolata</hi> with a glass
of good <hi>Canary,</hi> or old <hi>Malaga-Sack,</hi> when
they mill it up; or take a more rich sort,
but yet short of those <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>fiery Compounds</hi>
used by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The <hi>Phlegmatick</hi>
Tempers, if also <hi>abounding with ill Humours,</hi>
must take <hi>Chocolata</hi> cautiously at first: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
a <hi>Purge,</hi> and taking some <hi>gentle Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive</hi>
once in six or eight days; left it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
too great a fusion of Humours in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
and he must begin with <hi>milde Chocola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
and after take richer and more effectual
Compositions. <hi>Nature endures not violent
and suddain changes.</hi> I once had a Woman
came to me to complain of the <hi>unactiveness</hi>
of her Husband; who was, to see to, a
<hi>lusty able Man,</hi> but <hi>Phlegmatick,</hi> and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>muddy aspect,</hi> as if <hi>Cacochymical:</hi> she desiring
of me some powerfull <hi>Electuary</hi> to add cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

and life to him: I prescribed her one
agreeable to what <hi>Vanninus</hi> in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
recommends; not doubting, but he
would propose the most effectual in that
kind, <hi>Leachery</hi> being his greatest Moral vice.
He had not taken it many times, but it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated

in the midst of <hi>his</hi> and his <hi>Wive's delight,</hi> he
fell into a suddain fit of an <hi>Asthma,</hi> which
had almost ended his days.</p>
            <p>In reference to both these Considerations
perhaps it is, that in <hi>Italy</hi> they now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn

            <p>I shall speak no more concerning the use
of <hi>Chocolata,</hi> then as it is prescribed in <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal

doth merit a particular enquiry; for sundry
do commend it therein. <hi>Paulus Zacchias</hi>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93331:85"/>
to be allowed in that Distemper, but with a
great deal of judgment: since he cannot
believe, but it is rather <hi>hot,</hi> then <hi>temperate.</hi>
And <hi>Piso</hi> saith, he knew none in <hi>Holland</hi> to
receive hurt by the use of <hi>Chocolata,</hi> but
such, as were troubl'd with <hi>Hypochondriacal
heats:</hi> from whence we may collect, that,
in his judgment, <hi>it could not be allowed
them.</hi> Yet I have known learned Men here in
<hi>England</hi> prescribe it in the Case aforesaid. I
shall, with submission to better Judgments,
solve the Question by distinguishing the
<hi>several Compositions of Chocolata,</hi> and

in the <hi>Spleen,</hi> and its <hi>communion with

primarily and most evidently perceivable
there. There is also a Debility of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi>
which is so relaxed, that it neither
digests the Food received, well; nor emits
it, being digested: so that it corrupts by
long stay in the Stomach, (the Body being

and so corrodes the Stomach, and whatever

never well, full, nor fasting;</hi> and <hi>pine</hi> away,
complaining of a weak Stomach: which the
<hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish Galenists</hi> considering,
thought the Disease to proceed from a <hi>cold
Stomach,</hi> and not from an <hi>Aqua Stygia,</hi> or
the like <hi>Menstruum</hi> in the Stomach, made up
of the several <hi>Salts,</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> extracted
out of the different meats eaten, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant
sharpe liquour issuing out of the
<hi>capillary Arteries,</hi> and coats of the Stomach,
into the Stomach: for as the blood is in
such very <hi>serous</hi> and <hi>sharpe,</hi> so is the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
transuding into the Stomach heigth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
in its acrimony, and augmented in its
quantity beyond measure. Now, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is to be understood, <hi>praemissis genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus,</hi>
general Purgings being d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
and opening Physick administred.
And in this Case I answer, That <hi>hot-spiced
Chocolata</hi> (and especially what hath <hi>black,
long,</hi> or <hi>red Pepper</hi> in it, whose Nature it is
to <hi>create an acrimony,</hi> as well as to <hi>heat</hi>
the <hi>Blood</hi>) cannot agree with the Stomach;
because they will more <hi>heat and inflame
the Blood,</hi> then is tolerable: and this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by the experience of <hi>Piso.</hi> But, as for
<hi>milde</hi> and <hi>temperate Chocolata,</hi> I doubt not,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93331:86"/>
but such a sort might be made, as would
exactly suit the Disease, and contribute
much to the recovery, being given in <hi>water,</hi>
not mix'd with <hi>milk,</hi> or <hi>eggs;</hi> but given the
<hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> fashion: and the
<hi>water</hi> it self being such a water, as will not
stay in the Stomach, but pass immediatly
into the <hi>Blood,</hi> and void it self by <hi>Vrine.</hi>
To confirm my Opinion, do but consider
the Nature of the <hi>Cacao-nut,</hi> and <hi>paste:</hi> it
is very <hi>nourishing,</hi> it <hi>allays vapours and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullitions
of the Blood;</hi> it <hi>is not apt to sowre</hi>
(as <hi>gruels,</hi> and <hi>broths of meat,</hi> or <hi>China</hi>-root
instantly will) and it <hi>keepeth the Body solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and <hi>moderately purges by Vrine.</hi> All
which Indications we are to aim at in the
Cure of this Disease. It also <hi>corroborateth
the Stomach</hi> by its <hi>adstriction,</hi> it allayeth the
<hi>sowr Humour</hi> by its <hi>unctuousness</hi> (which
floats not on the top, but accurately <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixes</hi>
with the <hi>liquour</hi>) and its <hi>bitterishness,</hi>
then which there is not any thing else more
gratefull to a weak Stomach. Add to these
Considerations, that <hi>Chocolata</hi> is a <hi>liquour,</hi>
and that the Cure of <hi>Hypochondriacks</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon <hi>humectation</hi> (seeing that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholici,
si bene humectantur, bene curantur</hi>)
and there is not any thing can occasion a
scruple, but the addition of <hi>Sugar:</hi> which
how far it may agree, is to be determined
by <hi>Experience,</hi> since otherwise it will be
condemned by Reason. But, should it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
the <hi>Cacao</hi>-paste may be prepared for

have said, and shall say about the way of
using <hi>Chocolata,</hi> any <hi>Physician</hi> will be able
to collect how it is, or may be used in such
like Cases.</p>
            <p>Concerning the variety of Ingredients in
<hi>Chocolata,</hi> and the several frauds in making
it up, I have already spoken so much, as I
need not to enlarge again: only as to the
Addition of <hi>Achiote,</hi> I hear the use of it is
condemned by one of our <hi>most learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,</hi>
as being <hi>prejudicial to the Head.</hi> I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93331:87"/>
could never yet hear what Motives he had
for that Opinion of his: for in all the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Writers</hi> I do not remember any such
thing; I have already represented their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
and that is the voice of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in Comprobation of the use of it. I
never found any inconvenience by the use
of <hi>Achiote</hi> (which is an Ingredient in my
<hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>royal Chocolata</hi>) nor do I hear
of any, that does. I would rather adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to recommend the use of <hi>Achiote,</hi> since,
without heating, it doth powerfully <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
all gross Humours,</hi> (and the Blood
of us <hi>Northern</hi> People is <hi>more gross,</hi> and less
<hi>fusile,</hi> then that of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and we are prone to <hi>Coughs, stoppings
of the Chest,</hi> and <hi>Asthmas,</hi> by reason of our
gross feeding, and the thickness of the
Blood, whereby it is apt to obstruct the
Lungs) and since it doth make the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colata</hi>
to <hi>agree better with the Stomach,</hi> then
otherwise it would. I have faithfully decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
already the judgment of several Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
concerning <hi>Achiote.</hi> It is generally
put into <hi>Chocolata</hi> by the <hi>Indians,</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
and <hi>Portugheses;</hi> and that none
should ever observe in it a <hi>particular repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnancy
to the Brain,</hi> or a <hi>quality,</hi> that might
give ground for such a surmise (which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
by my taste) is very strange: and how
probable the thing is, let others judge.</p>
            <p>Since the writing of the aforesaid Passage
I have received the complaints of a <hi>fair La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:93331:88"/>
who thinks, that taking of my common
<hi>Chocolata</hi> with <hi>Achiote</hi> in it, the Head-ach
(whereunto she is Naturally, as well as by
her condition of being with Childe, prone)
is encreased; and that it doth create a more
then usual heat in her Face, and Body; and
indeed I my self, taking for sundry days
of the same <hi>Chocolata,</hi> found, that, taken in
<hi>Paste,</hi> or <hi>liquour,</hi> it did cause in my <hi>Stomach</hi>
and <hi>Body</hi> a greater and particular heat,
which before I never felt. To finde out the
cause of this Accident, I examined the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that made it up, and I found, he had
varyed his <hi>Achiote,</hi> and used a new parcel,
(which to me seemed not so good) which
in the same weight did yield a <hi>deeper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
by farr,</hi> and occasioned, as I thought,
the aforesaid Case, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ich did not happen
when I used another sort, which to me
seemed more pure, then the last used. But
I did further observe, that the <hi>Chocolata</hi>
complained of did promote Expectoration
beyond any other, I ever took to eat, or
drank: so that I conceive, in Case of <hi>Asthmas,</hi>
and <hi>stuffings from Phlegm,</hi> such a sort of
<hi>Chocolata</hi> might agree well. As to the heat
of <hi>Achiote</hi> it self, I could not perceive any
more in the last, then in the other; nay, I
must profess, I think, that five Grains of the
said <hi>Achiote,</hi> taken by it self, did not so
much heat me, (nay, it did not cause in
me any sense of heat) as did half a Dram
of <hi>Chocolata-paste</hi> already mentioned:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93331:88"/>
yet in sixteen Ounces thereof there was but
one Scruple. And this Consideration puts
me in mind of the <hi>Indian</hi> remark, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiote</hi>
(though destitute almost of <hi>Taste,</hi>
and <hi>Smell</hi>) doth amend the <hi>Taste,</hi> and <hi>Smell,</hi>
(which it may do, as well as the <hi>heat</hi>) of
the other Ingredients. And though it be
not sensibly <hi>hot,</hi> yet by its penetrancy, and
the great attenuating faculty it hath, it
may occasion some Distempers in the Head,
where the <hi>Blood</hi> is already so attenuated,
that it admits no further Rare faction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
indisposing the Head, which (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Mechanical Philosophy</hi>) must needs
receive a greater afflux of <hi>Blood,</hi> the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
it is. In the choice of <hi>Achiote</hi> I can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give this Rule, that it be <hi>solid,</hi> not <hi>soft,</hi>
rather <hi>pale-red,</hi> then <hi>deep,</hi> free from <hi>seeds,</hi>
or <hi>greenish hulls</hi> within; and not <hi>musty.</hi> As
to the quantity to be put in, I finde it is
impossible to determine the proportion,
by reason of the variety of <hi>Achiote:</hi> but
take the <hi>Indian</hi> Rule, recorded in <hi>Ledesma,</hi>
to put in as much, as will colour it: (and
that not deeply) and adhere not to what
was prescribed me, <hi>viz. half a Dram in each
Pound:</hi> which though it proved well in the
first Essay I made for His Majesty, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiote</hi>
being singular; it hath since displeased
me.</p>
            <p>The way, in which I choose to take <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colata,</hi>
is sometimes to mix <hi>two parts of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with one of milk,</hi> and to dissolve the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93331:89"/>
               <hi>Chocolate-paste</hi> therein with an Egg: for I
care not for <hi>milk</hi> alone. But most usually
I take <hi>three quarters of a pint of good</hi> [Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit]
water well-boil'd, and dissolve in it
(stirring it frequently with a Spoon) <hi>one
ounce of Chocolata,</hi> and <hi>two ounces of fine Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar:</hi>
having let it stand before a moderate
fire to dissolve, when it is so dissolved, as
that the liquour seems very fatty with a
yellow fat, and that there sticks to the spoon
an undescribable unctuousness, or oyliness,
(however that the <hi>Chocolata</hi> be not half dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
but that a great part of it still swim
in great stakes, and small parcels, up and
down) I proceed to mill it very well, and
then set it to the fire again to dissolve more
perfectly: and having, let it stand a good
while (even till it be ready to boil, of near
upon it) I mill it once more with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence:
and then either drink it alone
(which is the common <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi>
way) or putting in one Egg (<hi>white</hi> and
<hi>yolk</hi>) without ever beating it before break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it into the water, and immediatly mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it very hard, sometimes playing the
<hi>molinet</hi> (and that most, at first especially,
to break the Egg, and hinder its curdling)
on the top of the water, and sometimes at
the bottom. And I have observed, that by
this course the <hi>Chocolata</hi> (when taken
without an Egg) becomes better tasted then
otherwise it would: and, if an Egg be put
in, the <hi>Chocolata</hi> is farr better dissolved,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93331:89"/>
and swims with a greater oyl or fat on the
top, then if the Egg were put in sooner,
and never so long milled. Nor doth the Egg
harden, or <hi>curdle,</hi> if dropped in whole
without beating, but dissolve better (if
<hi>nimbly milled,</hi> and that towards the top,
where the Egg floats at first) then if it
were beaten much, and put in afterwards by
little and little.</p>
            <p>I prepare no more at once, then I drink
that time: not that I feel any offensiveness
in what hath been once heated, and cold,
before it be <hi>heated again</hi> for me: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I finde an observable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>fresh</hi> and <hi>old Chocolata-liquour:</hi> the
<hi>Spice</hi> evaporating their more subtile parts.
But the discrepancy is not such, as is in
Pottage, or Gruel, &amp;c. twice heated: nor
do I know what reason the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have
to prohibite so severely the use of <hi>Chocola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
twice heated. I drink it moderately hot,
and dip a piece of <hi>diet-bread,</hi>

Nor do I regard the quantity, taking fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

eating tosted wig, or diet-bread often with
it. What it may do to others, I know not;

may (without its disparagement) retard sleep.</p>
            <p>I have often wonder'd to hear upon how
inconsiderable causes many complain; though
they have no occasion to sleep: yet, if they
sleep not at certain times, they entertain
strange thoughts of their danger of sickness,
and condemn the occasion of it presently.
So, if they eat not flesh at least once or twice
a day, they repute their Stomach to be lost,
and imagine they must dy: not regarding,
that the end of <hi>food</hi> is to <hi>repair the defects of

and, when we enjoy these ends, we
are not to be solicitous of any particular

            <head>An account of the Distillation of
the Cacao-nut perform'd by
Mr. Le Febure.</head>
            <p>WE took eight Ounces of the <hi>Cacao</hi>-nut,
and, without hulling them,
beat them to a gross powder, and put them
in a Retort: we found the body so fix'd,
that with an ordinary Fire there came no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
over, but a white liquour in a very
small quantity, so clear as water: which
we suppose to be the Phlegm. Then we
encreased the Fire to such an heat, as if we
had been to draw Spirit of Vitriol: then
there came over (within the space of
seventeen hours Operation) first a Spirit,
that was as white as Milk, in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours;
and, whereas all other Spirits u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
ascend in the Recipient, these did
descend, and fall to the bottom: and after
that (but with a great reverberating Fire;
such as he never put to any Vegetable)
there came over the Oyl, which was red
as blood, but clear; resembling any Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
for clearness: after it was cold, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93331:97"/>
thick, like to the Oyl or Butter of
Wax for consistence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> weighed one ounce,
and seven drams; of the Spirit there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two ounces: and the remainder Oyl,
three ounces and an half; besides what was
lost in filtrating, and other contingencies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Upon Separation, the Spirit was as red as
blood, like to any exquisite Tincture of
<hi>Santals;</hi> however it were white in the
first distilling: which is to be attributed to
its being commix'd in the distilling with
the subsequent Oyl. The Spirit was not
very hot, but exceeding penetrative, and
not unpleasant as to smell, or taste, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Spirits drawn from blood, or flesh, are.
But, however it had not any <hi>empyreuma,</hi>
nor had that odiousness, which attends
Spirits drawn from flesh, yet had it an
evident affinity (but with a peculiar
in mildness) with flesh. The Oyl was not
very unpleasant, but miraculously piercing,
(the Volatile Salt, of which there was
a great quantity, being unseparated) and
had an unexpressible Aromaticalness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the tongue; and seem'd very much to
delight and refresh the Heart, and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach:
but with a great resemblance still
of flesh.</p>

was exceeding light, and carryed with it
in smell Testimonies of an affinity with

            <p>We had not time to pursue a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
enquiry into the several Liquours,
and Parts, into which the first appearances
of this Distillation might be further resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
but that there may be a very great
exercise for further Curiosity in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling
of this Nut appears hence, that
the <hi>Spirit</hi> in a short space became not only
<hi>turbid,</hi> but sowr, and manifested it self
to contain a <hi>Vinegar:</hi> which is not yet exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;
but the Honourable <hi>Robert Boyl</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr>
hath promised to make some <hi>Essays</hi> about
it. I would not have any offended at the
<hi>novelty</hi> of finding a <hi>Vinegar</hi> in the <hi>Cacao;</hi>
for it is an <hi>acid ferment,</hi> that we owe our
<hi>digestion</hi> to: and we ought rather to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire</hi>
the Nature of this <hi>Nut,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
in it self not only Principles for
<hi>nourishment,</hi> and <hi>food,</hi> but even of <hi>concoction:</hi>
and from hence we may observe, what it is,
that makes it so agreable to all, even to
the <hi>weakest Natures.</hi> Besides Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> told
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93331:98"/>
me of several <hi>Oyls,</hi> he observed in it upon
Distillation, the several effects and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
whereof are not yet, through want
of time, discovered.</p>
            <p>I have nothing more to add now, being just
ready to go on Ship-board; but that I have
since met with a Person, whose long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
and Curiosity in <hi>Spain</hi> have enabled
him to judge of <hi>Chocolata:</hi> he informed me
of many things so, as to satisfie me, that the
course I make <hi>Chocolata</hi> by, is exact: and
that, what I have taught <hi>Mortimer</hi> to make,
hotter then my ordinary way, is the true
<hi>Chocolata</hi> of <hi>Guaxaca,</hi> and most celebrated
in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Court. And I am to acquaint
the Nation with a piece of his Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
which was my own Conjecture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that to make <hi>Chocolata</hi> into <hi>Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats,</hi>
and <hi>Almonds,</hi> it is this <hi>Chocolata</hi> of
<hi>Guaxaca</hi> (a Present of which I designed
for Her Majesty, had She arrived before
my departure, and some whereof is in the
hands of the Lady <hi>Wood</hi>) wherewith the
said <hi>Confects</hi> are to be made: for milde
<hi>Chocolata</hi> will grow <hi>insipid</hi> upon so great
a commixture of <hi>Sugar.</hi> Any one may
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93331:98"/>
have it at <hi>Mortimer's</hi> made for them,
if they be-speak it by the name of
the <hi>Queen's Chocolata,</hi> as the other bears
the name of <hi>Chocolata-royal,</hi> which had His
<hi>Majestie</hi>'s approbation. There is a sort of
<hi>Chocolata</hi> made by Sir <hi>H. Bennet,</hi> which, if
I have seen the right Prescript, is conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to what I understand to be the
practise of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Court: yet differs a
little from mine, and hath a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of <hi>red Pepper,</hi> then I allow <hi>English-Men,</hi>
however it may suit with the <hi>Female
Sex</hi> pretty well. It hath <hi>Musk</hi> in it in as
great a quantity, as I put <hi>Amber-grise</hi> in
<hi>mine:</hi> but I think <hi>Musk</hi> not so healthfull
in many; for it begers a great fusion and
fermentation in the Blood, so as that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
it to boil, and colour the face: besides
that a little <hi>Musk</hi> chewed is observed to
make <hi>wounds to bleed;</hi> with many other
Instances, which I have not time to recount,
but shall in the next Edition; with Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of my own about it in the making
of a sort of Pies with <hi>Almonds, Pistachias,</hi>
Marrow, &amp;c. and <hi>Musk</hi> sometimes, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Amber-grise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which as it is a Dish I
love sometimes, so was I pleased with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Observations I made by putting <hi>Musk</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:93331:99"/>
and <hi>Amber-grise</hi> in it. If any will have any
made with <hi>Musk,</hi> and those other Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
which a little diversifie it from my
<hi>Chocolata-royal,</hi> or that, which I call the
<hi>Queen's Chocolata,</hi> I have told <hi>Mortimer</hi> the
way: so as they may have it either <hi>milde,</hi>
or as <hi>hot</hi> as Sir <hi>H. B.</hi> makes it.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman further informed me,
that he found <hi>Chocolata</hi> to keep his body
<hi>soluble</hi> (as did my much Honoured and
Learned Friend Dr. <hi>Quatremaine,</hi> Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-in-Ordinary
to His Majesty:) and if it
ever fail'd to do so, he then took it in bed,
half an hour before he rose, and it never
fail'd to give him a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ool, as soon as he
was up. He told me, he used to put <hi>butter</hi> in
his: and he told me, that they used to take
it in <hi>Spain</hi> after they have taken a <hi>little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
bisket,</hi> or a <hi>salt bit</hi> in a morning. He
further told me upon his <hi>Experience,</hi> that,
being desperately vex'd with the <hi>Piles,</hi> he
took the Butter of <hi>Cacao</hi> (which is the fat
I mention, that arises from digesting the
<hi>Cacao's simple paste</hi> in water, till the Fat be
drawn out) and melted it, and anointed
therewith, and it did not only cure him
presently, but that he never had them since.
I have not time to enlarge on the several
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93331:99"/>
Experiments I have since had account of:
but I have many more Rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But I must conclude, adding the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> which I hinted at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
because it contains some <hi>Observations</hi>
not ordinary in Physick.</p>

<hi>those Members had obeyed the will, as

should have been sown in the Vessel, as

say more in this kind, Modesty bids me
forbear a little, and first ask pardon of

proceed in any Discourse pertinent to this

            <p>Man therefore should have sown the
