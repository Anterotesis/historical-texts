            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14900:5"/>
are thereby rendred diſputable: ſo, we ſay in a generall propoſition, that <hi>Murder is vnlawfull,</hi> but yet in ſome particular caſe, <note place="margin">Generall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are not to be gainſaid, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities are ſubiect to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation.</note> it may from circumſtances receiue ſuch a qualification, that it may bee eſteemed a lawfull action; Vniuerſall maximes are like to Stars, their place certaine and their motions regular and within their generall extention, they comprehend inferior pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. The Law eternall of God and of Nature, are two great lights which impart luſtre and vigor to all the reſt, but, when wee come to Hypotheſes, then a man deſcends (as it were) to the elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary region, where all things are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable and turbulent, and where one ſhall encounter and meet with a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conflict of reaſons as with ſo many counterbuffs of contrary winds. One di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes concerning an exild man, a <hi>Banditti,</hi> to whom one promiſes pardon, in caſe he bring the head of one of his Comrads, hee brings the head of his owne father, that was one of the number, the queſtion is, whether hee ought to haue the benefit

vpon the faith of the State aſſured and promiſed him, or be puniſht as a Paricid: If a man found aſleep be charged to haue committed a murder, there is required a very ſerious diſquiſition and waighing of circumſtance and reaſons before he be eyther condemned or acquitted.</p>
            <p>Now, if the queſtion <hi>of Right</hi> (concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what is iuſt and what is vniuſt) be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with ſo many perplexities, that of <hi>Fact</hi> (concerning what is true and what is falſe) is infinitely more obſcure and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconded. It hath been ſeene, that two men haue ſo ſimmetrically reſembled each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that all the kindred of the one, and his very wife alſo, being miſtaken, hath entertained the impoſtor into a place wherein hee had no intereſt, and yet when the true husband hath come and preſented himſelfe, the ſubtilties of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were ſo quaint, and his anſwers ſo pat and comformable that they haue made the Iudges to ſtand aſtoniſht; The eies of all Europe were a long time intent vpon that pretended <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14900:6"/>
and they that were moſt cleare ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted were deceiued in him: Oftentimes both <hi>Fact</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi> are liable to diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as in the cauſe of diuorſe between <hi>H.</hi> 8. and <hi>Katherine of Arragon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the queſtion bee then of a fact which cannot bee proued by any ordinary way, what ſhall the Iudges doe to find out the truth? Wee haue not <hi>Moſes</hi> reſident on the earth, who could conſult with God himſelfe, when hee knew not to whom <note place="margin">Antient courſes to find out facts, which could not be proued by an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way.</note> the right of a controuerted ſucceſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed: Nor the Pectorall of iudgement vpon the habit of the great Sacrificer: Nor the water of malediction, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouered the innocence or guilt of women ſuſpected of Adultery: Nor the eie of Seers or Prophets, how gaue anſwer themſelues concerning ſmaller matters, as <hi>Saul</hi> ſearching his fathers aſſes, went to <hi>Samuel</hi> to heare ſome tidings of them: Nor that Spirit, by which <hi>Elizeus</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the auarice of <hi>Gehazi,</hi> and S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the lying of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14900:7"/>
to the laſt, and if the proceeding were barbarous, the iudgement was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. But theſe impious courſes, which the Sunne of Iuſtice hath chaſed into Hell, ought now thence to bee cald back againe.</p>
            <p>Let vs ſee then, if there reſt any other extraordinary way, which may hold the place of proofe: Wee find that in ſuch caſes, ſome haue vſed caſting Lots, and ſuch as approue of a Duell, doe eaſily allege this reaſon: That the Duell is one <note place="margin">Lotts.</note> kind of Lot, and by conſequent practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. Indeed thereby occaſions wherein the Lot may take place; If two brothers haue an inheritance to be diuided betwixt them, and after each portion being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualy diuided, yet they may try by Lot to ſee which of the two ought to fall to the one or other. In a Senat if a place fall void, and many Citizens expect it, being of equall capacity to execute the ſame, the claymes of theſe competitors may bee tryed by Lot, for auoidance of many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes: So did the Romans vſe to doe in

allotting their Prouinces, and ſtill to this preſent, many Common wealths follow that courſe, in diſpoſing Offices and dignities.</p>
            <p>In time of perſecution, the Miniſters of a Church may caſt the Lot, to know to whom amongſt them it ſhall fall to ſtay, or goe; the examples wherewith holy Antiquity doth furniſh vs, to this purpoſe haue ſome thing in them of a high ſtraine, then the ſimple nature of a Lot can well beare; as one may ſee in the diuiſion of the Land of Canaan, and in the inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Saul,</hi> in whoſe election it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God they ſhould deale by Lot. But the matter which is properly in queſtion is this; If a man may this way ſerue his turne, to find out the truth of a fact which is vnknowne vnto vs; and heere again wee haue examples, but they are ſuch which exceed the nature of a Lot. In antient times amongſt Gods people, when it was euident that ſome crime was committed amongſt them, the author whereof was not certainly knowne one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14900:8"/>
caſt Lots among the Tribes; from the Tribes, he came to the Families; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it fell vpon ſome one ſingle man; ſo was hee conuicted that had taken things forbidden at the ſacke of Iericoh; ſo <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> was found out, hauing done contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the command of the King his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo the Mariners came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that <hi>Ionas</hi> occaſioned the tempeſt; If we were aſſured to find out matters ſo happily, or if God had giuen vs his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, I could admit of caſting lots in this nature, but we haue nomore certainty to build vpon, but the incertainty of the Lot. And yet this makes nothing in fauour of a Duell; for the manner of proceeding by Lot, is not to ſend two men to ſlay one another, and generally the Lot tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth but one, but the Duell endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gereth both, one whereof is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
            <p>We will then now ſpeake of the Duel; and to the end, that no man may imagine <note place="margin">Duel.</note> that poſſeſt with a preiudicate opinion, we condemne it onely, in regard of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14900:8"/>
name which makes it odious, we wil accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately waigh all the kinds and differences; I well know that wee are not to treate heere of the fights wherein Gladiators &amp; Fencers exerciſe themſelues, for recreation of ſpectators; Moreouer, we handle not that vnheard fury of thoſe, who to fulfill their particular reuenge, or for ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary puntitio of honour, haue waded ſo farre in the effuſion of blood; and ſent ſo many ſoules to Hell: But the queſtion heere is of a Duell warranted by the Lawes; agreed vnto by the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, adiudged neceſſary in default of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe, for the making manifeſt of ſome fact in queſtion of conſequence to the State; and for the deciſion of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of great importance; but this is the very thing which we argue, to wit, if Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors may in good conſcience decree a Duell at their motions, for the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their difference.</p>
            <p>And that I may anticipate and obuiate many pretenſes, which might diuert vs from the ſtate of the queſtion: I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14900:9"/>
that vpon certaine occaſions the Duell is diſputable, and vpon others alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neceſſary; See ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:</p>
            <p>When an innocent man oppreſt by the calumnious accuſation of his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is like to be condemned, in caſe he iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie not himſelfe by combat; ſome hold, it ſhall bee lawfull to accept this way; there being none other way left him to ſupport his innocence. But, this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot iuſtifie the Iudges; for if they haue found him guilty, will the Duell make him innocent? and finding nought to conuict him, are they not bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit him? Why then will they expoſe him to the hazard of his life, whom they are not able to pronounce guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
            <p>The Duell whereto a man is conſtraind by the violence of one that ſets vpon him, is not of this nature. He that is aſſayled, may repell force, with force; it is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in nature and a priuiledge granted by the Laws; for the partie aſſailed is not in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14900:9"/>
caſe to inuoke the aſſiſtance of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and the Magiſtrate is not in place to repell that oppreſſion. But, what rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or analogy hath this defence with the Magiſtrates abſence rendred neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and which hee ought to haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, if hee had beene in place with a Duell, which the Magiſtrate will autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe either by his preſence, or by his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation?</p>
            <p>Nor makes it to the purpoſe to allege the Duels which haue beene fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Princes, which haue determined their quarels by the monomachy of man to man. The Crowne of England was ſometimes in that ſort diſputed, betweene <hi>Edmund Iron-ſide,</hi> and <hi>Canute</hi> the Dane: <hi>Edward</hi> the third offred as much to the King of France; the French King to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, Father of our moſt Illuſtrious Queene, made offer to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> his competitor, to put a period to their difference by point of ſpeare, his perſon againſt his, ſix againſt ſix, or hundred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14900:10"/>
hundred. I will not ſay, that it is lawfull to a Prince ſo to hazard the head of the Common-wealth, and in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, all the body of his Eſtate; but when this way is permitted them, it is, becauſe Soueraigne Princes haue not any Iudge aboue them who can doe them right, ſo that to obtaine reaſon from their hands, who are eleuated to as high a pitch of dignity as themſelues; there is not any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, but by armes; and theſe their doings haue an outward ſhew of charity: for a Prince will ſay, that hee likes better to expoſe his owne perſon to danger, then to ſee a bloody warre that ſhould ſwallow vp many thouſands of men, and giue occaſion of an infinite ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>And it may bee that ſome people deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to auoid a generall conflict of nation againſt nation, haue ſometimes remitted their quarrell to a certaine number of men, to be choſen by either ſide by them to bee decided by combat. So three hundred Lacedemonians fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a like number of the Argiens; three
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14900:10"/>
Romans againſt three Latins; and when <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> ſtood competitors for the Royalty; the two Generals <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Abner,</hi> cauſed a combat betweene twelue Souldiers of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt twelue of the Tribe of <hi>Beniamin.</hi> This kind of Duell is as it were an abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of the warre, and yet not very iuſtifiable.</p>
            <p>There is more apparance in this caſe, then in any of the caſes afore mentioned. Two Armies are ready to fight, hee that hath the right on his ſide, finds himſelfe inferior in forces, ſo that if they come to handy-ſtroakes we muſt all die of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: The enemy makes an offer of a ſingle fight one to one, and offers to ſtand to the euent of this Duell; why ſhould wee all periſh, and not rather make legall of this way and expedient, which perchance may giue vs the victory, or at leaſt will ſaue ſix thouſand mens liues, and there can but one be ſlaine?</p>
            <p>But this example hath no correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Duell, whereof wee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14900:11"/>
now treat, and one may not draw into conſequence particular actions which are exployted in warre, or in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of warre; eſpecially in heat of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, as <hi>H.</hi> 7. ſlew <hi>Richard,</hi> that enioyed the Royall throne: and <hi>Adolphe de Naſſau,</hi> died by the hand of <hi>Albert</hi> of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, it matters not to allege that famous example of <hi>Dauid</hi> againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> of a young infant not hauing for defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue Armes other then his Shepheards ſtaffe, and for offenſiue but a ſling and a ſtone, againſt an old warrier, monſtrous in ſtature; armed at all points, his ſpeare and lance of a prodigious bigneſſe, like the reſt; had not <hi>Dauid</hi> had in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular an aſſurance of Gods pleaſure, it had beene an extreme raſheneſſe to enterpriſe it, and to hope to ouerthrow ſo great a Coloſſus. Alſo that action is numbred amongſt the miracles, but miracles are not wrought to ſerue as rules for our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and we muſt conſider the quality of theſe two Champions, and the occaſion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14900:11"/>
of the Duell: The one was an Iſraelite, the other a Philiſtin; they engaged themſelues in the quarell of two nations, and not for their particular intereſt; they were ſubiects to two ſeuerall Princes, and of a contrary Religion, it was in the view of two Armies, and that of the Infidels was to yeeld themſelues conquered, if the Giant were ſlaine: In a word, beſide that, it was ſupernaturall, it was an action of Warre, and conſequently law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Now, to come to the ſcope of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, we muſt remember that all manner of difference, conſiſts either in <hi>Fact,</hi> or in <hi>Right.</hi> As concerning the queſtion of Right: I no more like that it ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the ſword; otherwhiles this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall cuſtome hath paſt as a Law, that the better title of Competitors conſiſteth in force, ſo that brothers entered not oft into their Fathers inheritance; but by way of parricide, vpon the dead carkaſles of their neereſt kindred, &amp; with violence to ſome of their own blood: Sons themſelues haue
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14900:12"/>
beene vnnaturall to their owne Fathers, and conſtrained them to ſeeke ſuccour by Armes. But, let vs ſee if a Duell may haue place in the queſtion of Fact.</p>
            <p>To proue the affirmatiue, theſe reaſons following are alledged; That the warre is without compariſon more vniuerſally bloody and pernicious, then is the combat of a few particular men, the death of one or two hath no proportion with the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chering and maſſacre of many thouſand perſons; the ſlaughter of infants and old folke, the deſolation of widowes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, the ſpoile of tillage, demoliſhing of houſes, ruine of villages, pillages and violence, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert into a wilderneſſe the moſt floriſhing Kingdomes; and in a word all the miſchiefes which warre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth, and yet is by naturall Right, That a Duell for proofe of actions ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and doubtfull, hath beene adiudged neceſſary by antiquity, which hath made the Laws, and approued by the ſuffrages of a great many nations, that the Chriſtian world hath happily put it in practiſe, for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14900:12"/>
no ſhort ſpace of time: That many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences cannot bee otherwiſe determined nor many ſecret iniuries come to light, but by this expedient.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge that warre is one of the ſcourges of mankind, and may bee of all others the moſt horrible: And thoſe which haue authority to make warre, are bound to ſeeke out all waies for agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they enterpriſe warre, to imploy the mediation of their allyes, and to bring downe their demands to an indifferent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallity. But, when one is forced to enter into war all lamentable euents, which accompany war are to be imputed to that party that hath compelled the other to ſuch a neceſſity; eſpecially, if the warre is defenſiue, for he that fights onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelfe, is not guilty of the miſeries which may follow. For offenſiue warre, oftentimes it is not neceſſary: a Prince or Eſtate, from whom a duty is detained haue right to regaine by this way. In the firſt warre that was in the world the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarche <hi>Abraham</hi> armed all his houſe, to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14900:13"/>
ſet at liberty his friends and kindred: Warre then is made warrantable by the law of neceſſity; now this neceſſity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds (as we haue before ſpecified) heere-hence, becauſe Soueraigne powers are exempt from iuſtifying their actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Tribunall.</p>
            <p>There is not a Iudge eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Kings to decide their differences, ſo that he which is offended by the other, can haue no recourſe but to the iuſtice of armes. But it is not ſo amongſt priuate men, for God hath giuen them Iudges, and yet not permitted ſuch Iudges, who are no other extirpers of Battell, to grant the ſame to two parties at variance, to the end that they may do Iuſtice by their ownhands.</p>
            <p>We muſt marke alſo that warre is not made to know which of the parties hath the right; for he that enterpriſeth a war, ought firſt to be well aſſured of the iuſtice of his cauſe; for otherwiſe it is not a war, but a publique robbery, but in the Duell, two men are made to fight, who it may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14900:13"/>
bee kill one the other, without which one knowes not which had the wrong.</p>
            <p>To conclude, war is authoriſed in Scripture by expreſſe ordinances, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with many rules, bleſſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> prayers, practiſed by Prophets and Kings; approued by the Fore-runner of Chriſt; honoured by the preſence of the Arke; and gouerned by a Chiefetaine, that cals himſelfe the God of Battailes. But after a Duell we finde not ſo much as the bare name mentioned.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Lawes, vpon which ſome found this Duell; we ought firſt to know, if ſuch Lawes themſelues be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. <hi>A wicked Law,</hi> ſaith an antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is no Law, but a corruption of Law; <note place="margin">Lawes haue enacted wcik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things.</note> and a baſtard law cannot legitimate an action, nor make a proceeding iuſtifiable: otherwiſe, Why curſe wee the antient <hi>Almains,</hi> amongſt whom, theft hath its approbation, as an exerciſe of vertue? Why condemne we the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who imitating the <hi>West Indians,</hi> haue their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants

buryed aliue with them, yea and their owne wiues? VVhy haue we abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated ſo many antient Lawes, made by our anceſtors, and that haue continued in vſe many ages? Is it not for that ſome of them are contrary to the Law Diuine; others of them repugne the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſauour more of barbarouſneſſe, then humanity? The Law which decrees a Duell in default of proofe, is found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the antient conſtitutions of the Seliques <hi>Allemans, Danes, Engliſh, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and other people of the weſt; from whom it is ſaid to take its originall. But, what were theſe Law-makers, that haue made this Law for vs?</p>
            <p>VVere they not ſuch themſelues, who decreed human Sacrifices to their falſe Gods, and ſpared not the offering vp in Sacrifice of their owne Infants? VVere they not ſuch who accounted thoſe vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate men and women, to haue an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall reſolution that died by their owne hands? VVere they not ſuch which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued inceſtuous copulations, and that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14900:15"/>
in a word made lawes as it were in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of God and Nature? But we are not to wonder if they decreed a Duell, in the queſtion of Fact, ſeeing that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of thoſe nations, do hardly take any other courſe in affaires where the right is controuerted, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is by all found fault with at this day. <hi>Froton</hi> King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> commanded that all differences ariſing in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſhould by combat be decided, and that is the reaſon, Why the <hi>Scythians</hi> who maintaine their right by force, and haue no other Religion, Law, nor Iuſtice then the ſword; haue accuſtomed to plant their grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds with trees, wherof they made their ſpeares, and to adore them as a ſupreme Deity. Contrariwiſe, the <hi>Eaſterne</hi> people, whoſe morall Vertues and Ciuility wee i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate; The <hi>Aſſyrians, Egyptians, Perſians, Hebrewes,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> neuer admitted of the Duell, but in fact of good warre: This Law then ought to be examined by that which is the rule of all others, as being deriued from God, for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14900:16"/>
we ſpeake not of particular ordinances which were in vſe onely in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but of that eternall Law, expreſſed in the Sacred Writ, which remaines in perpetuall ſtrength, &amp; binds all kinds of nations, and when there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a doubtfull cauſe, if Iudges would preuentthoſe reſentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences will make them feele, they cannot know a better way then this, to wit, To iudge an other by the ſame Law, which ſhall iudge them all at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>The examples of Duels cannot be of better regard then the laws which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them: <hi>England</hi> hath ſeene many fight in caſe of accuſations of treaſon, and it maters not to bring many inſtances of this nature, whereof Hiſtories are full: <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, King of <hi>France,</hi> would neuer condeſcent that two Noble men of his Court ſhould fight in ſingle combat, although they greatly deſired it, ſaying, that a Prince ought to ſuffer a thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of can come no good.

(who dyed after by a blow receiued in Tournament) granted a duell, but amongſt a thouſand of theſe combats one ſhall hardly finde two which haue brought to light that which was ſought after, to wit, the manifeſtation of the Fact, the truth thereof being ſtifled in the blood of the Duelliſts, ſo that it is oftner an act of Tragedie, then of true Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
            <p>Before I anſwer the Obiections, which may be alledged, we will encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Duell with theſe arguments fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Section,</hi> It is certaine and cannot be gainſaid, that this way is caſuall hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, and by conſequent deceiueable, I acknowledge that humane actions which are various, contingent and infinit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proue themſelues with ſo much cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, as can Mathematicall concluſions, which haue infallible demonſtrations; euer ſome incertainty goes a long with proofes.

ſhapes, that the Eie of Iuſtice cannot diſcerne the true figure, the witneſſes may be lyars; Oaths, falſe; Writings, counterfait; Iudges, corrupt; and the parties owne confeſſion, oftentimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traies their owne innocence: It hath been ſeene that ſome weary of an irkeſome life, haue voluntary accuſed themſelues of crimes which they neuer committed; the Torture hath ſomtimes cauſed men to ſay that which neuer was; and many alſo daue endured it, which haue ſtood in maintenance of deeds as falſe, as falſeneſſe it ſelfe: VVhat then can Iudges doe alwaies groping in the dark, and when the brighteſt lights, which they can bring, cannot find out the illuſions, which lie hidden in theſe obſcurities? I anſwer, that ſo long as they go a regular pace and that they containe themſelues within the bounds by good Lawes preſcribed, they cannot erre, when vpon the depoſition of two or three witneſſes, not to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt; it chanceth that an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent is condemned: the conſcience of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14900:17"/>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Section.</hi> This proceeding is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary to the fundamentall principles of Iuſtice, which adiudge the right not to him which hath the ſtronger body, or which hath more dexterity in his weapon; but to him that is knowne to maintaine a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14900:18"/>
iuſt cauſe, yet it is a thing thereby and conformable to the order of Nature, that the ſtrong ſhould ouercome the weake, ſo as it happens the weaker man though innocent, is conquered by the power of his ſtronger aduerſary. All the precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which may bee vſed (as the giuing them armes alike, and the taking away of all aduantages from either partie) cannot ſo perfectly equaliſe their forces, their dexterity, their ſpirit, their courages, but there will euer bee an inequality. And moreouer, a man is not at all times in like ſtrength and during the paſſage of ſuch an action a beame of the Sun; the ſhaking of a leafe, a little ſand blowne in the eye, or vnder the feet, a ſudden obiect, a cloud in the aire, a fright, a thought may vndoe one of the parties: but letting paſſe all this is it not alwayes a courſe oppoſite to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to iudge a man more by the ſucceſſe of his ſword, then by the goodneſſe of his cauſe?</p>

and that the ſingle combat is decreed to dilucidate and manifeſt the ſame; let vs ſee what will be the euent herein: Either the two combatants eſcape, or both of them ſtay vpon the place, or onely one of the twaine, if it chance they bee ſeparate vpon equall aduantage, what proofe will the Duell afford vs? Shall the truth of the Fact bee for euer vnknowne? Then to what purpoſe ſerued it to endanger their liues, when ſome other way of attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might haue beene found out? Had it not beene better to haue taken this knowne courſe, then to reioyce in their deſtruction, and engulph them into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? And if both remaine dead in the field, what proofe will that make? How ſhall truth appeare to vs, when their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is equall?

Or when one experiments the force of a poyſon vpon the body of a guilty man, with a promiſe to grant him his life, in caſe the ſtrength of his complexion ſurmount that of the poyſon; is not this a kind of condemnation? In the Duell, then two men are expoſed to vndergoe this danger; is not this a monſtrous iniuſtice? For or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily a man is condemned, becauſe proofe is brought in againſt him; but heer quite contrary, a man is condemned; though nothing be prooued againſt him: one is condemned, I ſay, to hazard that which no man can reſtore againe, I meane, his life; If any man obiect that in war, a Soldier who ſtands ſuſpect of ſome fault, is commanded to bee the firſt that ſhould ſcale a breach, orto ſeeke out ſome dangerous place, or to vndergoe ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14900:21"/>
ſeruice full of danger; I anſwer, if that man be in fault, the ordinance cannot be taxed of iniuſtice, that aſſignes him ſuch an expiation; but if he be innocent, yet is there no wrong done him, in ſo much as the law of armes may command men of more eminent ranke; who are bound to ſacrifice their liues for the good of the common weale. And therefore we muſt againe be mindfull of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a Duell, and thoſe actions; which are atcheiued in the warres. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, a Souldier, or Officer being ſuſpect, or accuſed of treaſon; there can no better courſe be taken to know the truth, then to make a triall, by ſome ſeruice; which may either manifeſt his perfidiouſneſſe or loyalty; for ſuch actions diſcloſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward intentions of a man, by a naturall dependance, and produce effects of like nature vnto the Fact, which cannot bee certainly decided: But in a Duell there is no iot of likelyhood, that any proofe ſhould appeare thereby amongſt ſuch as profeſſe themſelues men: for can wee in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14900:22"/>
any reaſon draw this concluſion, that one man is a traytor, becauſe an other hath killed him.</p>
            <p>It may be too, ſome will ſay, that this Duell is not by command, but onely vpon ſufferance, that the two parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues requeſt it, and they being agreed, there is no wrong offered them, ſeeing, it is their owne will and ſeeking: To which I ſay onely this, that it is the office of the Magiſtrate to cohibit and reſtraine the paſſions of particular men, and not to comply with their deſires of killing one another. In ancient time, in ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales, there was an ordinance made for the diſparagement, and diſgrace of ſuch that kill themſelues by their owne priuate authority; and the purport of the Law, was, that if any one deſired death, he ſhould make his repaire to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who hauing heard what he could ſay; iudged if his requeſt to dye were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and it being granted ſo to bee; gaue him leaue either to hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or cut his owne throat; otherwiſe,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14900:22"/>
it is a crime to dye without leaue. But the publike Magiſtrate ought rather to reine in the fury of the enraged, then giue them a paſtport to ſlay one another; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to permit a murther, is to commit it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Section.</hi> Now, as we know that the intention of each of the two, is to kill his aduerſary, in caſe he deny not his words; if it chance that this fatall Lot fall vpon the innocent; can the Conſcience of the Iudges find reaſons ſufficient for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe? Shall not the blood returne vpon their faces, &amp; they neuer be quitted of this aſperſion: And it will not ſerue their turnes, to ſay they had no ſuch intention, for they cannot deny to haue expoſed the innocent (which ſoeuer of the two hee were) to a deſperate condition, to haue ingaged him in a Combat, and to haue giuen authority to the hand that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated the murder.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Section.</hi> Nay, I ſay more, that if two criminall perſons, duly attainted and conuicted bee condemned to death, the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14900:23"/>
Magiſtrate cannot in good Conſcience aſſigne a Duell, that they may ſlay each other, for that were to make them execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and homicides of themſelues: but in a Duell (whereof wee treat) it is farre worſe, for heere the innocent ſhall bee the butcher of the nocent, or (which is more horrid) heere the guilty ſhall put to death the innocent, or, which fals out there, they are both in perill to bee but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of each other.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Section.</hi> To ſay that in a Duell, we await what ſucceſſe God will ſend, is a friuolous excuſe; ill proceedings haue ſometimes good ſucceſſe, but that is by accident: Wee are not bound to <hi>Pilate</hi> for hauing condemned <hi>Ieſus Christ;</hi> hoping that God will pardon our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. And more, who hath told vs that God will adiudge as we deſire; to wit, to the aduantage of the innocent? Thinke wee that God is bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe to our intentions, and to execute our ſentence? Or if it be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſee what hee will doe therein, is not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14900:23"/>
this impudently to tempt him, and to make an encrochment vpon his hidden iudgements?</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Section.</hi> But it is yet more cruell; To what danger are their two ſoules ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed?

Is it likely to bee receiued into the boſome of the Patriarks? Why then doe wee hazard ſo ſwiftly the ſaluation of a ſoule, which the Sonne of God bought ſo dearely, and which cannot bee bought againe; but at the price of ſo many teares, which he hath ſhed with great cries, and of ſo much blood hee hath ſhed to waſh it?

            <p n="9">9. <hi>Section.</hi> Let vs oppoſe to this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous law, the ſtipulations of Chriſtian Diuines, who call this Duell, an inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him that hath beene a murderer

from the beginning, who when in effect there were but two brethren in the world, inſtigated the one to kill the other. Let vs oppoſe againſt it the Canons &amp; Law of the Church, which haue thundred forth Anathema's, and Excommunications a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe bloody homicides; and which haue proſecuted their very aſhes, denying them Chriſtian buriall, and condemned their memory as abominable and worthy to be execrated.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Section.</hi> Finally, let vs not oppoſe the Lawes of God, which haue vouchſafed to deſcend to actions of leſſe conſequence. Theſe holy Laws forbid to ſpeake wrong of a deafe man, to lead the blind out of the way, to mouzell the Oxe that treadeth out the corne, and many other ordinances of like nature; But how comes it that we find not any rule, in a matter ſo important as is the Duell? Iudiciall proceedings are there well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed at large, and in diuers places; and vpon what proofes Iudges ought to found their iudgements. The ſame in

Alſo amongſt all the Great courages, which the Holy Story commends to vs; and amongſt them, which often had many particular quarrels to fight; wee cannot finde the practiſe of this Duell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> had an enemy in the Court of <hi>Saul,</hi> to wit, <hi>Doeg</hi> the Edomite, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore not to accuſe him before his Prince, breaking out defiance, and outrage in his hearing; But <hi>Dauid</hi> did neuer demand the combat to right his innocence, and to make this impoſtor ſwallow his lye; for, as concerning what he did againſt the Giant, wee haue ſeene, that that action was of another nature; and from this we may conclude, that the Duell is a crime, for whatſoeuer we find vnwarranted by precept or example in the Scripture, is without Faith; now whatſoeuer is done without Faith, is a ſin.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Section.</hi> Let vs adde to this, that when the truth of a Fact, cannot be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by lawfull meanes it is a tempting of God to bee obſtinately bent by firie force, to know that which he would haue
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14900:25"/>
hid from vs; but it is a bloody boldneſſe, to ſeeke for the truth in the blood and in the heart of a man, like thoſe wretched ſoules, that ſacrifice humane Creatures to know by their entrals, and ſhall often get nothing, but reſentment &amp; repentance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole matter, if it chance the fact be manifeſted afterward, when the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe is paſt repaire: as hath beene ſeene in the famous example of two men, one of which charged the other to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted theft; they fought in ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat; the partie accuſed was ſlaine; ſome ſhort time after, the theft was found in the hands of a third partie that was guilty thereof. The Iudges cannot now raiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the poore innocent, but muſt ſuffer the ſting of Conſcience, all their life long.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>Section.</hi> And laſtly, let vs ſee if a Duell be to any purpoſe, for the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of a difference; what inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can enſue vpon a difference vndeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? It may be the two parties may bee fighting continually; Is it then fit to make
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14900:26"/>
them kill one another to day, to the end, they may not doe it at another time? or is it better they ſhould be ſlaine with cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the end, they may dye by priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? The remedy is worſe then the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and it is worth laughing at, were it not an offence to God. If this way of a Duell bee lawfull betweene two perſons, why ſhall it not be vſed betweene two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies vpon like occaſion? and euermore the moſt barbarous neuer liked that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſhould permit a Combat between two kindreds or two families, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent would extend to the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and laſtly, one part of the Eſtate would deſtroy the other, which would proue the Forerunner of deſolation: In a word, this courſe would extirpate all Seates of Iuſtice, and ouerthrow all order and politie.</p>
            <p>What then is the duty of Iudges in ſuch like occaſions? I ſay not that they ſhould doe as that Iudge, that being not able to giue his reſolution in a Capitall matter; and fearing to doe wrong to the one, or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14900:26"/>
the other, would not giue a definitiue Sentence; but decreed onely that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould appeare within a hundred yeeres, to abide what ſhould bee iudged to be right: A terme long enough and ſuch as would free them from Court, and proceſſe vnleſſe ſome other Iudge had interpoſed himſelfe in the matter. But to ſpeake ſeriouſly, the Iudges cannot bee ignorant what is preſcribed vnto them by good Lawes, to wit: <hi>That in euery doubtfull caſe, the Accuſed ought to haue the aduantage, and that hee muſt pronounce in his fauour: That the Accuſer not prouing the crime obiected; the Partie charged ought to be acquitted.</hi> This rule of Law is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable and approuable; If hee erre in ſteering other courſe, pure Innocence ſhall reſide in more ſecurity in the Dens of Lyons, in the Foreſts, or among the Dragons of the Wilderneſſe, then in the Palace of Iuſtice. There is nothing ſo eaſy as to accuſe, and calumniation with a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen forhead, an impudent throat, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity to perſiſt in leaſings, are ſuch things as
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14900:27"/>
ever ouer whelme the modeſty of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
            <p>Yet neuertheleſſe, I acknowledge that when a crime touching the Eſtate in queſtion, many reaſons there may bee, wherefore one ought not euer to bind the Informer to all the ſtricktneſſe which are vſed to accuſers that faile to proue their accuſations; if a crime of this nature come to my knowledge and I diſcouer it not, I make my ſelfe guilty; and if the fact come to light, at any time, by another meanes; my ſilence will bee enough to hang me. It ſtands the State vpon, that there bee a moderation vſed in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: To impoſe ſilence at all times, to Delators, that are not able to proue; would Produce but bad conſequences, for many conſpiracies would be plotted, with more audacity and ſecurity. In all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates it is permitted to whomſoeuer hee bee to diſcouer crimes, by a ſecret way: hence it is that an Informer, or Delecter of ſome Crime, write downe in ſome ſcroll (without telling his Name) the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14900:27"/>
Crime, the Authors and Confederates, and all circumſtances, which are come to his knowledge; hee caſt this ſcroll into a Trunck, which is placed within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Churches for that end; the Magiſtrats comming to ſee the Trunck, find many relations, which ſerue them to diſcouer great miſteries: Now though this way bee not free from inconueniences, and that there can be no proofe made thereby (the informer being vnknowne) this good comes thereby, that many hidden pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, which otherwiſe had not beene brought to light, are by this diſcouery di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged. The Prince makes his obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things thus diſcouered, and the diſcouerer beeing vnknowne, remaines in ſecurity; I conclude, that a wiſe Prince hauing regard to the condition of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to the conſequences, and other good reſpects may conſerue vnſtayned both the honour of the one, and of the other.</p>
            <p>The greateſt difficulty, ſeems to be this, In two contradictories, the one being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14900:28"/>
falſe, how can one acquit the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, without making the accuſer giue himſelfe the lye, and by conſequent to ſurceaſe, but this moderation may bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to wit, that one content himſelfe to ſay; That he may not goe forward in a fact without proofe, yet it were fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne perpetuall ſilence, and neuer more to complaine vnder a great paine.</p>
            <p>Be it as it will, of all expedients, which one can take, the Duell is the worſe. This way is practiſed by men barbarous and vnnaturall; it is caſuall and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: It profanes the Sacredneſſe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: It ouerthrowes vniuerſall Maximes: It produceth no certainty: It puts in ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy the Innocent, as well as the guilty: It tempts God many wayes: It makes men ſlayers of their neighbours and themſelues: It cozens men of ſaluation, and carries their ſoules to the Gates of Hell: It is condemned by the wiſer part of Chriſtians: It is not warranted by the Law of God: It is without example, from the practiſe of the faithfull. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14900:28"/>
it is a poyſonous antidote, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious then the miſchiefe, which one ſhould preuent. And when it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the fruit deſired, it is wretched fruit muſt bee purchaſſed at ſuch a price. <hi>Dauid</hi> in his ſickneſſe earneſtly deſiring to drinke of the Wels of Bethlehem; two Souldiers, would haue hazarded their liues to fetch ſome, hee proteſted hee would not drinke the blood of thoſe men. Nothing is ſo ſacred as the blood of a Man, and the blood of Beaſts is not imployed but in Sacrifices. Let vs not forget the Law expreſſed in the 21. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Deut.</hi> concerning the manſlaughter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, and the expiation thereof in the ſtony vally.

So at the third time, the Herauld at the halfe houre after three of the clock in the afternoone, by the commandement of the Conſtable, ſhall thus ſummon him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>D.</hi> Defendant, ſaue your honour, and come in to the action you haue vndertaken at this day; the time is far gone, the halfe houre is ſpent; come into the liſts vpon the perill that ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereon, or elſe you come too late.</p>
            <p>Then when they haue both appeared, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of the Conſtables Court ſhall in writing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14900:31"/>
obſerue their entrance, the order, and time, and the manner, whether on foot or mounted, their Armes, the colour of their horſes, and how their horſes are harneſſed, leſt their horſes, or their harneſſe ſhould bee changed, or otherwiſe imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelled.</p>
            <p>Then the Conſtable ſhall know whether it will pleaſe the Kings Maieſtie to appoint any of his Nobles to counſell and aduiſe them.</p>
            <p>The Conſtable ſhall employ two Knights or Eſquires to the Appellant, to keep his ſtanding, and to care that hee obſerue no charme, ſpell, or other ill Arts, vntill he hath made oath; and with the like charge, two others ſhall be diſpatched to the Defendant.</p>
            <p>And when the Conſtable hath asked his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties pleaſure, whether his Highneſſe will receiue their oathes in perſon, or that the Conſtable and Marſhall take them in the liſts, calling for the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant, with his Counſell, he ſhall demand of the Counſell, if they will make any further proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they ſhould now put them in; for this time is peremptory, ſo as hereafter no proteſtation ſhall be receiued.</p>
            <p>Then the Conſtable ſhall haue a Clerke ready by him with a booke; and the Conſtable ſhall cauſe his Regiſter to read the whole Bill to the Appellant, and ſhall ſay to him,</p>
            <p>You <hi>A.</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> doe you know this to bee your Bill, and the complaint which you exhibited in Court before me? Laying your right hand vpon this booke, you muſt ſweare the truth of your Bill

in all points, from the firſt to the laſt charge in it, and that it is your intent to proue vpon <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>D.</hi> the contents thereof to be true, ſo aid you God.</p>
            <p>The forme of it is thus, Thou <hi>A.</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> this thy Bill is ſooth in all points and articles conteined therein from the beginning to the end; and it is thine intent to proue them this day ſo to bee, on the aforeſaid <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>D.</hi> So God thee helpe and hallow.</p>
            <p>This done, the Appellant is remanded to his ſtand.</p>
            <p>The Defendant ſhall be in like manner ſworne vpon the truth of his defence.</p>
            <p>And this their firſt oath they ought to take kneeling; but by the fauour of the Conſtable and Marſhall they ſomtimes do it ſtanding.</p>
            <p>Then the Conſtable ſhall by the Marſhall, call the Appellant before him, and tender him his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond oath, which (if the Conſtable giue leaue) he may take ſitting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> laying your hand on the book this ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d time, you ſhal ſweare that you come no otherwiſe appointed then as by vs the Conſtable &amp; Marſhall hath beene aſſigned; that is, with a ſhort Sword, and a Gauntlet; a long Sword, and a Dagger; that you haue not any knife, or any other pointed inſtrument or engine, ſmall or great; no ſtone, no herbe of vertue; no charme, experiment, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other inchantment, by whoſe power you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue you may the eaſier ouercome your aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who within theſe liſts ſhall oppoſe you in his defence; and that you truſt not in any thing more

then in God, your body, and the merits of your quarrell; So God you help.</p>
            <p>Then being conducted to his place, the keepers of the liſts ſhall bee put out, and the Defendant in the ſame manner ſhall be demeaned.</p>
            <p>Then the Conſtable and Marſhall ſhall ſend for them both before them, and the Conſtable ſhall name the Appellant and Defendant, and ſhall ſay to them both thus;</p>
            <p>Take yee each other by the right hand, and I command that neither of you bee ſo hardy as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to handle one another, vpon your perill; and laying their left hands on the booke, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable ſhall ſay,</p>
            <p>I charge you <hi>A.</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> Appellant, by your faith, and your right hand, which is incloſed in the hand of your aduerſary <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>D.</hi> that you vſe your power, and make vſe of all aduantages to make good your appeale vpon <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>D.</hi> your enemy, the Defendant, to force him to a rendring of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into your hands by demanding of a parley, or with your owne hand to kill him before you depart out of theſe liſts, by that height of the Sunne, and age of the day you haue aſſigned you by vs the Conſtable and Marſhall, by your faith; And ſo God you help.</p>
            <p>The ſame forme ſhall bee obſerued on the part of the Defendant; and then they ſhall be brought each of them to their places, the liſts cleared of the Councell and ſeruants on both ſides.</p>
            <p>The oathes thus paſt, an Herauld by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Conſtable and Marſhall, ſhall make
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14900:34"/>
               <hi>Oyes</hi> thirce, and ſhall ſay,</p>
            <p>We the Conſtable and Marſhall in the Kings name charge and command euery man of what quality or condition ſoeuer he bee, that hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach not within foure foot to theſe liſts, nor that hee ſpeake any word, make any noiſe, giue any ſigne, nor by his countenance or otherwiſe direct either of theſe parties, <hi>A.</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> or <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>D.</hi> Appellant and Defendant, to take any aduantage the one vpon the other, by any ſigne ſo giuen, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paine of life and member, and the forfeiture of his chattels.</p>
            <p>Next, the Conſtable and Marſhall ſhall aſſigne the place where the king at Armes and the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds ſtanding may haue a full ſight of the action within the liſts: for now they are to attend the Appellant and Defendant, and miniſter to them in what they ſhall command them; and if either of them faint, or haue either deſire to eat or to drinke of their victuals they bring with them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the liſts, it is the office of the Heraulds to bee attending vpon them. If the Appellant will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat or drink, hee muſt firſt deſire the good leaue of the Defendant, which ſhall be by a king at armes ſignified to the Conſtable and Marſhall, and they to attend his Maieſty with the deſire of the Appellant, and the conſent of the Defendant, and pray his Maieſties allowance of it. And if either the Appellant, or the Defendant haue a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to doe any other thing, the Heraulds and the Purſuiuants ſhall attend them.</p>
            <p>After this the Conſtable and Marſhall freeing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14900:34"/>
the liſts from people of all conditions, except a Knight and two Eſquires of the Conſtables train, and the Lieutenant; a Knight and two Eſquires of the Marſhals retinue, which ſhall bee in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, bearing Lances in their hands, which are not to bee barbed with any iron, to part them when his Maieſty ſhall giue the word.</p>
            <p>Theſe Knights and Eſquires are neither to bring ſwords, kniues, bowes, nor daggs into the liſts.</p>
            <p>They of the Conſtables ſide are to keepe one corner of the liſts, and there lay themſelues flat on the ground: and in like manner ſhall they of the Marſhals ſide beſtow themſelues at another corner of the liſts; for none may appeare vpright within the liſts ſaue the Conſtable and Marſhall.</p>
            <p>And if the King be not preſent, then the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and Marſhall ſhall ſit in the place of the King, and the Lieutenant be within the liſts.</p>
            <p>But if the King bee preſent, then the Conſtable ſitting vpon a ſeat before the King within the liſts, as the Kings Vicar generall, ſhall command his Lieutenant to accompany the Appellant, and the Marſhall or his Lieutenant with the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſhall accompany the Defendant.</p>
            <p>And the Conſtable ſitting at the foot of the ſeat Royall, ſhall ſpeake with a lowd voyce; Let them go, let them go to doe their endeauours.</p>
            <p>This ſaid, the Appellant going to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant (ſtanding in the preſence of the King) ſhall with all his ſtrength aſſault him; and the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſhall be as wary as he can in his defence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:14900:35"/>
The Conſtable and Marſhall, or their Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, ought to be within hearing, and alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight, if in caſe either of them ſpeake, or make any ſigne he will renounce his quarrell; or if the Kings Maieſty ſay but Hoe, or giue any other ſignall, then they who are within the liſts with the Conſtable and Marſhall, throwing their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwixt the Appellant and the Defendant, and ſo parting them, they ſhall not giue way to either of them to aſſault the other, vntill the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand they bee free, or that the Conſtable declare his Maieſties pleaſure to bee ſo, by ſaying, Let them go, the King wils it.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding that the Conſtable hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the Defendant a ſet time to come in to his performance, yet, in caſe he commeth not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the appointment of the Conſtable, of right, iudgement ſhall not paſſe againſt him vpon his default, vntill the firſt halfe houre after three of the clock be cleerly paſſed, let the cauſe be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But the Appellant whoſe ſuite it is, ought to be there at his preciſe time, when the Conſtable ſhall firſt demand him, elſe his pledges haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their ſecurity.</p>
            <p>The Appellant and Defendant ſhall be ſearched by the Conſtable and Marſhall, their weapons and armes queſtioned in all points, that they bee auowable, and no engine or deuice not honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly iuſtifiable in them. And if they finde any ſuch practice, the party ſhall bee outed of that weapon: for, reaſon, ciuility, and the law of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14900:35"/>
Armes will vpon no condition, in acts of this high performance, admit of trechery, or baſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy.</p>
            <p>The Appellant and Defendant ſhall, as they themſelues agree, cloath their bodies; for that is left to themſelues, only the Conſtable ſhall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that they both haue the ſame Armour, or other defence vpon his body.</p>
            <p>If one of them deſire his ſword to be ſhortned, ſo that it bee ſhorter then the meaſure of the ſtandard, the other is not bound to abate the length of his weapon: But if they once agree to fight with ſwords longer then the ſtandard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, at the day of the action within the liſts, either of them may demand to haue his weapon made to anſwere the ſtandard, and the other is in honour bound to make his conformable, being a demand lawfull, not vpon fancy, and taſting of no priuate way or aduantage.</p>
            <p>Now the Conſtable and Marſhall are to beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue to the King, if his Maieſty ſhall pleaſe to command the Combatants ſhould bee parted to take breath, or for any other purpoſe; and in any caſe they muſt haue eſpeciall care how they part and diuide them; and that at the time when they interpoſe, they bee both of them in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or poſſibility, and neither of them in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy nor in the hand of the other.</p>
            <p>The Conſtable and Marſhall ſhall not ſuffer them to whiſper, or haue any priuate diſcourſe; for they are the witneſſes, and in their breaſts lies the record of their words, and in no other place.</p>

And if the battell bee grounded on a cauſe of treaſon, hee that is conuicted and diſcomfited, ſhall be diſarmed by the command of the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Marſhall, one corner of the liſts broken downe in diſgrace of the party becoming recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and being faſtned to a horſe, ſhall bee dragg'd from the place where he ſo loſt his Armes to the block, and haue his head ſeuered from his body, or be hanged by the neck, or otherwiſe, according to the ſeuerall vſages of the Country.</p>
            <p>It is the office of the Marſhall to accompany the party to the place, and there in his view to ſee execution done, and all the ſentence performed, and that aſwell of the ſide of the Appellant as the Defendant. For good conſcience, equity, and the law of the field do exact, that the Appellant if in caſe he be conuicted, and becommeth a man van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed in his proofe, that hee incurre the ſame paine and hazard the Defendant ſhould haue done:</p>
            <p>But if the cauſe be any other crime then trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hee that is ſo by the body of his aduerſary conuicted, ſhall loſe his Armes within the liſts, and thence be led out to the place of his ſuffering, which is directed by the vſage of the Country; and this aſwell of the Appellant as the Defendant, as aforeſaid; onely hee ſhall not bee dragged, nor the railes broken, vnleſſe it bee in caſe of treaſon, and not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But if it be meerely an act of Armes, a tryall by challenge allowed by the grace of the King, Conſtable, and Marſhall; he that in ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14900:37"/>
confeſſeth himſelfe vanquiſhed, ſhall be diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, degraded, and being led to the skirt of the liſt, he ſhall be toſſed and throwne ouer the barrs, without any further puniſhment.</p>
            <p>If it pleaſe the King to take the difference, and the iudgement thereof into his owne hand; and command them to bee friends without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther controuerſie: Then the Conſtable taking the Appellant, and the Marſhall the Defendant, ſhall beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>both befor the King: And the King ſhall by the Conſtables ſignifie his pleaſure vnto them; Then they ſhall be both of them lead together vnto one of the gates of the liſts, and be ſo conuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the liſts, in all points as they entered the liſts; and ſhall be ſo conueied out of the liſts, in the ſame Article of time, that of them no man may ſay, A firſt was out, or A laſt within the liſts: For, ſince the King hath into his own hands taken the conſideration of the quarrell; it were diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that either of the ſides, in a Battaile with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne by the word of a King, ſhould ſuffer any diſhonor, the one more then the other. And the antient tenet and opinion hath bene, that he that is firſt out of the Liſts ſuffers a diminution of honor, the field being his in honor, that is laſt poſſeſſor of it; For, he maketh it good.</p>
            <p>There ought to be double liſts for the ſeruants of the Conſtable and Marſhall, and for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant at Armes of the King, who are to attend, and defend, that no offence, affray, outrage, or other miſdeameanor againſt the Cryes, made only in Court be committed or ſuffered, or any affront
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14900:38"/>
that may be meant againſt the Kings Maieſty, or the Laws and honor of Armes. Theſe men ought to be in compleat Armes.</p>
            <p>The Conſtable and Marſhall, may bring what power they pleaſe with them into the field, and thoſe either Armed, or otherwiſe, at their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>The Kings Sergeants at Armes ſhall bee the keepers of the Doores, and Portals of the Liſts; and they are to make all Arreſts by the Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandment of the Conſtable and Marſhall; and ſuch ſo arreſted to aſſure.</p>
            <p>The fee of the Conſtable is their ſteeds, and Armes, and all that they bring with them into the liſts, ſaue onely thoſe wherewith they fight; And of the partie ouercome, all his Armes and other things of Combat, are the right of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable.</p>
