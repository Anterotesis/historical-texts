            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Brother, indeavouring to quiet and comfort his
heart, which was (no queſtion exceedingly troubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon that ſore and great affliction that was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him in the ſtrange death of his two Sonnes, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab,</hi>
and <hi>Abibu,</hi> the ſtory is this:</p>
               <p>After <hi>Aarons</hi> Sonnes were conſecrated to the Prieſtly Office,
they coming to attend this their Office, the very firſt day after
their conſecration to offer Incenſe unto God, they ventured to
offer incenſe with ſtrange fire, with other fire then God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116352:4"/>
Upon that the fire of Gods wrath broke out upon
them, and ſlew them both preſently in the very Sanctuary before
all the people, for it was a ſolemne time: being the beginning of
the ſolemn Conſecration of the Prieſthood. Upon this the ſpirit
of <hi>Aaron</hi> could not but be exceedingly troubled, to ſee his two
Sonnes thus ſtruck. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> comes to him and ſaith, This is
that which the Lord ſpake, <hi>I will be Sanctified in them that draw
nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorifyed.</hi> And upon this
<hi>Aaron</hi> held his peace.</p>
               <p>We reade that once fire came downe from Heaven in a way of
Mercy to conſume the ſacrifices: but now fire comes downe
from heaven in a way of Judgement to conſume the ſacrificers,
even <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu:</hi> they were <hi>Aarons</hi> ſonnes, the ſonnes of a
godly man, the ſonnes of the High-Prieſt, they were his eldeſt
ſonnes, for <hi>Aaron</hi> had other ſonnes beſides <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazer</hi>
and <hi>Ithamar,</hi> but theſe were his two eldeſt ſonnes: they
were two voung men, they were ſtruck in the very prime of their
age, they were two that were newly conſecrated in the Prieſts
office, for ſo you finde it in the 9. Chap. And they were two men
of renown in the country and before all the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> two
men that God had much honoured heretofore; as you ſhall find
in the 24 Chap of Exod. and the beginning, this <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi>
were men of great repute and great renown, that God did
much honour in former times; for when God called <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> with the Elders to come up to him, Hee ſingles out <hi>Nadab</hi>
and <hi>Abihu</hi> amongſt the reſt and names them. And hee ſaid unto
<hi>Moſes,</hi> Come up unto the Lord, thou and <hi>Aaron, Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu,</hi>
and 70. of the Elders of <hi>Iſrael. Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Nadab</hi> and
<hi>Abihu</hi> are only named, and then 70. of the Elders in generall, but
<hi>Moſes, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu,</hi> as if theſe were the foure emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
men of renown among all the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hee names
none of the 70. Elders but theſe two, beſides <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi>
therfore theſe two that were conſumed by ſtrange fire, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
men and newly conſecrated into their Office.</p>
               <p>What was their Sinne?</p>
               <p>Their ſinne it was offering of ſtrange fire, ſo the Text ſaith
that they offred <hi>ſtrange fire,</hi> which God commanded them not, in
the beginning of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:116352:4"/>
But had God ever forbidden it? where doe wee find that ever
God had forbidden them to offer ſtrange Fire, or appointed
that they ſhould offer onely one kind of fire? There is no Text
of Scripture, that you can find from the beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to
this place, where God hath ſayd in <hi>terminis,</hi> in ſo many words
expreſly, <hi>You ſhall offer no fire but one kind of fire.</hi> And yet
here they are conſumed by fire from God, for offering ſtrange fire.
I finde in the 30 `of <hi>Exod.</hi> ver. 9. that there they were forbidden
offering ſtrange Incenſe, but I doe not find that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
offering ſtrange fire. In <hi>Levit.</hi> 6. 13. and divers verſes in
that Chapter we find that God had appointed that they ſhould
keep conſtantly the fire on the Altar burning, and never to let it
go out: Now that was it ſeemes Gods intention that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſhould make uſe of that fire, and that fire onely. God
would have them to pick out his meaning: God ſent fire downe
from heaven upon the Altar, ſo in the latter end of the 9. Chap.
God ſent downe fire from heaven, &amp; gave them a charge to keep
that fire on the Altar conſtantly, and never to let it goe out: ſo
that it ſeemes God would have them pick out his meaning, that
becauſe he had ſent down fire from heaven upon the Altar, and
gave them power to keep that conſtantly, God would have them
therfore to underſtand, that what Incenſe or Sacrifice he would
have the uſe of fire in, it ſhould be onely that fire and no other,
though God did never ſay to them directly in theſe words, <hi>You
ſhall make uſe of this fire and no other,</hi> but God would have them to
<hi>underſtand</hi> this. That's their ſin therefore in offering of ſtrange
fire. Now fire comes from the Lord and doth conſume them.
Some think this fire came from the Altar, but ſurely it could
not be any ordinary fire that did conſume <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> at
this time for you ſhall find in the next ver to my text, That the
bodies of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were not conſumed by the fire, no,
nor their cloathes, they were kil'd by the fire and yet their cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes
were whole. therefore it was not an ordinary fire, it was
ſome Celeſtiall fire ſtruke into them to ſlay them, for ſo ſaith the
text in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ver. <hi>Come neer, carry away your Bretheren from before
the Sanctuary out of the Camp: and ſo they went and carried them in
their coats out of the Camp,</hi> ſo tht their cloathes and bodies were
not conſumed, only they were kil'd by the fire: they were ſtruck
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116352:5"/>
with a ſudden death, and that in the preſence of the Lord: ſuch
a death as God had never threatned in the Word before, God
had never threatned the Prieſts and ſaid, If you Offer ſtrange
fire you ſhall be conſumed by fire: but yet God ſmites them
with death by fire they had not time to ſeek God, no not ſo much
(as we uſe to ſay) as to ſay Lord have mercy upon me: they had
no time to promiſe amendment at all: now upon this heavy
judgement, the heart of <hi>Aaron</hi> could not poſſibly but be very
much troubled, yea and the ſpirit of <hi>Moſes</hi> too, for <hi>Moſes</hi> was
their unckle, and <hi>Aaron</hi> their father, they could not but be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
much greived: but <hi>Moſes</hi> being the brother of <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſpirit (no queſtion) exceedingly troubled, being under
ſuch a ſad affliction, and that ſuch a Godly man even as <hi>Aaron</hi>
was ſhould have ſuch a ſad judgment befall his Children: <hi>Moſes</hi>
comes and ſpeakes comfortably to him, and labours to ſupport
his ſpirit: and how doth he do it? He comes not as ordinarily
you uſe to viſit your brethren, <hi>Oh! you muſt be content with this:</hi>
no, but he comes and applyes the Word of God, and ſhewes
how God muſt be ſanctified; and by that he comes to quiet the
heart of his brother <hi>Aaron:</hi> This is that which the Lord hath
ſpoke ſaith <hi>Moſes:</hi> Hee ſeekes to ſtay the heart of his Brother
with that which God ſpake.</p>
               <p>But where do we find that God ſpake this?</p>
               <p>It's hard to find in any Scripture theſe very words in <hi>ter minis</hi>
before this time: and therefore <hi>Auguſtin</hi> thinks it was onely the
word God <hi>ſpake</hi> but not <hi>written,</hi> and ſo they had it from hand to
hand by tradition as many other things, as the Prophecie of
<hi>Enoch</hi> that the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeakes of, you doe not find it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Book of God, and yet the Apoſtle ſpeakes of it, ſo
that indeed it was from hand to hand: yea and we find in the
New Teſtament when <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of a thing that Chriſt
ſhould ſay, how that our Lord ſaith, <hi>It is a more bleſsed thing to
give then to receive;</hi> you find it not recorded in the Goſpels that
Chriſt ſaid ſo. So, this is that which the Lord ſaid, though it
was not written from the beginning of Geneſis to this very place,
or otherwiſe though it be not recorded in expreſſe terms, yet
ſomthing is recorded to the ſame purpoſe and effect: and ſo it
may ſeeme to have reference to that Scripture <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 43. there
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116352:5"/>
we have a Scripture comes as neere to it as any I know. And
<hi>there will I meet with the children of Iſrael, and the tabernacle ſhall be
ſanctified by my glory,</hi> that's as much in effect, as <hi>I will be ſanctified
in thoſe that come nigh me,</hi> in thoſe that come to Worſhip me in
my Tabernacle, I will be ſanctified in all things that concerne
my <hi>Worſhip,</hi> I will be ſure to be ſanctifyed there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will be ſanctified</hi>] I will be <hi>Hallowed,</hi> for it is the very ſame
that you have in the Lords Prayer, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> only
that's the <hi>Greeke</hi> word, and this is the <hi>Hebrew:</hi> but if you would
tranſlate this word into <hi>Greeke,</hi> you muſt tranſlate it by the
ſame word that Chriſt ſpake when he taught his diſciples to pray
<hi>hallowed bee thy name,</hi> Hallowd and Sanctifyed is all one. Lord
let thy Name appeare to be Holy: ſo <hi>I will be Sanctified,</hi> that is,
I will have my Name appeare to be Holy, I will be made known
unto my People, and to all the World that I am a <hi>holy</hi> God:
that's the meaning of <hi>I will be Sanctifyed,</hi> I will be knowne to al
the world that I am a <hi>Holy</hi> God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And before all the People I will be Glorifyed,</hi> ſo it is in the latter
part of the verſe: as if God ſhould ſay, I account it to be my <hi>glory</hi>
that I ſhould be manifeſted to be <hi>Holy</hi> before all the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will be Sanctifyed,</hi> that is I will have my People to demeane
and carry themſelves ſo as to hold forth their acknowledgement
of my <hi>Holyneſſe</hi> ſo, as by their carriage I may appeare to be a <hi>Holy</hi>
God. I will be Sanctifyed by them, or otherwiſe if they ſhall
not in an active way <hi>Sanctify</hi> my name, that is, if they ſhall not
demeane themſelves ſo as to hold forth the glory of my <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
then I will be Sanctifyed upon them; I will demeane and
carry my ſelf towards them ſo, as by my actions upon them, I
will make it appeare what a <hi>Holy</hi> God I am: So God is Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two wayes, eyther by the <hi>Holyneſſe</hi> of his People, in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
towards him holding forth the glory of Gods <hi>Holyneſſe:</hi>
and ſo in that 1. <hi>Pet. 3. 15. Sanctifye the Lord God in your hearts,</hi>
the Saints doe ſanctifye God in their hearts when they feare God
as a <hi>Holy</hi> God, and Reverence him and Love him as a holy God:
and ſo Sanctifie him in their lives, when their lives doe hold
forth the glory of Gods <hi>Holyneſſe,</hi> then God is Sanctifyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Put then if we do not do ſo, then God Sanctifies himſelf, that
is in wayes of</hi> Judgement <hi>upon thoſe that do not in wayes of</hi> holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116352:6"/>
                  <hi>Sanctifie his Name. And thus you have it</hi> Ezek. 28. 22.
And ſay, Thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold I am againſt thee O Zidon, &amp;
I will be glorified in the middeſt of thee, and they ſhall know that I am the
Lord, when I ſhall have executed judgment in her, and ſhall be Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in her. <hi>And this is all one with</hi> I will be glorified in the middeſt
of them. <hi>And in the 38. of</hi> Ezek. 16, 23. <hi>You have to the ſame
purpoſe,</hi> And thou ſhalt come up againſt my people of Iſrael, as a cloud to
cover the Land: it ſhall be in the latter dayes: and I will bring thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my Land, that the Heathen may know mee, when I ſhall be San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
in thee O Gog, before their eyes. <hi>And in the</hi> 23. ver. Thus will
I magnifie my ſelfe, and Sanctify my ſelfe, and I will be knowne in the
eyes of many Nations, and they ſhall know that I am the Lord, <hi>In the
way of the execution of Judgment: thus I will Sanctifie my ſelf,
ſo I will be Sanctified in thoſe that draw nigh me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In thoſe that are nigh mee] Nigh ones,</hi> ſo it may be read: that is,
eſpecially the <hi>Prieſts</hi> that did approach to God. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 42. 13. they
approach to God eſpecially. But it is meant generally of all
thoſe that ſhall have to deale in my <hi>Worſhip,</hi> whoſoever ſhall
come to <hi>Worſhip</hi> me let them look to it; they muſt Sanctifie my
name, they muſt ſo demeane themſelves in my <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as to
hold forth my Name to be <hi>Holy:</hi> or otherwiſe I will manifeſt
my ſelfe againſt them in the wayes of <hi>Judgment,</hi> for I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to be a <hi>holy</hi> God. I will have the glory of my <hi>Holyneſſe</hi> one
way or other (ſaith God) in thoſe that come neere Mee, As if
God ſhould ſay, Though it's otherwiſe with men, they indeed
will be ready to favour thoſe that are <hi>neere</hi> them, but I will not
doe ſo. Men will ſooner paſſe by the offences of thoſe that are
<hi>neer</hi> them then thoſe that are not as ſuppoſe that a ſtranger com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
an offence, you would be ſevere towards him; but ſuppoſe
it were one of your owne Children, or kinſmen, what would
you doe then? Doe not we ſee that men will rather favour
their owne kindred then ſtrangers, though the offence be the
ſame? But I will not doe ſo ſaith God. Suppoſe it be one of
your own family, will not you be ready to excuſe them? Suppoſe
it were your own Child that ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſuch an offence, Oh!
what friends would you make to take him off from puniſhment?
Though men will do ſo towards their own, yet be bitter and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
towards ſtrangers; Yet I will not be ſo ſaith God: Let thoſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116352:6"/>
that are <hi>neer</hi> me looke to it, I will be Sanctified by them. I will
be ſanctifyed in thoſe that draw <hi>neere</hi> me.</p>
               <p>Now upon this, when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid thus, That God would be
ſanctified in thoſe that draw <hi>neere</hi> him: this was <hi>Moſes</hi> ſcope to
<hi>Aaron,</hi> as if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>Aaron,</hi> though I confeſſe the hand
of God is heavy upon you this day: Yet it is fit for you to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to God, 'tis fit that God ſhould be glorified what ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of you; you are deare to God, but Gods Name is <hi>dearer</hi> to
him then you are: what ever the lives of your Sonnes were, yet
it is fit that God ſhould be honoured, and his name <hi>Sanctified</hi>
what ever becomes of your Sonnes, or of your Comforts, and
therfore let your heart be quieted, you have had a great loſs and
affliction upon you; but God hath had glory; God hath glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
himſelfe. How hath God glorified himſelfe? Very
much by this way; for God by this way hath done an act to make
all the People of the Land feare before him; to cauſe them to
<hi>Worſhip</hi> him with all reverence. All the people of the Land ſeeing
ſuch a Judgment as this, and hearing of it; they will learne for
ever to feare and Reverence this God: they will ſay, How ſhall
wee appeare before this <hi>Holy</hi> God? Wee had need take heed
how we appeare in his preſence, and <hi>Worſhip</hi> him according to
the way that Hee himſelfe would be <hi>Worſhipped;</hi> As if <hi>Moſes</hi>
ſhould ſay, This Honour that God hath by this meanes in the
hearts of his people it is that, that you ſhould account a greater
good then the <hi>Lives</hi> of your Children, what ever they are. This
is the Scope of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeech to <hi>Aaron.</hi> Now upon this the Text
ſaith:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aaron held his peace</hi>] Hee was ſilenced. It may be before, Hee
was expreſſing himſelfe in greife: and ſorrow'd exceeding much
in words; but now he was quiet and had nothing to ſay: he did
by his ſilence acknowledge, his Children were dear to him, but
it's fit that God ſhould be glorified what ever becomes of his
Children, and therefore <hi>Aaron</hi> holds his peace.</p>
               <p>But the word that is here tranſlated <hi>Holds his peace,</hi> It hath
more in it then <hi>meere</hi> ſilence; for the Hebrews have another <hi>word</hi>
to ſignifie meere ſilence of ſpeech: but this ſignifies <hi>a ſtaying of the
heart,</hi> that it doth not further proceed in any trouble of Spirit,
a ſilence in the very heart, and ſtaying of it; a ſtaying of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116352:7"/>
of the heart. I find the ſame word to be uſed in Scripture,
when <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaid to the Sunne <hi>ſi and ſtill,</hi> ſtay thy ſelfe on <hi>Gibeon,
Joſ.</hi> 10. 12. It's the ſame word that is here tranſlated <hi>and Aaron
held his peace,</hi> that is, he was ſtayed from further vexing or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of himſelfe, or being diſquieted. Whereas his heart was
in a ſtrong violent motion: Now <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeech did ſtop him,
and gave a ſtop to his heart to make it ſtand ſtill in a wonderfull
manner, as the Sunne when <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſpake to it to ſtand ſtill. As if
the Lord ſhould have ſpoken to his heart, <hi>Aaron</hi> thy heart is in a
mighty ſtrong motion, but conſider that I muſt be Sanctifyed in
thoſe that drawe <hi>nigh</hi> mee and let all thoſe motions of thy heart
be ſtopt and quiet. Thus now you ſee the meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the ſcope of it. Now in this ſcripture you have theſe
three ſpeciall and notable points.</p>
               <p>1 That in worſhiping of God, there is a drawing nigh unto him.</p>
               <p>2 That when wee doe drawe nigh to God, wee ſhould take heed to our
ſelves that wee Sanctifye Gods name.</p>
               <p>3 If wee doe not Sanctifye Gods name in our drawings nigh to him,
then certainly God will Sanctifye his owne Name upon us.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the three points that I intend to handle; And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the ſecond to handle largely among you. I confeſſe upon
another occaſion in one Sermon I have ſpoke out of theſe words,
but now I intend not onely in generall, to ſhew you how you
ſhould ſanctifie Gods Name in <hi>Worſhip,</hi> but likewiſe in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Acts of Worſhip: As Sanctifying his name in <hi>Prayer,</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> in Hearing the <hi>Word</hi> in the ſeverall chief
parts of the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God how his Name ſhould be ſanctified:
For in all theſe you do draw nigh to God. And for that end
I have pitcht my thoughts upon this Scripture. But before I
come to theſe three great Points, that are the principall points
in the words read unto you I ſhall take up divers other notes of
obſervation that ly up and down as it were ſcattered that are of
great uſe: and will help us further to make uſe of this ſcripture
in the other points that I ſhall come to afterwards, and handle
more largely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt Note is this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Obſerv.</note> That in Gods Worſhip there muſt be nothing
tendered up to God but what hee hath commanded: what ſoever wee med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with in the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God, it muſt be what wee have a warrant
for out of the word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:116352:7"/>
For this ſpeech of <hi>Moſes</hi> is upon occaſion of the Judgment of
God upon <hi>Aarons</hi> Sonnes for offering ſtrange fire: They offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fire that God had not commanded. Hence I ſay that all
things in Gods worſhip muſt have a warrant out of Gods word,
muſt be commanded. It's not enough that it is not forbidden.
I beſeech you obſerve it it is not enough that a thing is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
and what hurt is there in it? But it muſt be commanded
I confeſſe in matters that are Civil and naturall, there this may
be enough: If it be but according to the rules of prudence,
and not forbidden in the word we may make uſe of this in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
and naturall things. But now when we come to matters of
Religion, and the Worſhipp of God; we mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> either have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
or ſomewhat out of Gods Word by ſome Conſequence
drawn from ſome Command wherein God manifeſts his will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a direct command, or by comparing one thing with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
or drawing conſequences plainly from the Words. Wee
muſt have a warrant for the <hi>Worſhip of God.</hi> One would have
thought that theſe <hi>Preiſts</hi> offering <hi>Incenſe</hi> to the true God, what
hurt was there in taking other <hi>Fire?</hi> But there was no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for it, and therefore it was not accepted. It's true there
are ſomethings in the <hi>Worſhip of God</hi> that are Naturall and Civil
helpes, and there we need not have any Command: As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
when we come to <hi>Worſhip God,</hi> the Congregation meets,
they muſt have a convenient place to keep the Ayre and weather
from them: now this is but a naturall help, and ſo far as I Uſe
the place of worſhip as a naturall help, I need have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
But if I will put any thing in a <hi>Place</hi> beyond what it
hath in it's owne nature, There I muſt look for a Command.
For if I account one place more <hi>Holy</hi> then another: or to thinke
that God ſhould accept of worſhip in one place rather then in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
This is to raiſe it above what it is in its owne Nature.
So that when any Creature is raiſed in a Religious way, above
what it hath in it by <hi>Nature</hi> if I have not Scripture to warrant
mee I am therein Superſtitious. It is a very uſefull rule for to
help you: If any Creature that you make any uſe of in a way of
Religion beyond what it hath in its owne <hi>Nature,</hi> If you have
not ſome warrant from the <hi>Word of God</hi> (whatſoever ſpecious
ſhew there may be in it) it is <hi>Superſtition.</hi> As now for the <hi>place,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:116352:8"/>
there was a place that was Holy, <hi>but</hi> then it had an Inſtitution
from God. And ſo for garments to uſe thoſe that are decent the
light of reaſon is enough: but if I wil put any thing upon them
beyond what there is in them in their owne nature, as heretofore
in a Surplis; what, had that any more decencie in its owne
nature, but only mans <hi>Inſtitution?</hi> Now when man ſhall put a
Relgious reſpect upon a thing, by vertue of his owne Inſtitution
when he hath not a warrant from God: Here's Superſtion, wee
muſt al be <hi>willing</hi> worſhippers, but not <hi>Will</hi> worſhippers; We muſt
come freely to worſhip God; but we muſt not worſhip God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our own wils, and therefore what ever we do in the
Worſhip of God if we have not a warrant for it, when this is
ſaid, <hi>Who requireth this at your hands?</hi> It will ſtop our mouths
another day. In <hi>Matthew 15. 9. In vain do they worſhip me teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Doctrine the commandments of men. In vain:</hi> it is a <hi>vain</hi>
thing to Worſhip God when there is nothing but a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of man for this Worſhip. If you would Worſhip God,
you muſt have a Commandment of God for the Worſhip: And
in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 13. there is a place to the ſame purpoſe, that ſhews
how the Lord is offended with any man that <hi>ſhall teach his fear</hi> by
their <hi>own precepts, Wherefore the Lord ſaid, For aſmuch as this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
draw neer me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me,
but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear towards me is
taught by the precepts of men:</hi> Mark it: Now if this be ſo, the
Lord have mercy upon us in this thing. You have cauſe
to be humbled every one of you, I believe, in ſome degree or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this Congregation very much, and moſt Congregations
that have had the fear of God taught them by the precepts of
men: How many things have there been in the Worſhip of God
that you can ſhew no warrant in the Word for? A great many
things meerly mans inventions, however they are now caſt out,
becauſe Authority came in and caſt them out, and ſo you ſubmit
to it; but that's not enough for you to ſubmit to it becauſe
Authority would have it ſo: but you ought to be humbled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God for all you Will-worſhip, for all your yeildings to
any thing in the Worſhip of God, that was <hi>taught by the precepts
of men;</hi> You ſee how ſevere God was to <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> for but
taking <hi>other fire</hi> then that which God had appointed to offer up
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116352:8"/>
Incenſe, though there was no direct commandment againſt it.
If the Lord hath ſpared you, and not manifeſted any diſpleaſure
upon you, you have cauſe to acknowledge Gods mercy, and to
be humbled for all your falſe Worſhip; certainly God doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it from this Land to be humbled for their Will-worſhip, or
otherwiſe they <hi>few among thornes:</hi> All the Reformation that is
among us, if there be not an humiliation before for our falſe
Worſhip: 'tis not enough that we ſet up now the true Worſhip
of God, but we muſt be humbled for our falſe Worſhip. And
that's the firſt Note; That in the Worſhip of God there muſt be
nothing but what God commands.</p>
               <p>The Second Note is,<note place="margin">2 Obſerv.</note> 
                  <hi>In the matters of Worſhip God ſtands upon
little things:</hi> Such things as ſeem to be very ſmall and little to
us, yet God ſtands much upon them in the matter of Worſhip.
For there is nothing wherein the Prerogative of God doth more
appear then in Worſhip: as Princes, they ſtand much upon
their Prerogatives, now God hath written the Law of natural
Worſhip in our hearts, as that we ſhould love God, fear God,
tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in God, and pray to God: this God hath written in our
hearts: but there are other things in the Worſhip of God that
are not written in our hearts, that only depend upon the Will
of God revealed in his Word, which were no duties except they
were revelead in his Word. And theſe are of ſuch a nature as
we can ſee no reaſon for but only this, becauſe God will have
them. As now, there are many kind of Ceremonies to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
honour to Princes that there is no reaſon for them at all, but
meerly becauſe it is a Civil Inſtitution ſo appointed: ſo God
would have ſome waies for the honouring of him that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſhould not ſee into the reaſon of them, but meerly the will
of God to have them ſo, now God ſtands much upon little
things, though men would think it a little matter whether this
fire or that fire, and will not this burn as well as that? But
God ſtands upon it: And ſo for the Ark, when <hi>Vzza</hi> did but
touch the Ark when it was ready to fall, we would think it no
great matter; but one touch of the Ark coſt him his life. There
is not any one minnum in the Worſhip of God, but God ſtands
mightily upon it: In the matter of the Sabbath, that's his
Worſhip, for a poor man to gather a few ſticks, what great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116352:9"/>
is it? but God ſtand upon it. And ſo when the men of
<hi>Beth-ſhemeſh</hi> did but look into the Ark, it coſt the lives of fifty
thouſand threeſcore and ten men. If it be a matter of a holy
thing that concerns his Worſhip, he would not have it abuſed
in any thing. Let us learn to make conſcience of little things
in the Worſhip of God, and not to think, O how nice ſuch are,
and how preciſe and nice in ſuch ſmall things! Thou doeſt
not underſtand the nature of Divine Worſhip if ſo be thou art
not nice about it; God is nice and ſtands upon little things in
the matter of his Worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another Note is this;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> That there are no priviledges or dignities of
men that can ſecure them from Gods ſtroke.</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God, he was their Uncle; <hi>Aaron</hi> that
great inſtrument of Gods glory, he was their Father: They
were men that were newly conſecrated to the Prieſts office they
were renowned, men that God put much glory upon; yet if they
will venture but to offend God in this little thing, Gods wrath
breaks out upon them and kills them preſently. Let us take
heed then of venturing, and do not think that any ſervices that
we have done heretofore can bear us out; If the greateſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be bore out with all their Priviledges, how dare we poor
wormes venture upon the diſpleaſure of God? Thou that art
a worthleſſe creature of no uſe at all in the world, dareſt thou
provoke this God, when as the Lord is ſo angry againſt men
that are of great uſe and ſervice, to let out his wrath upon them
ſuddenly? If you ſhould ſee a Prince not ſpare his Favorite,
or his Nobles that are about him, but upon one offence that we
think is but a little offence, that the Princes anger ſhould be ſo
much againſt them as to coſt them their lives; what cauſe is there
for poor people to tremble then when they have done that
which may incur the anger of their Prince? You ſee all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
priviledges and greatneſſe will not excuſe from the ſtroke
of Gods Juſtice, it ſhould not excuſe from the ſtroke of mans ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:
It's true, among men poor people they go to it if they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
but if great men offend they eſcape; but it is not ſo with
God, for <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were great and renowned men.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Note is,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
                  <hi>That the more the dignity of men is, the more
is their danger if they look not to it:</hi> And this Note I gather from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116352:9"/>
hence, That <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were the two eldeſt ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi>
and we find in the Scripture that <hi>Eleazer,</hi> and [<hi>thamer</hi> that were
the two other ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> they eſcaped and were not thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.
Why? Becauſe the two elder ſons had the dignity and
priviledge to come and offer the incenſe, and having greater
dignity then the younger, and not being carefull to behave
themſelves as they ought to do, the Lord ſmote them, and the
younger they eſcaped. And ſo many times thoſe that are in a
meaner condition they eſcape, when thoſe that are in a higher
condition they are ſtruck. Let men that are in higher conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
then others look to themſelves, for their danger is greater:
And you that are in a meaner condition, envy not thoſe that are
higher, for you may be more ſafe in that mean condition which
you are in, then they in theirs.</p>
               <p>The Fifth Note is this,<note place="margin">5 Obſerv.</note> 
                  <hi>That the beginnings of things of high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
do meet ſometimes with great difficulties and interruptions.</hi>
This Note I gather from hence, That <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were
ſtruck at the very beginning of their Preiſthood: as now, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
there were a new office erected in a Common-Wealth that
concern'd the Publick good of the Kingdom, and in the very
firſt erecting of the office there falls out ſome hideous accident
that rung throughout the whole Kingdom, as if God from
Heaven had done ſome thing againſt them in that office. As
now, ſuppoſe that the firſt time the Judges ſhould come at the
Bench, that God ſhould ſtrike them from Heaven dead at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bench, it would be a mighty matter to darken the glory and
honour of that office. So one would think that it ſhould have
been a mighty matter to have darkned the glory and the honour
of the Preiſthood alwayes: But God ſtands not upon that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times the beginnings of great things are darkned by ſad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
and therefore let not us be offended though we ſee ſome
ſad accidents to fall out at the beginning of great things, for
though accidents fall out ſadly at firſt, yet God may proſper it
afterwards as he did the Prieſthood.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Note is,<note place="margin">6 Obſerv.</note> 
                  <hi>That thoſe that enter into publick places, and
eſpecially ſuch places as concern the Worſhip of God, they had need have
the fear of God much upon them when they firſt enter into thoſe places.</hi>
Now this were a very good point if I were to Preach to an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116352:10"/>
of Miniſters. You ſee <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> upon their firſt
conſecration the Lord ſmote them for this little miſcarriage as
we would think, and that's a Sixth Note which eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
Miniſters and therefore I paſſe it over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Seaventh Note that we have,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">7 Obſerv.</note> 
                  <hi>and that's very uſefull for
us all,</hi> God would have us all to pick out his mind from dark expreſſions
in his Word.</p>
               <p>Though he doth not expreſſe his will fully, and in expreſſe
terms; yet if there be any thing in his word whereby we may
come to gather the mind of God, God expects that we ſhould
gather his mind out of his Word, and if we do not it's at our
own perill.</p>
               <p>The mind of God about this ſtrange fire that theſe offered,
you will ſay, They were to pick it out: How could they have
known that it was Gods mind that they ſhould not offer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fire but that on the Altar?</p>
               <p>They ſhould have reaſoned thus with themſelves, What hath
God let ſue come down from Feaven upon the Altar, and hath
he commanded that that ſhould be preſerved on the Altar for
his ſervice? Surely, this muſt be Gods mind then that we ſhould
make uſe of this fire rather then any other fire: God expects
that they ſhould have reaſoned thus, but becauſe they did not
pick out Gods mind by reaſoning after this manner, therefore
the hand of God came out upon them. They offended, and it
may be it was through ignorance, but it was at their perill, if
they were ignorant of the mind of God when it might be
known, though it were but darkly revealed, and were to be
pickt out from ſeveral places compared together, it was at their
perill. It is a point that we have a great deal of need of, for
this is the vain heart of man, That if there be any thing that
God would have that is not ſuitable to his own ends, he will
ſtand wrangling againſt it, and cavelling at it; How doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
(will he ſay) can you bring expreſſe Scripture for it? Bring
me expreſſe Scripture in words for to prove it and then I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, and ſo ſtands out till you bring ſo many words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
that forbids ſuch a thing, or commands ſuch a duty. Now
my brethren if you be of this temper, That you will forbear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor ſet upon any thing but what you have directly expreſs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116352:10"/>
words of Scripture for, you may run at your own perill into
wofull dangers, into wofull ſins: know that God hath ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
a great part of his mind as it is only to be known by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
one thing from another, and by comparing one thing
with another. And God expects this from you, That if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
examination of Scripture that one thing appear more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be his mind and will then another; you are bound to go
that way that is more likely. I told you before, That in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Worſhip we muſt have warrant from the Word; but it
doth not follow, That we muſt have a direct expreſſe warrant
in every thing: As it is many times in ſome kind of picture, the
great art it is in the caſt of the looks; you cannot ſay it's in the
drawing of this line, or the other line, but altogether; it is the
caſt of the looks that cauſes the beauty of the picture: So in the
Scripture, you cannot ſay that this one line, or the other line,
take it ſingle that proves it, but let them be laid all together and
there will be a kind of aſpect of Gods mind, that we may ſee that
this is the mind of God rather then the other, and we are bound
to go that way.</p>
               <p>Now ſo far <hi>Nadab</hi> &amp; <hi>Abihu</hi> might have ſeen, that they ſhould
rather have taken fire off the Altar then any other fire, But they
preſum'd becauſe they had not expreſſe Word, and you ſee it
was at their perill. O take heed of ſtanding out, and wrangl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt what is required becauſe you have not expreſſe
words: the Lord hath laid things ſo, and eſpecially in the
New Teſtament, for the ordering of the Church in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
as you have not expreſſe command for abundance of
things, but ſometimes an example in ſome things, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
not a cleer example neither; but compare one thing with
another, and that which ſeems to be neereſt the mind of God,
that ſhould be bond enough to us, to tye us to go according to
what the mind of God ſeems moſt probable to be in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and an humble teachable heart will ſoon be convinced
when another man will not.</p>
               <p>We find it cleerly, That ſuch things as are moſt ſuitable to
mens own ends, a little matter will ſerve the turn to perſwade
men to it, though one might argue againſt it: I could eaſily
ſhew it, but that I think it not ſo convenient in Pulpits to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:116352:11"/>
meddle with ſuch things as thoſe are. Thoſe things I ſay which
are ſuitable to mens own ends and wayes, them they will cloſe
withall: but other things that do croſſe the fleſh, that are moſt
oppoſite to loo ſeneſſe and would bring men moſt under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Chriſt, thoſe things men ſtand out againſt, and
they muſt have cleer and expreſſe words expreſſe and cleer war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
out of the word in ſo many termes, or otherwiſe by no
means they will not ſo much as yeild to it: That's a point that
if God would but ſettle it upon our hearts might be of very
great uſe; A gracious heart will ſee the truth through a very
little crevis: But it is marvelous to conſider what a do there is
to convince a man before he is humbled of ſome part of Gods
will; and how eaſie it is to convince a man after he is humbled.</p>

               <p>God did never threaten before hand and ſay, Whoſoever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers

               <p>Here they ſinned by fire and they are conſumed by fire. They

The judgements of God are very ſuitable to the ſins of men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes.
As here by fire, ſo another time we find it by water:
<hi>Pharoah</hi> he ſins by drowning the infants of the people of Iſrael
in the waters, and God drowns him in the Sea. If you will be
drowning by water you ſhall have water enough ſaith God:
And ſo here, if you will be medling with ſtrange fire, you
ſhall have ſtrange fire ſaith God God doth many times propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
judgments to ſinners that his righteouſnes might the more
appear thoſe very creatures in which we ſin, many times God
makes them or others of the ſame kind to be the executioners
of his wrath. So it was with the Jewes, they would fell Chriſt
for 30 pieces of ſilver, and they were ſold 30 of them for a
penny atterwards: And ſo the ſtory of <hi>Adoni-hezek</hi> in the firſt
of <hi>Judges,</hi> that was ſo cruell in ſuch a way to cut off Thumbs
and Toes of Kings, even ſo he was ſerved in the like kind: and
it's ordinary for men that are of cruell fiery ſpirits, to meet
with cruell fiery ſpirits too.</p>
               <p>And I would apply it in this particular, You that are ſtout
Children to your Parents, if God lets you live you many times
meet with the very ſame in your Children, and when you that
are Parents meet with ſtubborn Children, you ſhould reflect,
Doth not God come righteouſly upon me? And ſo you that
are Servants, you are ſtout to your Maſters, why afterwards
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116352:12"/>
when you come to have Servants they will be ſo to you; and
perhaps you were unfaithfull to your Governors, afterwards
when you come to have Servants, it's a thouſand to one but
they will be ſo to you. Now you ſhould ſtrike your hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your heart and ſay, It's juſt with God that it ſhould be ſo,
and that he ſhould come upon me in mine own kind.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And ſo when you come to the Lords Supper, take heed of
coming with Wrath and Malice, for then you come but to offer
ſtrange fire. It's a ſpeciall Conſideration for Miniſters that
come to Preach, they ſhould take heed of bringing ſtrange fire
into their Pulpits: that is, of venting their own Paſſions. That
hath been ever a rule that I have been convinced of ſince I knew
any thing of Preaching, That that man that is appointed to
reveal Gods wrath, had need to conceal his own wrath that's
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116352:13"/>
certainly a rule for all Preachers, for the Lord ſends his Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
to make known his wrath againſt mens ſins, but now the
more they make known his wrath, the more they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
their own; and ſo by that means when they come in the
openeſt way to manifeſt Gods wrath, the more their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
would be accepted. Now it's true, a carnal heart would
be ready to think, That when a Preacher ſpeaks out of true zeal

have from the Altar; their tongues being toucht with one of
theſe coales, and not that they ſhould come with their own Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:116352:13"/>
That the moſt eminent Saints of God are not freed from very
grievous afflictions even in their Children; It was one of the
ſoreſt afflictions that almoſt ever any Saint of God met withall
in his Children; this affliction of <hi>Aaron</hi> at this time, That
two of his Sons, and (as I told you the laſt day) renowned
men in Iſrael, newly conſecrated to the Office of Prieſthood,
that the very firſt day they came to offer in their office, they
were ſtrucke before all the people with fire from heaven
and conſumed: Oh what a ſad affliction was it to <hi>Aaron</hi> their
Father when he ſaw his Sonnes in ſuch a manner deſtroyed by
God himſelf! Conſider of this you that have Children, and
are ready to murmur and complain of every little affliction
that is upon you in reſpect of your Children: If ſo be that
your Children be but a little ſick, or there be any miſcarriage
of them, you think it is a heavy hand of God; But eſpecially if
God take away your Children by death, then you mourn and
will not be comforted: Yea but though God have taken away
your Children by death, yea perhaps it may be by a violent
death, as being drowned, &amp;c. yet they have not been ſtrucken
with fire from heaven by God, and they have not been of ſuch
publick uſe. Theſe here were renowned men, and taken away
in their very ſin too, your Children which have gone upon
their lawfull imployments and God hath taken away their
lives; there's no ſuch cauſe of murmuring here, but when
God takes away Children in their ſins, and in ſuch a way as by
fire from heaven; thus God took away <hi>Aarons</hi> Children, and
he was as dear to God as you are: And yet thus God deals
with his Saints; with <hi>Aaron</hi> in regard of his Children, and
with his Elder Children and with two of them together. This
example may be enough to ſtill and quiet the hearts of men
and women that are afflicted in reſpect of any calamity befals
their Children. You ſee what a hand of God is againſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Children of <hi>Aaron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">15 Obſer.</note> That Gods judgements we ſee ſometimes,
though the effect of them be viſible, yet they come in an inviſible
way.</p>
               <p>For you ſhall find if you read on in this ſtory, That they were
ſmote with fire from heaven, but it did not appear what fire, for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116352:14"/>
it did not ſo much as conſume their cloaths, nor their bodies,
but went through and ſtruck them dead, and no body could tell
how. Gods judgements do come in a way that is inviſible: if

                  <hi>Again Note,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">17 Obſer.</note> That the neerer any men are to God, the more they
had need take heed that they glorifie him, for they muſt expect to be ſpared
the leſſe if they ſin againſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> the Prieſts of God, and they came neer to
God, yet by their tranſgreſſion: though I told you We do not
find in any place of Scripture directly in words that this fire is
forbidden, but they ſhould have gathered Gods mind by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
And therefore by the way I only Note, That we muſt
not think to urge upon men in all things ſtrict commands in
very words, but if it be commanded ſo as we may draw it by
any conſequence, it's a command, as now here for the Negative,
they had not a Negative prohibition in words, yet they had it
by Conſequence; So for the Affirmative, though we have not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:116352:14"/>
the affirmative in expreſſe words, yet if we may have it by
conſequence it is an affirmative as well as the negative, when
we have it by conſequence. But now the Note of Obſervation
is, <hi>That the neerer any comes to God if they ſin againſt him, they muſt
not expect to be ſpared.</hi> Do not think that God will ſpare you
the more becauſe you are profeſſors of Religion, or becauſe
you do often worſhip him: I ſuppoſe you that are acquainted
with Scripture know that place in <hi>Amos 3. 2. You only have I
known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will puniſh you for all
your iniquities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another Note is this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">18 Obſer.</note> That when a judgement is exemplary, then
we ſhould have recourſe to the Word of God, to ſee how God doth make
his Word good in that judgement.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Moſes</hi> doth, <hi>This is that which the Lord hath ſaid.</hi> Do you
ſee any remarkable hand of God in the execution of a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon one, have recourſe to Gods Word, and preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to think this, What is there in Gods Word againſt that ſin
that this man hath been guilty of? If you ſee a judgement of
God upon a Drunkard, remember the threats in the Word of
God againſt drunkenneſſe, and ſo the judgements of God upon
unclean Perſons, ſwearers, Sabbath breakers, lyars, or any
prophane and ungodly perſons, have recourſe to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God threatned in the Word againſt ſuch; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
concerning Scorners and Oppoſers of Religion, remember
what is ſaid in the Word of God againſt ſuch, and ſo learn to
Sanctifie Gods Names. We might have mentioned ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
threats of God againſt particular ſinners for the helping

               <p>
                  <hi>A further Note from this ſtory is this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">19 Obſer.</note> That the great honour
that God intends to his Name, It is the making of his Name Holy.
I will be Sanctified in them that draw nigh me, and before all the people
I will be glorified.</p>
               <p>As if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould ſay in Gods name, Why, I muſt have
glory from the people, and how? By making my name appear
to be holy, this is the glory that I ſtand upon above all other
things that my Name may appear to be holy, that I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be a holy God. I beſeech you brethren conſider of this,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:116352:15"/>
God ſtands upon nothing more then to appear to all the world
to be a Holy God, there's the glory of Gods Name in an eminent
way, God doth not ſo much ſtand upon this, to appear to be a
<hi>ſtrong</hi> God, to appear to be a <hi>powerfull</hi> God, to be a God of <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
long-ſuffering,</hi> God doth not ſo much ſtand to be an Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient
God, though theſe Attributes are dear to God, but
that he may appear to be a Holy God: that he ſtands upon.
Whatever glory of the Name of God, that God ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to have eclipſed in the world for a while, yet he is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
he will have the Glory of his holineſſe above all things:
and therefore the Angels when they are celebrating the glory
of God, they do not ſay Lord Almighty, Almighty, Almighty,
or Lord Omniſcient, Omniſcient, Omniſcient, but <hi>Holy, Holy,
Holy.</hi> Thoſe three together, the Holineſſe of God, therein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
the glory of God above all: God ſtands upon it that he
will appear to be a Holy God.</p>
               <p>Oh that thoſe who profeſſe themſelves to be the Servants of
God, that they would eſpecially indeavour to hold forth Gods
Holineſſe; you that are neer to God, you that hope you are
Gods Children, and make profeſſion of his Name, labour you
to hold forth the glory of his Holineſſe above all things, in
your holy lives and converſations: for God ſtands upon this,
To have his Name to be Sanctified <hi>I will he Sanctified</hi> ſaith God,
<hi>and I will be Glorified,</hi> ſo he doth interpret the glory of his Name
by being Santified. As if God ſhould ſay, That's the glory
that I look for, That my Name may be extolled as Holy: And
therefore the very firſt Petition that Chriſt teaches us to pray in
the <hi>Lords prayer,</hi> it is, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> which is all one
with this, <hi>Sanctified be thy Name;</hi> Oh let the Name of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be holy in the World: that's another Note, that theſe
two are joyned together, <hi>I'le be Sanctified in thoſe that draw nigh
me, and I will be Glorified before the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again obſerve,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">20 Obſer.</note> That it is the part of true friendſhip, to help friends
in their diſtreſſes, and ſeek to comfort them from the Word.</p>
               <p>Though we our ſelves be in afflictions, yet we ſhould ſeek to
comfort our friends that are in greater afflictions, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them by the Word, for ſo did <hi>Moſes: Moſes</hi> comes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<hi>Aaron</hi> and applies the Word, <hi>This is that which the Lord hath
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116352:15"/>
ſaid, I will be Sanctified.</hi> Now mark, no queſtion <hi>Moſes</hi> was
afflicted upon this heavy hand of God, for he was their Uncle;
but though it was heavy upon the Uncle, yet it was heavier up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Father, and therefore though <hi>Moſes</hi> was troubled, yet
he knew that <hi>Aaron</hi> was more troubled, and therefore he goes
to <hi>Aaron</hi> and ſeeks to comfort him, and he makes uſe of the
Word in his comforting of him. Learn this then, to go and
comfort your brethren, for <hi>Aaron</hi> was <hi>Moſes</hi> brother; go and
comfort them in thier afflictions, and think not becauſe that
you have ſome afflictions upon you, that therefore you ſhould
not be a comfort to your brethren: their affliction is greather
then yours, and when you come to comfort, them, come not in
a meer carnal way and ſay, Brother you muſt be content, but
you muſt come and apply ſomewhat of the Word of God to
comfort them and ſay, <hi>This is that which the Lord hath ſpoke;</hi> and
to that end you ſhould labour to be exerciſed in the Word of
God, that ſo you may be able to go to your brethren and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them in any affliction; for there is no particular affliction
but there is ſome word of God that is ſuitable to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
affliction, and thoſe who are well exerciſed in the Word of
God, they can apply ſome word to every affliction: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this is an excelent friend, and ſuch a friend is worth his
weight in gold, that can come to another friend in any affliction
and ever more hath ſome what of the Word of God to apply to
that affliction.</p>
               <p>The Laſt Obſervation is this,<note place="margin">21 Obſer.</note> 
                  <hi>That</hi> Aaron <hi>held his peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From whence we may Note,</hi> That there is no ſuch way to quiet a
gracious heart under any afflictions in the World as that God will fetch
out his honour by it.</p>
               <p>It is grievous to me, but God fetches out his glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
by it. The applying of the Word, and the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that God hath his way to fetch out his glory in our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is the only way to quiet a gracious heart. All theſe Points
might take up a great deal of time, but I will let them paſſe and
come to the main Point of all, <hi>I will be Sanctified in all thoſe that
come nigh me.</hi> There are theſe Three Points in theſe words:</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Firſt,</hi> That in the Worſhip of God, men and women draw nigh
to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:116352:16"/>
2 <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we ought to Sanctifie Gods Name in drawing
nigh to him.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That if we do not Sanctifie it, God will Sanctifie his
own Name upon us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That in Worſhipping of God, there is a drawing nigh to
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why is not God in every place?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes certainly, we can never be in any place but we are
nigh to God, God ſtands by us and looks upon us It is not only
when you are Worſhipping of God that you are nigh him, but
when you ſin againſt him: when thou art ſwearing prophaning
his Name his Day, God ſtands &amp; looks upon thee thou art nigh
him: And it may be ſaid or written upon every place, what was

nigh him yea but though we are alwaies nigh God in regard of
that eſſentiall preſence of his, yet there is a more peculiar and
ſpeciall drawing nigh to God in the duties of his Worſhip,
and that the Scripture ſeems to hold forth unto you. Firſt Ile
ſhew you how the Scripture holds it forth, and then in what
reſpects the Creature may be ſaid to draw nigh to God in holy
duties of Worſhip; for ſo it was here, they were coming to offer
Incenſe.</p>
               <p>1 That we do draw nigh to God in holy Duties,<note place="margin">That we draw nigh to God in Holy Duties.</note> ſee <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 8.
<hi>Draw nigh to God</hi> (ſo that you may be neerer God then you were)

<hi>Let us</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>come before his preſence with thanksgiving,</hi> ſo that

one part of the Worſhip of God. But the Scripture is plain,
that there is a ſpeciall coming before God when we are coming
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:116352:16"/>
to Worſhip him, and in this reſpect the Servants of God in <hi>Pſal.</hi>
148. 14. are ſaid to be <hi>a people neer to God.</hi> It is a very remarkable

There's the commendation of the excellent eſtate of the Saints.

God, they are much exerciſed in the Worſhip of God. This
is one reſpect though there may be divers others mentioned, yet
in reſpect of their coming ſo much before God in his Worſhip,
therefore they are neer God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Neer him, Why, in what reſpects may a man be ſaid to <hi>draw
nigh to God</hi> when he Worſhips him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I Anſwer, There are three reſpects in which
a man when he is Worſhipping of God may be ſaid to <hi>draw nigh
to God:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 Firſt, Becauſe when we come to Worſhip God, we come
to tender up that homage and ſervice unto him, that is due
from us as creatures to the infinite Creator that's the very end
of Worſhip. If you would know what it is to Worſhip God,
it is this:</p>
               <p>You come to tender up that homage and reſpect that is due
from the creature to the Creator.<note place="margin">What it is to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God.</note> Now when a Subject comes
to tender up his homage to his Prince, he comes towards him,
when he doth it immediately: So we have none to tender it up
by but Jeſus Chriſt, and when we tender it up we muſt come
our ſelves too, for Chriſt doth not take our ſervice and tender
it up to God and we be abſent, but we muſt come with Chriſt,
and Chriſt takes us by the hand and ſo tenders it up to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
while we are in preſence, ſo that we are ſaid to come nigh
to God in that reſpect, becauſe of the immediate tendering up
of that Worſhip of ours to God; I call it immediate in reſpect
of any creature: But in reſpect of Chriſt indeed he is a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to do it, but yet he doth it in a ſpirituall way, and we have
to do with none but God through Jeſus Chriſt in the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of our Worſhip to him: We may make uſe of an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
that God hath appointed, but we do not tender up our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:116352:17"/>
Worſhip to God through that creature, but in the uſe of that
creature we do come to God, and our ſouls are to tender up
that reſpect we owe to God immediately. Therefore in <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.
21. it is ſaid of the Prieſts in their Sacrifices, when they were to
come to Worſhip God, <hi>No man that hath a blemiſh of the ſeed of</hi>
Aaron <hi>the Prieſt ſhall come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord made
by fire.</hi> So that when any come to offer any offerings of the
Lord made by fire, it appeares he came nigh to God: he came to
bring a preſent to God: therefore he comes nigh. So when we
come to offer our ſpirituall Sacrifices unto God, we come nigh
to God to offer, it's the offering of a Sacrifice to God. And
that's the firſt thing, becauſe the creature comes to bring a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to God, therefore he is ſaid to <hi>draw nigh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Secondly,<note place="margin">The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect wherein the Soule is ſaid to draw nigh to God in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> the Soul is ſaid to <hi>draw nigh</hi> to God in holy
duties, becauſe it doth preſent it's ſelf before God in thoſe ways
through which God doth uſe to communicate his choice, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
moſt excelent and glorious mercies to his people: I ſay,
when we come to Worſhip God, we come to ſet our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God in thoſe waies that God doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to communicate the
choice, moſt excelent and glorious rich mercies that he hath to
communicate to his creature.</p>
               <p>When we have to deal with creatures, as meat and drink, and
our outward buſineſſes we have to do with God in them; but
when we come to Worſhip God, we come to preſent our ſelves
before him in thoſe things that he doth uſe to let out himſelfe
though in a more ſpeciall and glorious manner to the ſouls of
his people. What's the reaſon why heaven is ſaid to be the
preſence of God, and why thoſe that are in heaven are ſaid to
live with God? There they behold the face of God and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him in a ſpeciall manner, therefore when Chriſt teacheth
us to pray he teacheth us to look up to heaven and to ſay, <hi>Our
Father which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rt in heaven, &amp;c.</hi> Now certainly the eſſentiall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God is on earth as truly and really as in heaven, and
God is not ſo as to have one part in one place, and another in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
but All God is in every place, but the reaſon why God
is ſaid to be in heaven, it is becauſe the Lord makes known him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
there in a more glorious manner then in any other place,
and therefore heaven is the preſence of God in a more ſpeciall
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:116352:17"/>
way. Now then if the communication of God unto a creature
be enough to make the preſence of God more ſpeciall if this be
enough to make a creature to live with God, and to be before
his face, becauſe they are there where God doth moſt communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
himſelf, then certainly when we come to Worſhip God, we
come to be neer God, and be with God becauſe the duties of his
Worſhip are thoſe means that the Lord hath appointed for the
letting out of himſelf in the glory of his goodneſſe and mercy
to his people: You may expect other manner of communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods goodneſſe through the duties of his Worſhip then
in any other way: And that's the Second reſpect wherein you
may be ſaid to <hi>draw nigh to God</hi> in holy duties.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You may be ſaid to <hi>draw nigh to God,</hi> becauſe then
we ſhould (and if we Worſhip God as we ought, we do) act
our faith and humility, and all the graces of the Spirit; We do
act them, as it were, upon God, when we come to Worſhip
him: That's required in every duty of Worſhip, that you ſhould
ſtir up the faculties of your ſouls, and all the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, and you ſhould act them upon God when you are
Worſhipping of him. Tis not enough to come with grace
when you come to Worſhip God, but there muſt be an acting
of that grace upon God.</p>
               <p>And ſo we find in Scripture, that the acting of grace upon
God, it is a <hi>drawing neer to him,</hi> therefore in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 13. the Lord
complaines there, <hi>This people draws neer to me with their lips, but
their hearts are far from me,</hi> as if God ſhould ſay, Indeed they
come and ſpeak to me, and therefore they think they <hi>draw nigh
to me,</hi> but I expect that their hearts ſhould be acting upon me,
that's the meaning. And in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 2. God complains there of
his people that they did not <hi>draw neer to him</hi> as they ſhould:
And it appears plainly, it was from hence, that their graces did
not act ſo upon God as they ought, <hi>She obeyed not the voice: ſhe
received not correction: ſhe truſted not in the Lord: ſhe drew not neer
to her God.</hi> So that acting faith upon God is a drawing nigh to
God, and ſo acting any grace upon God is a drawing nigh to
God. Now when is there a time for the acting of our graces
upon God ſo as when we come to worſhip God? And therefore
in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 7. the Lord complains there, <hi>That no man did ſtir up
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:116352:18"/>
himſelf to take hold on him.</hi> When we come to Worſhip God we
ſhould ſtir up our ſelves to take hold of God. And thus you
ſee in what reſpects the Soul may be ſaid <hi>to draw nigh to God</hi>
when it comes to worſhip him.</p>
               <p>Now for the Application of this point and it is in divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
The Firſt is this,</p>
               <p>Hence learn what you do when you come to Worſhip God,<note place="margin">Applic. 1</note>
and conſider of it every time you come to performe any act of
Worſhip. Truly this one thing would be of marveilous uſe,
and it would help forward to the next Point of <hi>Sanctifying
of Gods Name.</hi> This you are all convinced of, That it is your
duty to Worſhip God, when you pray you come to Worſhip
God, when you come to hear his Word you come to Worſhip
him, and when you receive the Sacrament you Worſhip him.
Now if I ſhould come from one end of the Congregation to the
other, and ask every one of you this Queſtion, It is your duty
to Worſhip God, is it not? Yes: that you will all be ready to
anſwer. And what do you do when you Worſhip God? I fear
that this Second Queſtion would gravell many. You will ſay,
We muſt pray to God, and ſerve him, and hear his Word, and
go to the Communion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> yea, but what do your Souls do in this
Work of Worſhipping of God? This ſhould be the anſwer, and
ſo you ſhould think with your ſelves, and charge this upon
your own hearts, I am now going to Worſhip God, either in
Prayer, Word, or Sacraments, I am now going to tender up
that homage that is due from a creature to the infinite Creator,
ſo that I muſt ſo pray, as I muſt manifeſt that high reſpect that
I owe to God as my Creator; but that I ſhall ſpeak to more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward:
only now remember this, That you do profeſſe every
time you go to Prayer, That you go to tender up that homage
that you owe unto God and ſo every time you come to hear the
Word, there is a profeſſion that you come to tender up that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and homage that you owe to the infinite God: And ſo
likewiſe when you come to receive the Sacrament. Now when
we come to offer a preſent to men, we know how we prepare,
and with what ſuitable preſence we deſire to offer: but of that
afterward when we come to ſpeak of <hi>Sanctifying Gods Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Secondly, Remember, when I come to Worſhip God, I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116352:18"/>
come to ſet my ſelf before the Lord in thoſe ways that God doth
let out the choice of his mercies to his people in: I have many
mercies from God in the enjoyment of the creature, but when
I come to Worſhip him I expect the communication of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in another way then through any creature in the World.
The duties of his Worſhip are the chief cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nels that God doth
let out the choiceſt of his mercies to the hearts of his people
through, and now I am going to Worſhip him, I am going to
preſent my ſelf before God. Indeed there is a little glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the light of God through other creatures to me, but
the glorious beames of the light of God is through the duties of
his Worſhip.</p>
               <p>3 And then Thirdly, I am now going to act my Soul upon
God, ſo that if I have any abilities to cloſe with God, to act
my Soul upon him, it muſt be put forth now at this time; I am
indeed at all times to labour to injoy communion with God,
when I ſee the creatures, the Sun and Moon and Stars to labour
to lift up my heart to God, and when I ſee the glory of God in
the Sea, and for my meat and drink I am to bleſſe God, and to
acknowledge God in all; but now when I come to Worſhip
God, then all the ſtrength of my Soul is to be acted upon God
in a more ſpeciall manner; I muſt then above all labour to ſtir
up whatſoever I have in my Soul to act upon God, this is now to
Worſhip God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Applic. 2</note> If to Worſhip God, be to draw nigh to God, hence
we ſee the reaſons why guilty conſciences have little mind to
the duties of Gods Worſhip. When a man or woman hath given
liberty to any licentious way &amp; ſinned againſt their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
if they have any light in their conſciences, it is one of the
tediouſeſt things in the World to come to the duties of Gods
Worſhip: they had rather do any thing then to come to holy
dutys, as to Prayer and eſpecially to ſecret prayer. A man or
woman that hath an inlightened conſcience, and is under the
guilt of ſin, the coming to God in holy duties, is a very grievous
burden to them: Why? Here's the Reaſon, Becauſe to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God is to <hi>draw nigh to God,</hi> and the guilt that is upon them
hath made the preſence of God terrible to them, and therefore
they had rather go into their company &amp; be merry, eat, drink,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116352:19"/>
ſport, or any thing rather then to come into Gods preſence.
We know how it was with <hi>Adam,</hi> when God appeared in the
garden and called to him, he ran to hide himſelf; Why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had guiltineſſe upon him: Oh the evill that the guilt of
ſin brings upon the Soul, it makes the preſence of God terrible!
The preſence of God it ſhould be more comfortable to us then
our lives but our ſin makes Gods preſence grievous and terrible.
A Child ſometimes when it hath offended the Father and is
conſcious to its ſelf of the offence that it hath given the Father,
it had rather be in the Kitching among the Servants, then to
come into the Hall or Parlour where the Father is, becauſe it
hath offended him: and ſo it is with a guilty conſcience, when
it is conſcious to its ſelf of ſome haunt of evil that it hath given
it ſelf unto, it hath no mind at all of coming into the preſence
of the Father, but hangs off. My Brethren, the very preſence
of God in the communion of his Saints is terrible to a guilty
conſcience, the very looking upon a godly man is terrible to a
guilty conſcience. When as thou haſt bin abroad &amp;c. bin looſe &amp;c.
wicked in thy waies, I appeal to thy conſcience, when thou
comeſt into the preſence of ſome holy gracious man or woman
that lives cloſe with God, doth it not daunt thee? Now is the
preſence of God in the very faces of his Saints terrible to a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
conſcience? How terrible is the preſence of God in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
then? Indeed thoſe men and women whoſe conſciences
are not inlightened, but are ignorant and ſottiſh, they can
ſin againſt God and go into his preſence without any trouble;
you ſhall have men ſwear and be drunken over night and come
to the Sacrament the next day, What's the reaſon? Becauſe
there is no light in their conſciences, their conſciences are in
darkneſſe, they are beſotted in their ſin; but I ſpeak now of
one who hath an inlightened conſcience, the preſence of God
is terrible to ſuch a one.</p>
               <p>A Third Uſe is this,<note place="margin">Applic. 3</note> Here is the Reaſon why Hypocrites do
meet with ſuch vengeance from God as they do: I confeſſe we
ſhall meet with this more eſpecially afterwards, only by the
way take notice of it; Hypocrites above all men may expect
the ſevereſt judgements of God upon them, becauſe they come
ſo nigh God, for they come often to the duties of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116352:19"/>
now they that will come ſo nigh Gods preſence, and
come with baſe and ungodly hearts, to cloak their villany, of
all in the world they muſt expect to have the ſevere vengeance
of God let out upon them; they that ſtand nigheſt the bullet
muſt expect to have the ſtrength of it to be the more upon them;
ſo when the wrath of God proceeds out upon ſinners, wicked
men that ſtand nigheſt him they have the greateſt ſtrok of Gods
wrath; but of that more when I come to the Third Point, <hi>That
God will be Sanctified in thoſe that draw nigh him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fourth Uſe is this,<note place="margin">Applic. 4</note> If to Worſhip God be to draw nigh
him, then to neglect Gods Worſhip is to depart from him, that
muſt needs follow, and this is a dreadfull thing, it is the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that ſhall be at the laſt day of judgement, <hi>Depart from me.</hi>
Thou now art willing to depart from God, Oh conſider of this
you that neglect Worſhip, the Worſhip of God in your fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and in your cloſets, and in the congregation, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Saints, thou haſt little minded or regarded the
Worſhip of God it may be all thy daies, what haſt thou been
doing all this while? thou haſt been departing from God all
this while, &amp; when thy conſcience ſhall be but inlightened and
awakened to ſee how far thou art from God, how terrible will
it be to thee? Remember this you that have no mind to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Worſhip of God but love the Commiſſion of ſin, you
neglect Gods Worſhip, you were wont to Worſhip him in a
conſtant way in your cloſets and families, but now you grow
more looſe, and ſo you grow more dead every day then other,
you go off from God more and more. Surely there can be no
good to neglect Gods Worſhip. And thoſe that are loth to
Worſhip God becauſe they cannot Worſhip him as they ought,
from this Point it appears plainly, That there can be no good
gotten by neglecting Gods Worſhip, for it is departing from
God, whatſoever plea there may be by any temptation to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
Gods Worſhip, certainly there is danger in it, and therefore
never liſten to any ſuch temptation as ſhall draw your hearts
from the duties of Gods Worſhip. There are a Generation of
wantons in theſe times that make little matter of continuing
the duties of Gods Worſhip, they were wont conſtantly to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God, and to attend upon the Word, but now it is nothing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:116352:20"/>
to them, and they are even ready to thank God for it that they
make not ſuch conſcience as they were wont to do in the duties
of the Worſhip of God: It may be they will ſay, That hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſome ſlaviſh terror did carry them on in the duties of
Gods Worſhip more then the underſtanding of the freeneſſe of
the grace of God would admit of: But ſhall the underſtanding
of the freedom of the grace of God carry thee on leſſe then thy
ſlaviſh terrour did? Oh blind and wanton ſpirit that knoweſt
not the waies of God, nor the freeneſſe of the grace of God, nor
the riches of it! Oh what a diſhonour art thou to Jeſus Chriſt
and to the freeneſſe of his grace, that now canſt go up and down
from day to day and never Worſhip God! Did Jeſus Chriſt
come into the world to that end for to cauſe thee to depart
more from God? 'Tis plain out of the Word, That the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Gods Worſhip are thoſe duties whereby the Soul comes
to draw nigh to God: And I beſeech you brethren obſerve
theſe men, whither there be that holineſſe in their lives, that
ſpiritualneſſe as there was wont to be; no, you ſhall find them
by degrees to grow looſe, yea run ſometimes into groſe ſins,
grow many times to lying and deceiving, and to drunkeneſſe
and company keeping; yea to worſe things by degrees: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they are at firſt ready to ſay, Is thy Servant a dead Dog
that I ſhould do this? But by departing from God they grow
dead to holy duties: We find it by experience, That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of Religion have not that holineſſe, heavenlineſſe, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualneſſe,
as they were wont to have in former times. And
no marveile, for now they keep not ſo nigh to God as they were
wont. You that are Sea-men and Travelours, ſometimes you
are neer the Sunne, and then you are hot but the further off the
Sunne you go, you grow to be colder and colder: And ſo thoſe
that neglect the Worſhip of God, they go from the warm Sun,
they go from the light of Gods countenance and from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God and ſo they grow cold and chill, and by degrees
they grow to prophaneſſe, and it is to be feared that many of
them will grow to meer Athiſme.</p>
               <p>Another Uſe is this,<note place="margin">Applic. 5</note> A Uſe of Exhortation, that we would
be incouraged to Worſhip God, and to be much in the Worſhip
of God. In <hi>Heb. 10. 22. Let us draw neer</hi> (ſaith the Text) Who
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:116352:20"/>
would not draw neer to God? Oh what a good thing is it to
be in the preſence of God! Is not the Lord the fountain of thy
life? Is it not a ſweet thing to be in his preſence? We think it
a ſweet thing to be in the preſence of godly men; Oh 'that we
might alwaies live with ſuch men, and be nigh them! That
Martyr Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> rejoyced in this, That ever he came into
Priſon to be acquainted with that Angel of God holy Maſter
<hi>Bradford,</hi> and as I remember ſome among the heathens that
profeſt they would rather be in priſon with <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o</hi> then be in the
greateſt glory with ſome other: It is a bleſſed thing to be in the
preſence of God, to be with him that is the God of our lives, and
the fountain of all good; let us draw nigh to God often, let us
know that it is a mercy that we may draw nigh to God; wee
might have been baniſhed from the preſence of the Lord long
e're this time.</p>
               <p>This is that that the happineſſe of the glorious Church is ſet
out by in <hi>Rev. 22. 4. They ſhall ſee his face and his name ſhall be in
their foreheads.</hi> This is the Priviledge of the Church. And
that it is ſuch a bleſſing to draw nigh to God you may ſee it by
that in <hi>Eph. 2. 18. For through him we both have an acceſſe by one ſpirit
unto the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Through him]</hi> Through Chriſt we have acceſſe by one Spirit
unto the Father, and now (ſaith he) <hi>Ye that were ſtrangers and

of God:</hi> and verſ. 13. <hi>But now by Chriſt Jeſus ye who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
were a far off are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt,</hi> and you have
acceſſe through Chriſt: So our coming nigh to God is ſuch a
priviledge as coſt the bloud of Chriſt; and will not you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it? You were far off in your naturall condition, but now
you are nigh through his bloud; Lay but this text warm to
your hearts this morning, That I that was far off am made nigh
by the bloud of Chriſt, made nigh to God, it will be a means

               <p>And by drawing nigh to God often, you will come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
your graces abundantly: your graces how will they act

               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:116352:21"/>
And by this means we come to live moſt holy lives.<note place="margin">We come to live holy lives</note> We read
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he was upon the mountain forty daies with God, and
when he came down his face did ſo ſhine, that the people were
not able to bear it; what's the reaſon? it was from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was ſo nigh to God: would you have your faces to
ſhine in a holy converſation before men? converſe much with
God, be often with God, be nigh to him, and that will make
you ſhine as lights in the middeſt of a crooked and perverſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.
We find it ſo with ſome that converſe much with
God, there is a ſhine upon their very countenances.</p>
               <p>And further it is a ſpeciall ſigne of our adoption to love to
be nigh to God.<note place="margin">A ſpecial ſigne of our adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> What ſhould a Child love moſt but to be in
the preſence of his Father? Would you know whither you
have received the Spirit of adoption yea or no? I can hardly
give you any one ſigne ſo clear as this, for to love to go into
Gods preſence, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I was glad when they ſaid, Come
and let us go up unto the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> You ſhall have many
that love to be in Gods preſence, ſo as they think on it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
and long for the time while it comes; I never am better
then when I am with God, me thinks when I get into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
either in Prayer or any duty of Gods Worſhip, I find my
heart warmed and quickned, &amp;c. They are ready to ſay with
<hi>Peter,</hi> Maſter, it is good being here.</p>
               <p>And that's another thing,<note place="margin">We come to be put in mind of the life of heaven</note> It is that which will put us in
mind of the life of heaven, it is the only thing in heaven to be
in the preſence of God. Why, the more thou art nigh God in
the Duties of Worſhip, the more thou art in heaven, and doeſt
not thou pray, That the will of God may be done in Earth as
in Heaven? Now the Saints and Angels are alwaies before God
Worſhipping of him; then be as much as thou canſt in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God, If thou wouldeſt be in heaven, be there: Many
of the Saints they find it ſo, It is not ſo with carnall hearts, they
are weary preſently, when they are in Prayer, or hearing the
Word, it is not ſo to them: yea, that's becauſe thou haſt not the
preſence of God, as in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. what wearineſſe is there? thou
canſt be a gaming till one or two a clock at night, and though
thou ſhouldeſt loſe thy ſupper, or the work of thy family, it is
not tedious to thee to be exerciſed in thoſe things that pleaſeth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:116352:21"/>
the fleſh; but when thou comeſt to Worſhip God, how quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
art thou tir'd now what wilt thou do in heaven where there
is nothing elſe done to all eternity but Worſhipping of God?</p>
               <p>And then it muſt needs be delightful to God that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
come nigh him:<note place="margin">Our draw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing nigh to God delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him,</note> There is nothing in the world more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to God then to have his Saints come into his preſence.
What doth a Father more delight in then to have his Children
about him? never did any Father or Mother love to have their
Children by them, ſo as God loves to have his Children come
nigh him, and be often with him. And the truth is, one great
reaſon that God ſuffers you to fall into afflictions ſo much
is that you may come running to him: How doth the Child
come running to the Father or Mother when it is afraid? why,
the Lord is willing to permit men to do you wrong that you
may run to him, that he might have more of your preſence:
Thou that art ſuch a poor creature, yet thou heareſt this day
that there is nothing in the world that God takes more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in (next to the preſence of his own Son Jeſus Chriſt, and
his Saints and Angles that he hath with him in heaven)
then to have his Saints come nigh him, to have them alwaies to
be under his wing.</p>
               <p>And then by coming often into Gods preſence in his worſhip
there will grow a ſweet and bleſted familiarity between God
and thy ſoul,<note place="margin">By com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Gods preſence there is a bleſſed familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betwee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God and the ſoul.</note> for thou wilt be ſpeaking to God, and God will
be ſpeaking to thee too: We know many times that dear friends
who are very neerly linkt together, yet if they be long abſent
one from another there grows a ſtrangeneſſe, and ſo by degrees
their friendſhip is deaded; but now when they are together e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day, and there is an intercourſe of love and friendſhip,
then their friendſhip is kept active and quick, but now if they
be abſent long; Indeed if they be abſent in another Country
when they cannot come together, that they are ſure it is not
through any neglect, then it will not damp their friendſhip;
but when they are neer and come not one to another, then they
think it is out of neglect &amp; ſo they grow ſtrange. So it is with
the Soul, if there were no poſſibility of a coming into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
then it would not hinder the ſweetnes of the love of God
to us. But now when we have thoſe duties of Worſhip wherein
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:116352:22"/>
we may draw nigh to God, if we neglect them our familiarity
with God will quickly be loſt, <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf with God and be
at peace.</hi> God is willing to be acquainted with his Servants; the
Lord loves to be familiar with the pooreſt of his Saints, and wilt
not thou maintain that ſweet familiarity with God? Theſe
two benefits will follow upon thy familiarity with God.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milarity with God makes us to be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with him.</note> Thoſe that are moſt familiar with God they are moſt
potent with God; As now a ſtrnger cannot prevaile in any
Petition ſo as a familiar friend can: Thus my brethren, when
ſtrangers come into Gods preſence, God doth not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
them; but when his familiars come into his preſence, the
Saints of God that keep cloſe with him in conſtant communion
and converſe in the duties of his Worſhip, God doth take them
as his familiar friends, and they will prevaile much with
God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">By our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God the terror of death wil be taken away.</note> By this means the terror of death will be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
there is no ſuch way to take off the terror of the thoughts
of death as by keeping familiarity with God, death then is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to thoſe that converſe with him. That Reverend Divine
that is now with God (Doctor <hi>Preſton</hi>) when he was to die he
had this ſpeech, <hi>I ſhall but change my place, I ſhall not change my

God, when death comes it will look with a terrible face, for
then thou haſt to deale with God, thou art then to go into the
preſence of the infinite dreadfull God, into whoſe preſence thou
never hadſt any mind to go before, but ſaith death, I muſt now
carry thee into the preſence of God. As thy <hi>Body returns to the duſt
ſo thy Soul muſt return to God that gave it;</hi> that is, to receive its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
doome, &amp;c. But now ſaith a Saint, what muſt my body
return to duſt and my Soul to God that gave it? it is he which
I have bin with every day, and can ſay as he ſaid, <hi>My Soul go
forth, go forth, why art thou unwilling to go forth to him that thou haſt
converſed with all thy daies?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then what ſafety is there in being neer to God,<note place="margin">Safety in being neer to God.</note> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in theſe dangerous times? In the time wherein we live it
is ſafe to be neer God; in <hi>Pſal. 22. 11. Be not far from me, for

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:116352:22"/>
trouble is neer us, trouble is neer many of you, perhaps there's
not a ſpans breadth between death and us, what a bleſſed thing
is it then to have God to be neer us? when the poor Chickin
ſees the Kite come neer it to ſeize upon it, and is like to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
if the Hen be neer, it runs to the Hen, and the Hen co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
it and keeps it ſafe; ſo it ſhould be with us, for ſo Chriſt
ſaith of Jeruſalem, <hi>How often would I have gathered thee as a Hen
gathereth her Chickins?</hi> There are a company of Kites abroad in
the world, and we are poor ſhiftleſſe creatures; now how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
are we then if we can run under the ſhaddow of Gods wing?
there is a kind of ſhaddow in the preſence of God in the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the creature; but the ſhadow of God that we have in
his Worſhip that is as the ſhadow of his wing. There is the
ſhadow of a Tree, and that may help from ſome kind of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
but there's another manner of ſhadow under the ſhadow of
the wing of the Hen, becauſe that nouriſhes the Chickin: The
men of the world they have the ſhadow of the Tree, as it were,
Gods generall providence which is over all creatures; but the
Saints of God that draw nigh to God they have the ſhadow of
Gods wing, like the ſhadow of the Hens wing to the Chickin,
which doth comfort it and ſafeguard it; let us by the duties of
Worſhip thus draw nigh to God, and keep nigh unto him.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:116352:23"/>
them to draw nigh unto him, they are ſuch as are precious
and honourable in his eies. I will not inlarge my ſelf in this,
only give you three Scriptures that ſhew the great honour and
reſpect that God puts upon thoſe that he doth admit to come
and Worſhip him.</p>
               <p>The firſt Scripture is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 17. There <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of
the People of Iſrael; and the great reſpect that God ſhewed to
them more then others; for ſaith he, <hi>What nation is there ſo
great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all
things that we call upon him for?</hi> What Nation is there ſo great
as you are? (<hi>So great</hi>) How doth it appear that the Nation of
Iſrael is a greater Nation then other Nations are? how?
<hi>That hath God ſo nigh unto them in all things that they call upon him
for:</hi> herein any man or woman, or nation, may be ſaid to be
great, that is, greatly honoured by the Lord God, in that they
have the Lord nigh to them and they are nigh to him, here's
the greatneſſe of a nation; you would think that if one would
deſcribe the greatneſſe of a nation, it ſhould be in their great
wealth, their great trading and traffique that they have and the
fertile place that they live in; no, this is not the greatneſſe of
a nation, But <hi>what nation is there ſo great that hath the Lord God ſo
nigh to them?</hi> There's the greatneſſe of a nation, and ſo a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
heart would account greateſſe to conſiſt in having God to
be nigh unto it.</p>
               <p>The Second Scripture is in <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 9. There we have <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
ſpeaking unto the Sons of <hi>Korah</hi> rebuking them for their ſin,
and he brings this aggravation to them of the greatnes of their
ſin, ſaith he, <hi>Seemeth it but a ſmall thing unto you that the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
hath ſeparated you from the congregation of Iſrael to bring you neer
to himſelf?</hi> That is, That you ſhould come to Worſhip him,
is this a ſmall thing to you? is not this honour enough? As
if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould have ſaid, Why do you contend for any more
honour, the Lord hath ſeparated you to bring you neer to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſef?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> This you will ſay was ſpoken to the Prieſts?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But it may be ſaid of every gracious Soul, for every
Beleever Chriſt hath made a King, Prieſt, and Prophet unto
himſelf; now there is no Beleever but Jeſus Chriſt hath ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:116352:23"/>
him or her from the reſt of the world to be neer unto God.
This is the dignity that God hath put upon thee that thou art
ſeparated by his grace to be one neer to him, whereas others
of the world they depart from him, continually depart more
and more from him; but I ſay the Lord by his grace hath ſet
thee a part for himſelf, as he ſaith in <hi>Pſal. 4. 3. The Lord hath ſet
apart him that is godly for himſelf:</hi> Thou art ſeparated from the
world, to what end? It is that thou mighteſt be neer to him,
this is thy priviledge, and thou ſhouldeſt account it thy great
honour: thou haſt not that honour and reſpect in the world
as others have, but thou art one of Gods ſeparated ones that
thou art neer to him.</p>
               <p>A Third scripture is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 28. There you may ſee how
the Prophet <hi>David</hi> did highly eſteeme of that great honour
that the Lord did put upon him in this, in being neer to God:
<hi>But it is good for me to draw neer to God.</hi> Mark how he ſpeaks, <hi>But
it is good for me:</hi> Why? <hi>For loe, they that are far from thee ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh:
thou haſt deſiroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</hi> As if
he ſhould ſay, There are ſome that did ſeeme to be neer unto
thee heretofore, that were as the wife to the husband, but
they are gone a whoring from thee; baſe Hypocrites, baſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates,
they are gone a whoring from thee, their hearts being
carnall they did not find that contentment and ſatisfaction in
thy Worſhip as thy Saints do, and therefore they are gone a
whoring from thee, but it is good for me to draw neer to thee:
It is an excellent Scripture, do you ſee any young ones, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that were very forward not many years agoe, and would
ſpeak of good things, and ſeem to rejoyce in the word, but now
they are gone a whoring, they are departed from God and his
wayes, and the pleaſures of the fleſh hath taken their hearts?
<hi>Thou wilt deſtroy them</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) that go a whoring from thee.</hi>
So thou ſhouldeſt think with thy ſelf; Oh miſerable is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of thoſe who once were forward in the profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and now are gone a whoring from God, <hi>but it's good for
me to draw neer to God,</hi> they are gone from thee, and <hi>thou wilt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them, but it is good for me to draw neer to thee;</hi> I bleſſe my ſelf
in drawing neer to thee the Lord, and bleſſe the time that ever I
did draw neer to thee, and that ever I knew thoſe waies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:116352:24"/>
in my ſoul hath drawn neer to God. Such a Worſhip God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and do delight in the worſhip of God they are ſuch as
have a great honour put upon them, they do draw nigh to God;
And thus we have finiſhed the Firſt Point.</p>
               <p>The Second Point is that will hold us ſome time, and that is,</p>
               <p>The Sanctifying Gods Name in our drawing neer to God.<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>When we Worſhip God we draw nigh to him, but let us
take heed how we draw nigh, <hi>Heb. 10. 12. Let us draw neer with a
true heart. Looke to thy feet when thou comeſt into the houſe of God,
Eccle.</hi> 5. 1. Now for the Sanctifying of Gods Name in drawing
nigh to him we ſhall indeavour to open it;</p>
               <p>1 Firſt in ſhewing you wherein the Sanctification of Gods
name conſiſts, or what we ſhould do that we might Sanctifie the
Name of God in drawing nigh to him.</p>
               <p>2 The Reaſon why God will have his name to be Sanctified
in thoſe that do draw nigh to him.</p>
               <p>How we ſhould ſanctifie the name of God in drawing nigh
to him, it is under theſe two heads:</p>
               <p>Firſt, There muſt be a due preparation unto the Worſhip of
God that we exerciſe our ſelves in at any time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A right behaviour of our ſouls in it: in theſe
two things conſiſts the Sanctifying of Gods Name in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
Now under theſe two heads all that I ſhall ſpeak about
the opening of the Sanctifying of Gods Name will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
At this time I ſhall only ſpeak of the Firſt:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The due preparation of the Soul unto the duties of Gods Worſhip;</hi>
Therein conſiſts a ſpeciall part of the Sanctifying of Gods
Name in drawing nigh to him. And that it is ſo, we find it in
Scripture, That preparation for worſhip it is called the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of our ſelves; and by finding this in Scripture it hinted
me upon this head, to ſpeake of the preparation unto worſhip in
our Sanctifying Gods Name, becauſe I find in Scripture that
the Sanctifying our ſelves for worſhip, and the preparation of
our ſelves for worſhip are all one: I'le give you theſe two texts;
In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 5. you ſhall find there, that <hi>Samuel</hi> when he was
ſent by God to Anoint <hi>David</hi> in Bethlem, the text ſaith, <hi>I am
come to Sacrifice unto the Lord, Sanctifie your ſelves and come with me
to the Sacrifice, Do you come peaceably</hi> ſay they? <hi>Yes;</hi> what then?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:116352:24"/>
                  <hi>Sanctifie your ſelves and come with me to the Sacrifice:</hi> That's all
one, as if he ſhould have ſaid, Prepare your ſelves and come
with me to the Sacrifice: and ſo in <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 5. there you ſhall find
that the holy man <hi>Joh</hi> when his ſons had been feaſting, he was
ſome what afraid leaſt there ſhould be ſome miſcarriage, and
that they had ſinned againſt God in their feaſting; as it is very
hard to give liberty to pleaſe the fleſh and not to ſin, not to
tranſgreſſe bounds; therefore <hi>Job</hi> though he did not hear of
any notorious abuſe of their feaſting, yet he was afraid leaſt
they ſhould ſin, he knew how dangerous it was to have ſo much
ſatisfaction to the fleſh and not to tranſgreſſe bounds, therefore
it is ſaid <hi>he ſent to his ſons and ſanctified them. It was ſo</hi> (ſaith the
text) <hi>when the daies of the feaſting were gone about, that</hi> Job <hi>ſent and
Sanctified them:</hi> that <hi>Job</hi> ſent unto them to prepare them to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Sacrifice, to prepare them for the Worſhip of God: So that
the Scripture holds forth this then, that to prepare for worſhip
it is, to Sanctifie for Worſhip, and ſo it is one ſpeciall thing
that is required in our ſanctifying of God, in our drawing nigh
to God, to make a due preparation for his holy worſhip. Now
for the orderly handling of things;</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Firſt, I ſhal ſhew you,</hi> That we muſt prepare for the worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Secondly, I ſhall ſhew you,</hi> Wherein this preparation for the
Worſhip of God doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The excellencie that there is in this, <hi>or</hi> what great
good there is in preparation for Gods Worſhip.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I ſhall Anſwer a caſe of Conſcience or two.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Fiftly, I will ſhew you</hi> what is the behaviour of the Soul in
Sanctifying Gods Name.</p>
               <p>6 <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Reaſons why God will be Sanctified in the duties
of his Worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there muſt be preparation to the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>For Firſt, that God that we come to Worſhip,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1</note> is a great and
glorious God, and we having to deal with ſuch an infinite, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
dreadfull Majeſty, it is fit that we ſhould make prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
when we come nigh unto him: therefore in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 10.
when God came among the people to give them his Law, he did
require that <hi>they ſhould be Sanctified to day and tomorrow, and that
they ſhould waſh their cloaths and be ready againſt the third day, for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:116352:25"/>
the third day the Lord would come down upon mount Sinai in the ſight
of all the people.</hi> God did not ſo much ſtand upon their cloaths,
but it was to ſignifie an inward waſhing. Now my brethren,
if when God came to give the Law they were ſo to prepare, then
certainly when we are to come to Worſhip God in the way of
the Goſpel, we are to prepare as well as they, becauſe God is
coming. For that that is obſervable is, why they were for
two dayes together to make ſuch preparation, the argument is
becauſe of the preſence of God; <hi>The Lord ſaid to</hi> Moſes, <hi>Go and
Sanctifie the people to day and to morrow, and let them waſh their
cloaths and be ready againſt the third day,</hi> Why? <hi>for the Lord will
come down in the ſight of all the people upon mount Sinai:</hi> The Lord
will come down the third day and therefore let them be San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.
So when thou goeſt to Worſhip God, thou expecteſt or
ſhouldeſt expect that God will come to thee, and that thy heart
ſhall be drawn to God, and therefore thou ſhouldeſt make ſome
preparation (For the time of preparation we ſhall ſpeak to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
when we come to the caſes of Conſcience about prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for Worſhip.) And ſo in 1 <hi>Chr. 22. 5. 14. David</hi> makes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for the houſe of God becauſe it was the houſe of God
that he had to build, though he could not do it himſelf in his
own time, yet being the houſe of God what great preparation
was made by <hi>David?</hi> The morral of which is this That the houſe
of God being a Type of the Church and the worſhip of God, as
well as of Chriſt; it ſhewes that there ſhould be much prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
when we have to deal with God in his Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2</note> As God is great that we draw nigh to, ſo the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Gods worſhip are great duties, they are the greateſt things
that doth concern us in this world, and it is a ſign of a very
carnall heart to ſlight the duties of Gods Worſhip, to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them as little matters: Carnall hearts ordinarily the
things that concern their buſineſſes in the world they think
great matters; Oh I may not neglect that, I may not neglect
that, I may not neglect ſuch a buſineſſe, or I may not neglect
to viſit or gratifie ſuch a friend but now for the worſhip of God
it is good indeed, but whither it be done or not it is no great
matter, therefore they can put off prayer; if they have any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
the time of prayer muſt pay for it; they can put off that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:116352:25"/>
upon any ſlight occaſion, they do not account the duties of
Gods worſhip great matters; My brethren I beſeech you learn
this leſſon this morning, to account the duties of Gods worſhip
great matters, they are the greateſt things that do concerne you
here in this world; for they are the homage that you tender
up to the high God, as you heard, and thoſe things wherein
God communicats himſelf in his choiſe Mercies, now being ſuch
great matters there is cauſe that we ſhould prepare. For that
one thing of prayer, ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> It is a great work, and a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
work, and therefore there had need be preparation for it:
Buſineſſe of great conſequence we make preparation for, indeed
if a buſineſſe be a ſlight buſineſſe we can fall upon it on a ſudden,
you make not preparation to go in a Boat in the Thames, but
to go a voyage you make great preparation. Now if men and
women would but underſtand the duties of Gods worſhip to be
great, they would ſee a neceſſity to make a preparation; Many
men for want of preparation to duties they loſe a great part of
the time, when they come to performe a duty of Worſhip in
prayer they ſpend half the time that is convenient to be ſpent in
prayer before they begin to pray; and ſo in hearing the word,
they are a long time before they can ſettle themſelves to attend
to the word, or in any other kind of Worſhip; I ſay a great
deal of time in the worſhip is ſpent ordinarily before we can get
our hearts to cloſe with the worſhip; now that is a ſore and a
great evill to loſe any part of the time of worſhip: Chriſtians,
I beſeech you account highly of the time of your worſhip, you
have bin ſo long time at prayer, yea but how much of it hath
been loſt becauſe you have not prepared before hand for it? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you kneel'd upon your knees, but you were a long time
before you could get your hearts warm at your work, why you
ſhould have been warm before you had come: It is ſo often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with many men, when they meet together and there is no
preparation for their buſineſſe, they come together and they are
a long time before they can buckle to the buſineſſe that they
came about, becauſe there was no preparation, but if there be
preparation made, that every man knows before hand what his
work is, they can fall to it, and they can diſpatch as much in
one hour as others do in two or three; but of that we ſhall
ſpeak more afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:116352:26"/>
Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3</note> There muſt be preparation becauſe our hearts are
naturally, exceedingly unprepared for every good work, we
are all naturally even <hi>reprobate to every good work,</hi> the duties of
Gods Worſhip are high and Spirituall, and holy things, but by
nature our hearts grovell in the dirt, and we are carnal, ſenſual,
droſſie, dead, ſlight, ſottiſh, and vain, altogether unfit to come
into the preſence of God: Oh that we were but apprehenſive
and ſenfible of the unfitneſſe of our hearts to come into Gods
preſence! Perhaps becauſe thou knoweſt not God thou canſt
ruſh into his preſence without any more adoe, but if thou
knoweſt thy ſelf, and God, thou couldeſt not but ſee thy ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unfit for his preſence, and ſo as to wonder that the
Lord ſhould not ſpurn thee out of his preſence every time thou
comeſt unto him, there had need then be preparation becauſe
we are ſo unfit to come into his preſence.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 4</note> There had need be preparation becauſe of the
great hinderances of the Worſhip of God. This buſineſſe and
the other buſineſſe would hinder; the intanglements, they
would hinder; the temptations of the Devill, they
would hinder; ſometimes the indiſpoſition of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
doth mightily hinder; and the ſtirrings of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of our minds they hinder: if there be any buſineſſe fals
out amiſle in the family, and any thing go but croſſe, how are
we put off the hinges &amp; made unfit for holy duties! There had
need be preparation therefore becauſe there are ſo many hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
in the way, many of you will complain that you are
much hindered, but do you do what you can to make prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
before hand? Do the hinderances that you complain of
put you on to be ſo much the more carefull to make due prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for holy duties.</p>
               <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 5</note> We find that the heathens themſelves by the light of
nature when they did but worſhip their Idol gods, they would
make ſome preparation, ſuch as was ſuitable to thoſe gods that
the worſhipped, therefore they would waſh their fleſh and
purge themſelves, but though their preparation was but very
poor, yet they taught us thus much, That they were convinſt in
their conſciences that when God was to be Worſhipped, people
ſhould be prepared.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:116352:26"/>
The Sixt &amp; laſt reaſon hath a great deal in it,<note place="margin">Reaſon 6</note> which I beſeech
you conſider of; we find that the Scripture doth make the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes
of the heart much to conſiſt in <hi>preparation</hi> for worſhip;
and doth make the falſeneſſe of the heart to conſiſt in this,
that men do not <hi>prepare.</hi> Perhaps you have not ſo much thought
of this, but yet it is of excellent uſe unto you. We ſhall find the
Scripture doth make the very uprightneſſe of the heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in the <hi>preparation</hi> for duty; and the falſeneſſe of a mans heart
to conſiſt in this, that he makes not conſcience to prepare his
heart for God and his worſhip. And this I will ſhew unto you
very plainly and cleerly, take theſe two examples. The firſt
of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and the ſecond of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> one a wicked man
whoſe heart was falſe, and the other a godly man whoſe heart
was right with God. The falſeneſſe of the heart of the one is in
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 14. there you have what Gods thoughts of <hi>Rehoboam</hi>
were in the verſes before: but now he brings the reaſon of his
ſentence upon him, and ſaith the text, <hi>he did evill becauſe he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not his heart to ſeek the Lord;</hi> there were many good things
that <hi>Rehoboam</hi> did; I might ſhew you ſome things; as how he
did obey the Prophet of God when he was ſeeking to avenge
himſelfe upon thoſe that did rend themſelves from his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
the Lord did but ſend his Prophet, and though he had an
army ready to revenge himſelfe upon thoſe that in a way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
did rend themſelves from under his government, &amp; he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
the word of the Lord but for al that he did evil in the fight
of the Lord God look'd upon him as a man that had no upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in him, why? <hi>for he did not prepare his heart to ſeek the Lord,</hi> ſaith
God, I look upon all <hi>Rehoboam</hi> did as nothing; I look upon his
waies as evil and himſelf as a wicked man, Why? Becauſe he did
not prepare his heart to ſeek the Lord if his hart had bin upright
with me he would have prepared his heart to ſeek me. I beſeech
you now lay this text to your hearts do you prepare your hearts
to ſeek God? when you go to prayer can you ſay that you take
paines in preparing your hearts for it? and in hearing the word,
and ſo likewiſe for receiving the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Now for <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> a godly man in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 3. there you
may ſee what the Lord ſaith of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> that was godly. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
there are good things found in thee, in that thou haſt taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:116352:27"/>
the greves out of the land, and haſt prepared thine heart to ſeek God.
Jehoſhaphat</hi> was found guilty in joyning himſelf to wicked men
too much, the Prophet comes and ſaith to him, <hi>Wouldeſt thou
help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath
upon thee from before the Lord. Jehoſhaphat</hi> here we ſee was very
faulty in joyning with thoſe that were wicked, and is rebuked
by the Prophet from the Lord; What wilt thou joyne with
the wicked? the wrath of God is upon thee: Well, but for all
that, (I beſeech you obſerve it) That at that time when the
Lord is moſt diſpleaſed againſt <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> and ſends his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
in his name to pronounce this, that the wrath of God is out
againſt him; yet for all this, God cannot but take notice of
this, that he had an upright heart, though he failed in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<hi>yet there is ſome good found in thee, in that thou haſt prepared
thy heart to ſeek God.</hi> Indeed through ſome ſudden temptations
thou art drawn aſide in this particular act; Yea, but it hath
been thy care to prepare thy heart to ſeek me, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
I do look upon thee as having an upright heart: And
thus you ſee how much the Scripture puts upon the preparation
of the heart to ſeek God. And ſo in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 3. you ſhall find
that the Scripture makes the uprightneſſe of the heart to conſiſt
in this, <hi>And</hi> Samuel <hi>ſpake unto all the houſe of Iſrael ſaying, If ye do
returne unto the Lord with all your hearts,</hi> what then? <hi>why then,
put away the ſtrange gods, and Aſhtaroth from among you, and prepare
your hearts unto the Lord, and ſerve him only:</hi> As if <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhould
ſay, If you will return indeed to the Lord, if indeed your
hearts be upright according to what you ſeeme to profeſſe in
turning to God, why then <hi>prepare your hearts to ſeek the Lord.</hi>
You do not in truth turne to God except you make conſcience
to prepare your hearts: Therefore you that yet never knew
what it was to make conſcience to prepare your hearts for holy
duties, know that you have not turned with all your heart
unto the Lord, there hath not been the true turning of your
hearts unto the Lord. Thus now you ſee there is much lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
preparation to the duties of Gods worſhip: Well, you will
ſay, ſeeing there lies ſo much in it, I pray open it wherein it
doth conſiſt. To that I Anſwer, It conſiſts in theſe five things,
which I ſhall but briefly name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:116352:27"/>
Firſt, <hi>In the poſſeſſing the heart with the right apprehenſion of that
God before whom we come to tender our duties;</hi> Then do we make
conſcience to prepare our hearts, when we labour upon our
going to worſhip God, to get our hearts before hand poſſeſſed
with right apprehenſions of the Majeſty of that God that we are
going to Worſhip, and of the greatneſſe, and weight of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that we are ſetting about the nature of it, the manner how
it is to be performed, the rule by which we are to be guided, the
end that we are to aime at: Meditation is a good preparation
to holy duties. And theſe are the generall heads of our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for our preparation to duty. <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What God He is we have to deal with meditate of God in his
Attributes and then meditate of the weight of our duties, and
the nature of them and the rule of them, and the end of them;
get your hearts poſſeſſed with meditations of this nature, and in
this as a ſpeciall thing doth conſiſt your preparation to holy
dutie, and that's the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>2 The Second thing wherein the preparation to a duty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts,
it is in this, In the taking off of the heart from every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
way, the indeavour at leaſt, If there be iniquity in thine
hand or heart labour to put it out: When thou are come into
Gods preſence, do not bring into the preſence of God the love
of any ſin in thine heart, but labour to put it from thy heart:
In 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 5. We find there what is required to preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Text ſaith, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>Hear me, ye Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits,
ſanctifie now your ſelves, and ſanctifie the houſe of the Lord God
of your fathers, and carry forth the filthineſſe out of the holy place:</hi> that
is ſanctifying a thing to carry forth the filthineſſe out of that
thing that we would ſanctifie ſo the Sanctifying of our hearts
it is by carrying forth the filthineſſe out of our hearts, ſo as to
be fit for a duty. And in <hi>Job. 11. 13, 14. If thou prepare thine
heart, and ſiretch out thine hand towards him:</hi> What then? <hi>If ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
he in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedneſſed well in
thy tabernacles:</hi> Theſe Two muſt be together.</p>
               <p>3 A Third thing is this, The Preparation of the heart it is
the diſintangling of the heart from the world, and from all
occaſions and buſineſſes in the world. I am to worſhip God,
but how is my heart inſnared and intangled in this and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:116352:28"/>
buſineſſe? Now when I come to worſhip God I muſt lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
all, for there's the preparation of the heart, the ſeparating
of it for ſuch a work, for that's the nature of Sanctification, the
ſeparating of a thing from a common uſe I am to worſhip God,
now I muſt labour to ſeparate my heart from a common uſe:
At other times God gives me liberty to let out my heart to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
uſes; but now when I come to worſhip him, I muſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
my heart from all common uſes, that my heart may be
wholly for God. I remember it is ſaid in the ſtory of <hi>Cieil</hi>
which was Lord treaſurer, that when he went to read, he would
lay his gown off and ſay, <hi>Lie there Lord</hi> Cieil: So when we go
to duty, we ſhould ſay, Lie by world: (and by laying aſide the
world I mean, laying aſide of all houſhold affairs, or affairs in
trading, &amp;c.) I muſt be as one that hath nothing to do in the
world for that time: It is true, the time cannot be ſaid to be
holy for this, as the time of the Sabbath day is holy.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, Why may not any time be ſaid to be holy that
I ſpend in holy duties? No, that is not enough to make time
holy, for the time that God makes holy, it is not holy becauſe
of the duties that I perform in it, but the duties that I perform
then are more acceptable becauſe they are done in ſuch a time,
and ſo that makes a place holy, not becauſe it is appointed for
holy duties and uſes, but becauſe it is ſo appointed by God, and
the performing a duty in that place is more acceptable to God
then in another place: But now though we cannot make our
time holy in that ſecond ſenſe, yet in the firſt, it is time ſet apart
for a holy uſe, and in that regard it is holy, and ſo we ſhould
look upon it as not to have our outward buſineſſe to devour
that time that is holy in that regard, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> When <hi>Tobiah</hi>
and <hi>Sanballat</hi> ſent to him to come and confer with them; No,
ſaith he, I cannot go <hi>for the work is great that I have to do:</hi> So we
muſt not intangle our ſelves to meddle with other things when
we are to come to worſhip God, for our work is great.</p>
               <p>The Fourth thing for Preparation is, <hi>To Watch and to Pray:</hi>
We ſhould watch over our hearts leaſt they be made unfit for
duties. So we ſhould prepare for Prayer all day long in this
ſenſe, that is, we ſhould watch over our hearts that they bee
not let out ſo far as to hinder us in prayer when we come to do
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:116352:28"/>
it. I remember that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, That the Chriſtians did
ſo ſup as if that they were to pray, ſo when thou art in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thou ſhouldeſt watch unto Prayer; Oh that you did ſo, you
cannot but be conſcious to your ſelves that oftentimes when
you have bin in company your hearts have been put out of tune
and frame, that you have been no way fit for prayer; when
you come home your houſe and family finds it ſo; you that
take ſuch delight in company and fitting up late, I appeale to
your conſciences whither you can come home and find your
ſelves fit either in your family or cloſet to go and open your
hearts to God.</p>
               <p>This is one Note by the way wherby you may come to know
whither you have been immoderate in company at any time;
God gives not men liberty to be buſie in any outward occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the world ſo as to unfit them for his ſervice. preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
conſiſts in that, in watching over your hearts, that you may
not be unfitted for any holy duty when God cals you to it, but
that you may be ready even to every good work.</p>
               <p>The Fift is this, Preparation conſiſts in the readineſſe of the
faculties of the ſoul and the graces of the ſpirit of God, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to act upon the ſetting upon a holy duty. When a man or
woman ſhall find the faculties of their ſoul and the graces that
are in them, to be ready to act as ſoon as ever they fall upon du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
juſt as you ſee a company of Ringers when they have made
all preparation for the raiſing of the bels, then in an inſtant
when they begin to pull, all the bels go in that tune that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their skil they ſet them in. And ſo it ſhould be with our
hearts, the faculties of our ſouls and graces, though now we are
not upon duty, yet we ſhould be ſo ready that as it were upon
a pull, all the faculties of our ſouls and graces of Gods Spirit
ſhould work in a melodious way; There are thoſe that keep
their hearts ſo prepared as at the very firſt moment that they ſet
about the duty of Worſhip, all faculties and graces begin to
act and to ſtir and are working towards God, as a fire, when all
the matter is ready laid, preſently it comes to be kindled and
flame out; and thus it ſhould be with our hearts: So that now
you ſee wherein preparation of our hearts to duty conſiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>The next thing is the Excellency of the preparation; and that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:116352:29"/>
may be in way of Application to you to make you to be in
love with Preparation for holy duties. There is abundance
of good in it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By this meanes we come to make every duty of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
eaſie to us, things are difficult when we come upon them
unprepared, If you have a friend come to dinner or ſupper to
you, and ſhould come ſuddenly, and you have nothing prepared
there would be a great deal of ſtir in the houſe, but it you have
every thing prepared, it would be carried on in an eaſie way;
and the reaſon why people e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mplaine ſo much of difficulty in
duty, it is becauſe their hearts are not prepared. Indeed we
have naturally many things to keep us off from God but now
when the heart is prepared for a holy duty, it goes off as eaſie to
God even into the infinite ocean of All mercy and goodneſſe,
as a ſhip goes off to be lanſht when you have made preparation
for it and the heart can go with a holy boldne e to God when
you have made preparation for holy duties. In <hi>Job</hi> 11. the
place which I quoted before for the work of preparation, do
but conſider a verſe or two further, and you ſhall find what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of good there comes upon the keeping of the heart
prepared in things that are good. Verſ 13. <hi>If thou prepare th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne
heart, &amp;c.</hi> And then Verſ. 15. <hi>Then ſhalt thou life up thy face with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpot, yea, thou ſhalt be ſteadf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt and ſhalt not fear:</hi> When the
heart is prepared for that that is good, when it comes into the
preſence of God it is able to lift up its ſelf without fear, in a
ſteadfaſt comfortable way, and this will quit the coſt of any
labour.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, if the heart be prepared, it will do a great deal
in a little time In 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 36 it is ſaid, That <hi>Hezekiah re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced,
and all the people, that God had prepared the people for the thing
was done ſuddenly.</hi> The thing came off freely and ſuddenly when
as that they were prepared: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> rejoiced and ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed God
for ſuch a mercy as this was it is a great mercy to have the
hearts of people prepared unto a good work. And ſo in 2 <hi>Chr.</hi>
27. 6. the text ſaith, <hi>Joth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m,</hi> he grew mighty by this,
and ſo certainly the way to grow to be very ſtrong and mighty,
to be able to do a great deal in a little time, it is to make prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:116352:29"/>
there may be as much work done in one hour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, as in
ten times to much time when the heart is not prepared for it. In
<hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 10. you ſhall find that the reaſon is given why <hi>Ezra</hi> had
ſuch good ſucceſſe in his journy, it was becauſe he had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his heart. Make preparation for holy duties and you ſhall
have ſucceſs in holy duties There is a notable Scripture for that
in <hi>Pſal</hi> 10 17 where the holy Ghoſt ſaith, that God <hi>prepares the
heart</hi> and what then? when God doth prepare the heart, he
doth then <hi>cauſe his eare to hear.</hi> There was never a prayer made
wherin the heart was prepared for it but that praier was heard,
they go both together, Lord thou wilt prepare their heart, and
thou wilt cauſe thine eare to hear: it God hath once prepared
thy heart, thou wilt be ſure to be heard then: Is it not worth
a world for to know ones ſelf to be accepted of God in every
duty of Wo-ſhip that we tender up to him? this one Scripture
<hi>Pſal</hi> 10. 17. will ſhew it. Oh the excellency that there is in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to duty!</p>
               <p>There is one thing more that is very obſervable, and that is
this, Where the heart is prepared to duties, there the Lord will
paſſe by weakneſſes and imperfections in duties. When thou
comeſt to perform holy duties thou art troubled, will the Lord
have regard to ſuch a duty as this is? thou mayeſt have certain
aſſurance that the Lord will have regard if thou canſt make
this point good to thine own ſoul, that it was thy care to make
preparation for this duty canſt thou ſay, Lord I have indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
and done what I could to fit my heart for duty, but O
Lord, I find when I am at it, wonderful diſtractions, much
deadneſſe and vanity, what ſhall I do? Why canſt thou make
good the former and appeal to God that indeed it was thy care
to make preparation? I'le give thee one cripture then for the
quieting of thy heart in this: That the weakneſſe of the duty

this Scripture, know it's written for thine inſtruction, and thou

conſcience of Preparation to holy duties.</p>
               <p>Again furthe, by being carefull to make Preparation for
duties, within ſome little time thou wilt bring thy heart to
ſuch a frame as it will alwaies he ready for duty without much
adoe; Indeed at firſt it is ſomewhat hard.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, Are we bound to ſpend ſometime every time
we go to prayer before hand, or every time we come to the
Word? That ſhould have been one of the Caſes of Conſcience,
but I cannot come to Anſwer that, but this we may ſay, Be
carefull to prepare for duties, you that are young beginners, or
you that have made profeſſion a longer time, but yet have not
had the weight of this duty upon your ſpirits; now be carefull
for a while to prepare for every duty of Gods Worſhip, that
God calls you to, and I ſay within a little time thou mayeſt
bring thy heart into ſuch a temper as thou mayeſt be ready at
all times to performe holy duties: becauſe you ſhall be able to
come to that temper and frame that the Apoſtle exhorts to,
<hi>Pray continually,</hi> for indeed ſo it ſhould be with us, we ſhould be
alwaies prepared either for Prayer; hearing the Word, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Sacraments. Now becauſe Sacraments are ſo rare, thoſe
that have any inlightened conſcience they think they dare not
but prepare for Sacraments, but you ſhould be alwaies in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for the receiving of the Sacraments, as the Primitive
Chriſtians did. And thoſ that have been acquainted with
this Point that I am upon, of preparing for duties, they have
come to ſuch a frame of Spirit, as that there is not ſo much time
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:116352:30"/>
required of them as of others, for they are in a conſtant fitneſſe,
ſo that there is no inſtant of time in the whole day but if God
cals them to Prayer they could preſently fall down upon their
knees and pray ſo as to Sanctifie Gods name in Prayer, that
were an excellent temper indeed if you could find it ſo, that you
walk ſo ſpiritually and holily before God as there could be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a quarter of an hour from morning to night, nor from the
beginning of the week to the end, but if you were cald to pray,
or to receive the Sacrament, you had your heart fitted, that you
could come into Gods preſence with a prepared heart, and were
able to Sanctifie Gods Name in the duty. Acquaint your ſelves

ſet ſome time apart for preparation to the duty that we are to

               <p>The anſwer to that is this; we muſt diſtinguiſh of perſons;
There are ſom that are exerciſed in the way of godlineſſe, and
do keep their hearts cloſe with God in the waies of holineſſe;
now for them it may be ſuppoſed that through their exerciſe in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:116352:31"/>
the waies of godlineſſe, and keeping of their hearts conſtant
with God in communion with him walking with God cloſely,
that they are at all times <hi>prepared to every good work,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

fulfil that command of the Apoſtle, <hi>pray continually,</hi> that is, in
the diſpoſition of their hearts, they are fit to pray at any time,
there is no day in the week, nor no hour in the day but they (if
God call them to it) could fal down to ſolemn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>raier. And
indeed this is an exellent condition and a good evidence of the
hearts walking cloſe with God that there is no time but they
are fit to pray, and fit for any Ordinance, yea to recive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Lords upper. It is poſible to keep the heart ſo
cloſe to God, as to be fit for praier, and for the hearing of the
Word, and for receiving of the Sacrament every day, or any
hour in the day but this needs a very cloſe walking with God
and communion with God and the truth is this is very rare;
moſt men let out their hearts ſo much to other things, as their
conſciences cannot but tel them, that if God call them to praier
at ſuch a time in the day, they are altogether unfit for it: If they
were called to receive, the Sacrament, their conſciences would
fly in their faces and tel them, they are unfit for it but it is not

               <p>Firſt, thoſe that firſt ſet upon the duties of Religion: young
beginners, that begin at firſt to ſet their faces towards Heaven,
to worſhip God they had need look to their hearts they ſhould
ſpend ſome time in Preparation when they come to holy duties,
and the truth is, when the conſcience of a man or woman is at
firſt inlightened, and awakened, they will be very carefull in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:116352:31"/>
preparing to holy duties, the fear of God it is mighty upon
their Spirits at firſt, and it ſhould not be leſſe afterwards the
conſtancy of Gods fear ſhould bring their hearts to ſuch a holy
temper as to make them fit for holy duties alwaies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thoſe men and women that at any time ſhall ſin
againſt conſcience, ſhall commit ſuch ſins as ſhall in a kind even
lay waſt Conſcience, ſhall break their peace between God and
their Souls; they had need ſpend ſome time in preparation for
holy duties, they cannot come into the preſence of God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
communion with God, but they had need before hand be
very ſerious in the examination of their hearts, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the working of their hearts into mourning for their ſinne,
and to labour to poſſeſſe their Souls with the preſence of God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before they come. Theſe two ſorts of people, ſuch as have
not been acquainted with the waies of godlineſſe, or ſuch as
have broken their peace with God by ſome evill carriage of
theirs towards God in ſome vile way, I ſay it is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of them to bee more ſolemne in the worke of Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>2 But now for the ſecond caſe which indeed is the main;
Suppoſe when we come to duties, and begin to examine our
hearts, and begin to bethink our ſelves whether we be prepared
yea or no to holy duties, and we do not find our hearts prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
according to that that we do deſire, whether then we may
let the duty go for that time, and forbear the performance of it,
as ſuppoſe Prayer, or receiving the Sacrament, or coming to
the Word or any other holy duty?</p>
               <p>And the reaſon of this doubt is, becauſe when any man or
woman is conſciencious, they think with themſelves that they
muſt Sanctifie Gods Name in holy duties, now if they cannot
find their hearts in a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t diſpoſition to Sanctifie the name of God
in holy duties, they are ready to think thus, Were it not better
to neglect this duty and lay it aſide for the preſent, will God
accept of a duty when I performe it, and am not fit for
it?</p>
               <p>Therefore for the Anſwer to this, becauſe it is a temptation
that ſometimes carnal hearts have, and they are ready to take
this temptation, and willing to neglect the duty upon ſuch a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:116352:32"/>
thought as this, that they are not prepared: And the truth is,
they are more glad to let the duty fall, then they are ſorry for
want of the preparation of their hearts for the duty. I beſeech
you conſider of this, whether you have not found it ſo, that
ſometimes when you have not been fit to performe a holy duty,
there hath not been a more ſecret willingneſſe of the heart to let
the duty go, then a ſorrow of the heart becauſe you are not it
for the duty. This is a very evil ſign that the heart is very much
diſtempered. Thoſe that are godly indeed when they find not
their hearts prepar'd for the duty it is the trouble of their ſouls,
it is that that goes neer to their hearts, when they think with
themſelves that they are now like to loſe a duty of the worſhip
of God, they are now like to loſe their communion with God
in a holy duty, they even look upon themſelves in an evill caſe
in regard of this; and it makes them watchfull for time to come
to take heed of thoſe things that have put them in ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparation
as they find their hearts to be in at this time: Now
if it be ſo with thee it is a good ſign that thy heart may be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
with God though through infirmity it comes at ſuch a
time to be unprepared for the duty.</p>
               <p>But yet ſuppoſe I find I am not prepared, I am greiv'd and
troubled at it, (for that muſt be premiſed) whether were I bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to leave the duty for this time then to fall upon it in ſuch an
unpreparation as this is?</p>
               <p>Now for the Anſwer to this Queſtion.</p>
               <p>1 Firſt, That which I would Anſwer to it is this, The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of a duty, or the laying of a duty aſide, will never fit
the Soul for a duty afterwards it is no way to make thy ſoul
more fit afterwards becauſe thou haſt laid it aſide now for the
preſent; do but obſerve your own hearts that way, and you
will find this by experience: Such a time you have been buſie
in the world, and occaſions have hindered you ſo as your heart
is out of temper and frame for a duty, you lay it aſide, now are
you more fit the next day? If you do neglect duty in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon any buſineſſe, are you fitter to perform duty at night
becauſe of it? you will not find it to be ſo: the forbearing a
duty now will not make the Soul fitter for a duty afterwards;
therefore is no wiſdome to forbear a duty for want of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:116352:32"/>
becauſe the forbearance will never help to further pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
but will make the Soul more unfit for duty. It is an
excellent ſpeech that I read that <hi>Luther</hi> hath concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>I have learned this by experience, that the oftener I do omit duty,
the oftener do I make my ſelf the more unfit for duty, and cauſe I have to
abhorre my ſelf.</hi> It is not the deferring that makes thee the more
fit.</p>
               <p>2 Therefore conſider that this is but a temptation, and that
is the Second thing that I would propound to thoſe that ſhall
omit a duty becauſe they are not prepared, That this is but a
Temptation to keep thee from it, to tell thee that thou art not
prepared: and if thou ſhalt forbear it becauſe thou art not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
in this thing thou doeſt gratifie the Devil, and the Devil
hath what he would have, and ſo would be incouraged to
tempt thee another time becauſe he hath now what he would
have in cauſing thee to forbear the duty; Firſt, he laboureth to
unfit thee for it, and then he tempts thee to forbear it becauſe
thou art unfit, this is the ſubtilty of the Devil. From whence
is it that thou art unfit but from the temptation of the Devil?
And I and <hi>Luther</hi> again, that was a man that had as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with God as any in his daies, and a man that had as much
to draw his heart away, as many temptations, and as many bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes
as any, for indeed the great Cauſe of Chriſt in all the
Chriſtian world in a great meaſure under God lay upon his
ſhoulders, and yet ſaith he, <hi>If any one think that prayer muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
till the Soul be purified from impure cogitations, he doth no other
then help the Devil who is powerfull enough;</hi> he thinks to be wiſe in
deferring the duty becauſe he is not fit, and he hath many ill
thoughts and troubles in his Spirit, he doth nothing elſe ſaith
<hi>Luther,</hi> but gratifie the Devil that is ſtrong enough without this.
Oh let us take heed of gratifying the Devil in his temptations,
therefore remember it is a temptation for thee to omit a duty
meerly becauſe thou art not prepared for the duty.</p>
               <p>3 In the Third place, that which I would Anſwer to this
Queſtion is this, If any one performe a duty of Worſhip in that
ſincerity and ſtrength that he is able to do it, though he be not
prepared as he ought, yet it is better to do it then to neglect it.
It is true, ſome do performe a duty in a meer formall way, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:116352:33"/>
to ſatisfie their conſciences, or to cloak and cover their ſins and
the like: perhaps they may ſo performe it as it might be better
to be unperformed then to performe it as they do, but if you do
indeavour to the uttermoſt of your ſtrength to do it, though
you be not prepared as you do deſire, yet it is better to do it
then to omit the doing of it, and you will find it ſo, for one
duty doth prepare for another. Though it be not done as I
deſire it ſhould be done, yet the doing of it as well as I can at
this time will help me to do it better at another time, that is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as one ſin doth prepare the heart for another ſin, ſo one
duty prepares the heart for another, as now, ſuppoſe a man
commits a ſinne, and he hath a conſcience that is inlightened
that doth hinder him from committing his ſin with that full
ſtrength that he would do it many a man hath a mind to ſin
but through the inlightening of his conſcience he cannot ſinne
with that delight as he would, becauſe his conſcience flies in
his face and doth interrupt him, but yet for all this through
the ſtrength of his corruption he will break through to that
ſin: now though at firſt they cannot commit that ſin with that
delight and freedome as they do at other times yet if their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
be ſo ſtrong as to break through the light of their
conſciences, the next time they come to the committing of that
ſin they will commit it with more freedome and eaſe a great
deal.</p>
               <p>This is evident by experience, there is none of you but if
you well obſerve your hearts you will find this, A Temptation
comes to a ſin, now you cannot do it with ſo much freedom as
you would, but yet you break through it, you will find that
the next time you will commit it with more freedom, and ſo
one ſin will prepare for another, and it may be you have ſome
trouble of Conſcience at firſt, but the next time you will have
leſſe trouble, till at length you can commit it freely without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
trouble of Conſcience at all. As it is in ſinne, ſo it is in
godlineſſe many times in ſome degree at the firſt you have a
motion to a holy duty, but through the ſtirrings of your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
you are not fit for it, now do you but break through
that difficulty, and the next time you will be more fit, and the
next time after that you will be more fit, and ſo ſtill more and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:116352:33"/>
more fit as it is in ſin, If a man when he hath ſome trouble of
conſcience would but liſten to his conſcience and would not
commit that ſin, his conſcience would grow ſtronger upon him,
and ſtrengthen him againſt that ſin, ſo if any man or woman li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens
to the temptation to deferre duty and put it off becauſe
they are not prepared, why after that the corruption will grow
more ſtrong, therefore ſet upon the duty, and the performance
of one duty will prepare for another.</p>
               <p>4 In the Fourth place, while men and women are ſtrugling
with their ſouls and the corruption of their hearts, and do not
fall upon ſeeking God, they by their very ſtrugling to prepare
themſelves many times, do inſnare themſelves: It may be thou
haſt thoughts of Athiſme or other wickedneſſe, the very ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with thoſe thoughts may inſnare thy heart; now the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way were to fall upon prayer, and to cry to God to help
thee again them, for while thou art ſtrugling and ſtriving
with thoſe thoughts thou art ſtriving with the corruption of
thy heart and with the Devil all alone, but now when thou
falleſt to the duty thou calleſt in the help of God and of Jeſus
Chriſt, and that is a great deal better, while thou art muſing,
plodding, &amp; troubling thy heart that way, I ſay thou art ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
alone but now when thou falleſt upon the duty then thou
calleſt in help from God and ſo thou art more able to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the duty then thou wert before. And therefore it
is the beſt way to fall upon a duty though thou canſt not find
thy heart prepared as thou doeſt deſire the very falling upon it
will fit thee for it. And thus much for the Anſwer unto thoſe
two Caſes of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Now then we are to proceed further in the opening of the
Sanctifying of Gods Name in holy duties. Thus much for the
preparation of the heart. But when the heart comes to it in
what manner ſhould the duty be performed ſo as the name of
God may be ſanctified in the duty or what is the behaviour of
the Soul in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anctifying of Gods Name when it is in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
act of the duty?</p>
               <p>To that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Anſwer. Firſt in generall thus, When the Soul la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to performe duties ſo as God may have ſuch glory from
the duty as is fit for a God to have in ſome meaſure: then do I
Sanctifie Gods name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:116352:34"/>
You will ſay this is a very hard thing to performe a duty ſo
as that we ſhould give God the glory that is fit for a God to
have: Certainly this is not done by every manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of a duty of Worſhip: yet you ſhall hear this opened to
you, and I hope you ſhall have it made very plaine before
you.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore I ſhall ſhew you, that when we are to perform
a duty of worſhip, we ſhould ſet our ſelves to glorifie God
as a God, that is to do it in that manner that God may have
that glory that is fit for a God to have. As now in the duty of
Praiſe <hi>Pſa. 66. 2. make his praiſe glorious,</hi> that is, do it ſo as you
may lift up His Name in it, and that God may be glorious in
your praiſe. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. there the Apoſtle ſpeaking of
the Heathens; he doth rebuke them; For what? It was
for this, <hi>becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as
God, neither were thankfull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> now this is ſpoken eſpecially of the
worſhip of God: for he ſaith afterwards <hi>ver. 23. that they changed
the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
man &amp;c.</hi> So that it's ſpoken of the worſhip of God; that
<hi>they glorified not God as God.</hi> That is then to ſanctifie Gods
Name, <hi>to glorifie God as God:</hi> and therefore our Saviovr in the 4.
of <hi>John</hi> when he ſpake to the woman of Samaria, he tels her
<hi>that God is a Spirit, and muſt be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth,</hi> that is
we muſt labour to ſuite, our worſhip to what there is in God;
that our worſhip may be proportionable in ſome meaſure even
to the nature of God himſelfe; And therefore God being a
Spirit, his worſhip muſt be a Divine worſhip. I have read of
ſome of the Heathens that did worſhip the Sun for a God, and
they would offer to the Sunne ſomwhat ſutable; therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they did ſo admire at the ſwiftneſs of the motion of the
Sunne, they would not offer a ſnaile to the ſunne, but a flying
horſe, a horſe with wings; now a horſe is one of the ſwifteſt
creatures, and the ſtrongeſt creature to continue in motion for
a long time together; and they added wings to the horſe, and
they thought that ſutable to be a ſacrifice for the Sunne. So
when we come to worſhip God, that is, to ſanctifie his Name,
we muſt behave our ſelves ſo as to give him the glory that is fit
for a God to have. As now in thoſe three particulars which I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:116352:34"/>
opened to you when I ſhewed you wherein wee draw nigh to
God. This was one, I tould you that when we come to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God, we come to tender up ſome preſent to God, now then
we muſt tender up ſuch a preſent as is ſutable to Gods excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
If a man ſhould come to a poor man to give a preſent, If it
were not worth twelve pence, yet it may be taken well; but
if you were to tender up a preſent to a Prince, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
an Emperour, then you muſt tender a preſent that is
fit for the qualitie of the perſon. Therefore <hi>Mal</hi> 1. 8. When
the Lord rebukes them for their Sacrifices that they were ſuch
poore things: Go ſaith God <hi>and tender up this to your governour</hi>
and ſee whether he wil accept of it or no. So certainly that
which may be accepted of by a mean man, would be accounted
a ſcorne, if you ſhould tender it up to a Prince or an Emperour.
Now when we are to worſhip God we muſt conſider that we
are to tender up our ſervice to God, who is the great King of
Kings, and Lord of Lords. But you wil ſay, is it poſſible for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
creature when it comes to tender up it's worſhip to God, to
tender up that which is fit for a God to have? This may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be a diſcouragement unto prayer or any other duty of
worſhip, then an incouragement.</p>
               <p>To that I Anſwer thus, though we be very poore and mean,
yet it doth not hinder but we may tender up that to God which
God wil acknowledge to be ſuitable to his infinite excelencie, as</p>
               <p>Firſt, if we tender up to God all that we have. Though we
be never ſo poore and mean, yet if God hath the ſtrength of
our ſoules, God accepts it. For we are to know that God doth
not ſtand in need of what we have, or of what we do; but that
we might ſhew our reſpect to him: Therefore if we give all that
we have God accepts it. As a child if it puts forth all it's
ſtrength that it hath to do a buſines which the father bids him,
whether the buſines be done or no, the father looks upon it and
accepts it as ſutable to the childs ſtrength; and it ſhewes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
that the child hath to his father. And as it is ſtoried of
an Emperour that when a poore man had nothing to offer him
but a little water that he had taken up with his hand, he have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing elſe the Emperour accepts of it. So that's that
which God looks for, that the Creature ſhould lift him above
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:116352:35"/>
all. If therfore when thou comeſt to worſhip God, God hath
more of thy heart then ever any creature in the world had, God
accepts of that, and that you muſt look unto; Can you
ſay ſo, when you go to Worſhip God, Lord it is true there is
much weakneſs in my ſpirit, but thou that knoweſt al things
knoweſt, that thou haſt more of my heart then ever any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the World had. This is ſutable to God: God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
this (in the Covenant of grace) to be a preſent ſutable to
himſelf. As in the Law, when they offered to the building of
the Temple, every one could not offer gold and ſilver and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ſtones, but ſome came and offered Badgers-skins, and
ſome women did ſpin and offered Coats-hair to the building
of the Temple, and ſo God accepted of that being the moſt they
could do.</p>
               <p>2 In the Second place, When we do not only offer unto God
the moſt we can, but when we adde to this the grief of our
Souls that we can do no more, when the Soul ſhall ſtrive to the
uttermoſt it can, and when it hath done all, ſaith, <hi>I am an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Servant,</hi> Oh that I could do more! This is ſuitable to
God.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdly, The people of God though they be weak, yet
the weakeſt Servant of God is able to offer up to God ſomewhat
that is ſuitable to the infinite Majeſty of God, upon this Third
Ground, becauſe that there is a kind of impreſſion of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitnes
in thoſe ſervices that a gracious heart doth tender unto
God, and therefore ſuitable unto God.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, God is an Infinite Glorious God? Be it ſo;
He is Infinite that's certain but the duty of Worſhip that a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
heart tenders unto God, it hath an impreſſion of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitneſſe
upon it. How is that? If that can be made out, then
indeed we may be incouraged to worſhip God. Thus, That
that a gracious heart tenders up to God hath an impreſſion of
his Infinitneſſe in this regard, becauſe as God hath no limits of
his Being, ſo a gracious heart when it comes to worſhip God
will not propound any limits or bounds, but in the deſires of it
would fain be inlarged infinitly if it could. If it were poſſible
for a creature to be inlarged to God infinitly it would be. Here
lies I conceive the maine difference betweene the moſt glorious
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:116352:35"/>
Hypocrite in the world, and one that hath true Grace, yea that
hath but the leaſt degree of Grace: The moſt glorious Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
in the world, who it may be for the outward act doth
more then one that hath true Grace, yet ſuch a one doth limit
himſelf, he doth great things, but he doth it ſo, as he limits
himſelf, that is, ſo much as may ſerve for ſuch and ſuch ends of
his, ſo much as may ſerve his turn, either to ſatisfie his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
or to get credit and eſteeme, to be accounted eminent in
ſuch a way, ſo much he doth do, but his duty is alwaies limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
within ſuch bounds and if he could conceive that he
might go to heaven, and that he might have as much credit
and honor, and as much peace of conſcience with doing leſſe,
he would do leſſe. But now one that hath Grace, though but
little though but the leaſt dram of Grace, he goes farther: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſaith he, though through the little Grace that I have, I
cannot do what another can do, yet this doth ſo inlarge my
heart, that I would have no bounds ſet in what I do for God,
but I would have it inlarged to the uttermoſt Latitude, if it were
poſſible beyond what ever yet was done for God in the world;
and the more I do, the more I do deſire to do. That's now a
kind of infinitnes that there is in the heart where Grace comes:
I ſay, Grace inlarges the heart to a kind of infinitneſſe that the
more it doth, the more it would do: there is no Hypocrite but
will have his periods, he will riſe thus, and thus, and thus high;
ordinarily you ſhall find that if he lives in ſome company there
he is high, but if he lives in other company, there he is lower;
Now there is nothing doth limit a gracious heart, but to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
it would work and work more and more for God. Here
now is a Worſhip that is ſome way ſuitable to the infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
that there is in God: Here's a kind of proportion (as
I may ſo ſpeak) even between the creature and God himſelf in
this thing, but it is the grace of God in the creature, here is the
Image of God indeed, becauſe grace doth ſo inlarge the heart
even to an infinitneſſe as it were for God. And thus you ſee in
the generall what it is to Sanctifie Gods Name, to tender up to
God that which is ſome way ſuitable to the glory of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
God.</p>
               <p>2 You know there was a Second thing, viz. That then I do
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:116352:36"/>
Sanctifie Gods Name when I come ſo to worſhip God as my
heart works, and follows after God as a God, ſo as it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeem
the ſoul of a Creature to follow the infinite Creator, and
to work after the infinite Creator: So <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal. 63. 5. My
Soul followeth hard after thee, O God, and</hi> (mark it's a very ſweet
Scripture) <hi>thy right hand upholdeth me.</hi> Thoſe whoſe hearts fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
hard after the Lord, they have the right hand of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of them: It is a mighty encouragement to put forth
the heart to the uttermoſt, becauſe when thou doeſt ſo the right
hand of God upholds thee: ſo that thy heart muſt follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
God more then it followed after any creature.</p>
               <p>3 When I come to draw nigh to God, I come to preſent my
ſelf for the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of the choiceſt of his Mercies, ſo then
I Sanctifie Gods Name when I labour to prepare and open my
heart for God as for the choiceſt Mercies that God hath to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
upon his Creature. When there is ſuch a temper of heart
that my conſcience tels me it is ſuitable to that that is fit for a
Soul to have that expects to receive the choiceſt Mercies from
God: but that we ſpake too more in the opening of our draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nigh to God Now we are to come more particularly to
this, to open the <hi>Sanctifying of Gods Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 Firſt, In what particulars the behaviour of the heart
may be diſcovered to be ſuitable to God in reſpect of Gods
greatneſſe and glory.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, What the behaviour of the heart ſhould be
as ſuitable to the ſeverall Attributes of God.</p>
               <p>It will coſt us ſome time to open the particular things in the
behaviour of the heart as in reference to the Greatneſſe and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie
of God, conſidered more generally; as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. 1.
<hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 14.
<hi>Curſed be the deceiver which hath in his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ock a male, and voweth, and
ſacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing.</hi> Why? <hi>for I am a great King
ſaith the Lord,</hi> and therefore curſed is he that doth not offer a
Sacrifice ſuitable to my Greatneſſe? And in 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 2. 5. we find
that <hi>Solomon</hi> when he was preparing for the Temple, he would
build a great Temple, <hi>why?</hi> becauſe God was a great God that
he would build it too: So that the Worſhip of God muſt be
ſome great thing becauſe the Lord is a great God, and it muſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:116352:36"/>
be ſuitable to his greatneſſe. Now if you ask me in what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
doth the behaviour of the Soul conſiſt that is very ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the greatneſſe of God in the generall? there are many
things in this:</p>
               <p>1 The Firſt is, You muſt be carefull to bring a Sanctified
heart. You cannot tender up a worſhip ſuitable to his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
except you bring a Sanctified heart with you, there muſt
be holineſſe in the heart: Under the Law you know, if any one
came to offer a Sacrifice in his uncleanneſſe, he muſt be cut off:
and ſo it muſt be here, we muſt look to it that we offer not to
God in our uncleanneſſe: <hi>Waſh you, and make you clean.</hi> in Iſa. 1.
and then <hi>come let us reaſon together:</hi> There is no comming to God
without waſhing and making clean: in <hi>Pſal 93. 5. Holineſſe
becometh thine houſe O Lord for ever:</hi> Holineſſe becometh the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God for ever, we muſt look to get a Sanctified heart.
Sanctification conſiſts in thoſe two parts, <hi>Mortification,</hi> and
<hi>Vivification:</hi> there muſt be a mortifying of the luſts of the
heart: We read in the Law, that every Sacrifice was to be <hi>ſalted
with Salt;</hi> that did ſignifie the mortification of our hearts when
we come to offer up our ſelves as a Sacrifice to God the Salt
did eat out the raw humors, and kept the fleſh from putrifying;
ſo doth the Grace of God in mortifying our Luſts: In <hi>Heb</hi> 9. 14.
you have a notable ſcripture for the clen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng of our hearts when
we come to offer any ſervice to God, <hi>How much more ſhall the
blood of Chriſt who through the eternall Spirit offered himſelf without
ſpot to God, purge your Conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living
God:</hi> So that you cannot ſerve the living God untill your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
be purged from dead works: And how comes your
conſciences to be purged from dead works? It is <hi>through the
blood of Chriſt, who through the eternall Spirit offered himſelf without
ſpot to God,</hi> he muſt purge your conſciences. So that here's the
way of Sanctifying Gods Name by applying of Jeſus Chriſt
who was offered to God without ſpot that our conſciences
might be purged from dead works, that we might be purged
from that naturall filthineſſe and uncleanneſſe in which we all
were; for the whole world doth lie in filth, as a carrion doth
lie in his ſlyme. Now if we would worſhip God ſo as to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
him, we muſt apply Chriſt to our Souls, and get our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:116352:37"/>
purged from dead works, and to have the Spirit of
Chriſt in us to quicken up our hearts in the waies of holineſſe;
to have the image of eſus Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>in us, whereby we may be
holy according to our proportion even as he himſelf is holy,
this is the Sanctifying of the heart There muſt be an habituall
Sanctification and an actuall Sanctification of the heart: An
Habituall, that is that the heart muſt be changed through the
work of Regeneration there muſt be a Regeneration in the
heart, there muſt be Divine principles of the Graces of the
Spirit of God in the heart.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, May not an unregenerate man
Pray?</p>
               <p>To that I Anſwer;</p>
               <p>It is true, it is his duty to pray, <hi>Poure forth thy wrath upon
the Heathen, and upon the families that call not upon thy Name:</hi>
But it's as true, that they cannot Sanctifie Gods Name in
doing of it: But if we would Sanctifie Gods Name in it there
muſt be an Habitual holineſſe in the heart, for every thing doth
act according to its principles, in nature it is ſo; and ſo doth
the heart when it comes to Worſhip God, it doth act according
to the principles that it hath.</p>
               <p>And then there muſt not only be Habitual Sanctification, but
Actual Sanctification likewiſe, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 10, 11. there you
ſee what a doe there was to fit them for the hearing of the Law,
becauſe <hi>God was to come among them:</hi> God is to come among us,
and we are to come to God when we are to performe holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
therefore it is not enough to have Grace, but there muſt
be an improving of Grace, there muſt be an acting of Grace not
only when you come to receive the Sacrament, to think that
then there muſt be an acting of Grace but every time you pray
and hear there muſt be an acting of Grace; A purging out of
your corruptions and acting of Grace. So that one cannot
Sanctifie Gods Name in holy duties unleſſe he come thus far, to
be able to ſay, Lord, thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt,
there is nothing that thou doeſt reveale to be contrary to thy
will, but my heart is againſt it, that's the leaſt; thou canſt not
have any peace of conſcience in drawing nigh to God, untill
thou come thus far, to have thy heart to work thus againſt ſin,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:116352:37"/>
and to be ſet upon every good that God reveals to be his mind.
You know when a man of quallity comes to your houſe what a
deale of ſtir there is, not onely in ſweeping, but in making all
things as clean and tite and ſhining as poſſibly can be: Thus
it ſhould be when thou comeſt to God.</p>
               <p>And the Reaſon why there muſt be this Sanctifying of the
heart is.</p>
               <p>1 Firſt, Becauſe the Lord doth firſt accept of the perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he doth accept o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Action: Men indeed do accept of the
perſons of men becauſe they do good actions but God accepts
of the actions of men becauſe their perſons are good If indeed
we ſee a man do good, then we love him and accept of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the man, but God firſt will accept of the perſon before
the Action: As the Lord accepted of <hi>Abe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> firſt, and then he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
his offering: So you muſt look to that, to have your
perſons firſt accepted of God before any duty can be accepted:
You think though you be wicked and ſinfull, yet if you amend
your life God will accept of you, you go that way to work;
but certainly that is the wrong way; you muſt firſt look after
meanes of acceptation of your perſons, which is through the
Righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and through the Sanctification
of his Spirit, whereby you come to have his Image and life, and
ſo are accepted, and then all that proceeds from you comes to
be accepted. There is not any action which comes from you
that comes to be accepted to eternall life, untill your perſons be
accepted before God, and therefore there muſt be a Sanctifying
of the heart before there can be a Sanctifying the Name of God
in the duties of his Worſhip: Therefore when you come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
any duties of Gods Worſhip you ſhould co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>der this, Is
my heart Sanctified? I muſt Sanctifie Gods Name, and how can
I do that, except my heart be Sanctified?</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, Our hearts muſt be Sanctified becauſe the Lord
doth look more to the principle from whence a thing comes,
then at the thing it ſelf. As indeed were our hearts right as
they ſhould then all the good things that come to us, we would
not ſo much regard what the things are, that we do injoy from
God, as what the principle is from whence they come, that
is, Whether what we do injoy from God is from the love of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:116352:38"/>
God in Jeſus Chriſt or no? Whether it be from the generall
Bounty and Patience of God, or from the ſpeciall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oue of God
in Jeſus Chriſt? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur hearts would regard that mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> if we were
Spirituall: now then look as a godly man is not ſatisfied with
injoying any good thing from God except he knows it comes
from a principle of love to him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſus Chriſt; So God is not
pleaſed with any thing that comes from us, except he knows
that it comes from a principle of Love, Grace, and Holineſſe in
our hearts.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdly, According as the heart is, ſo will the Service
be; Certainly if the heart be unclean the duty will be unclean;
perhaps the words may be fine and brave, but if there be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
heart, the duty will be unclean: As it is with a man that
hath the Plague, ſuppoſe he makes a brave Oration, yet his
breath is infectious: ſo it is in our Services with God: If ſo
be that our hearts within us have the plague, then certainly
the breath that comes from us, all our duties will be unclean,
and therefore that is the firſt thing that we are to look for in
the Sanctifying Gods Name in holy duties: Look to have thy
heart Sanctified, and conſider from what principle it comes tis
for want of this that thouſands of our duties are caſt aſide and
God never doth regard them: But this is the firſt Particular,
there is many more to ſpeak of.</p>

the Lord upon his Throne: It is an excellent thing when all

him, have their eyes darted up to heaven and behold the Lord
God ſitting in his Glory upon his Throne: So you ſhall find
in <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. the 24 Elders that Worſhipped God, they ſaw him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Throne in his Glory and ſo they Worſhipped him they
Worſhipped God to purpoſe indeed when they ſaw the Lord in
that Majeſtie as he was; we ſhould at all times have high
thoughts of God: take heed of having low thoughts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of the Infinite Majeſtie of God at any time, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
when thou art to Worſhip the great God, then look
upon the Lord in that infinite diſtance that there is between
him and thy ſelf, yea that infinite diſtance that there is between
him and all Creatures in the world, look upon the Lord as
lifted up in Glory, not only above all Creatures, but above all
excellencies that all Angels and men, in heaven and earth are
able to imagine: Look upon the Lord as having all excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
in himſelf, joyned in one, and that immutably; look
upon him as the fountain of all excellencie, good, and glory
that all Creatures in the world have. And look upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

every time thou comeſt to Worſhip him, as that God whom
Angels do adore and before whom the Devils are forced to

               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:116352:39"/>
The great Reaſon why people come and Worſhip God in
a ſlight way; it is becauſe that they do not ſee God in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
'tis a great Mercy for God to give unto us a ſight of himſelf,
a ſight of his glory here in this world while we are Worſhiping
of him, this would keep our eyes and our thoughts from wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,
if we had a ſight of the glory of God, and had high
thoughts of God. What's the reaſon why we wander ſo as we
do? but meerly becauſe we ſee not God as now ſuppoſe you
were in your houſe, and looking after every feather that were
flying up and down if you ſhould hear that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his glory, and have high thoughts of him, and this is that
whereby we are to Sanctifie Gods Name when we come before
him in holy duties, And that is the Second thing: Firſt a
Sanctified heart and then high thoughts of God.</p>
               <p>3. A Third thing is, High-ends, Raiſed-ends in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
of God: <hi>Prov. 15. 24. The way of life is above to the
wife:</hi> it is on high in this reſpect, when he Worſhips God his
heart is lifted up on high: there is a holy raiſing of the heart
which is well pleaſing to God: Our hearts ſhould be on high
in regard of the high ends that we aime at in holy duties: <hi>Lift
up thy prayer</hi> ſaith <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to the Prophet in another caſe: ſo I
may ſay lift up thy Soul when thou comeſt to Worſhip God in
regard of the high ends that we aimeſt at: when we are Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
God we ſhould have our hearts above al creatures, and
above ourſelves. Let not our hearts then be groveling upon
the ground, mingled with baſe and droſſie things, when we
come to Worſhip the Lord indeed it is fit that we ſhould have
our hearts low (as we ſhall ſhew hereafter) in regard of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but not low in regard of any baſeneſſe of Spirit to mix
with any baſe and low ends: Now there are low and baſe ends
in Worſhipping of God, As.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We muſt take heed we do not ſubject the Worſhip of
God unto our luſts, that is a curſed thing, thou art far from
Sanctifying Gods Name in Worſhipping of him that ſhalt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
his Worſhip to thy baſe Luſts, this is an abominable and a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:116352:39"/>
curſed thing indeed: You will ſay, Who doth thus? who is
the man or where is he that will do this ſubject the Worſhip of
God to his baſe luſts! To that I Anſwer, Whoſoever doth
make uſe of any duty of Worſhip, as Prayer, Hearing the
Word, or what ever it be, to cloak any kind of wickedneſſe,
whoſoever is conſcious to himſelf of any kind of ſecret wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and yet ſhall think to cover it by the performance of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and ſhall reaſon in this manner, who will think me to be
guilty of ſuch a vile thing, when I pray ſo as I do, and am ſo
carefull to hear the Word? and I hope I ſhall cover ſome wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe
this way: If there be any in this place whoſe conſcience
tels them that they ſubiect the Worſhip of God to ſuch a baſe
end as this is the Lord rebuke them this day, and ſpeak to their
hearts, If I knew any, I would ſet mine eyes upon them and
ſay as the Apoſtle to <hi>Simon Magus, I perceive that thou art in the
gall of bitterneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that did ſeek to draw the Deputy from the Faith, <hi>O thou child
of the Devil, and full of all ſubtilty,</hi> to damne and undo thy ſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally,
that ſeekeſt to cloak any wicked way by any duty of
Gods Worſhip; Is it a great evill for a man or woman to make
uſe of any of Gods creatures to be ſerviceable to their luſts as
meat and drink &amp;c. What a damnable thing is it then to make
uſe of any duty of Gods Worſhip ſometimes extraordinary
worſhip, as Faſting and Prayer, to be a cloak to cover their
wickedneſse! Thou art ſo far from Sanctifying Gods Name,
that thou polluteſt Gods Name: thou doeſt what in thee lies
for to caſt even dirt in the face of God himſelf that doeſt ſo.</p>
               <p>The Second Baſe end, is to ſubject the duties of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to the praiſe of men, as to performe duties of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
for the eſteem of men, and becauſe we ſhall be well thought

deſireable thing to have a good eſteem from thoſe that are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
but take heed that you do not ſubject the duties of Gods
Worſhip to this. Indeed it may be an incouragement to you, as
<hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſal. 52. 9. This is good before thy Saints: David</hi> did
incourage himſelf to praiſe God, becauſe it was good before
Gods Saints; and I confeſse it may be an incouragement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:116352:40"/>
holy duties are good before Gods Saints: but take heed
that this be not thy higheſt end that thou aimeſt at, and that
which carries thee on in the work, meerly to get the praiſe of
men, and that they ſhall think that thou haſt good gifts and
parts, and therefore thou art inlarged in that regard take
heed of that, know that now thou doeſt not Worſhip God, but
thou Worſhippeſt men, thou doeſt make the praiſe of men to be
thy God, for whatſoever thou doeſt lift up in the higheſt place,
that's thy God, whatſoever it be: therefore if thou lifteſt up
the praiſe of men and makeſt that thy end, thou makeſt that
thy God, and ſo thou art a worſhipper of men, but not a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper
of God</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Take heed of making <hi>Self</hi> thy end there are ſome
that are not ſo baſe &amp; low in their hearts, as to make the praiſe
of men their end, but they aime and look at themſelves, that is,
they aime at their own peace, and ſatisfying their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
in the performance of duties; now though it's true, when
we performe duties of Gods Worſhip, we may expect to receive
ſome good to our ſelves, and we may be incouraged to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by the expectation of good to our ſelves; yet we muſt look
higher, we muſt look at the honour and praiſe of God, that the
name of the bleſſed God may be honoured: Now I am going to
Prayer, Oh that I may pray ſo as I may lift up Gods Name: I
am going to Hear, Oh that I may hear ſo, as God may be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by my hearing: tis this that carries me on to hearing the
Word, and makes me riſe readily and to go forth chearfully: I
hope that God may have ſome honour by my hearing this day,
&amp; God knows that this is the thing that I aim at I do not come
for company nor to be ſeen of men, neither do I come meerly
to ſatisfie mine own Conſcience: Others go and hear ſuch
Truths of God as do good to their Souls, and if I ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
them meerly for mine own eaſe, my Conſcience would not
let me be quiet howſoever there are many whoſe Conſciences
will be quiet enough; though they loſe am opportunity in the
Worſhip of God; but yet there are others whoſe Conſciences
cannot do ſo their Conſciences would tell them when they are
lying and turning themſelves upon their beds, how do you
know but that God had ſome thing to ſpeak to thy heart this

morning, that may never be ſpoken to thy heart at any other
time? therefore they cannot be at quiet except they attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God in the duties of his Worſhip: but ſtill this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
meerly to ſatisfie Conſcience; thy main end it muſt be
that thou mayeſt this day know ſome part of the mind of God,
that God may ſpeak to thy heart, that ſo thou mayeſt be fitted
to honour the Name of God that thou mayeſt be inabled to live
to his honor the week following ſo much the better. As in this

of it themſelves: now they were very carefull in thoſe offerings
that they ſhould partake of themſelves to offer fat beaſts; you
do not ſee that the Holy Ghoſt takes any notice of fat beaſts in
their burnt-offerings. Now the Note from hence is this, That
in thoſe things where men are intereſted themſelves, they will
be very carefull to have the beſt things. But now the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
the fat beaſts of their peace-offerings: ſaith God, you
were very carefull to offer fat beaſts in your peace-offerings
where you may feed your ſelves, but for thoſe offerings wherein
I have all, there you are not ſo carefull, and therefore I regard
them not. The Third Scripture is in <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. 5. there they did
keep many daies in ſeeking of God, (it is an obſervable Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for theſe times,) <hi>Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the
Prieſts ſaying, When ye faſted and mourned in the fifth and ſeventh
month, even thoſe ſeventy years, did ye at all faſt unto me? even unto
me?</hi> Mark the phraſe you faſted in the fifth and ſeventh
month, and for ſeventy years together, but ſaith the Lord, Did
you at all faſt unto me? and then mark how it is doubled, <hi>To
me? even unto me?</hi> Noting that when we faſt or pray, or do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing in the Worſhip of God, we ſhould be ſure to aime at
God more then our ſelves, that God may not ſay of us another
day, <hi>Do you do it to me, even to me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may ask me this Queſtion, How may I know that I
am acted by <hi>ſelf</hi> ends in holy duties? for it is a hard thing for
one to know ones own heart, when one is acted by principles of
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and when we aime at God in holy duties. Now for that I
will give you theſe notes to try whither you be acted from your
ſelves or no.</p>
               <p>The Firſt is this, If a man loves holy duties (though he finde
no preſent good comes in by them) becauſe they are ſuch things
as God requirs, and therefore though I get nothing by them,
yet this is enough to carry me on, and to carry me on readily
and willingly in the worſhip of God: thoſe that can delight
in Gods worſhip, even at that time, though they find nothing
coming into themſelves. But now when we find not that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in that we do deſire, we begin to be weary of worſhip;
and ſay, <hi>Why have we faſted, and thou ſeeſt it not?</hi> This
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:116352:41"/>
is an Argument that thou art acted by <hi>Self</hi> rather then by
God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To know whether we be acted by <hi>ſelf</hi> ends, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by <hi>high</hi> ends for God: Thoſe men that can rejoyce in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that are able to honour God in holy duties more then
themſelves, they may have a good evidence to their own Souls,
that when they worſhip God, they are acted by higher
ends then <hi>ſelf,</hi> but now, ſuch as are ſtreightned themſelves, and
when they ſee others more inlarged in the worſhip of God, they
rather envy them, are greiv'd and troubled; know that <hi>Self</hi> is
a great ingredient in thoſe duties that thou doeſt performe: if
thy heart were raiſed high to God, though thou canſt not thy
ſelf be inlarged in holy duties, yet thy ſoul would be glad that
any others are, though I have a wretched and vile heart of my
own, yet bleſſed be God that there are any others that can wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God better then I can.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A man that is acted by <hi>ſelf</hi> in holy duties, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
holy duties but little, ſave in time of extremity, in time of
fear, or of ſickneſſe, or in dangers. But now, one that hath
high ends in holy duties, makes the duties of Gods worſhip to
be the joy of his ſoul in the middeſt of his proſperity, and that is
an evident ſign that thou art not acted by ſelf ends but by high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ends Canſt thou in the middeſt of thy abundance ſay, Lord,
thou giveſt me all conveniencies in this world and all outward
things that I want but Lord this is that which is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Soul, this is that which makes my life comfortable, even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with thy ſelf, in the duties of thy worſhip, that I have
free acceſſe unto the Throne of thy Grace to worſhip thee the
Lord, and there meet with thee when I am in the performance
of holy duties. O Lord, thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt
that this is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hing that makes my life comfortable; It is not
that I have a Table furniſhed with variety of diſhes, and that I
can have liberty of time to go into company, and ſpend accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

appeale to God, ſurely when he worſhips God, he is acted by

ſuch a conſtant way, as except <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> we do not find
mention of the conſtancy of any in the worſhipping of God as
we do of <hi>Iſaacs;</hi> for it is ſaid, that he walked but into the fields
in the evening as he was wont to do, to Meditate, and to Pray;
and therefore God is called, <hi>The fear of</hi> Iſaac. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 7. is
a notable Scripture for this drawing nigh to God with fear:
<hi>God is greatly to be feared in the aſſembly of the Saints, and to be had in
reverence of all them that are about him:</hi> God is to be had in
reverence of all them that are about him, but in the aſſembly

for the mountain did burn with fire, that ye came neer unto me, even all
the heads of your tribes, and your elders, And ye ſaid, Behold the Lord
our God hath ſhewed us his glory and his greatneſſe, and we have heard
his voice out of the middeſt of the fire: we have ſeen this day, that God
doth talk with man, and he liveth, now therefore why ſhould we die?
for this great fire will conſume us: If we hear the voice of the Lord our
God any more, then we ſhall die.</hi> See with what a terrour they
were ſtruck at the apprehenſion of Gods appearance; you
would think ſurely theſe men did fear God much, but mark in
verſ. 29. <hi>O that there were ſuch a heart in them that they would fear me.</hi>
Why, did they not fear the Lord? Were they not ſtruck with
ſuch fear that they thought they ſhould die? they ſaw his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
ſo terrible that they were afraid they ſhould die and yet,
<hi>O that there were ſuch a heart in them that they would fear me!</hi> So that
it appears by this, that one may be ſtruck with much terrour in
the apprehenſion of Gods preſence, and yet have no true fear of
the Name of God: So ſome of you it may be in time of thunder
or danger, are filled with terrour; but yet may it not be ſaid
preſently after, <hi>O that there were the fear of God in the heart of this
man or woman, this youth or maid:</hi> They are terrified ſometimes,
but yet there is not a filiall and reverential fear of God in them.
And I find in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. (where you have the ſtory of Gods
appearing in that moſt terrible manner unto the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi>
by Fire, by thunder, and in a mighty Wind) the Prophet was
not ſo ſtruck with fear of Gods preſence when he did appear in
the mighty wind or earthquake or fire, as when God did appear
in the <hi>ſmall ſtill voice,</hi> therefore in verſ 13. it is ſaid, <hi>And it was ſo
when</hi> Elijah <hi>heard it:</hi> that is, the ſoft voice, after the fire and
earthquake, and the mighty wind) <hi>that he wrapped his face in his
mantle and went out and ſtood in the entring in of the Cave, and behold
there came a voice unto him and ſaid, What doeſt thou here</hi> Elijah?
Then his heart was more ſtruck with fear where was moſt of
Gods preſence, (though it was in a ſoft voice) then when the
fire and earthquake did appear: It is a good ſign of a gracious
fear when the ſoul can be ſtruck with more fear from the word,
and from the ſight of God in injoying of communion with him
in his Worſhip, then when God appears in the moſt terrible
way of his works; or when there is terrour in a mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:116352:43"/>
through fear of hell, when God appears as though he
would ſend him down preſently to hell, though God expects
to be feared then, but when the Soul in injoying communion
with God in holy duties, and the more communion he hath
with God, the more is he ſtruck with reverence and the fear of
God, this is a ſign of Sanctified fear, and then doth the heart
Sanctifie the Name of God indeed when it is ſo poſſeſſed with
fear in the duties of worſhip. Now this fear of God ſhould be
indeed in the Soul, and expreſſed outwardly when you are in
the aſſembly, by ſuch reverent carriage in prayer, as if a heathen
ſhould come in he may ſee Gods Name Sanctified, and may ſay,
How great is this God that this people do worſhip! And in your
Families, a reverant carriage, not lying all a long in prayer,
upon the elbows ſleeping, but carrying your ſelves ſo that if
a heathen ſhould come into your families, they may ſay, O how
great is this God that this people do worſhip! And likewiſe
this fear it muſt be an abiding fear, not only at that inſtant
when you are worſhipping of God, or ſpeaking of any of Gods
Titles and Names, but a fear that muſt abide upon your hearts
after duty is over; that is, after you are come out from your
Cloſets one may perceive the fear of God upon you, and ſo
walking all the day long in the fear of God, as it becomes thoſe
that have been ſolemnly ſetting themſelves to worſhip him:
Now this fear and reverence is contrary to the ſlightneſſe, vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the boldneſſe and preſumptuouſneſſe that there is in the
hearts of men and women when they are Worſhipping of
God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The duties of Gods worſhip muſt be full of ſtrength,
for they are not ſuitable to God elſe, becauſe God is a God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
in power and glory himſelf, therefore God cannot indure
vain Worſhipping. In <hi>Iſa. 1. 13. I hate vain oblations:</hi> Vanity
of Spirit in Worſhipping of God is very hatefull to God, it
doth defile the Name of God. God is diſhonoured by the vanity
of mens Spirits. Now this ſtrength is Three fold:</p>
               <p>1 Firſt, The ſtrength of Intention.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, The ſtrength of Affection.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdly, The ſtrength of all the Faculties of the Soul,
and the ſtrength of Body too, as much as we are able ſhould be
put forth in the Worſhipping of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:116352:43"/>
1 Firſt the ſtrength of Intention. We muſt intend our work
as if it were for our lives: If ever we were ſeriouſly Intentive or
Attentive about any thing, it muſt be when we are worſhipping
of the Name of God. When you are coming to Pray, be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
about it. You ſhall ſee ſome when they are going in the
ſtreet when they have much intention about their buſineſſe,
their friends meet them, and they never mind them; one may
perceive as they are going, that they are mightily intent about
their buſineſſe. My Brethren, look upon every duty of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
as a great thing which you muſt be intent in your thoughts
about, and not give way to the wandring of your thoughts. I
have read of one Martyr, that when he was to die, and the fire
a kindling, ſaith an Officer, What will not you ſpeak when
you ſee the fire kindling? ſaith he, I am ſpeaking to God:
that is, he was praying, and he minded not at all what they
were doing. O what little things do take our thoughts away
from holy duties! When every toye, every feather, every light
matter cals them off; Is this to Sanctifie Gods Name? Would
not we account it a diſhonourable thing, if we were talking to
one about ſerious buſineſſe, and when we are talking, every one
that comes by he ſhould be looking after them, and turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
to talk with them? If a Superiour be talking with you, he
doth expect that you ſhould mind what he ſaith. But when
God is ſpeaking to you, and you are ſpeaking to God, every
vain thought that comes by, you are turning aſide too: as if it
were a greater thing to talk to vain thoughts and temptations,
then to the great &amp; glorious God. Therfore now that is the very
time that the Devil chuſes for to bring temptations when we
are in holy duties, for the Devil knows then he doth two works
at once: he doth diſturb us in our duties and call off our hearts
to that that is wicked, and doth aggravate our ſin exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
It may be thou wilt not dare to commit that ſin that the
temptation doth turn thy thoughts upon, yea but the Devil
hath ſpoyled the duty by it. The Lord doth expect that there
ſhould be ſtrength of Intention when thou art upon the duty:
and there is no time to parlie with temptations now, what ever
thoughts come in. The truth is, though they be good thoughts
that ſhould come into thy mind, and that time that thou art
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:116352:44"/>
Praying, yet if they be not pertinent to the duty thou muſt caſt
them away as the temptation of the Devil.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, Can any thing that is good come from the
Devil? Certainly that that is materially good, and coming
unſeaſonably, may be from the Devil; the Devil may take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by what is in it ſelf materially good, and bring in that
in an unſeaſonable time, and ſo he may turn it to evil: As now
when thou art hearing the Word, it may be the Devil thinks he
cannot prevaile to cauſe thee to have thy heart running about
uncleanneſſe; yea, but ſaith the Devil, If I can inject good
thoughts, I will put into their minds ſome place of Scripture
that is no way pertinent to this, only to divert them: The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
gets much by this; therefore look to it, and know that God
expects the ſtrength of thy Spirit in duty: that is, ſtrong inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
thou art a worſhipping of God, and therefore thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
need be intent about what thou art a doing. Indeed ſome-times
before you are aware, evil thoughts will come into your
minds as when a man is keeping of a door, and there is a croud
of people without that would come in, perhaps the man doth
open the door for ſome Gentleman that he hears is at the door,
but when he opens it for one that is to come in, forty others wil
crowd in: and ſo it is many times with the Soul, that when it
opens the door for ſome good thought, a great many evill
thoughts will crowd in: thoſe people might come in if they
would ſtay their time, but they ſhould not now come in. So
about worldly buſineſſes that are not in themſelves unlawfull,
if they will ſtay the time they may come in; but they muſt be
bar'd out now at this time. There is required ſtrength of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly ſtrength of Affection is required alſo: That is,
the affections muſt work mightily after God ſtriving with God
in prayer: If ever thou hadeſt a heart inflam'd in any thing, it
ſhould be when thou art praying or attending upon the Word;
as the Heathens that worſhipped the Sun ſometimes I have told
you that they would not have a Snail, but a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ying Horſe, they
would offer that that was ſwift ſo when we come to the living
God, we muſt have living affections, our affections boyling;
and that will be the way to cure vain thoughts; as the flies will
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:116352:44"/>
not come to the hony if it be boyling hot, but when it is cold:
So if the heart be boyling hot, and the affections a working,
it will keep out vain thoughts and temptations: It is a ſign of
the breath of life when it is warm, but artificiall breath you
know it is cold; as now, the breath that comes out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that is warm, but the breath that comes out of a pair of bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
that is cold: So the breath of many people in prayer, it
is diſcovered to be but artificiall breath, becauſe it is ſo cold but
if there were ſpirituall life then it would be warm. There muſt
be ſtrength of Affection.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdly, There muſt be likewiſe the ſtrength of all the
Faculties: We ſhould ſtir up what ever we are or have, or can
do to work in prayer, then the bent of mind, and conſcience,
and will, and affection; yea, and the body ſhould be put to it
too, and thoſe that worſhip God to purpoſe, they ſpend their
bodies in nothing ſo much as in the worſhipping of God. It
will be a ſad thing another day when this ſhall be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
many, Thou haſt ſpent the ſtrength of thy body upon luſts,
but when dideſt thou ſpend any ſtrength of thy body about any
holy duty? What a riddle is this to moſt people, to tell them
of ſpending the ſtrength of their bodies in prayer, or hearing of
the word, or Sanctifying a Sabbath; they think the Sabbath
is a time of reſt, I confeſſe it is a time of reſt from an outward la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
but it is a time of ſpending ſtrength in a ſpirituall way;
and thoſe that ſhall worſhip God aright on the Sabbath, will
find it a ſpending of a great deal of ſtrength, and bleſſed is that
ſtrength that is ſpent in the worſhip of God rather then in the
waies of ſin, as moſt ſpend their ſtrength: If God gives thee a
heart to ſpend thy ſtrength in his worſhip, thou mayeſt think
thus, Lord, thou mighteſt have left me to have ſpent my ſtrength
in ſin, how much better is it ſpent in the worſhipping of thy
Name? There is one notable Scripture in <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 2. that ſhewes
how much ſtrength the Idolaters put forth in the worſhipping
of their Idol, they would not do it in a ſlight and vain way, but
their hearts were much in that falſe worſhip, ſaith the text, <hi>And
they ſhall ſpread them before the Sun, and the Moon, and all the hoſt of
Heaven,</hi> (mark now) <hi>whom they have loved, and whom they have
ſerved, and after whom they have walked, and when they have ſought,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:116352:45"/>
and whom they have worſhipped:</hi> All theſe are put together in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to their Idols; Oh that it could be ſaid ſo of us in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to God, when we come to worſhip him, whom we have
loved, and whom we have ſerved, and after whom we have wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and whom we have ſought, and whom we have worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
there is all theſe ſeverall expreſſions to ſhew the ſtrength
of their ſpirits in following after their Idols: And that is the
Fift thing in our Sanctifying of Gods Name.</p>
               <p>6 The Sixth is, If thou wilt Sanctifie Gods Name in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
there muſt be an humble frame of Spirit, worſhip him with
much humility of Soul: <hi>Abraham</hi> did fall upon the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, and <hi>duſt and aſhes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath begun to ſpeak
unto thee;</hi> yea, we read of Jeſus Chriſt groveling upon the earth,
and the Angels they cover their faces in the preſence of God,
and ſo ſhould we be humble when we come before the Lord:
there is nothing more abaſes the Soul of man, then the ſight of
God; and the great reaſon of the pride of all mens hearts, is
becauſe they never knew God: If thou dideſt but ſee God, thy
heart muſt needs be abaſed; and when doth the Soul ſee God
if not when it comes to worſhip him? In <hi>Job 42. I have heard
of thee by the hearing of the eare, but now my eye ſeeth thee, wherefore I
abhorre my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> Now this humility
muſt be in the ſenſe of our own meanneſs and baſeneſſe. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34. 6.
<hi>This poor man cryed to God:</hi> They are poor Souls that come into
Gods preſence that Sanctifie Gods Name moſt; even thoſe Souls
that do apprehend and are ſenſeable of their own baſeneſſe and
meanneſſe before God. This poor man cryed to God: we uſe
to ſay, Give that poor man ſome what. It doth affect the heart
of God when he ſees much poverty of Spirit: when we come
before him we muſt be ſenſeable of our Infinite dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God. Come as the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> O Lord, <hi>even doggs do

                     </gap>ums,</hi> and though I be a dogg, yet let me receive crums;
here is humility of Spirit. Now this humility of Spirit appears
in theſe things.</p>
               <p>1 Firſt admiring Gods goodneſs that we do live at this time,
and that we have liberty to come before him: we might have
been paſt praying and worſhipping of God: think thus, What
a Mercy is it that we are not baniſhed out of Gods preſence that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:116352:45"/>
the Lord hath not ſpurnd us out of his ſight as filth, and caſt us
out as an everlaſting abhorring, while others have bin praying
we might have bin yelling under the wrath of the eternal God:
Come with this apprehenſion of thy ſelf, and adorre Gods
goodneſſe, that thou art alive to pray, and alive to heare Gods
word. And that it is not only a duty, but a rich priviledge and
mercy that God will admit of thee to come into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
Againe, it is the goodneſſe of God, that he will
vouchſafe to look upon the things that are done in heaven,
then if the Lord doth humble himſelf to behold the things
that are done in heaven, then how doth the Lord humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to behold me a poor vile cative as I am in my ſelf: and yet
that God ſhould not only behold me before him, but invite me
to come into his preſence; What mercy and goodneſſe is
this!</p>
               <p>2 Our hearts muſt be taken off from the thoughts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of all excellencies in our ſelves; we muſt not come
in the pride of our hearts, becauſe we have abilities more then
others, what do all thy parts commend thee to God; thou haſt
ability in expreſſing of thy ſelf in Prayer: why do thy parts
commend thee to God? What ever is natural in any of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
is nothing to God, only that which is from his own Spirit,
and therefore thou ſhouldeſt come in thine own thoughts as
vile as if thou hadeſt no parts and abilities at all. Lay aſide all
ſuch apprehenſions of thy ſelf, for the truth is, ſome poor bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
hearted ſinner that can but ſigh out a few groans to God,
and is not able to ſpeak two or three ſentences together in a
right language, but only breath out his Soul to God, may be a
thouſand thouſand times more acceptable to God then thou
that art able to make great Orations when thou comeſt before
him.</p>
               <p>3 Thou muſt come without any righteouſneſſe of thy own,
thou muſt never come into Gods preſence, but as a poor worm;
and if there be any difference that is made between thee and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in outward reſpects, it is nothing to thee: when thou art
in the preſence of God, thou art as a baſe vile worm, though
though beeſt a Prince or Emperour.</p>
               <p>4 Thy heart muſt be taken off from what thou doeſt: If
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:116352:46"/>
thou haſt any abilities of grace yet thy heart muſt be taken off
there, there may be pride not only from ones parts, but it may
be God hath given me inlargements in Prayer, the Devil will
come in and ſeek to puffe up thy heart even becauſe of this But
thy heart muſt be taken off there, and thou muſt deny thy ſelf in
all, when thou haſt done the beſt ſervice of all, yet thou muſt
conclude, <hi>thou art an unprofitable ſervant,</hi> when thou haſt prayed
the beſt, yet riſe with ſhame, and take heed of having thy heart
puft up even through the aſſiſtance of the graces of the Spirit of
God in holy duties.</p>
               <p>5 Laſtly, Thou muſt come with a humble reſignation of thy
ſelf to God, to be content to wait upon God as long as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
to wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon God in regard of the time, and of the meaſure,
and of the manner of the Communication of himſelf, in regard
of the meanes by which he will pleaſe to communicate himſelf,
wait upon him; Let me have mercy though at the laſt hour.
This now is an humble heart in Prayer; and when we come
with ſuch a poverty of Spirit as this is, we may expect that the
Lord will accept of us, Give this poore man ſome what,
will God ſay: <hi>This poore man cryed and the Lord heard
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Seventh place, we muſt bring that which is Gods own
in Sanctifying Gods Name. I ſpake to this before in the point
of Preparation, <hi>Viz.</hi> That in Gods Worſhip we muſt give him
his own. I will only mention it here in the Sanctifying of
Gods Name in two regards:</p>
               <p>1 Firſt, To give God his owne, for the matter of
it.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, To give God his owne, that is, what comes
from the work of his owne Spirit, or elſe we do not Sanctifie
Gods Name. I will give you one text further about the matter
of it, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. if you read the Chapter, you ſhall find that
there is ten times ſaid, that <hi>they did as God had commanded</hi> Moſes:
And then in the cloſe of the Chapter, when they had done as
God had commanded in his Worſhip; the text ſaith, Moſes
<hi>bleſſed them.</hi> That people is a bleſſed people that do obſerve the
Worſhip of God as God hath commanded them. But the main
thing is, all that we do it muſt be acted by the Spirit of God; it
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:116352:46"/>
is not enough to have true ſilver and gold, but it muſt have the
right ſtamp or elſe it cannot go for current coyn. And ſo it is
not enough that the things we offer to God in his worſhip be
Gods owne, be what we have warrant for out of Gods Word,
but it muſt have the ſtamp of the Spirit of God. In the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God there be Two Queſtions that he will ask; Firſt,
<hi>Who required this at your hands?</hi> But then if you can Anſwer thus,
Thou O Lord, did'ſt require it: It is well, but then God hath
another Queſtion, <hi>Whoſe Image and Superſcription is this?</hi> If thou
canſt not give an Anſwer to that, it will be rejected too: Thou
muſt be acted by Divine principles, in all that thou doeſt, there
muſt be the ſtamp of the Spirit upon that which is tendered to
God elſe it is nothing. To open this Point fully will ask ſome
time.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Therefore I will ſhew you how we may know when
our duties are acted by our naturall parts rather then by the
Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly how we may know whether our duties be acted by
naturall Conſcience rather then by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>1 Firſt, If thou art acted by naturall parts, they will not
change thy heart: Men that do performe duties by the ſtrength
of naturall parts, they may be as large as others, and ſpeak to
the edification of others, but thoſe duties do never change their
hearts; now if thou beeſt acted by the Spirit of God, thou wilt
be changed into the very Image of his Spirit.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, If men are acted by naturall parts, they will
not carry them through difficulties and diſcouragements, but
now the Spirit of God if thou haſt acted by him, though thou
doeſt meet with never ſuch difficulties &amp; diſcouragements, thou
wilt be carried through them all.</p>
               <p>3 Thou mayeſt know it by this, wherein doeſt thou account
the excellency of a duty to conſiſt, either in thy ſelf or others?
Thou performeſt a duty, now it may be thy parts do act ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
lively, and to thy credit, and yet thy conſcience tels thee
that thy heart was ſtreightned: Now canſt thou riſe up with
joy becauſe thou haſt thy ends? At another time perhaps thy
heart is more troubled, and broken: But thou doeſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
thy ſelf ſo much, then thou art diſcouraged. And when
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:116352:47"/>
thou ſeeſt another performe a duty, if thou ſeeſt but any failing
in their expreſſions, thou pitcheſt upon that, and lookeſt upon
it as a poor thing: thou art not able to ſee an excellency in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
duties, except there be an excellency of naturall parts; but
thoſe that have the Spirit of God, they can find the Spirit of
God acting in others, though they have not ſuch naturall
parts.</p>
               <p>4 Thoſe that are acted by their naturall parts, in ſecret they
are leſſe inlarged, then they are before others a great deal. Their
parts act much before others, but what is there between God
and their own Souls?</p>
               <p>5 They that be ſo acted will not be very conſtant, you ſhall
have young ones, that begin to look towards Religion, their
parts are a little freſh, and they are mightily inlarged in holy
duties, and the thing is good for them to make uſe of their
parts; but how ordinary is it, that after a few years they are
deader and duller then they were before, and have leſſe mind to
the duties of Gods Worſhip then they had formerly? Were
this the Spirit of God, you would find as much ſavour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
in them afterwards, as there was at that time.</p>
               <p>Secondly for naturall Conſciences which ſometimes puts
men upon acting of duties, and indeed is better then meerly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
parts.</p>
               <p>1 If it be only naturall Conſcience, it puts upon duties, but
gives no ſtrength to do them: but when the Spirit of God puts
thee upon a duty, it gives thee ſome ſtrength to performe it,
ſome ſtrength whereby thou getteſt ſome communion with
God.</p>
               <p>2 If it be naturall Conſcience it puts upon the duty, but
makes not the heart glad of the duty, and to love the duty; but
if it be the Spirit of God, it makes thee to delight in it, and to
love it.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdly, If it be naturall Conſcience, thou doeſt not by
that increaſe thy communion with God, thou doeſt thy duties
as in a round, but now when the Spirit of God puts thee upon
holy duties, it is not a task done, but thou findeſt more and
more increaſe in Communion with God; thy heart more raiſed
to God, and more cloſing with the Lord, and ſo ſtill more and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:116352:47"/>
more in the courſe of thy life: I had a little converſe with God
at firſt when God began to acquaint my Soul with his waies,
but through his mercy now I find more communion with him,
and ſo thou canſt bleſſe thy ſelf in God, in that converſe that
thou haſt in communion with him, thou wouldeſt not loſe that
Communion thou haſt with God in holy duties for all the
world; others have their companions that they have their
communion withall, much good may do them, but the Lord
hath ſhewen me another manner of communion which my Soul
can have with himſelf, in which it hath ſweet ſatisfaction. And
thus you have had Seven particulars for the Sanctifying of the
Name of God in holy duties.</p>

               <p>4 <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>GAINE,<note place="margin">Stepney, Dec. 21 1645.</note> as Naturall Conſcience doth give no
ſtrength to do the duty, ſo it makes not the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be ſtrong to the Soul; that is thus, there's
no ſtrength got by the duty, they are not by
one duty prepared for another, <hi>But the way of the Lord is ſtrength
to the upright,</hi> that is, when a gracious heart is in the way of
Gods worſhip, it finds the very duty of the worſhip of God to
be ſtrength to it, and ſo it fits it for another duty.</p>
               <p>5 Further, A Naturall Conſcience limits its ſelf, and is
bounded; that is, ſo much as will ſerve the turn for its owne
peace and quiet, ſo much it will do and no more: But when
one is acted by the Spirit of God, one is inlarged without any
limits at all, not bounded to ones own peace, for the more peace
a gracious heart hath in duty, the more it is inlarged in duty:
Now a Naturall Conſcience, that puts to duty, and will act you
when you want peace, when you are in trouble and fear, but
when you are not in trouble and fear, then it puts not on the
heart to performance of duty: but the Spirit of God puts
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:116352:48"/>
on the Soule to duty, when there is moſt peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>6 A little will ſerve the turn to ſatisfie a naturall conſcience,
ſo be it they performe the duty it is enough; but one that is
acted by the Spirit of God in duty, muſt meet with much of God
or elſe he is not ſatisfied; he goes mourning in the day time if
he hath not met with much of God in the morning in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of duty. Thus you ſee there's much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Actings of naturall parts and conſcience in duty, and
the acting of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>There be only now Two things more for the <hi>Sanctifying of
Gods Name</hi> in duty, and then we are to come to ſhew how we
ſhould Sanctifie Gods Name in duty in reference to the ſeverall
Attributes of God. But Firſt for thoſe Two Heads fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>8 The Eight thing is this, When you come to performe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
duties, if you would Sanctifie Gods Name; you muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
your ſelves to God; there muſt be a reſignation of ſoul and
body, eſtate, and liberty, name, and all you are, have, or can do
unto God: This is to Sanctifie Gods Name, the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your ſelves to God. And the profeſſing of this in the
performance of duty, when you are to pray, were a very good
thing, actually to profeſſe your ſelves to be Gods, to profeſſe
that you do give up all that you are, have, or can do to God:
Lord, I am thy ſervant, take all Faculties of Soul and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of body, and improve all, lay out all, to thine own praiſe,
to the uttermoſt, to bring glory to thy great name. If every
time you came to God in prayer you did this, this were to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
your ſelves to God: I ſpake before of a Sanctified heart,
but now this is in a profeſſion of your ſelves to God; do it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
at leaſt in your own thoughts; if you do not every time
expreſſe it in words, yet in your own thoughts do it; devote
your ſelves to God every day: Of admirable uſe it would be if
every day when men and women worſhip God, either in their
cloſets or families, they did profeſſedly devote and conſecrate
themſelves to God; and ſo likewiſe, every time they came to
hear the Word, or to receive Sacraments, God would account
his name to be Sanctified in ſuch a work as this is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:116352:48"/>
9 Laſtly, That that muſt make all up, and without which
all the other is nothing; it is, that you muſt tender up all your
worſhip in the name of Jeſus Chriſt; let a man or woman wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God never ſo well, yet when they have done all, if they do
not tender it up in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, God will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
his Name to be Sanctified; thou muſt by Faith look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Jeſus Chriſt as the glorious Mediator that is come into the
world, by whom thou haſt acceſſe unto the Father: And act
thy Faith upon Chriſt, and give up thy duties into his hand, as
the hand of a Mediator to be tender'd up to the Father by him;
though thou haſt laboured what thou canſt to performe duty
as well as thou art able, yet thou muſt not think to tender it
up by thine own hand unto God; but thou muſt tender it up to
the Father by the hand of Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, and ſo
thou ſhalt Sanctifie the Name of God in holy duties. We read
in <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 13. that when <hi>Aaron</hi> was to tender up the Incenſe,
he was to <hi>put the Incenſe on the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of
the Incenſe may cover the Mercy Seat that is upon the teſtimony, that he
die not:</hi> Mark, it is as much as his life is worth, whether he doth
it, or doth it not: Now Incenſe it is in the NEW TESTAMENT
called Prayer, and ſo in the OLD TESTAMENT too, it was a
kind of emblem of Prayer: The offering up of our Prayers is
the offering up of Incenſe to God, and the Mercy Seat it was a
Type of Jeſus Chriſt. Now the Incenſe ſhould cover the Mercy
Seat; ſo our prayers muſt go up to Jeſus Chriſt, muſt be upon
him, and ſo muſt be accepted by the Father. And as we read
in <hi>Judg.</hi> 13. 20. when <hi>Manoah</hi> offered a Sacrifice, the text ſaith,
that <hi>the Angel of the Lord aſcended in the flame:</hi> This Angel of God
here was Jeſus Chriſt, as we might eaſily from this Scripture
make it out, and he aſcends up in the flame from the Altar,
Now though we do not offer ſuch kind of Sacrifices with Fire
and Incenſe as they did in the time of the Law, yet when we are
offering up of our Incenſe there muſt be a flame of Fervency and
Zeal: But that is not enough, together with the fame of the
Altar, the Angel of God Jeſus Chriſt the great Angel of the
New Covenant (for Angel ſignifies nothing but meſſenger)
the great Meſſenger that is come into the world, about that
great Errand of his, to reconcile the world to himſelf; he muſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:116352:49"/>
aſcend up in the flame, and ſo God will account his Name to be
Sanctified, the name of God is not Sanctified but through Jeſus
Chriſt. The Acting of our Faith upon Chriſt as mediator is
a ſpeciall ingredient to the Sanctifying of Gods Name in holy
duties; as you know the Scripture ſaith, that the Altar doth
Sanctifie the gift offered upon the Altar, Jeſus Chriſt is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
upon whom all our Spirituall Sacrifices are to be offered,
and this Altar doth Sanctifie the gift that is offered upon it, let
never ſo great a gift be offered upon any other Altar, it was not
accounted holy nor accepted; ſo let men by their naturall
ſtrength, or power that they have, offer up the moſt glorious
and ſpeciouſeſt Service to God. It is not accepted unleſſe it be
offered up upon the Altar Jeſus Chriſt, we have an Altar
now, (not the Communion Table) but Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is
our Altar upon whom we are to offer all our Sacrifices, and
this Altar muſt Sanctifie the gift; we can never have our gift
ſanctified, no nor Gods name ſanctified in this gift except it be
offered upon this Altar, and our Faith acted upon Jeſus Chriſt.
People little think of this, but of other things, viz. That when
we worſhip God, we ſhould worſhip him with fear, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and with humility, and with ſtrength of Intention, ſuch
kind of things every one that hath any inlightening of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
will think of at ſometime or other; but people do leaſt
think of this, which is the greateſt ingredient of all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the Sanctifying of Gods Name in holy duties: that
is, to come and tender up all to the Father in the Name of Jeſus
Chriſt: How many men and women that have been profeſſors
of Religion 20 or 30 years, and yet not acquainted with this
great myſterie of godlineſſe, to tender up all to God in the name
of his Son. This is that that upon divers occaſions I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
unto, and am willing upon every occaſion as I meet with
it to ſpeak of, becauſe it is a principall part of the great myſterie
of the Goſpel, without which all our duties are rejected of God
and caſt away. Now then put all theſe Nine things together
and ſee by them what we ought to do that we may Sanctifie the
Name of God in holy duties.</p>
               <p>But there is ſomething further to be ſpoken that may help
you to Sanctifie Gods Name in holy duties, and that is, ſeverall,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:116352:49"/>
workings of heart, ſuitable to the ſeverall Attributes of God,
for that is to Sanctifie Gods Name, to have the duty to be ſuch
as is ſome way ſuitable to ſuch a God as we are now worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.
Now then let us conſider what the Scripture ſaith of
God, and then let us ſee what ſuitable diſpoſitions we ſhould
have in us unto thoſe things that the Scripture ſaith of
God:</p>
               <p>1 Firſt, You know the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi>
in <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24. Then preſently Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That he that worſhips
him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit;</hi> that is, there muſt be a ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in our worſhip to what God is: Is God a Spirit? then all
that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and Truth: that
is thus, When I am to go to worſhip God, I muſt conſider of
him, as he is an infinite and glorious Spirit; well then, ſurely
bodily worſhip is not ſufficient for me: Though I do kneel
down in prayer, or do come and preſent my body to hear the
Word, or my body to receive the Sacrament, this is not to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God as a Spirit: If indeed that our God were as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
that were corporeall, then it were another matter, then
bodily worſhip would ſerve the turne, but God being a Spirit,
he muſt have Spirituall worſhip, therefore <hi>my ſoul and all that is
within me, magnifie his name:</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> my <hi>Soul</hi> magnifie his
name, not my lips only, but my Soul: The Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.
8. ſaith, that <hi>bodily exerciſe profits little;</hi> it is no great matter for
the body, God looks but very little at bodily exerciſe; but it is
godlineſſe that is profitable, it is the work of the Spirit; when
we come to pray, we muſt pray in the Spirit; that is, we muſt
pray with our Souls, we muſt poure forth our ſouls before God,
and when we come to hear, our hearts muſt not go after our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteouſneſſe,
we muſt ſet our hearts to what we hear, we muſt
hear with our hearts as well as with our ears, our Souls muſt be
at work in hearing of the word, when you hear it is not enough
for you to come and ſit in a Pew, and have the ſound of a mans
voice in your eares, but your Souls muſt be at work: And ſo
when you come to receive the Sacrament, your Souls muſt feed
upon Jeſus Chriſt: Bodily worſhip without Soul-worſhip is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but Soul-worſhip may be accepted without bodily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
therefore it is the Soul that God doth principally look
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:116352:50"/>
at in holy duties: If you be not able to worſhip God in your
bodies, you may worſhip him in your Souls, and God regards
that Bodily exerciſe in holy duties is little worth, ſome what it
may be worth, I confeſſe ſometime bodily exerciſe may further
the ſoul, as a reverend carriage of the body and the like, but it
is nothing in compariſon, the great work is the work of the
Soul, for God is a Spirit and muſt be worſhipped in Spirit. And
God is ſaid to be a Spirit not only in that he is not of ſo thick
a capitall ſubſtance, but it notes the ſimplicity of God, he is
without any compoſition, whatſoever is in God is God himſelf,
he is abſolutely one, there are not divers things in God; now
then, thoſe that come to worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and in Truth: that is, there muſt not be a heart and a heart,
there muſt not be a compounded heart, but you muſt bring
ſimple hearts before God, without any compoſition of drofte in
your ſelves, and of any kind of falſeneſſe, but in the ſimplicity
of your hearts you muſt come to worſhip God, and thus you
ſhall worſhip him with ſuch worſhip as is ſome way ſuitable to
him as he is a Spirit.</p>
               <p>2 Further conſider God as he is an eternall God, what ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
diſpoſition doth this require of me when I am to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God as an eternall being; it requires this only, That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy heart muſt be taken off from all temporal good things,
and ſet upon that eternall good, thou maieſt indeed deſire theſe
outward good things but in order to thy eternal good.</p>
               <p>Then further, Thou art worſhipping an eternal God: hence
then whatſoever ſin thou doeſt confeſſe although committed
20. or 40. years ago, thou muſt look upon it as if it were now
preſently committed, and be humbled as much before the Lord
as if it were now committed at this preſent, you will ſay, Why
ſo? Becauſe God is an Eternal God? Yes: For if I underſtand
Gods Eternity, I know that there is no ſucceſſion in Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
therefore the ſins that I committed in my youth, if I come
to confeſſe them, they are before God as if they were now a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in regard of time; and therefore I muſt (as much as I can)
look ſo upon them, and be humbled for them as if they were
ſins lately committed. Many people are troubled for their ſins
the very day after they commit them, but a little time wears
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:116352:50"/>
off their trouble; but if you did conſider that you had to deal
with an eternal God, then you would look upon your ſins
though a long time ſince committed as if they were now
done.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe there will be this required from the conſideration
of Gods Eternity, you muſt come with ſuch a diſpoſition of
heart as not to think much, though what you deſired be defered
and not granted in your time when you would have it. For if
there be no time that alters with God, but a thouſand years are
with God as one day, then that that we account long before its
done, it is nothing with God; and therefore we muſt have our
hearts ſo work towards God as towards an Eternall God, as
one with whom there is no alteration of time at all, with whom
there is no ſucceſſion of time. If we come to a man and ſeek a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing of him, if he doth not anſwer us preſently, we will
think that he will forget it, and other things will come into his
mind: but when we come to worſhip God, we muſt look upon
him as an Eternall being, and that time alters nothing with
him: Thus underſtanding God in a right way will much help
us in his worſhip, and ſo to Sanctifie his Name. We cannot
Sanctifie Gods Name, without knowing his Name, without
having ſerious thoughts about his Name; and getting our
hearts to work accordingly.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdly, Look upon God when you come to worſhip
him in his incomprehenſible being; that is, as a God that fils
all places, his being is as reall in the room that we are praying
in, the place that we are meeting in as it is in heaven. Now then
when we come to worſhip him, we muſt conſider that that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
glorious being ſtands before us, looks upon us, is at our
elbow; and therefore eſpecially when you worſhip in Secret
conſider this, it is good to conſider it when you are with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but eſpecially I ſay, conſider it when you are in Secret,
and know that when you are moſt private, you have one that
looks on you, and takes notice of you, who is more then if you
had ten hundred thouſand witneſſes ſtanding by you, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
upon you: For it is the Lord that ſtands by you, and ſees
your behaviour, ſees what you do in your worſhipping of him;
take heed therefore that there be nothing done by you that is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:116352:51"/>
unbeſeeming the preſence of ſuch a God as the Lord is: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that ſome of you were praying, and there were ſome god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able Miniſter ſtood neer you, it would be ſome meanes to ſtir
up your hearts to mind what you did; but now the Lord he is
not in the next room only, but in the ſame room, and ſtands by
you: Let there be nothing done therefore unbeſeeming the
preſence of that infinite holy God that ſtands by you: and hold
this Truth forth, The Lord is preſent with me, I acknowledge
it, and I owne it, and therefore I carry my ſelf thus, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I would witneſſe to Angels and men, that I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that the Lord is preſent with me in this duty.</p>
               <p>4 Fourthly, Conſider God is an unchangable God, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
That is another Attribute of God, he is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Therefore our hearts muſt be taken off from
theſe mutable things, and ſet upon God as that unchangable
good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We muſt be humbled for our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ickleneſſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtantneſſe;
there is no ſhadow of change in God, and there
is no ſhadow of con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tancy in us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When we come into the preſence of a God who
is unchangable, then we ſhould look upon God as being the
ſame now that ever he was heretofore he hath as much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
againſt ſin now as ever he had, and that God that hath
done ſuch great things for his Church in former times, is the
ſame God to do good to his people as ever he was, and make
uſe of this; When you read the Word, and there find how
God hath made himſelf appear to be glorious for his people;
and now every time I am to Worſhip God, I ſhould think that
I am to deal with God that is the ſame that ever he was, as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,
and gracious, and juſt, and powerfull as ever he was,
and ſo my heart is to worke towards him.</p>
               <p>5 Fiftly, When I am to Worſhip God, I am to look upon
him as the living God, as that God that hath life in himſelf,
and gives life unto his creatures.</p>
               <p>Then what ſuitable behaviour doth become me? I muſt come
before his preſence with fear; <hi>It is a fearfull thing to fall into his
hands that is the living God;</hi> that hath my life under his feet, he
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:116352:51"/>
hath the abſolute diſpoſe of my preſent and eternall condition,
he gave me my life, he hath preſerved my life, and ſo may take
it away when he pleaſes, and bring death, eternall death unto
me. Theſe things may marveilouſly help your meditation
when you are to come before him, you who are barren in your
meditations, go over the Attributes of God thus, and conſider
what you may be able to draw from thence. God he is the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God: What behaviour then doth beſeeme me towards
this living God? Oh let me be afraid leaſt my Soul depart from
the living God. Let me bring a living Service to him, I muſt
not bring a dead heart; let me take heed how I come before the
living God with a dead heart, and with a dead ſervice, to
ſacrifice that that is dead before it comes, its like a carrion
that lies dead in the ditch. Oh let us be humbled for our dead
hearts, and dead ſacrifices; it is a living God that I am Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping,
&amp; therfore I muſt pray, <hi>Lord, turn away mine eyes from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
vanity, and quicken my heart in thy Law. Pſ.</hi> 1. 19. 37. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
when thou comeſt to worſhip, that thou come with a quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kned
heart, for thou haſt to deal with the living God: A man
or Woman that is of an active ſpirit, cannot iudure a dull and
heavie ſervant in the family; but the Lord is a pure act, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but act, and therefore he doth expect that all
his people ſhould have quick active and lively ſpirits.</p>
               <p>6 When you come to Worſhip God; you are to look upon
him as Almighty. And ſo are 1</p>
               <p>To Feare his great power when you come before him
And 2,</p>
               <p>Then you are not to be diſcouraged by any difficulties. I
come to ſeek for ſome great thing, and I come to ſeek to a great
God, that hath all power in heaven and earth, and infinitly
more power then there is in all creatures in heaven and earth;
I am praying to a God that can create peace, create help: My
condition cannot be ſo deſperate, but this infinite Almighty
God is able to help me Let me make him the object of my Faith
as he is ſo infinitly Almighty: What a full object of Faith is
this God that hath all power in him? Let me therefore come
to him as a ſtrong tower; <hi>run to the name of God as a ſtrong tower,</hi>
that can help in all ſtreights whatſoever. There would be much
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:116352:52"/>
drawing forth of our Faith; if we could preſent tht Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us as an infinite Almighty God: when we ſee outward
helps and meanes neer at hand, then we can beleive that we
may have ſome ſuccour from him, but when all outward helps
and meanes fail then we are diſcouraged; we do not ſanctifie
Gods name, but we rather take this name of God in vain, when
as our hearts are diſcouraged with any difficulties; now the
Lord expects that all his children that come to worſhip him,
ſhould worſhip him as the Almighty God, and ſo have their
hearts working towards him; there would be mighty work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Spirit towards God, if we ſaw him by the eye of Faith
as well as reaſon.</p>
               <p>7 Looke upon God as an Omniſcient God, as a God infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly
underſtanding all things. Now what doth this call
for?</p>
               <p>Firſt if God be a God of infinite underſtanding, then let
not me bring a blind ſacrifice to God, then let not me bring an
ignorant heart to God; this is the excellency of an underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Creature to know the rule and end of its own Actions;
now thou comeſt to worſhip an infinite God, of infinite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
then know the rule of what you do, and know the
end of what you do, and come with underſtanding into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</p>
               <p>Secondly, If he be ſo underſtanding, come with a free
open heart, to open whatſoever is in thine heart to God; take
heed of keeping any ſecret reſolutions in thine own heart, God
knows thee, and can tell how to find thee out; God knows all
that is in thine heart before; all the ſecret baſeneſſe that is in
thine heart the Lord doth underſtand it, the Lords eye is a
peircing eye, he ſees through and through thy heart. Its a
vaine thing for thee to come and conceale any thing before
him.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, If God underſtand a mans heart, what
need he come and confeſſe?</p>
               <p>Yes, he requires it it as thy duty that thou ſhouldeſt come and
open all before him: In ſpight of thy heart thou canſt not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any thing from the Lords eyes; but the Lord will ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou beeſt willing of thy ſelf that he ſhould underſtand all:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:116352:52"/>
God doth not require us to come and confeſſe our ſins, that ſo
he might know that which he knew not before, but for this end,
That there might be a teſtimony, that thou art willing that he
ſhould know all that is in thy heart; therefore now when thou
comeſt to worſhip him, ranſack every corner of thy heart and
confeſſe all before the Lord, and give glory to his name, as that
God that is an All-ſeeing God, that knows all the windings
and turnings of thy heart: Now meditate of theſe things that
be preſented to thee, and it will be a mighty means to help thee
to Sanctifie his Name.</p>
               <p>8 God is a God of infinite Wiſdome, therefore when we
come to worſhip God, let us be aſhamed of our folly: When
thou comeſt to have to deal with God, look upon him as a God
of infinite wiſedome, and I ſay be thou aſhamed of thy folly
then, and do thou exerciſe the grace of wiſdom too when thou
comeſt to God; that is, by propounding right ends (of which
we ſpake before) That is one part of wiſdome to have right
ends, and right meanes towards thoſe ends, ſo that the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the wiſdome of God when we come to worſhip him will
further us to Sanctifie his Name.</p>
               <p>And further; This is to Santifie Gods Wiſdome, when
thou comeſt into Gods preſence, in thy greateſt ſtreights, deny
thy own wiſdome, come with a reſolution to be guided by the
wiſdome of God, in this manner, Lord, I know not how to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my ſteps, there is much folly and vanity in my heart, but
thou art a God of infinite wiſdome, I come to thee for direction,
and I profeſſe here, I am willing to give up my whole Soul to
be guided by thy wiſdome. If every time we come to worſhip
God we came thus, Oh Lord whatſoever our thoughts have
been heretofore, yet if thou ſhalt but reveale thy mind to us, we
will hearken to thee, Lord, we beleeve that thy wiſdome it is
thy ſelf, and therefore we profeſſe to give up our ſelves to thy
Wiſdome. Now this is to Sanctifie the Name of God.</p>
               <p>9 Conſider the holineſſe of God: God is a God infinitly
pure from all ſin, and therefore when we come to worſhip God,
we muſt be aſhamed of our unholineſſe, as the Prophet in <hi>Iſa</hi> 6.
when he heard the Seraphins cry, <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of
hoſts,</hi> he fals down and ſaith, <hi>Wee is me for I am undone, becauſe I
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:116352:53"/>
am a man of unclean lips.</hi> And is God a holy God? Then let
me take heed when I come before him, that I bring not with me
a love to any ſin for the Lord hates it, and let me take heed that
I do not caſt dirt in the very face of Gods holineſſe, but give up
my Soul to be rul'd wholly by him:</p>
               <p>And labour that there may be a ſuitableneſſe between the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
of thy heart and of the infinite God. Now this is to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
Gods Name, when the conſideration of this Attribute of
God hath ſuch effect upon my heart, that I labour upon this to
come with a ſuitable heart before God.</p>
               <p>10 When thou comeſt before God, Conſider that thou
comeſt to a mercifull God: And what ſhould this work?</p>
               <p>Firſt, It ſhould make me come joyfully into his preſence,
as a God that is willing to do good to his poor Creatures that
are in miſery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſhould make me to come with a heart ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of the need of this mercy; O Lord, I have had my heart
let out to other vain things heretofore, but now Lord, thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
it is that my Soul comes for, as that wherein my chief and
only good conſiſts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It ſhould make me come with expectation of
great things from God; do not come unto God as unto an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
Vine, but as unto a full Vine, and the more thy Faith is
raiſed to expect great things from God, the more acceptable art
thou to God: Certainly the higher any ones faith is raiſed
when they come into his preſence, to expect the greateſt things
the more acceptable; It is otherwiſe with God then men, if you
come to men to begge a little thing, you may be welcome, but
if you come to ask a great matter, they will look a skew upon
you: but the truth is, the greater the things are that we come
to God for, the more welcome are we into Gods preſence and
thoſe that are acquainted with God they know it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they come the more fully. When they come to ask Jeſus
Chriſt himſelf and his Spirit that is more worth then ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
worlds they come with more freedom of Spirit then when
they come to ask their healths and the like.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It will be likewiſe another means of Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Attribute of God when thou comeſt to him: If thou
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:116352:53"/>
doeſt come with a mercifull heart towards thy brethren. Take
heed whenſoever you come to worſhip God, that you come not
with a rugged and cruell heart towards any of your brethren;
therefore you find that Chriſt laies this upon you in teaching
how to pray; you muſt ſay, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes as we forgive
our brethren that treſpaſſe againſt us;</hi> And you find it repeated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
If you forgive, then your heavenly Father will forgive,
and not otherwiſe. As if Chriſt ſhould ſay, When you come to
begge mercy be ſure you bring mercifull hearts.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It is a good way to Sanctifie the Name of God in
this Attribute, for the Soul to be ſolicitous with it ſelf: What
is that that will hinder me from the mercy of God, and let me
avoid it? It is otherwiſe, a taking of the name of God in vain,
for me to come to profeſſe what need I have of Gods mercy, and
yet for al that, never regard to avoid thoſe things that may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the work of his grace upon me.</p>
               <p>11 Conſider the Juſtice of God, (that is another Attribute)
Conſider that thou haſt to deal with an Infinite, Righteous,
and Juſt God: Do not think that if thou beeſt a beleever, that
thou haſt nothing to do with the Juſtice of God, for certainly
thou art to Sanctifie the Juſtice of God.</p>
               <p>Now you will ſay, How ſhould a beleever Sanctifie the Juſtice
of God? Thus;</p>
               <p>Firſt, He ſhould be apprehenſive ſenſeable how by ſin
he hath put himſelf under Juſtice, and deſerved the ſtroke of
Juſtice to be upon him to eternity; he ſhould conſider what he
is in himſelf: It is true, that Jeſus Chriſt hath come between a
beleeving Soul and the juſtice of the Father, and hath taken the
ſtroke of juſtice upon himſelf: yea but though he hath done it,
it doth not hinder but that thou ſhouldeſt be apprehenſive of
what thou haſt deſerved thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Here is a ſpeciall thing in the Sanctifying of
the juſtice of God: When we come before him, we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that we have to deal with an infinite juſt God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to dare to come but through a mediator: Here you
have the reaſon why we muſt tender up all in the name of
Chriſt, becauſe when we are to come before God, we are to
Sanctifie the name of his juſtice: For thee to think thus, I have
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:116352:54"/>
ſinned, and God is mercifull; and I will go and pray to him
that he might be mercifull, and there's an end. Is this all? Oh
no, God requires the Sanctifying of his Juſtice, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that doth Sanctifie his Juſtice ſo much as this, That when
a poor creature ſees the infinite diſtance that ſin hath made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that infinite God and it, it ſees that through ſin, it hath
made its ſelf liable to juſtice; and when it ſees that there is an
abſolute neceſſity that infinite juſtice muſt have ſatisfaction, and
thinks the ſinner, If it comes to me that I muſt ſatisfie the juſtice
of God I am never able to do it, but there is a mediator, and
therefore I'le fly to him, and by Faith tender up to the Father
all the merits of his Son as a full ſatisfaction to his infinite ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:
When thou comeſt thus before the Lord, thou Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
his Name indeed. Many think that when they come to
pray, they ſhould look upon Gods Grace, and Mercy, and not
upon his Juſtice; but thou muſt look upon both.</p>
               <p>Another Attribute it is Gods Faithfulneſſe: Conſider
thou haſt to deal with a God of Infinite Truth, and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and therefore look upon him as an object of thy Faith to
reſt upon. And likewiſe thou muſt bring a faithful heart ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſome way to this faithfulneſſe of God that is, a heart faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
with him, to keep within the Covenant that thou haſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into and to performe all the Vows that thou makeſt with
God; Remember thou haſt to deal with a faithfull God, and
as the Lord delights to manifeſt his Righteouſneſſe to poor
Creatures that ſeek his face, ſo this God doth expect that thou
ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be faithful in all the Covenants that thou doeſt make
with him, and this is to Sanctifie Gods Name.</p>
               <p>Now then put all theſe Attributes of God together and there
you have his Glory, the infinitneſſe of his Glory. The ſhine
and luſtre of all the Attributes together is Gods Glory. I have
then to deal with a glorious God, and let me labour to perform
ſuch ſervices as may have a ſpirituall glory upon them, that
ſome image of the divine luſtre that there is in God may be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my ſervices; and let me look for glorious things ſeeing I
have to deal with ſuch a glorious God.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, Here is a great deal of doe in ſerving of God,
how much is here that we muſt do?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:116352:54"/>
I appeal to any gracious heart, what canſt thou want of any
of theſe, or what wouldeſt thou want? Doeſt thou ſay, Here's
a great deal? Can there be too much to make thee happy?
Theſe things are not only thy duty, but thy happineſſe glory
and excellency conſiſts in them: If any one ſhould bring you a
great many Jewels and Pearls, would you ſay, Here's a great
deal adoe? Oh no, the more the merrier. So ſay I, this one
meditation would take off the thoughts of <hi>a great deal,</hi> for in al
theſe my happineſſe conſiſts, and the more I have of theſe, the
more ſhall I injoy of God, the more happy ſhall I be both here
and for ever.</p>
               <p>Now I had thought to have given you ſome Reaſons why
the Name of God muſt be Sanctified; only I beſeech you by all
that hath been ſaid go away with this thought, what little
cauſe is there that any of us ſhould reſt upon any of our duties;
If this be required of us thus to Sanctifie the name of God in
duty, I ſay we have little cauſe any of us to reſt in any duties
that we performe. There are many poor creatures that have
no other Saviours to reſt upon but their Prayers, and coming
to Church, and taking the Communion; Now if in all theſe
the Lord expects that thou ſhouldeſt thus Sanctifie his Name:
Thou haſt little cauſe to reſt upon any thing that thou haſt
done, thou haſt cauſe rather to go alone and mourne for taking
the Name of God in vain in the duties of his worſhip: Reſt not
in any of your performances; labour to performe duties as well
as you can, but when you have done, know that you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
ſervants after all, and renounce all as in the point of
Juſtification, and reſt upon ſomething elſe, otherwiſe you are
undone for ever.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE are coming now to the concluſion of this great
Argument of Sanctifying Gods Name in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for the generall. God expects that we ſhould
all in our drawings neer to him in the duties of
worſhip, Sanctifie his Name. Now we are to conſider of divers
reaſons why God will be Sanctified in all the duties of his
worſhip.</p>
               <p>1 The Firſt Reaſon is this, It is the very nature of God to
Will himſelf the laſt end, and all other things to work ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the lifting up of himſelf as the laſt end: I ſay it is as
eſſentiall to him as any thing, for him to will himſelf as the
higheſt end, and that all things ſhould work ſo as to be ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vnto that Glory of his for the furtherance of it: God
ſhould ceaſe to be God, if ſo be he ſhould not will himſelf as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
higheſt end, and ſo will that all things that have any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhould ſome way or other work for himself: This is the
very nature of God. It is that which I conceive the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Gods holinſſe conſiſts in, the willing himſelf as the
laſt end, and ſo to work all things as is ſuitable unto his own
infinit excellencie. Now as this is Gods holineſſe, ſo it is the
holineſſe that God requires in his Creatures (that are capeable
of holineſſe) that they ſhould will him as the laſt end, and all
things ſuitable to that infinit excellencie of his. Now if this be
the nature of God, and this be his holineſſe, then certainly it
muſt needs be a neceſſarie duty in all thoſe that would have
communion with God and would honour God, to will as God
himſelf doth will, that is that all things ſhould work ſuitable
to the infinite excellencie of God, that God may attain the
glory of his infinit excellencie, and this makes it to be a neceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
duty that when we come to worſhip him we ſhould Sainct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fie
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:116352:55"/>
his name: So that the firſt reaſon is taken from the very nature
of God, it is the very being of God that all things ſhould work
to himſelf, and in ſuch a ſuitable way as to lift up his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and glory.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, We muſt Sanctifie God in the duties of his
Worſhip, becauſe it is the ſpeciall glory that God hath in the
world to be actively honoured; for his paſſive glory, that is,
to be glorified in a paſſive way, that he hath in hell, but the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
glory that God would have it is that he might be glorified
actively: Now there is no ſuch way of glorifying the Name of
God actively as by worſhipping of him in a holy manner, and
therefore God ſtands much upon this, That when we come to
worſhip him we ſanctifie his Name; For ſaith God, If I be not
ſanctified in my worſhip, what active glory have I in the world?
It is the ſpeciall active glory that God hath in the world, the
Sanctifying of his Name in the duties of his worſhip.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdly, That which we have intimated before, That
the duties of Gods worſhip are the moſt precious things, the
ſpecial conveyances of the choice mercies that he intends to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
on his Saints, and therefore though he loſes his glory in
any thing elſe, he would not loſe it in that wherein he doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
convey his mercy and goodneſſe to his people. But
that we ſpake too in ſhewing how we draw nigh to God in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
duties and it may well come in here again as an Argument
why we ſhould ſanctifie Gods name.</p>
               <p>4 A Fourth Reaſon is this, Becauſe there is no way for us
to be fitted for the receiving of Mercy from God through thoſe
duties of worſhip, but by our Sanctifying of Gods name; when
thou comeſt at any time to worſhip God, what wouldeſt thou
have? there is ſome communion that thou wouldeſt injoy with
God, now there is no way to make thee a fit ſubject of Mercy,
or capable of the injoyment of Communion with God, but by
ſuch a behaviour of Soul as this is that hath been ſpoken of, to,
Sanctifie the Name of God: thou wouldeſt be loath to loſe thoſe
duties of worſhip that thou doeſt performe, therefore it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of thee to ſanctifie his Name leſt thou doeſt loſe all, for
'tis this that makes thee the only capable ſubject of what good
is to be had there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:116352:56"/>
5 We muſt Sanctifie Gods Name in holy duties, becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
we ſhould certainly never hold out in duties, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
and come to nothing; now God would be worſhipped ſo
by his creatures, as to be conſtantly worſhipped, he would have
thoſe that do worſhip him, to worſhip him alwaies, to worſhip
him for ever, and he would have this worſhip that we perform
to him, but to be the beginning of that eternall worſhip that he
ſhall have from us in heaven. And ſo the Saints do Worſhip
God now, the worſhip which they performe, it is but as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of that worſhip that hereafter in heaven they ſhall
tender up to God, though there may be ſome difference in it, as
there our prayers will be turned into praiſes, and it will not be
in ſuch outward Ordinances as now we worſhip God in there
will be no Preaching, nor Sacraments: yet notwithſtanding
the Soul-worſhip that is now, will be in effect the ſame as it
ſhall be in heaven. God would have us ſo to worſhip him, as
to continue to worſhip him: Now I ſay, unleſſe his Name be
Sanctified in our worſhipping of him we will certainly fall off;
and the truth is, this is the very ground of all Apoſtacie in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites;
Some that have been very forward in the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of God when they were young ones, and afterwards they
have fallen off, they were wont conſtantly in their families,
and in ſecret in their chambers to be worſhipping of God, and
they accounted it the very joy of their lives for the preſent to be
worſhipping of God; but it is not ſo with them now as it
was yea they are fallen off it may be from their very profeſſion
of Religion, and turned loſe: And now to be in vain company,
to drink, or play, is better to them then any ſervice or worſhip
of God, they prize more to be in company with their ſports
then to hear a Sermon, or to be in Communion with the people
of God in Prayer: Heretofore they would not have changed
one ſhort time of private communion with God, for the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a great deal of pleaſures and content in the world; but
now it is otherwiſe with them. How comes it to paſſe that theſe
are Apoſtatiſed thus from God? Surely here is the ground of
it, That they did not Sanctifie Gods name in holy duties, at the
moſt it was but a work of conſcience that put them upon them,
and they had but ſome flaſhes, there was no reall ſanctification
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:116352:56"/>
of their hearts whereby they did ſanctifie the name of God in
holy duties, and upon this it is that they have left off. This
I dare ſay, That there was never any ſoul that did know
what it was to ſanctifie Gods Name in worſhip, that ever was
weary of worſhipping God.</p>
               <p>It may be ſome of you may ſay, We have heard that there
is much required in Sanctifying Gods Name in duties, and that
is the only way to weary the Soul, and to make it fall off; Oh
no (as we ſaid the laſt day there is not any one thing that hath
been opened for the Sanctifying of Gods name in duties that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
gracious heart can tell how to miſſe, and the more we do
Sanctifie his Name, the more we ſhall be in love with worſhip.
For it is from hence that thoſe that Sanctifie Gods name in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
will hold out, becauſe they will find the ſweetneſſe of
worſhip, they will meet with God in holy duties, and ſo they
come to be incouraged in worſhip, but as for others who do
worſhip God in a formall way, their worſhip will prove to be
tedious to them, for they performe the duties, but do not find
God in the duties in that Spirituall way as the Saints do; If
they think they meet with God, it is but an imagination ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then any reall meeting with him; they do not find the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of God in their ſouls in holy duties, ſo as thoſe do that
ſanctifie Gods name in holy duties; here then you ſee the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
why we are to Sanctifie Gods name in holy duties.</p>
               <p>Now then for the Application of all this.</p>
               <p>1 If all this which you have heard be required of us for the
Sanctifying of Gods Name: Hence we ſee how little cauſe we
have to reſt upon any duty of worſhip that we do performe,
certainly the duties of worſhip that we performe are no ſuch
things as are fit to be reſted upon for life and for ſalvation and
yet for the moſt part there is ſcarce any thing that people have
to reſt upon, or to tender up to God for acceptation to eternall
life but only their prayers, and their coming to hear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of the Communion, and ſuch duties that they perform;
this is all they have to tender up for life and for ſalvation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they may ſometimes ſpeak of Chriſt, but the truth is that
which their hearts reſt upon for acceptation to eternall life is
this. And is it but this? It is a weak prop, a rotten reed that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:116352:57"/>
thou haſt to reſt upon; Let the duties of worſhip be performed
never ſo well; Suppoſe we did ſanctifie Gods Name to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
that is poſſible for any creature to do in this world, yet
ſuch duties are not to be reſted upon: <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
and the Apoſtles, the moſt holy men that ever did perform
duties in the moſt holy manner, yet wo to them if they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to reſt upon but their duties; conſider therefore of this,
that what thou muſt reſt upon for acceptation to eternall life,
it muſt be that that muſt have ſo much worth in it, as muſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
for all thy ſins that formerly thou haſt committed; yea
and for all the ſins that ever thou ſhalt commit. Now I appeal
unto any ones conſcience, is that which thou performeſt, is
prayer, or receiving the Sacrament, or hearing of the word, ſuch
a work as in thy conſcience thou canſt think, it hath ſo much
worth in it, as to ſatisfie God for all the ſins that ever thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
or ſhalt commit? I am perſwaded if people that have reſted
upon duties heretofore, would but ſeriouſly have this thought
in their minds, That I muſt reſt upon nothing for my accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for life and Salvation, but that that muſt have ſuch worth
in it, as to ſatisfie God for all my ſins that ever have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
or ſhall be committed; this would take them off for
ever from reſting in duties. Yea, and it muſt be ſuch as muſt be
the object of the infinite holineſſe of God to take content in,
Surely the duties that we performe are no ſuch duties to reſt
upon: the truth is, If we would ſeriouſly conſider what they
are, as they come from us, we would even abhor our ſelves in
duſt and aſhes, and account of them as the Prophet ſpeaks of his
own righteouſneſſe as menſtruous cloaths, they are ſuch as if
God ſhould deal with us, as juſtly he may do, he might caſt them
and us to the dogges, for they are (as the Prophet ſaith) <hi>torne
and rent Sacrifices;</hi> now if a man in the time of the Law ſhould
bring to the Lord a ſacrifice that was all torne and rent before
he brought it, would ſuch a ſacrifice have been accepted? All
the duties we performe as they come from us they are ſnch; we
read in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 31. concerning ſuch things as were torne and
rent, that they ſhould caſt them to the dogges. <hi>Ye ſhall be holy
men unto we</hi> (ſaith he verſe ult) <hi>neither ſhall ye eate any fleſh that is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orne of beaſts in the field, ye ſhall caſt it to the dogs, becauſe ye are
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:116352:57"/>
holy men unto me:</hi> Muſt the people of Iſrael manifeſt their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
in this, That they muſt eate nothing torne by beaſts, but
caſt it unto dogs? Or was the holineſſe of the people of Iſrael
ſuch as God required them, that they muſt eate nothing that
was torne by beaſts? What then is the holineſſe of the infinite
God? our ſervices that we performe are of themſelves ſuch as
are torne by our beaſtly luſts many times: how many are there
that bring ſacrifices to God that are as a carrion that ſwine
have been tearing before hand, and yet theſe are the Sacrifices
that they bring to God, and not only think that God ſhould
accept of them, but they do reſt upon them for their accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to eternall life. How infinitly are theſe people miſtaken<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
how little do they know of God, or of the way of acceptation
to eternall life! That is the Firſt Uſe.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, If all this be required for the Sanctifying of
Gods Name in duties, That we cannot performe the duties of
Worſhip without this behaviour of Soul; hence we ſee that the
work of Religion is a hard and difficult work to fleſh &amp; bloud.
A main work of Religion is the work of worſhipping of God,
for indeed thoſe that are not religious and godly, they never
worſhip God to any purpoſe: then we come to worſhip God
when we begin to be religious and godly. Now it muſt needs
be a buſie work to be a religious and a godly man, becauſe there
is ſo much required in the ſanctifying of Gods name in holy
duties: many people think it a very eaſie matter to worſhip
God, and the worſhip that they tender up to God is an eaſie
matter, there is little in it. If it were nothing elſe to worſhip
God but meerly to go and ſay a few prayers, and come and hear
a Sermon, and take a peice of Bread and Wine, then it were the
eaſieſt matter in the world to come and worſhip God; but there
is more required in the duties of Gods worſhip then thou haſt
been acquainted with; there is a power of godlineſſe in it. That
Text of Scripture is a very famous one that ſhewes the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that there is in the Worſhip of God, and how men are
miſtaken in thinking it ſuch an eaſie and ſlight matter to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God: It is in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 16. 19. where <hi>Joſhua</hi> doth call upon
the people to worſhip God, and they came off preſently, and
ſaid, They would worſhip him (ſo you ſhall find them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:116352:58"/>
verſe 16.) But mark what the Text ſaith in verſe 19.
<hi>And</hi> Joſhua <hi>ſaid unto the people, Ye cannot ſerve the Lord, for he is
an holy God, he is a jealous God, and he will not forgive your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
and your ſins,</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, You think it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſerve the Lord, and that it is an eaſie matter to ſerve
him, you think to put off God with any thing: Alas you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſerve the Lord, for he is a holy God, and a jealous God
and you muſt have other manner of hearts then yet you have,
and you muſt underſtand his worſhip in another manner then
yet you do, the Lord will be Sanctified in thoſe that draw nigh
him, and therfore untill you underſtand God, and his waies
and worſhip, you cannot ſerve the Lord. Know that the
work of Religon is a very hard and difficult work, for it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
all this, and therfore the Soule had need be very diligent
and laborious that would come to worſhip God in a right
way.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdly, hence is a uſe of humiliation to us all, even to
the beſt of us; oh how little, how little hath the beſt of us all
Sanctified the name of God! how far have we all come ſhort of
the Sanctifying of Gods name in holy duties! And when we
look abroad in the world and ſee what poor ſervice God hath
generally from the Men and women of the earth, it ſhould
make our hearts bleed within us. Where almoſt is the man or
woman that according to that text in <hi>Iſa. Stirs up himſelf to
take hold on God.</hi> And I verily beleeve that in the opening of this
point of Sanctifying the name of God in holy duties, that I
have bin in the boſoms of as many as in the opening of any
point whatſoever; and as many may have cauſe to lay their
hands upon their hearts and ſay, Certainly I have come ſhort
of what is required here, and have not bin acquainted with
this way, this myſterie of godlines in Sanctifying Gods name in
holy duties as I ought to be: O be humbled for this, for all the
uncleanneſie of your hearts in the performance of duties In
<hi>Exod</hi> 27 4, 5. you read, that at the Altar where the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>acrifices
we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to be offered, the Lord required that there ſhould be a
grate made. <hi>Thou ſhalt make for it</hi> (meaning the Altar) <hi>a grate
of net-work of braſſe, and upon the net ſhalt thou make four braſen rings
in the four corners thereof, and thou ſhalt put it under the compaſſe of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:116352:58"/>
the Altar beneath, that the net may be even to the middeſt of the Altar.</hi>
There was as it were a grate for the aſhes of the Altar to go
through, as you have grates in your fires to make them burn
cleer, and for the aſhes to fal down, ſo the Lord would have ſuch
a grate for the aſhes of the Altar to fall down: We had need of
ſuch a grate. Oh the aſhes, and dirt, and filth, that there is in our
ſervices when we come to offer and tender them up to God!
So that we have cauſe I ſay to be humbled for holy offerings.
There be many godly people that through Gods mercy are able
to keep from groſſe ſins, they do not find it any great matter
to keep from company, ſwearing, drinking, uncleanneſſe, lying
or wronging of others, and ſuch kind of ſins as thoſe are, ſo
that they ſee not ſuch need of humiliation in this regard, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it be for that their natures are as corrupt as any, though
they break not forth into thoſe actuall groſſe ſins, but the
maine work of the humiliation of thoſe that are godly, it is to
be humbled for their thoughts, for the miſpending of time,
and for not ſanctifying of Gods name in holy dnties, thoſe are
the maine things that are the ſubject of the humiliation of the
Saints, beſide the body of ſin and death that they carry about
with them. And it would be a good ſign that thy heart hath
ſome tenderneſſe in it when thou makeſt theſe to be the matter
of thy humiliation: Carnall people little are troubled for
theſe, if they fall into ſuch ſins, as their Conſciences do
fly in their faces, then they are troubled and humbled. But
for ſuch things as theſe are they are ſeldome humbled: To be
humbled for thy holy offerings is a good ſign of a gracious
heart. We read of the Cherubims that they had ſix wings, and
with two of their wings the text ſaith they covered their faces,
ſo my brethren we had need have wings as it were to cover our
beſt duties they had wings, and with two they covered their
legs, and with two their faces: We had need, not only of a
covering for our lower parts and meanner duties, but a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of our holy duties, to cover our faces our beſt duties of all,
the moſt heavenly duties we perform had need be purged by the
bloud of Chriſt. In <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 14. 16. we read of their holy
things, that there was need of purging of them by bloud; and
ſo it ſhould be in our holy duties: Let us be humbled for our
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:116352:59"/>
beſt performance that ever we performed in our lives: The beſt
had need be ſo, but then as for others that have made little or
no conſcience of Sanctifying of Gods name, how had they need
be humbled? Thou haſt ſomething more to repent of then
thou thoughteſt of; for the truth is, thoſe that have not made
conſcience of Sanctifying of Gods Name in holy duties, they
never in all their lives did any ſervice for the honour of God,
thou haſt lived perhaps 30. or 40. it may be 60. years or more,
and dideſt never yet honour God in any one thing that ever
thou dideſt in all thy life.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, God forbid: Have not I prayed, and heard
the word much, and received the Communion often, and yet
have I never honoured God?</p>
               <p>If thou haſt not bin aquainted with this myſterie of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in Sanctifying his name in theſe things, This is ſaid from
God to thee this morning, That thou haſt never done any one
action to the honour of God: Thou hadeſt need begin preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for thy time is not long, and wilt thou go out of this world
and the name of God never to be honoured by thee?</p>
               <p>Yea and further, Thou haſt loſt all thy duties, all the time
hath bin loſt that thou haſt been in performance of duties, now
it is an ill thing to idle away time in the things of the World:
When a man hath an opportunity for to gain in the world, If
ſo be he loſes his time and neglects it, we account it a very ſad
thing to him, but now to loſe our trading time for heaven (for
the times of the worſhipping of God are our trading times for
heaven) that's ſad indeed: And yet thou that makeſt not conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Sanctifying the Name of God in holy duties, all the
time thou haſt ſpent is loſt.</p>
               <p>And yet further, You that have been falſe in the performance
of duties, and hypocrites, not only all your pains and labour is
quite loſt (for if that were all it might be well with you) but
you have aggravated your ſins by your holy duties. Thoſe
duties that others have injoyed communion with God in, and
furthered their eternall life by, thou haſt aggravated thy ſins
by them, yet it was thy duty to do them: but I ſay, by not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
of Gods Name, thou haſt aggravated thy ſins ſo much
the more. As thoſe that are godly, they work out their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:116352:59"/>
even in their naturall actions they ſanctifie Gods Name,
in eating and drinking, and following their buſineſſe; they
performe thoſe actions in ſuch a holy manner, as they honour
God in them, and further their eternall peace; but as they in
their naturall and civill actions work out their ſalvation; ſo
thou in the very religious actions doeſt work out thy damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Certainly wicked men that are not acquainted with this
work of godlineſſe to ſanctifie Gods name in holy duties,
they work out their damnation even in the performance of
them.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, Then they had better not do them.</p>
               <p>Yes, they are bound to do them; but they are bound to do
them in a right manner, as ſometimes I have given you this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and it is a ful and a cleer one, to ſhew that men are bound
to performe holy duties and not to leave them undone, and
yet they may further their own damnation while they are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them: As for example, If ſo be that a Prince ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
a man to come into his preſence ſuch a day to Petition for
his life, which he hath forfeited by the Law, if he do not come
he may be a dead man: But now if this man be drunk on that
day, and come drunk into the Kings preſence, he may be a dead
man too, for preſuming to come drunk before him; ſo wicked
and ungodly men, whether they worſhip or worſhip not, they
are in danger to periſh: But of this more when we come to ſhew
that <hi>God will be Sanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Fourth place here is a uſe of Exhortation, that ſeeing
we have this truth thus preſented to us and opened before us;
O that we had hearts to apply our ſelves now to it with all our
might, to ſeek to ſanctifie the name of God when we draw nigh
to him. The Lord hath ſhewen thee what it is that he requires of
thee; make conſcience of it for time to come, thou doeſt not
know what bleſſed Communion thou maieſt have with God if
thou doeſt make conſcience of this, the truth is, If you have not
been acquainted with this, you have not been acquainted with
the way of a Chriſtian in his injoyment of Communion with
God, thou doeſt not know what the comfort of a Chriſtian life
meanes; do but make tryall of this for time to come, and thou
wilt find more comfort in the waies of godlineſſe, and more
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:116352:60"/>
thriving in them in one quarter of a year then thou haſt done
before in ſeaven years, one Chriſtian that keeps cloſe to God in
holy duties and ſanctifies the name of God in them, I ſay finds
more comfort with God, and growes on in godlineſſe more in
one quarter of a year, then the other doth in ſeven years that
goes on in an ordinary, dull, and formall way in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the duties of Worſhip: Some there are in our time
that cry out of duties, and what need we trouble our ſelves ſo
much? thoſe that know not how to ſanctifie Gods name they
think lightly of them; but now do you apply your ſelves ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as you are able to this that I am ſpeaking of, and you will
find yourſelves to be as it were in another world, you will be
able to ſay, Well, I have not yet underſtood what it was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
communion with God in Prayer, in Word, and in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
before, this will make your faces ſhine in your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
if you would do it; and now to that end that you may
do it, there are theſe two or three things that I would propound
to you.</p>
               <p>1 In the Firſt place, Learn to know God more with whom
you have to do, and preſent thoſe things that you have heard
before you in your meditations, when as you are to come to
God in Prayer, or in any other duty, and when you are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
of God, remember that you have to do with God and
none elſe. You are every time you come to performe holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to be as a man or woman ſeparated from all things. <hi>Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Maximus</hi> tels a ſtory of a young noble man that attended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Alexander</hi> while he was ſacrificing, this noble man held his
Cenſer for Incenſe, and in the holding of it, there fell a coal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his fleſh and burnt it ſo as the very ſcent of it was in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils
of all that were about him, and becauſe he would not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
<hi>Alexander</hi> in his ſervice, he reſolutely did not ſtir to put of
the fire from him; but holds ſtill his Cenſer: If heathens made
ſuch adoe in their ſacrificing to their Idoll gods, that they
would mind it ſo as no diſturbance muſt be made what ever
they induted: What care ſhould we have then of our ſelves
when we come to worſhip the high God? And ſo <hi>Joſephus</hi> he
reports of the Preiſts that were ſacrificing in the Temple when
<hi>Pampey</hi> brake in to them with armed men, and though they
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:116352:60"/>
might have fled and ſaved their lives, yet they would not leave
off their ſacrificing but were ſlain by the ſouldiers. They did
ſo mind it as a matter of great conſequence: Oh that we could
mind the duties of Gods worſhip as matters of great moment,
that ſo we might learn to Sanctifie the name of God in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of them more then ever we have done.</p>
               <p>2 When thou comeſt to worſhip, take heed thou doeſt not
come in thine own ſtrength. For there is more required in ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
the name of God then thy ſtrength is able to carry thee
on in, and therefore act thy Faith upon Jeſus Chriſt every time
thou comeſt to worſhip God, not only as I ſaid before, to tender
up thy ſervices in his name, but act thy faith upon Chriſt to give
thee ſtrength to do what thou haſt to do. &amp; what ſtrength thou
haſt received from Chriſt be ſure to ſtir it up many godly men &amp;
women have more ſtrength then they know of themſelves; &amp; if
they would but ſtir up that ſtrength that they have received,
they might Sanctifie the Name of God a great deal more then
they do. Therfore remember that text before mentioned, <hi>None
ſtirs up himſelf to take hold on God:</hi> Quicken up thy heart, and
rouze up thy Spirit when thou art to worſhip God.</p>
               <p>3 When ever thou art worſhipping of God, do not ſatisfie
thy ſelf meerly in the duty done, but conſider, do I ſanctifie
Gods Name in the duty? every time thou worſhipeſt him, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
thy heart whether thou doeſt it yea or no. And if thou
findeſt that thou haſt not attained in ſome comfortable meaſure
to this that hath been preſented to thee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thy heart to what is required; The next time thou comeſt to

               <p>But now that all may be ſealed up unto you, and ſo that we
may cloſe the point, know <hi>that God will be ſanctified in thoſe that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> And there are theſe Two things in the
Point;</p>
               <p>Firſt, If we do not ſanctifie Gods Name, God will ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
his Name in a way of juſtice.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If we do Sanctifie his Name, then he will ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
his Name in a way of mercy towards us.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt, God will manifeſt that he is diſpleaſed with
ſuch duties that thou doeſt performe, he will manifeſt it one
way or other that he is a holy God, and he doth not accept of
ſuch unholy things as thou doeſt tender up to him; for the
truth is, if God ſhould accept of ſuch unholy things from men,
God may be ſaid to be like unto themſelves. As a man if he
doth entertain any as his familiar friend that is naught and
wicked, it is his diſgrace and diſhonour; a man may ſometimes
imploy in ſome buſineſſe thoſe that are naught and wicked, and
it may be no diſgrace to him, but if he doth entertain one in
his houſe that is wicked, it is a diſhonour to him: So God may
imploy the moſt wicked men in the world in ſome outward ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
but if he ſhould accept of them in his Worſhip, it would
be a diſhonour to God, and therefore God that he might ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
his own Name, he will manifeſt his diſpleaſure at one time
or other againſt ſuch duties of worſhip you that performe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
in a formall manner, and with unclean vile hearts; I ſay,
it ſtands upon the honour of God if he will manifeſt himſelf a
holy God, he muſt manifeſt ſome diſpleaſure againſt that way
of thy worſhipping of him: This one meditation one would
think, ſhould mightily ſink into the heart of any man that hath
an inlightened conſcience, to think thus, It ſtands upon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
of God, And he cannot appear to be a holy God except
he doth ſome way or other appear to be againſt me in ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that I tender up unto him.</p>
               <p>Now you will ſay, How doth God appear, that he doth not
accept of them? He will appear in theſe three things:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:116352:61"/>
1 Firſt by blaſting thoſe that do worſhip him thus in a
formall way: It ſhall at Firſt be ſecret, but afterwards it
will appear more apparantly, and we ſee it by experience, that
ſuch as have bin profeſſors of Religion, and worſhip God in
hypocriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, and in formality, they have been blaſted in their
parts and common gifts.</p>
               <p>The judgement of God upon <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> that did not
ſanctifie Gods Name it was ſecret at firſt: It ſtruck them dead,
and though by fire, yet if you read the ſtory you ſhall find that
their cloathes were not burnt, and yet they were burnt in their
bodies: So the Lord ſome times doth blaſt men inwardly in
their Spirits, in their Souls, in their Parts, in their common
Gifts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he blaſts them I ſay inwardly though it doth not appear
outwardly, yet at length it will appear before men that they
are blaſted: and in theſe times of the Goſpel the Lord doth
come with ſpirituall judgments rather then with outward tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
judgements. In the time of the Law, thoſe that did not
ſanctifie the Name of God in holy duties, the Lord did appear
by ſome externall and viſible way upon their bodies; but now
in the time of the Goſpel there God comes with more ſpirituall
judgements upon mens Souls, and thoſe are the moſt terrible
judgements: We have a notable Scripture for this in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 13.
How God doth blaſt thoſe that do not ſanctifie his name in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
duties. <hi>Wherefore the Lord ſaid, For aſmuch as this People draw
neer me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have
removed their heart far from me, and their fear towards me is taught
by the precepts of men:</hi> Mark what follows: <hi>Therefore behold I will
proceed to do a marvelous work amongſt this people, even a marvelous
work and a wonder: for the wiſdome of their wiſe men ſhall periſh, and
the underſtanding of their prudent men ſhall be hid.</hi> What do they
come and draw neer me with their lips and their hearts are far
from me, and do they worſhip me in a formall way? Ile take
away the wiſdom from the wiſe, and the underſtanding from
the prudent: And that is the reaſon why ſo many great ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
are blaſted in their very parts, becauſe they would worſhip
God according to the precepts of men, in a formall way; and
ſo all hypocrites and formall worſhippers the Lord doth blaſt
them in one way or other, the judgements of God upon the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:116352:62"/>
of men were ſometimes in the time of the Law; But in the
times of the Goſpel there we find generally the judgements of
God to be more ſpirituall upon the hearts and conſciences of
men; we find it by experience God doth diſcover that he doth
not accept of ſuch as thoſe are; and therefore when you ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that have made profeſſion of Religion, that had excellent
Parts at firſt, many common Gifts, and now are as we ſay, no
body; Remember this Text, <hi>That God will be ſanctified in thoſe
that come nigh me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly the Lord doth manifeſt that he will be Sanctified in
thoſe that draw nigh him, by awakeing their conſciences many
times upon their ſick beds and death beds, the Lord doth force
them to give glory to him, and there to acknowledge that they
did not worſhip God in uprightneſſe but in Formality. And
now they are in horrour of conſcience and cry out in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of their ſoules upon the apprehenſion of the dreadfull
wrath of God that is upon them: Take heed for the Lords
ſake of this thing, when you are performing of the duties of
worſhip, do not reſt in the outward duties for they will never
comfort you upon your ſick and death beds, you may perhaps
put off your conſciences a little for the preſent, but when you
come upon your ſick beds there will be no comfort unto you,
and then you will be forced to ſay, well all this while I have but
taken the name of God in vain, and now God hath rejected me
and all my ſervices and you will then ſpeak to thoſe that come
about your beds ſide, and bid them take warning by you,
take heed that when you worſhip God you worſhip him to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
I have ſpent time in prayer, and hearing but for want
of this I find I have no comfort at all, but the Lord appeares to
be terrible to my ſoule, and comes out againſt me as an enemy I
ſay now Gods name is Sanctified; what ever becomes of thee,
he will force glory from thee one way or other, and it may be
even here in this time of thy life, but however, at the great
day, when the ſecrets of all hearts muſt be diſcloſed before men
and Angels, then the Lord will apeare to be a holy God by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
all ſuch ſervices that thou dideſt tender unto him, and
it will then be a great part of the work of the day of Judgment
for God to be Sanctified in thoſe that did worſhip him; by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:116352:62"/>
before men and Angels, how he did reject ſuch formal
and hypocritical worſhip that they did tender up unto him, Oh
that God would ſtrik this upon your hearts, that it may abide
upon you every time you come to worſhip him, to think thus,
let me look to it to Sanctifie his name now, for I hear that
God will Sanctifie it himſelfe if I do not do it.</p>
               <p>But then on the other ſide if ſo be that thou makeſt Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Sanctifying Gods name in duties, then he will Sanctifie
his name in a way of Mercy; that is, he will manifeſt how he
doth accept of the leaſt degree of holines though there be much
mixture: God hath a way to take a way the mixture by the
bloud of his Son, and then to accept of any holineſſe he ſees in
thee, he will Sanctifie his name by meeting with thee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
his glory to thee when thou art worſhiping of him:
There is an excellent ſcripture for this, <hi>Exod: 29. 43. There
I will meet with the Children of Iſrael and the Tabernacle ſhall be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by my glory.</hi> Thou that haſt a gratious heart and art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping
of God in Sincerity, thou art as a Tabernacle of God,
and God hath his ſervice and worſhip from thee, thou art as
the Temple of God, <hi>and there will I meet with thee</hi> (ſaith God)
<hi>and I will Sanctifie my Tabernacle by my glory.</hi> God will Sanctifie
thy heart by his glory if thou doeſt Sanctifie his name.</p>
               <p>Further; thou ſhalt it may be not alwaies have ſuch glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
comforts, the full beames of the Sun riſing upon thee, but
at one time or other the Lord will break in upon thee and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
his glory to thee, and its like if thou haſt not ſuch full
comforts now, yet upon thy ſick bed, though God doth not
then alwaies manifeſt himſelf fully, for ſomtimes the diſeaſe
may be a hinderance, yet it is ordinary that thoſe that in their
conſtant way did Sanctifie Gods name in holy duties they do lie
comfortably upon their ſicke beds, and a glorious entrance is
made for them into the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and
Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And then againe all things are Sanctified unto them: as on
the other ſide, thoſe that do not Sannctifie Gods name all things
are curſed to them, if thou doeſt not make Conſcience of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
Gods name in duties, God cares not to Sanctifie any
thing for thy good: But now, thoſe that make conſcience of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:116352:63"/>
Sanctifying Gods name in holy duties, the Lord takes care,
that all things ſhall be Sanctified for their good, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance
of their eternal good.</p>
               <p>And how ever it be here, yet hereafter at the great day of
judgment it will be a part of the glory of God to manifeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men and Angels how he did accept of thoſe holy ſervices
that thou dideſt tender up to him; when hypocrites ſhall be
caſt away and abhorr'd, and thou who hadeſt an upright ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
heart ſhalt be owned before God, and before men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
at that great day; and God ſhall ſay, well, it is a part of
the glory of my holineſſe to make it appeare, that I have accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of theſe holy things, that theſe my poore ſervants have ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
up to me. And this now is of marveilous uſe for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
of a gracious heart; thoſe duties that thou doeſt now
think thou haſt loſt, and there will nothing come of them,
thou ſhalt certainly hear of them another day, God will make
it appear, there is nothing that he ſtands more upon then the
glory of his holineſſe, and it is the glory of his holineſſe that is
thy ſtrength in this thing and that makes it certain to thee that
there muſt be a manifeſtation of thy acceptance; and therefore
take theſe truthes into thy heart about Sanctifying the name of
God. You have had only the point in generall opened to you
Oh that the Spirit of God would bring things unto your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</p>

SERMONS upon that point of Sanctifying the

                  </gap> duties of Worſhip and I intend to ſpeak to all theſe
Three and to ſhew how we ſhould Sanctifie the Name of God in
drawing nigh unto him, in the Word, Sacrament, and
Prayer.</p>
               <p>We might chooſe ſeverall Texts for all theſe, but they fall
full within the generall and therefore it ſhall be ſufficient, for
to ground the Sanctifying of Gods Name in theſe duties of
worſhip upon this Text;
<q>I OF SANCTIFYING THE NAME OF GOD IN THE
HEARING OF THE WORD.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That which we are to ſpeak to this morning it is the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the Name of God in the Hearing of his Word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> If you
would have the ground of what we are to ſay concerning this
in a particular Scripture, you may have it in <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 18.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:116352:64"/>
                  <hi>take heed therefore how you hear:</hi> It is not enough to come to hear
the word, that is good, and no queſtion but God is pleaſed
with the willingneſſe of people to come to hear his word, but
you muſt not reſt barely in hearing, but <hi>take heed how you hear.</hi>
Now this is a point of great conſequence and I hope it may do
good to help to make many Sermons to be profitable to you, &amp;
the point I hope is ſeaſonable &amp; will be very ſuitable unto you:
For thoſe that come to hear ſo ſoon in a morning, and are
willing even in hard weather to come out of their beds, they
give ſome good teſtimony that they do deſire to honour God in
their hearing, and to get good by their hearing; and it is pity
that labour and pains ſhould be beſtowed and no profit but hurt
rather got by it, which God forbid: Therefore now I am to
ſpeak to a point that may help you ſo to hear, as may recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
all your labour and pains in hearing. In preaching to
thoſe that come to hear, that ſo they may get good and benefit
by it; there is a great deal more incouragement then to ſuch as
come in a formall way becauſe they uſe to come; therefore this
Point being a great point; I ſhall open it ſome what largely,
and ſhall caſt it into this Method:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall ſhew you that the hearing of Gods word is a
part of the Worſhip of God, for otherwiſe I could not ground it upon
any text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew you how we are to ſanctifie Gods Name
in the hearing of his word, either in regard of preparation unto it, or our
behaviour in the hearing of the Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why it is that God will be Sanctified in this ordinance
of his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> How God will Sanctifie himſelf in ſuch that do not
ſanctifie his name in the hearing of his Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> How God will Sanctifie his Name in waies of mercy to
thoſe that are carefull to Sanctifie his Name in the hearing of the
Word.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Five Principall things that concern this
Argument</p>
               <p>For the Firſt, That the hearing of Gods word it is a part of
Gods Worſhip. You heard in the opening of the worſhip of
God in the generall what it was, I told you it was a tendering
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:116352:64"/>
up of the creatures homage to God, a teſtimony of the reſpect
that the creature did owe to God; now if that be the nature of
Worſhip, certainly the hearing of Gods word it is a part of the
worſhip of God: for in the hearing of Gods word we</p>
               <p>1 Firſt do profeſſe our dependance upon God for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his mind and the way to eternall life: Every time we
come to hear the word, if we know what we do, we do thus
much, we do profeſſe that we do depend upon the Lord God
for the knowing of his mind, and the way and rule to eternall
life; we do as much as if we ſhould ſay, Lord, of our ſelves we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know thee, nor the way &amp; means how we ſhould come to be
ſaved, and therefore that we might teſtifie our dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee for this thing, we here preſent ourſelves before thee,
now this is a Teſtimony of the high reſpect wee owe to
God.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, The hearing of Gods Word is a part of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
becauſe in it we come to wait upon God in the way of an
Ordinance, to have that good conveyed to us by way of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
beyond what the thing is able in it ſelf to do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis worſhip. I wait upon God when I am hearing the
word if I know what I do) to have ſome ſpiritual good convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me beyond what there is in the meanes it ſelf, this makes
it worſhip. When I am buſied in natural and civil actions, there
I muſt profeſſe that theſe things can do me no good without
God, but I do not wait upon God in an ordinance for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
of naturall good beyond what God hath put into the
creature; tis his bleſſing with it, that God in the ordinary
courſe of his providence doth convey ſuch naturall or civill
good in the uſe of thoſe creatures. But now, when I come to
hear his word, I here come to wait upon God in the way of an
Ordinance for the conveyance of ſome ſpirituall good that this
Ordinance hath not in its ſelf, take it materially, but meerly
as it hath an inſtitution in it, and is appointed by God for
the conveyance of ſuch and ſuch things. God doth appoint
meat to nouriſh me, and together with his appointment
he hath given a natural power to meat to nouriſh my body that
in an ordinary courſe of providence is enough for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my body; but now when I come to hear the word, I
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:116352:65"/>
muſt look upon that not only as a thing appointed to work
upon my ſoul, and to ſave my ſoul by not as a thing that hath
any efficacy put into it in a naturall way as the other hath; its
not the nature of the thing that carries ſuch a power in it, but
it is the inſtitution of God, and the Ordinance of God in it;
Now then, when I come to wait upon God in an ordinance for
the ſpirituall good that is beyond the vertue of any creature to
convey to me, certainly I worſhip God, that is a ſpeciall part
of worſhip to wait upon God in this way; Therefore in theſe
two reſpects the hearing of Gods word it is a part of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God, and I beſeech you remember theſe two things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
time you come to hear. I come now to give a teſtimony
that I am not able to underſtand God and the way to eternall
life of my ſelf, but I do depend upon God for the knowledge of
it. And here I come to wait upon God for the conveyance of
that good to my ſoul that is not in the power of any creature to
convey: Now I worſhip when I do theſe.</p>
               <p>But further (you ſhall find it more plain when we come to
open how we ſhould ſanctifie Gods Name in the hearing of his
word) This is divine ſervice, as much as any ſervice can be
performed. Heretofore our Prelates and thoſe kind of men,
made all the Worſhip of God to be in their Divine Service (as
they call it) which was of their own inventions, and made
light of the preaching or hearing of the Word, but the Word
is a great part of that divine ſervice that God requires of us in
his Worſhip, and in it you do tender up your homage to God;
You therefore muſt not only when you come to hear, think, I
come to get ſomething, I come to underſtand more then I did,
and to hear ſuch a mans parts, and the like, but remember you
come to tender up your homage to God, to ſit at Gods feet and
there to profeſſe your ſubjection to him: That is one end of
your coming to hear sermons</p>
               <p>Now then you will ſay, What ſhould be done in the hearing
Gods Word, ſo as Gods Name may be Sanctified?</p>
               <p>For that as we opened in the generall, that in the duties of
Gods Worſhip there muſt be preparation, and then an anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
behaviour of the ſoul. So here there muſt firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſoul to this work, and then an anſwerable behaviour
of the ſoul in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:116352:65"/>
1 There muſt be a preparation of the Soul, ſo as when you
come to hear, you may with all readineſſe receive the Word;
the ſoul muſt be made ready, in <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. there it is ſaid, <hi>Theſe
were more noble then thoſe of</hi> Theſſalonica, <hi>in that they received the
Word with all readineſſe of mind:</hi> The word is, with all <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aerity,</hi>
as well as readineſſe: their minds were in a fit preparation to
receive the word: and the text ſaith, <hi>They were more noble:</hi> The
word thats tranſlated <hi>more noble,</hi> it ſignifie <hi>Better bred,</hi> for I do not
take this ſcripture, as if it were meant only of men that were
Earls or Lords, that did thus receive the Word with readineſſe,
but they were of a more noble diſpoſition, They were well bred
men, ſo the Greek word ſignifies. A man ſome times preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a company of rude people that never had any good bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
they will behave themſelves rudely, they ſlight the word,
and like the Swine, regard Acorns rather then Pearls: And the
word is ſeldome ſo profitable to a company of rude people that
have no breeding at all; but now there is more hopes to Preach
to men that have breeding: Men that are exerciſed in Arts and
Sciences, and have ſome underſtanding, and ſo ſome ingenuity
in them, they will hearken to reaſon. Now there is a great deal
of ſpiritual reaſon in the word, there is a great deal to convince
men that are but rationall men; let a man be but a rationall
man and willing to attend to the word, I ſay there is a great
deal of reaſon to convince him in it, and it is a ſign of good
breeding, of men of ingenuity to be willing to hear the Word,
Who are thoſe in a pariſh that ſo diſregard the word as not to
hear it, but the ruder ſort? There are many I confeſſe that are
men of parts perhaps the word doth not prevaile with their
hearts to convert them; yet if they have any good breeding at
all, if the Word be preached in a convincing way, ſo that they
ſee there is pains taken, and preached as the word of God to
them, they will vouch ſafe their preſence at leaſt: but the rude
multitude that know nothing at all, they had rather be in Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes
drinking and ſwilling they never care to hear the word,
as in ſuch a place as this there are very few of your miſerable
poor people that come to hear the Word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> What place is there
fuller of miſerable poor people then this place is and yet what
a poor appearance is thereof ſuch people at the hearing of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:116352:66"/>
Word? But now thoſe that have any ingenuity in them at all,
or any breeding (for ſo the word is) they will <hi>receive the word
with readineſſe:</hi> But this breeding here ſpoken of, was a little
higher then naturall breeding; They were ſpiritually noble,
&amp; ſo they had a readineſs in their hearts in receiving the word.
Now this readineſſe of heart in receiving the Word conſiſts in
theſe particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, When you come to hear the Word, if you would San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
Gods Name, you muſt poſſeſſe your ſouls with what it is
that you are going to hear, That what you are to hear is the
Word of God, That it is not the ſpeaking of a man that you
are going to attend upon: but that you are now going to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon God, and to hear the word of the eternall God.
Poſſeſſe your ſouls with this; you will never ſanctifie Gods
Name elſe in the hearing of his Word; therefore you find that
the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> he gives them the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why the word did them ſo much good as it did: It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they did hear it as the word of God 1 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 13. For this
cauſe alſo (ſaith he) thank we God without ceaſing, becauſe when ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the
word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
worketh alſo in you that beleeve,</hi> Mark, ſo it came effectually to
work, becauſe they received it as the word of God; many
times you will ſay, Come, let us go hear ſuch a man preach;
Oh no, let us go hear Chriſt preach, for as it doth concern the
Miniſters of God that they preach not themſelves, but that
Chriſt ſhould preach in them: So it concerns you that hear,
not to come to hear this man or that man, but to come to hear
Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>We as the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt do beſeech you,</hi> ſaith
the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>2 Poſſeſſe your hearts likewiſe with this conſideration, that
I come to heare the word as an ordinance appointed by God to
convey ſpiritual good to my ſoule, and this is a very uſefull
conſideration, and eſpecially it concernes men of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and parts for the helping of them to heare. For men that
are of underſtanding and parts, when they come to heare this
temptation is ready to come upon them, that except they hear
ſome new thing that they did not underſtand before wherefore
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:116352:66"/>
ſhould they come? I am able to underſtand as much in ſuch a
point as can be ſaid: And when I have come and heard many
times, I have heard but that I knew before, and upon that they
think there is no uſe of coming to hear: Now this is a great
miſtake, when you come to hear the word, you do not come
alwaies to hear what you did not know, it may be ſometimes
God may dart in ſome thing that you did not think of before,
or ſo fully underſtand, but ſuppoſe it be not ſo, you are to
come to it as an ordinance of God for the conveyance of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
good to your ſoules.</p>
               <p>You will ſay. Cannot we ſit at home and read a Sermon?
But hath God appointed that the great ordinance for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
and the edifying of ſoules in the way to eternal life?
True, there is ſome uſe of it, but the great ordinance is the
preaching of the word, faith comes by hearing, the Scripture
ſaith, and never by reading, So that though when you come to
hear, you do not hear that which you heard not before, yet you
come to attend upon this ordinance for the conveyance of ſome
Spirituall good that it may be hath not bin conveyed before,
or in a further degree then it hath bin conveyed before, And
ſo you ſhould come to hear the word with your hearts poſſeſt
with that meditation, that it is the word of God, and the
great ordinance that God hath appointed for the conveyance of
Spiritual good. So that I come now in obedience to God, and
in this do I teſtifie my reſpect to God, that I will attend upon
this ordinance of his for the conveyance of Spirituall good to
me, and although I may think that this or the other means
may do the deed as well, yet becauſe God hath appointed this
to be his ordinance, therefore in obedience to him I will attend
upon this means rather then upon other means, as you know
<hi>Naaman</hi> he thought the other waters would have bin as good
as the waters of Jordan to have heal'd him, but if God will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
him the waters of Jordan that they ſhould heal him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then other waters he muſt waſh there; No queſtion but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
waters had as much naturall vertue in them as they had,
but becauſe the waters of Jordan were the ordinance that God
for that time had appointed to cure his Leproſie withall, he
muſt come and waſh in thoſe waters rather then in any other,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:116352:67"/>
So becauſe preaching of the word is the great ordinance that
God hath appointed for to convay himſelfe by, therefore he
doth require that thou ſhouldeſt ſhew thy reſpect to him, ſo far
as to attend upon him in this ordinance.</p>
               <p>2 The Second thing that is to be done in way of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it is to plow up the fallow ground of your hearts, and not
to ſowe amongſt thornes, as you have it in <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 3. and ſo in
<hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> 10. The word of God you know is compared to ſeed in that
parable of Chriſt in <hi>Mar.</hi> 13. And an Auditory is compared to
the ground, I ſuppoſe you are al aquainted with that parable of
the ſower, that it is to ſet out the miniſtry of the word, and
what fruit it hath upon the hearts of men, a congregation is like
the field, and a miniſter preaching is like the ſower that ſows
the ſeed in the field: He knows not which truth whether that
or the other will proſper, the ſeed being ſowed in ſome part of
the ground it is loſt, and in another part it grows; ſo in one
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ew the ſeed of the word is loſt, and in another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ew it grows
up: But now if people that are compared to the ground would
ſo hear the word as Gods name may be ſanctified in it, their
hearts muſt be plowed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as if one ſhould ſow ſeed upon green
ſoil, ſow it in the fields upon green graſſe, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of it? The ground muſt firſt be plowed for the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſeed</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, what is the meaning of the plowing of
our hearts for the preparation of the word? The meaning is
nothing elſe but this The work of humiliation, the humbling
of the ſoul before the Lord when it doth come to hear Gods
word.</p>
               <p>Humble it in theſe two regards.</p>
               <p>Firſt be humbled for your ignorance that you know ſo little
of Gods mind as you do.</p>
               <p>Secondly be humbled for all the ſinfulneſſe of your hearts,
be ſenceable of the ſinfulneſſe and wretchedneſſe of your hearts
and the miſerable condition that you are in, if you can get
your hearts broken with the ſence of your ſin and miſery, and
come ſo to hear the word, it is very like the word may be of
mighty uſe, and Gods name may be very much Sanctified in
your hearing of the word.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:116352:67"/>
You will ſay, Muſt we plow up our hearts before we come
to hear? It muſt be the word that muſt plow us, the word is
the plow, and ſo the Miniſters of God are compared to plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the word, <hi>he that puts his hand to the plow and looks back
is not fit for the Kingdom of heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, it cannot be expected that the heart ſhould be
throughly plowed as it ought but by the word, therefore at
the firſt coming to hear there is not hope that men will Sanctifie
Gods name till the word gets in to plow them, and ſo by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at one time into their hearts they come to be prepared for
hearing at another time. And yet ſome what may be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by that natural knowledg that men have they may come to
know themſelves to be ſinners, and come to underſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be very weak and ignorant by ſome knowledg that
they may have by the works of God, and by conferrence with
others, and by reading and the like, and ſo they may in ſome
meaſure come to have their hearts to be humbled. And it is
good to make uſe of theſe to humble the heart, but now, You
that have heard the word often, and yet have not Sanctified
Gods name, there be truths that you have heard heretofore,
that if you had made uſe of in private to have, plowed up your
hearts, they would have prepared your hearts for the next
time in hearing of the word, If therefore you would hear the
word with a great deal more profit then formerly, your hearts
muſt be plowed by humiliation.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, the heart muſt be plowed by labouring to get
out thoſe thorns that are in the heart, thoſe luſts that grow
deep in the heart as thorns grow in the ground: labour to
pluck them out, that is, when thou comeſt to hear the word
get thy heart into that frame, as to be willing to profeſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
every known ſin that thou haſt found in thy heart, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to find out thoſe luſts that are in thy heart and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
againſt them, that thou art willing to have them to be
rooted out of thy heart, if men and women would but do thus
when they come to hear, that God might ſee this in them,
that they have before they come profeſt againſt every known ſin,
This would be an excellent thing indeed.</p>
               <p>3 Again in the third place which will follow from hence,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:116352:68"/>
When thou comeſt to hear the word, come with a Reſolution
to yeeld to what ever God ſhall reveal to be his mind, I am
now going to hear thy word oh Lord, to wait upon thee, to
know what thou haſt to ſay to me: And thou that art the
ſearcher of the ſecrets of all hearts, Thou knoweſt that I go
with ſuch a reſolution to yeeld up my ſelf to every truth of
thine, How would the name of God be Sanctified if you did
thus come to hear the word. If you did come with ſuch a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,

                     </gap>u me, and if
I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 3. you have a
propheſie of the Centils how they ſhould come to the word,
<hi>And many people ſhall go and ſay, Comeye, and let us go up to the
mountain of the Lord to the houſe of the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he will
teach us of his waies, and we will walk in his paths:</hi> Here is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
diſpoſition when you come to hear the word, Some of you
come together in ſtreets and lanes, and over the fields, when
you come together, and meet one with another as you walk o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the fields, make uſe of this text, Oh that this propheſie
might be fulfilled in your coming over the fields every Lords
day morning and at other times, that you would ſay one to
another, or when you call one upon another to go to hear,
<hi>Come let us go up to the houſe of the Lord and he will teach us of his
waies and we will walk in his paths.</hi> We are reſolved that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Lord ſhall teach us to be his waies we will ſubmit unto
it. This is a due preparation of the heart for the Sanctifying
of Gods name in the hearing of his word.</p>
               <p>4 When you come to hear the word come with longing deſires
after the word, come with an appetite to it. As in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2.
<hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincear milk of the word that you may
grow thereby.</hi> Do it as new born babes, Now you know little
babes they do not deſire milk to play withall but only to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
them: Children of three or four yeers old, they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
milk to play with but new born babes never care for it but
when they are hungry to nouriſh them, And ſo it is true, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
come to hear the word to play with it, But now you ſhould
come to hear the word as new born babes, with a hungring
deſire after the word that your Souls may be nouriſhed thereby.
That were excellent if every Lords day, and at other daies you
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:116352:68"/>
did come as hungry to the word as ever you went to your din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or ſupper, The word of God ſhould be to you <hi>more then your
appointed food,</hi> And then you are like to grow by it and to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
Gods name in it.</p>
               <p>5 Pray before hand, that God would open thine eyes, and
open thine heart, and accompany his word, thus did <hi>David,
Open mine eyes O Lord, that I may underſtand the wonders of thy Law.</hi>
And you know what is ſaid of <hi>Lydia, The Lord opened her heart
to attend to the word that was ſpoken:</hi> Now ſeeing it is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
thou doeſt expect more good from, then what it ſelf of
its own nature is able to convey; thou hadeſt need to Pray,

expect that is, to have my heart ſpoken too, and quickned,
and to have mine eyes opened, but O Lord open mine eyes and
open mine heart Lord my heart naturally is lockt up againſt
thy Word, there are ſuch wards in my heart, that except thou

Man he is not able to know my heart, and therefore he
cannot fit a key to anſwer every ward, to reſolve every doubt,
to ſilence every objection but Lord thou canſt do it: Do thou
Lord therefore fit thy word this day that may meet with my
heart Lord, I have gone often to thy Word, and the key hath
ſtuck in it and it hath not opened; but Lord, if thou wouldeſt
but fit it and turn it with thine own hand, my heart would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
Oh come with ſuch a praying heart to the Word, and
thereby ſhalt thou ſanctifie the Name of God in hearing his
Word, this is to come to the Word, as to the Word of God,
you muſt not come to the hearing of the Word as to hear a
ſpeech or an oration, but come in ſuch a preparation as this
is, and ſo I ſay God will be glorified, and you will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited</p>
               <p>The next thing is, what ſhould be the behaviour of the Soul
in the Sanctifying Gods Name in the Word when it is come,
Now to that there are theſe particulars:</p>
               <p>1 Firſt there muſt be a carefull attention unto the Word,
you muſt ſet your hearts unto it, as <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 46 he ſaid
unto the people. <hi>Set your hearts unto all the words which I teſtifie
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:116352:69"/>
among you this day, which you ſhall command your Children to obſerve
to do, for it is not a vain thing for you, becauſe it is your life.</hi> Set
your hearts to it, for it is not a vain thing, it is your life; when
you come to hear the word give diligent attention to what you
hear. In <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 6. it is ſaid, <hi>The people with one accord gave heed
unto thoſe things which</hi> Philip <hi>ſpake. They gate heed,</hi> The word is
uſed often in Scripture, ſometimes it is uſed for to beware of a
thing, <hi>Beware of the leven of the Phariſees,</hi> Beware of them; as a
man when he ſees an enemy and is aware of him, he is very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
to obſerve how to avoid him; So there ſhould be as much
diligence to get good by the Word, as one would be diligent to
avoid any danger whatſoever, And the word ſignifies ſometimes
to give ſuch heed as a Diſciple gives unto his Maſter, ſo they gave
heed to the Word. So in <hi>Prov. 2. 1, 2. My Son, if thou wilt receive my
words and hide my commandments with thee, ſo that thou incline thine
eare unto wiſdome:</hi> We muſt diligently attend, and not to ſuffer
our eyes &amp; our thoughts to be wandring, but diligently attend
to what is ſaid: My Brethren, there is all things that may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
attention in the Word. What would make you to
attend to any thing?</p>
               <p>Firſt if he that ſpeaks were much above you If it were a great
Prince, or Lord that ſpake to you, then you would attend Now,
though it is true, it is but a man, that it may be, is inferiour to
moſt of you, that ſpeaks, yet know in him it is the Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth that ſpeaks to you: And ſo you know what
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that heareth you heareth me:</hi> So though you
would not attend in reſpect of the Meſſenger ſo much, yet as it
is the Son of God that is ſpeaking to you, it may challenge
your attention. This day if you ſhould hear a voice out of the
clouds from heaven ſpeaking to you, would you not then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten?
the truth is, we ſhould liſten as much to the voice of God
in the Miniſtery of his Word, as if ſo be that the Lord ſhould
ſpake out of the clouds to us. And I will give you a Scripture
for that, that the voice of God in his Word ſhould be as much
regarded of you, as if God ſhould ſpeak from heaven to you by
an audible voice out of the clouds. In 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 18, 19. This voice
which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ount.</hi> But mark, in verſ. 19. <hi>We have alſo a mere ſure Word of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:116352:69"/>
Propheſie whereunto ye do well that ye take heed.</hi> Mark; We heard
a voice from heaven, ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> yea but <hi>we have a more ſure word
of Propheſie whereunto ye do well that ye take heed.</hi> There was a voice
from heaven ſpake, you will ſay, If we had heard that voice,
we would have given heed to that, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>You have
a more ſure word of Propheſie:</hi> Now propheſie in Scripture is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for preaching, <hi>Diſpiſe not Propheſie:</hi> As if the Holy Ghoſt
ſhould ſay, You muſt have regard to the word of Propheſie as
you would have regard to any voice from heaven: Suppoſe an
Angel ſhould come and ſpeak to you, would not you attend to
him? then whatſoever thoughts you had, they would be taken
off, for there is an Angel that is come down from heaven to
ſpeak: Now mark what is ſaid in <hi>Heb. 1. 1. God who at ſundry
times, and in divers manners ſpake in times paſt to the Fathers by the
Prophets, hath in theſe laſt daies ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he
hath appointed heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the worlds.</hi> And
then in verſ. 3. he deſcribes his Son, <hi>And being made ſo much
better then the Angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
name then they:</hi> If a Prophet ſhould come and ſpeak, that
is not ſo much as if the Son of God comes; no nor as if an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
ſhould come, for Jeſus Chriſt hath obtained a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
name then the Angels, and it is Chriſt that is in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of his Word, <hi>He that heareth you heareth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Secondly, That which would cauſe attention, is the greatnes
of the matter propounded: It is true, if a man ſhould ſpeak of
ſome flight and vain things, there need not ſo much attention.
My Brethren, the matters in the Word are the great things of
God, it is the voice of God, the great Myſteries of godlineſſe,
thoſe deep things that the Angels themſelves deſire to pry into;
Yea the Angels themſelves by the Churches they come to have
the knowledge of the Myſteries of God. I make no queſtion but
in the Miniſtery of the Word among the Churches the Angels
they attend and come to ſome knowledge in the Myſteries of
godlineſſe; for ſo the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That they have it by the
Churches,</hi> there the greateſt things of Gods will, the greateſt
Counſels of God that were kept hid from all eternity, are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to you in the Miniſtry of the Word: We do not come to tell
you tales, and the conceits of men, but to open the great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:116352:70"/>
of God, wherein the depth of the wiſdome of God comes
to be revealed to the children of men, and therefore this cals for
attention.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdly, Suppoſe they be great things, yet if they do not
ſo much concern us, there is no ſuch great reaſon of attention,
therefore in the Third place, That which we ſpeak, it is your
life; it is that concerns your Souls and eternall eſtates: Your
Souls and everlaſting eſtates do lie upon the Miniſtery of the
Word, if that be made effectuall to you, you are ſav'd: if that
be not made effectuall to you, you are damn'd and undone for
ever. If we ſhould come to tell you of ſomething whereby you
might get ſome good bargain, or of a way how to get great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
I make no queſtion but you would riſe though it were a
cold or rainy morning: But know when you are called to hear
the Word you are called to hear that which may do you good
for ever, that for which you may bleſſe God for to all eternity
with the Angels and Saints in the higheſt heavens. If they
be ſuch things of ſo great concernment, then there had
need be a great attention: You know what Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi>

                     </gap> that good part which
ſhall not be taken away from her.</hi> What did <hi>Mary</hi> chooſe? It
was this, That ſhe did diligently attend upon Jeſus Chriſt to
hear the word from his own mouth, when <hi>Martha</hi> was buſied
in the houſe to provide for his entertainment but it is a better
thing to attend upon the word then to entertain Chriſt in your
houſes: You that are of loving diſpoſitions, that if a good
Miniſter ſhall come to your houſes, or a good Chriſtian, that
you ſee but the Image of Chriſt in your hearts ſpring within
you, and you will do any thing to entertain them: Well, but
what if Jeſus Chriſt ſhould come, if you knew that ſuch a man
that came within your doors were the Son of God, how would
you beſtir your ſelves to entertain him? But know, it is a more
acceptable ſervice to Jeſus Chriſt to attend upon his word then
to provide for him in your houſes And there is great reaſon to,
that we ſhould be diligent in drawing nigh to the word, and
give eare unto it; becauſe you find that the Lord doth expreſſe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:116352:70"/>
himſelf in the Scripture, how he gives eare to us when we ſpeak
to him. God is ſaid to incline his eare, ſometimes to open his
eare, ſometimes to bow his eare, ſometimes to cauſe his eare to
hear, and divers ſuch expreſſions there are to that purpoſe.
Now if God when we that are poor wretches ſpeak to him, ſhall
bow his eare bend his eare open his eare, cauſe his eare to hear,
much more ſhould we when we come to attend upon him.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly as there muſt be attending to the word of God,
ſo there muſt be an opening of the heart to receive what God
ſpeaks to you, it is true, it is the work of God to open the
heart, but God works upon men as upon rationall creaturs
and he makes you to be active in opening your hearts, ſo that
when you have any truth come to be revealed, you ſhould open
your underſtandings, your conſcience, and will, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Oh Lord thy truth which thou art preſenting here to my
Soul at this time let it come in, let me receive it, as the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is in <hi>Prov. 2 1. My Son, if thou wilt receive my words</hi> and then in
v. 10. <hi>When wiſdom entereth into thy heart:</hi> The words of wiſdom
the words of God, they muſt enter into the heart, get in; it
may be they get into thy eare, but that's not enough, they
muſt get into thy heart, in <hi>Joh</hi> 8. 37. There Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
that his word had no place in them, that's a ſad thing
when the word of God ſhall have no place in the heart. If a
temptation to ſin comes, that hath a place in the heart, but
when the Word comes that hath no place in the heart; I ſay, it
is a very ſad thing that we can find no room for the Word; we
ſhould get room for the Word, Open ye gates, <hi>Stand open ye
everlaſting doors, that the King of Glory may come in:</hi> Know that
when you come to hear the Word, the Lord is knocking at the
doors of your hearts; have not you felt it ſometimes? Open,
O open the doors, let all be opened to receive the Word into
your hearts. That is the Second thing for the behaviour of the
Soul in hearing.</p>
               <p>3 The third thing is the carefull applying of the word, ſo
in <hi>Pro.</hi> 2. 2. There muſt be an applying of the heart to the
word, and an applying of the word unto the heart. All action
is by an application of the thing that doth act unto the ſubject,
there muſt be an application of the word to thy ſoul, as now,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:116352:71"/>
ſuppoſe thou comeſt to hear the word, and thou heareſt of
ſome ſin, that it may be thou knoweſt thou art guilty of, take
the word and lay it to thy heart and ſay, The Lord hath met
with my ſoul this day, the Lord hath ſpoken to me, to the
end that I might be humbled for this ſin, and the other ſin that
my Conſcience tels me I am guilty of, So, doth the Lord put
thee upon a duty that concerns thee? acknowledge this, the Lord
hath ſpoken to me this day and put me upon the reformation
of my family, and the reformation of my own heart. Is there
a word preſented? apply that, and let not the trouble of thy
heart cauſe thee to caſt off that word that God hath ſpoken to
thee; The application of the word to the heart it is of marvelons
uſe, and it concerns not only Miniſters in general to lay before
people the doctrine of the Goſpel but to aply it, And know
that it concerns you as well as Miniſtrs to apply it; And not
only when they come to that that is called uſe, but all the way
in the opening of the word, it concerns you all to apply it to
your own ſouls, and to conſider how doth it concern me in
particular? My brethren there is no ſuch way to honour
God, or get good to your owne ſouls, as the application of the
word unto your ſelves. As a man that is aſleep if there be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſe
made it will not awake him ſo ſoon, but come and call
him by his name (and ſay <hi>John,</hi> or <hi>Thomas,</hi>) and that will
awake him ſooner then a greater noiſe will; So, when the
word makes a noiſe when it is delivered only in the general,
men take little notice of it, but when the word comes particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to the ſouls of men, and doth as it were call them by
name, this awakens them; now God many times doth ſpeak to
your hearts but you ſhould apply it, you know the word is
compared to meat, and it muſt be applyed to the body, Then
do we worſhip God in a right way when as we take notice of
Gods word as concerning us in particular, as that notable
Scripture that you have in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 25. Where there comes a
poor man into the Church of God, and hears Propheſying,
hears the word opened, and the text ſaith <hi>He is convinced of all,
he is judged of all,</hi> and then in verſ. 25, <hi>Thus are the ſecrets of his
heart manifeſt and ſo falling down on his face he worſhips God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
that God is in you of a truth,</hi> that is, when the word comes
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:116352:71"/>
and meets with his Soul in particular, that he finds himſelf to
be aim'd at by the word, then he worſhips God, and ſaith
that God certainly is in them, here's the reaſon now that when
you come to hear the word you do not worſhip God becauſe
you apply it not to your ſelves, you are ready to ſay, This was
well ſpoken to ſuch a one, and it concerns ſuch a one, but how
doth it concern thy ſoul in particular? Sometimes the Lord
doth even force men and women to apply it whether they will
or no, for that they think the Miniſter ſpeaks to them in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and that no body was ſpoken too in the Congregation
but themſelves; This is a Mercy when the Lord doth it unto
you; but it is a greater Mercy when the Lord gives you a heart
to apply it to your ſelves, and although it may trouble you
a little for the preſent, yet be willing to apply it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it a great Mercy from the Lord, That the Lord will be
pleaſed to ſpeak in particular to your Souls.</p>
               <p>4 Fourthly, We muſt mix Faith with the Word, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it will do us but little good; Apply it and then beleeve it.
In <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. it is ſaid, that <hi>The word preached did not profit them,
not being mixed with Faith in them that heard it.</hi> Wherefore there
muſt be a mixture of Faith, to beleeve the word that the Lord
brings unto you. Now concerning that Ile but propound theſe
few particulars;</p>
               <p>You will ſay, Muſt we beleeve every thing that is ſpoken?
ſometimes there are ſome things ſpoken that we cannot tell
how to beleeve?</p>
               <p>I do not mean ſo, to beleeve every thing meerly being ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
for you muſt take heed <hi>what</hi> you hear, as well as <hi>how</hi> you
hear; but do thus much at leaſt.</p>
               <p>1 In the Firſt place, whatſoever comes in the name of God
to you, (except you know certainly it is not according to the
written Word) you owe ſo much reſpect to it, as to examine it,
at leaſt to try it whether it be ſo or no, as it is ſaid of thoſe Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
men that I ſpake of, that they did examine whether things
were ſo or no. Do not caſt off any thing preſently that comes
in the Name of God: Now any thing that hath the broad Seal
upon it, you muſt not diſobey: You will ſay, It may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit:
but do not diſobey it till you be ſure it be counterfeit.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:116352:72"/>
Oh that men would give but this reſpect to all things that they
hear, never to caſt them off till they have examined and tryed
whether they be ſo or no.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, Do but grant this reſpect to the Word that is
ſpoken to you, as to think thus, What if all that I hear ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
againſt my fin, which laies open the dangerous condition
that my ſoul is in, prove to be true, what a caſe were I in then?
This hath been the beginning of the converſion of many Souls,
the having but ſuch a thought as this, It may be things are not
ſo terrible as I hear, but what if they do prove ſo? then I am
undone for ever. Dare I venture my Soul and my eternal eſtate
upon hopes that theſe things are not ſo bad as I hear? I beleeve
if you would put your ſelves to it, you would think it a bold
adventure, and the comfort that any of you have grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, meerly hoping that things are not ſo bad as you hear;
it is a curſed comfort that hath no ſure bottome: Grant that
reſpect therefore to the word.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdly conſider this, It may be I do not ſee cleerly that
theſe things are ſo which are delivered, I do not ſee enough to
beleeve them now, but what if I were now dying? What if I
were now going to receive the ſentence of my eternall doome;
would I not then beleeve theſe things? Would I not then
think what I hear out of the word to be true? It is an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for men to reject the word while they have their healths,
and proſperity. But if you were to die, and upon your ſick and
death bed if you ſaw the infinite ocean of eternity before you,
what would you ſay then? were the word true yea or no?
would you give beleif unto the ſuggeſtions of the Devill then?
We find it by experience, That men that could eaſily caſt off the
word in their healths, yet when they have come to ly upon their
ſick bed, and death bed, they found the word true: Beleeve it
now as well as then.</p>
               <p>4 Conſider, If thou doeſt not beleeve, what a caſe art thou
in? Am I worſe then the Devils themſelves? The Scripture tels
me, <hi>That the Devils beleeve and tremble;</hi> Why Lord do I come to
hear Sermons, and am I more hard to beleeve then the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
themſelves? They do beleeve that word that I caſt off,
and they tremble at it, but my Soul is not at all ſtirred, as if
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:116352:72"/>
there were no reallity in ſuch things that have been ſpoken to
me. There be other things which may further help us towards
beleeving of the word of God, but theſe ſhall ſuffice: And
certainly my brethren till we come to this to beleeve the word
though we ſhould ſit under it many years, it will do us little
good, and we ſhall never Sanctifie the Name of God in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of it.</p>

But only now we quote the place for this, <hi>Receive with meekneſs
the ingrafted word which is able to ſave your ſouls.</hi> Let there be a
quietneſſe in your Spirits in attending upon the word, no hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
There is a twofold diſtemper of paſſion in many people
that is a great hinderance to the profit of the Word, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
Gods Name in hearing it.</p>
               <p>1 The Firſt is a diſtemper of Paſſion in thoſe that have ſome
trouble of conſcience in them, they are troubled for their fin,
and their Spirits are in a diſcontented froward humour becauſe
they have not that comfort that they do deſire, and therefore
the Word of God when it comes to be preached to them, if it
doth not every way ſuit with their hearts, and if they do not
find preſent comfort by it, their Spirits are in a diſtemper and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:116352:73"/>
frowardneſſe, and caſt it off; and if at any time there be never
ſuch comfortable things ſpoken in the word, yet there is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in their ſpirits becauſe they are not able to apply the Word
to themſelves, and they think, This doth not concern me: now
there ſhould be meekneſſe of Spirit in thoſe that are in trouble
of conſcience above all; they ſhould quietly attend upon the
Word, and wait for the time that God will ſpeak peace to their
conſciences: And if I cannot find the Word ſuitable to me at
this time, yet I may at another time: let me atend with meeknes,
let me receive everything with meekneſſe the Word is above me,
and if ever I have good, it muſt be by the word at laſt. It doeth
much concern thoſe that are in trouble of Conſcience to have
meeke Spirits.</p>
               <p>2 There is another diſtemper in others and that is worſe;
that is, Such as when they find the word come neer unto them,
relating thoſe ſins that their conſciences tels them they are
guilty of, their hearts riſe againſt God, and his Word, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
too: Becauſe it would pluck away ſome beloved cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
becauſe it rebukes them for ſome haunt of evill, ſome
diſtemper of heart that they have been or are guilty of, it puts
a ſhame upon them, and therefore their hearts do riſe againſt
it. It is a dreadfull thing to have the heart riſe againſt the
Word. As we read of that froward Prince <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> in the
Propheſie of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that when the Roll was read in his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſitting in the winter time by a great fire, he tooke a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife
and cut it a pieces and threw it into the fire in anger; and
I have read that the Jewes kept a Faſt every year to mourne for
that great ſin, &amp; yet this <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> was the Son of <hi>Joſiah</hi> whoſe
heart did melt at the hearing of the Word, he had an humble
and a meek heart when the Law was read, and yet ſee what a
different Spirit <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> had either from his Father or grand-Father.
It is a great diſhonour to the name of God for men to
give liberty to their Paſſions to riſe againſt the Word; take
heed of Paſſion either while you are hearing the Word, or after
the Word, as many of you when you are diſcontented with
what is ſaid. When you come in company, what a fury are
many men in upon the hearing of ſome things in the word that
comes cloſe to their hearts; Remember when you are a hearing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:116352:73"/>
of the Word that it is that which is above you, and it is not fit
for one that is an inferiour to ſhew himſelf Paſſionate in the
preſence of a Superiour: It is true, the Miniſters they may be
in as low a condition as you, and in a lower; but the word
they ſpeak, it is above all the Princes and Monarchs upon the
face of the earth; and it is fit therefore we having to deal with
God that we ſhould behave our ſelves in a meeke diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>6 The next thing for the Sanctifying Gods name in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the word is this, we muſt hear it with a trembling heart,
with fear as well as meekneſſe, and for that you have that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Scripture in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. begining. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the
Heaven is my Throne, and the Earth is my footſtool wher is the houſe
that ye build unto me, and where is the place of my reſt? For all thoſe
things hath my hand made, and all thoſe things have been ſaith the
Lord, but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a
contrite ſpirit and trembleth at my word.</hi> this is a moſt admirable
Scripture. Marke how God lifts up himſelf in his glory, ſo
great a God as the Heaven is my Throne, and the Earth is my
footſtool where is that houſe that ye will build unto me? but
then may a poor Soul ſay, how ſhall I be able to ſtand before
this God that is ſo glorious? Saith God, be not diſcouraged
Poor Soul who doeſt tremble at my word, for I look to you;
And then this is a further thing obſervable that God hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to that ſoul that trembles at his word, rather then to any
that ſhould build the moſt ſumptuous buildings in the world
for him, for ſaith God here, the Heaven is my Throne, and
the Earth is my footſtool, where is the houſe that ye build un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me and where is the place of my reſt? they have built a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Temple to God, but what do I regard that ſaith God? I
regard one that trembls at my word more then that great houſe
that you have built unto me, it is a notable Scripture to ſhew
what a high reſpect God hath to one that trembles at his word,
he regards them more then this glorious Temple, that was
built unto him, If you were able to build ſuch a place as this
was for the ſervice of God, you would think it a great matter,
it is not ſo much regarded as if you could bring a trembling
heart to Gods word, that's a ſpecial thing wherein the Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:116352:74"/>
of the name of God conſiſts, when we come to ſee the
dreadfull authority that there is in the word of God, when we
are able to ſee more glory of God in his word then in all the
works of God beſides, for there is more of his glory in the word
then there is in the whole Creation of Heaven and Earth, take
the Sun, and Moon and Stars, you that are Marriners you
have ſeen much of the glory of God abroad that one would
think might ſtrik terrour into all your hearts, but know that
there is more of the dreadfulneſſe of Gods name in his word
then in all his works; In <hi>Pſal. 138. 2. Thou haſt magnified thy
word above all thy name,</hi> the word it is magnified above all the
name of God whatſoever, and it is a very good ſign of a
Spirituall inlightened Soul that can ſee the name of God more
magnified in his word then in all his works beſides; I appeal
unto your conſciences in this thing, have you ever ſeen the
name of God to be more magnified in his word then in all his
works? I may with very good confidence affirm this that there
is no godly Soul upon the face of the earth, that hath the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
degree of grace but hath ſeen more of the glory of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in his word, then he hath ſeen in all the works of God
beſides, and his heart hath been more taken with it, It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
therefore a trembling frame of heart when we hear it.</p>
               <p>And then further when this is conſidered that the word is
that that bindeth the Soul over either to life or death, mens e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
eſtates are to be caſt by the world, certainly then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a trembling heart to hear that by which the eternal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
of man is to be caſt, we do not Sanctifie Gods name when
we come to hear the word, except we come with trembling
hearts, and they are the moſt likely of all men and women to
underſtand the mind of God, as for ſuch as come with conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſpirits that they underſtand as much before they come, and
think their reach of wit or capacity is beyond the capacity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that ſhall open the word unto them (yet that were not ſo
much if it did but only reſt upon the man and not reflect upon
the word it ſelf) Now theſe that are rich in their own thoughts
and underſtandings are ſent empty away, but thoſe that come
with trembling hearts to the word, they are the men that are
like to underſtand Gods Counſels revealed in his word. In
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:116352:74"/>
                  <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 2, 3. Shechaniah <hi>the Son of</hi> Iehiel <hi>one of the Sons of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam
<hi>anſwerd &amp; ſaid unto</hi> Ezra, <hi>we have tranſgreſſed againſt our God &amp;
have taken ſtrange wives &amp;c. Yet now there is hope in Iſrael concerning
this thing, now therefore let us make a covenant with our God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the counſel of my lord and of thoſe that tremble at the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our God;</hi> ſo that thoſe that tremble at Gods word are
ſuch as are fiteſt to counſel, they underſtand moſt of Gods mind;
and that's another particular of the behaviour of the Soul in
Sanctifiying Gods name in hearing his word.</p>
               <p>7 The next is an humble ſubjection to the word that we hear,
our hearts muſt bow to it, muſt lie under the word that we hear,
it is a very remarkable Scripture that we have in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 12.
There it is ſaid concerning a great King <hi>Zedekiah, He did that
which was evil in the ſight of the Lord, his God, and humbled not
himſelf before</hi> Jeremiah <hi>the prophet, ſpeaking from the mouth of the
Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> It it a very ſtrange expreſſion as any we have in the book
of God, that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> a great King ſhould be charged with this
as a great ſin that he did not humble himſelf, humble himſelf
before whom you will ſay? we are bound to humble our ſelves
before God, but here it is that he did not humble himſelf before
<hi>Jeremiah</hi> the prophet; Why before the prophet? <hi>Becauſe he ſpake
from the mouth of the Lord.</hi> If it be any meſſenger that ſpeaks
from the mouth of the Lord, God expects that we ſhould hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our ſelves, ſo that if any truth comes to be delivered unto
you, the Lord expects that you ſhould fal down and yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to it, whatſoever your thoughts, your judgments,
your opinions have heretofore been, if there come any thing
in the word agianſt it you muſt ſubmit your judgments, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
your very conſciences, you muſt ſubmit your wills, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
your hearts have been ſet upon, though it hath been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo contentfull to your ſpirits before, yet now ſubmit, and
yeeld though it go never ſo croſſe unto your minds, your wils,
your ends, yet all muſt be ſubmitted, and laid down flat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the word, ſo as to be willing to deny your ſelves of any
thing in the world. When a man or woman can ſay thus,
Lord it is true, I confeſſe before I heard thy word opened in
the evidence and demonſtration of the ſpirit unto me, I was
of ſuch a mind, and my heart went after ſuch and ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:116352:75"/>
and I though it was impoſſible that ever my heart
ſhould be taken from them, but Oh Lord thou haſt been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
plainly to ſhew to me by the opening of thy word in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of thy ſpirit, what thy mind is; Now whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of my name, of my comforts, of my contentments in
this world, Lord here I caſt down all before thee, I ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy word; this is a gracious frame. Now is the name of God
extoll'd, and lifted up in hearing of the word, the name of God
is Sanctified in ſuch a work of ſpirit as this is. I have read of a
Germain Divine writing to <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> another famous
German Divine, he hath this expreſſion, Oh let the word of God
come, &amp; though we had 600. necks we would al ſubmit them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the word of God ſaith he. So it ſhould be the temper of ſuch
as hear the word and deſire to Sanctifie Gods name in it, let
the word of God come this morning, let God ſpeak and we
will ſubmit had we 600. necks, we will ſubmit all we are, or
have, to this word of the Lord, it is the word of God, that we
are willing ſhould triumph over us: To have a congregation
to lie down under the word of God that is preached to them is
a moſt excellent thing, and Gods name is much Sanctified, we
do not brethren deſire you ſhould lie under us, we are not only
willing, but we are very deſirous that you would examin what
we ſpeak to you, whether it be according to the word of God
or no. But look to it, that if we do ſpeak to you that which
is the word from the mouth of the Lord, know then that God
expects that you ſhould ſubmit your eſtates, your ſouls, your
bodies, all that you are and have to this word, and that is
another particular in the Sanctifying of the name of God in
hearing the word; there muſt be an humble ſubmiſſion of the
ſoul unto it.</p>
               <p>8 Another particular wherein the behaviour of the Soul
for the Sanctifying of Gods name conſiſts is this, The word it
muſt be received with love, and with joy, it is not enough
for you to be convinct of the authority of it, and to think thus,
well I muſt yeeld to it, this is the word of God and if I do not
yeeld to it I muſt expect the plagues and judgements of God to
follow it that is not enough, but you muſt yeeld to it with
love, and with joy, except you receive the word with love
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:116352:75"/>
and with joy it is not Sanctified; you do not Sanctifie Gods
Name, nor is it ſanctified unto you. You muſt receive the word
not only as the true word of the Lord, but as the good word of
the Lord. In <hi>Theſſalon.</hi> 2. 10. we find it to be the cauſe of mens
being given over to a ſpirit of delution, <hi>Becauſe they received not
the word of God in Love:</hi> It is ſpoken of Antichriſt, that at his
coming he ſhall come with all deceivableneſſe, and he ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with them that periſh, who are they? <hi>They that receive not the
love of the truth that they might be ſaved.</hi> It is not enough my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to receive the truth that we might be ſaved; but we mnſt
receive the love of the truth if ever we would be ſaved; Good
is the word of the Lord to my ſoul. And we muſt receive it with
joy too as well as with love; <hi>Prov. 2. 10. When wiſdome entereth
into thy heart, and knowledge is pleaſant unto thy Soul: Then diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhall preſerve thee, underſtanding ſhall keep thee, &amp;c.</hi> That is a great
matter, when the word reveals ſome truth to thy underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and thou canſt ſo receive it as it ſhould be pleaſant to thy
ſoul, that thy ſoul rejoyces in it; it is a good word, it is that
that doth me good at the heart, when a people can hear the
word, and the word coming neer unto them, they can ſay, This
word doth me good at the heart, it is pleaſant to my ſoul, that
is excellent. In <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41. the godly are deſcribed, thoſe that
did receive the word ſo as to ſanctifie Gods Name in it; by this,
that <hi>they gladly received the word and were baptized, and the ſame day
there were added unto them about three thouſand ſouls.</hi> There were
three thouſand in one day that did gladly receive the word;
What an auditory had <hi>Peter</hi> at this time? Then the word it did
them good, when they gladly received it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But it may be ſaid, We read in <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. of the ſtony ground,
the hearers that were not good and did not profit by the word ſo as to be
ſaved, yet they received the word with joy. And <hi>Herod</hi> it is ſaid of him,
That he heard <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> gladly: It ſeems then that it is not enough
to receive it with gladneſſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I Anſwer Firſt, There muſt be that that Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
may have, if there be want of that, we cannot Sanctifie
Gods Name. But you will ſay, We muſt go further or elſe
Gods Name is not ſanctified: That I confeſſe; Therefore when
I ſpeak of gladneſſe and joy, know that I mean another kind of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:116352:76"/>
joy then the ſtony ground had; and ſo certainly the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that is ſpoken of in <hi>Prov.</hi> which I mentioned before; And
the gladneſſe that the three thouſand did receive the Word
withall is different from the gladneſſe of the ſtony ground. If
you ask me wherein it differs? I would Anſwer it differs thus,
The gladneſſe of an Hypocrite in receiving Gods Word, it ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
either from the novelty of it, becauſe it is a new thing, and
he gets new notions that he had not before, or elſe he is joyful
from ſome other carnal excellencies that he finds going toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the word, ſome eſteem or honour that he ſhall get by
it, ſome ſelviſhneſſe there is that makes his heart to be glad,
for there is a great deal of natural and carnal excellency that
goes along many times with the word. But now this gladneſſe
that is ſpoken of in the <hi>Acts</hi> and in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> it is the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that ariſeth from the apprehenſion of the ſpirituall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
that there are in the word, as that it is that word that
reveals God and Chriſt to my ſoul; that word that comes neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
to my ſoul to the mortifying of my Luſts, and the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my heart: This is that which makes me rejoyce in the
word, the holineſſe and the ſpirituall excellencie that I ſee to
be in the word: <hi>Thy word is pure</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and therefore doth
thy ſervant love it and rejoyce in it.</hi> This no Hypocrite can ſay;
I ſee the Image of God in his Word, I ſee the very glaſſe of Gods
holineſſe in his word, I feel that in the word that may bring my
Soul to God, wherein my ſoul injoyes communion with God
and Jeſus Chriſt, and it is this that glads my ſoul. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the word with joy thus, we ſhall come to Sanctifie the
Name of God in the hearing of it; And that is the Eight par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>9 The Ninth Particular is this, If we would Sanctifie the
Name of God in his word, we muſt receive the Word into ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
hearts. This you have in <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 15. in the Parable of the
Sower; you ſhall find there that there are divers grounds that
do receive the ſeed; and by thoſe divers grounds are meant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ſorts of hearers: There is Firſt the high-way ground, that
is, ſuch as hear the word and never regard what they hear, and
as ſoon as ever they go out of the Congregation the ſeed of the
Word is quite gone and is as if they had not heard at all. And
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:116352:76"/>
then there is the ſtony ground, and the thorny ground, that is,
thoſe that hear with joy (as was ſpoken of before) but the cares
of the world choak the ſeed of the word; as ſoon as ever they
are gone, they are upon their worldly buſineſſe, and their
thoughts and hearts runs that way. But then there is the good
ground, that is, Thoſe that receive the ſeed of the Word into a
good and honeſt heart, a good and an honeſt heart they are
both joyned together. By a good heart is meant a heart that
hath not malice in it, a heart that doeth deſire to empty it ſelf
of every thing that is againſt the Word, and which is not ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the ſpiritualneſſe of the Word: A heart I ſay that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines
nothing in it that any way makes againſt the word:
<hi>A good heart</hi> is a heart which (as the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21.
and that place may very well come in here to be opened) is
<hi>clenſed from all filthineſſe and ſuperfluity of naughtineſſe.</hi> The word
that is there tranſlated <hi>filthineſſe</hi> it ſignifies Excrements; that
which is unclean, that which comes from the body, ſuch is the
ſinfulneſſe of your hearts; you come to hear the word, if it be
with evil hearts you mingle that very filthineſſe which is as vile
before God as excrements are: <hi>And ſuperfluity of naughtineſſe;</hi> by
that I take is meant, as if the holy Ghoſt ſhould ſay, Do not
think it enough for to purge away filthineſſe, that is notorious
ſtinking evils, abominable ſins, that you do not come with ſuch
filthy vile hearts, but whatſoever there is in your heart that is
any way againſt the work of Grace, it is a ſuperfluity of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe,
all kind of evill thoughts, and evill affections that are
more then needs. Look into your hearts and affections, and
ſee whatſoever you find there that is more then ought to be,
runing out unto any thing that they ſhould not, labour to
purge out that ſaith he, do not ſatisfie yourſelves in any kind of
evill whatſoever: It may be you are clenſed from the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
evils of the World; but if there remaines any naughtineſſe,
any kind of droſſineſſe in your hearts that is not grace, it is to
be purged out, for it is a ſuperfluity: So then that is a good
heart that entertaines no kind of evill in it. It may be there
is ſome evill, but it doth deſire to purge out not only that that
is filthy, naſtie, and abominable; but if there be any thing that
ſhould not be there, a good heart is againſt it. And that is a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:116352:77"/>
good heart that is willing to receive any thing that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals;
As we uſe to ſay, Such a man is a good man, that is, you
can propound nothing to him that is fit to be done but he is
willing to hearken to you. A good man he hath no kind of
evill ends in him, no evill deſignes at all, but he is willing to
hearken to every thing that is good: So a good heart whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is good he is ready to entertain, if it be a good thing his
heart is ſutable to it, and runs preſently unto it; having a
good heart, it doth preſently cloſe with the good word of the
Lord.</p>
               <p>But what is meant by an <hi>honeſt heart?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By honeſty of heart, certainly there is more meant then ſuch
a one that we call an honeſt man, that is, a man that is honeſt in
his dealings between man and man; there is many a man that
is accounted a very honeſt man in the world but hath not an
honeſt heart: I beſeech you obſerve it, That man that hath an
honeſt heart to God, is one that receives the ſeed of the word,
ſo as he goes beyond the high-way ground, the ſtony ground,
or the thorny ground, he goes beyond thoſe three ſort of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors;
he is one that hath an eminency in profeſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
beyond thoſe three: now the world accounts many honeſt
men that do not go beyond any of thoſe three; yea the world
doth ordinarily account any of thoſe three to be honeſt men,
as the high-way ground: Are there not many honeſt men in
the world, that regard not the word of God at all, but only
come to hear a Sermon, and as ſoon as they have done, as it
came in at one eare, ſo it goes out at the other? I fear there are
ſome men and women that are accounted honeſt men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the world that can hardly give an account of any one
Sermon they have heard in all their lives: hardly I ſay, but the
word which they heard is preſently taken away from them,
and yet theſe are accounted honeſt men in the world: But this
is not the honeſt heart the Scripture ſpeaks of. And many
there are that goe further then theſe, that come to hear the
word with joy, and yet they have not this honeſt heart: Yea
they may hear the word ſo as to bring forth a Blade, and yet
not have this honeſt heart. By this honeſt heart I take there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be meant this, A heart that deals ſquarely and truly
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:116352:77"/>
with God, behaving it ſelf in a beſeeming manner ſutable to that
authority and excellency that there is in the Word of God. As
now for example:</p>
               <p>1 Firſt, Amongſt men he is accounted an honeſt man that
deals ſquarely and truly with men in all actions; ſuch a man
you will ſay is an honeſt man, as honeſt a man as ever broke
bread; that is, one that will deal ſquarely with men, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in one thing, but turn him to any thing, and you ſhall find a
proportion between one action and another: So this is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
heart, not one that only will be forward for God in ſome
one action wherein he may injoy himſelf as well as God; but
one that deals ſquarely with God, let God put him upon du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
upon any ſervice, God ſhall find him ſtill to be the ſame man:
Put him upon an eaſie ſervice (as many will imbrace that) or
put him upon a difficult ſervice, it is all one if it be the mind of
God; you ſhall find him ſquare in every thing, though he be
put upon that which he is like to ſuffer very much in, yet he
goes on according to his principles. An honeſt heart is one
that hath received gracious principles, and accordingly he
acteth, all the world cannot take him off from his principles
of godlineſſe that the Lord hath put into his heart.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, An honeſt man is one that provides things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
before men, that doth all things in a ſeemly way in all
thoſe relations that he hath unto others, that we account ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty:
So when a mans behaviour towards the word is ſuch as
doth beſeem the word of that God with whom he hath to deal,
That look what excellency, what glory, there is in the word of
God, ſuch a ſutable behaviour there is in the heart of a man to
it, this is an honeſt heart. So that there are thoſe two things,
when a man is ſquare with God in one thing as wel as another,
and when there is a ſutableneſſe in the behaviour of the Soul to
what excellency there is in the word, when the heart of man
will not abuſe the word at all, but behaves its ſelf honeſtly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto the gravity, holineſſe, and weight that there is
in the word. And thus now with ſuch a good and honeſt heart
we are to receive the word if we will Sanctifie Gods Name in
it.</p>
               <p>10 A tenth particular is this, If we will Sanctifie Gods name
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:116352:78"/>
in the word we muſt hide the word in our hearts, we muſt not
only heart the word but keep it, preſerve it, and then do we
declare that we account the word of God to be worth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
indeed; For what is it to Sanctifie God (as we have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
before in the general) but ſuch a behaviour towards him
as may teſtifie the excellency of the name of God, ſo the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of the Soul in hearing the word muſt be ſuch as may give
a teſtimony to the excellency of the word and manifeſt the high
eſteem I have of it. Now if I received a thing that is of great
value, if I ſlight it, and let any body take it from me I do not
give a teſtimony to the excellency of that thing, but if I take it
and lock it up, and ſo keep it under lock and key I do thereby
give a teſtimony of the eſteem that I have of the excellency of
that thing, ſo now, When I come to hear the word, and
meet with truths that have gotten into my Soul I cloſe with
them, and am reſolved within my heart as I am hearing of
them, well this truth I will keep through Gods grace, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
me, and I will make much of it, and although I forget
other things, yet I hope I ſhall remember this to Sanctifie Gods
name in hearing of the word, In <hi>Iſa. 42. 23. Hear</hi> (ſaith the
holy Ghoſt there) <hi>for the time to come?</hi> When we come to the
word we muſt not only hearken for the preſent, as many of us
while we are hearing, our hearts are ſtirr'd for the preſent, Oh
that we could but have that affection of heart alwaies as we
have when we are hearing of the word, how many of you have
ſaid when you have been hearing ſuch a ſermon, Oh then me
thought I could have gone through fire and water for God? I
but mark it, you muſt hear for afterwards. And in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.
11. There the prophet <hi>David</hi> profeſt that he did hide the word
in his heart, the word was ſweet unto him, <hi>Thy word ſaith he
have I hid in my heart that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> You that
come and hear thoſe truths upon the Lords day if you would
hide them thus in your hearts and keep them all the week, they
would help you againſt the many temptations that you meet
withall, you go abroad on the week daies into company, and
there you meet with a temptation and it overcomes you, and
you complain, Alas I am weak, I have met with a temptation
and it hath foyld me? But had you hid the word that you
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:116352:78"/>
heard on the Lords day in your heart, it would have kept you
from the ſtrength of your temptation that it ſhould not have
overcome you, thoſe that are truly godly they have a care to
hide the word in their hearts, when they hear it, they think,
this word ſhall help me againſt ſuch and ſuch ſins which I am
prone to by nature, and when a temptation comes to that ſin I
hope I ſhall have uſe of the word that I have heard this day;
As now ſuppoſe you hear a word againſt paſſion, then you
ſhould hide that word in your hearts againſt that time
that temptation comes to paſſion, And you hear a word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſenſuallity and abuſe of the creatures you ſhould hide
that word, againſt that temptation cometh, And you hear a
word againſt unrighteouſneſſe and unjuſt dealings, when a
temptation comes to that ſin you ſhould hide that word againſt
that time, So you hear a word that ſpeaks of obedience to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and ſervants duties to governors, now you ſhould hide
that word in your hearts againſt that time, <hi>I have hid thy word
in my heart that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> You ſay that you
would fain withſtand and not be overcome with temptations?
why here is the way, hide the word within thee that thou
mayeſt not ſin againſt him; And ſo in <hi>Pro.</hi> 2. 1. you have a
Scripture to the ſame purpoſe, about hiding the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
within us. And then in 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 14. I write unto you
young men becauſe you are ſtrong, and the word of God abideth in you
and ye have overcome the wicked one.</hi> I have written to you young
men, you are youug, you have ſtrong natures, and ſo ſtrength
of nature for God, But how comes this to paſſe? <hi>You are ſtrong
and the word of God abideth in you;</hi> here is an excellent Scripture
for all young men, you have your memories freſh, and if you
will exerciſe your memories about any thing it ſhould be in the
word of God, it is a comely and an excellent thing to ſee young
ones to have the word of God abiding in them, that if you
come to them, not only a week but a month after they have
heard the word they are able to give you an account of it: I am
verily perſwaded that there are many young ones in this place,
that are able to give you old ones, If you ask them, an account
of what it is to Sanctifie Gods name in the duties of worſhip
and why? becauſe the word of God abideth in them, It is the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:116352:79"/>
honour of young men to have the word of God to abide in
them, and hereby <hi>they overcome the wicked one.</hi> And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide many young people that do come to hear the word,
it may be they are drawn to it by others, or it may be they love
to have a walk in the morning, but the word of God abideth
not in them, and therefore when the wicked one comes with
temptations the week after they are overcome by him, but thoſe
that have the word of God abiding in them they overcome the
wicked one. And ſo in <hi>Job.</hi> 8. 31. you have a very remarkable
Scripture for this purpoſe of keeping the word after we have
heard it. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus to thoſe which beleeved on him, if you
continue in my word then are you my Diſciples indeed.</hi> I beſeech you
obſerve it, It is ſaid that the Jewes did beleeve in Chriſt, and
yet ſaith Chriſt <hi>If ye continue in my word then are you my Diſciples,</hi>
why, were they not the Diſciples of Chriſt that did beleeve in
him? By this beleeving therefore we muſt underſtand ſome
kind of general notion that they had of Chriſt, they began to
think that Chriſt might be the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſome kind of
imperfect beleeving they had, but they were not throughly
brought off, now ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If you continue in my word, you are
my Diſciples.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Do not you think it enough
that you come to hear me, and that you are taken by what I ſay;
you muſt continue in my word, and then you are my Diſciples:
Chriſt will not own that man or woman to be his Diſciple that
doth not continue in his word. O that you would conſider of
this, you that ſatisfie your ſelves in having ſome flaſhes of your
affections when you are hearing the word, but do not think
that you are the Diſciples of Chriſt becauſe of them, In <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.
9. <hi>Holding faſt the faithfull word as you have been taught,</hi> that is
the thing you ſhould labour for, to hold faſt the faithful
word, hold it faſt, that it may not be taken from you, and ſo
you ſhall come to Sanctifie the name of God in the hearing of
his word.</p>
               <p>11 The laſt that I ſhall ſpeak to is this, If thou wouldeſt
Sanctifie the Name of God in hearing his word, turn it into
practice, or otherwiſe the Name of God is blaſphemed, or at
leaſt is taken in vain by thee if thou doeſt not turn what thou
heareſt into practice: So you have it in <hi>Jam. 1. 22. He that is
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:116352:79"/>
not a forgetfull hearer but a doer of the word, this man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall
be bleſſed in his deed.</hi> And verſ. 22. <hi>Be ye doers of the word, and not
hearers only deceiving your own ſelves.</hi> The word here that is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
<hi>Deceiving your own ſelves,</hi> its a word taken from Logicians,
and ſignifies to make a falſe Sylogiſme. A man that hears the
Word and doth not do it, he doth as it were reaſon thus, Thoſe
that do come to Church (as we uſe to ſay) thoſe ſurely are
Religious people, but I come to Sermons and therefore I am
Religious: Now this is a falſe reaſoning, and thou doeſt but
cozen thy ſelf. Be not a hearer only, but a doer of the word,
that thou maieſt not deceive thine own ſoul. So in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 3.
<hi>Thinkeſt thou this O man that judgeſt them that do ſuch things, &amp; doeſt
the ſame, that thou ſhalt eſcape the judgement of God?</hi> As if he ſhould
ſay, You have the word, and you are able to judge thereby
what you hear, but yet ſtill you are wicked in your lives; this
is diſpiſing of the riches of the goodneſſe of God towards you.
And in <hi>Phillipians</hi> 2. 16. you have a remarkable text where the
holy Ghoſt ſaith of the Philipians, That he would have them
<hi>hold forth the word of Life.</hi> It were a moſt excellent thing if it
might be ſaid of this Congregation, that as they come diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to hear, and are willing to take pains to get out of their beds
ſo earely in the mornings, ſo all the week after they hold forth
the word of God. You that are ſervants it may be your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are naught, and the families naught from whence you
come: now when you go home, though it may be they will not
let you repeate the Sermon, yet you are to hold forth the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in your practice and converſation: How is the Name of
God glorified when we hold forth his word! this is to let, not
only your <hi>light ſhine,</hi> but the light of the word ſhine <hi>before men</hi>
that they may behold it <hi>and glorifie your Father which is in
heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that now put all theſe Eleaven Particulars together, and
then you have made good that expreſſion we find in <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48.
<hi>That the word of God was glorified.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe we
have another expreſſion in 2 <hi>Theſſ. 3. 1. Finally, brethren, Pray for
us, that the word of the Lord may have free courſe, and be glorified e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as it is with you.</hi> This is the commendation of a people, that
they do glorifie the word of God: I beſeech you brethren, in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:116352:80"/>
the Name of Jeſus Chriſt this morning that you that are hearers
of the Word would glorifie the Word, and glorifie the Name of
God in the word; Oh that not one of you would be a diſgrace
or ſhame to the word of God; this is the charge that God this
morning laies upon you, as ever you expect to receive any good
from the word, or to look upon the face of God with comfort
whoſe word this is: do not be a ſhame to his Word, and to the
Miniſters of his word. Put all theſe things together, I ſay, and
learn to make conſcience of Sanctifying Gods Name in hearing
the Word, that ſo there may be none of you that may give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
juſt occaſion to others to ſay, Is this to hear Sermons? Do
you get nothing elſe but this by hearing Sermons? If you
ſhould open the mouths of men to ſay ſo of you, the Word of
God as much as lies in you would be diſgraced by you; you
ſhould rather think thus, It were better for me that I ſhould die,
and that I were under the ground and rotting there, then that
the Word of God ſhould ever be diſgraced by me: Let me hold
forth the glory of the Word, the Word is that that hath done
good to my ſoul; the Word is that that I would not for ten
thouſand worlds but have heard it, and ſhall I diſgrace this
Word? ſhall I give any occaſion that this word of the Lord
ſhould be ſpoken ill of by reaſon of me? O God forbid. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if you regard not your ſelves and your own honour, yet
regard the honour of the Word; If ever you have got any good
by the Word you ſhould go away with this reſolution, Well,
I will labour all the daies of my life to honour this Word of
God that I have got ſo much good by: If this were but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of every one of your hearts this morning, it would be
a bleſſed mornings work.</p>

               <p>1 Firſt, It is becauſe there is ſo much of God in
his Word, and therefore we ſhould Sanctifie Gods Name. If
it were poſſible there could be ſin in heaven, that ſin would be
greater then ſin committed here; therefore the ſin of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
when they were in Gods preſence in a more eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was the greater: The name of God being in any thing, the
greater will be the evill if we do not ſanctifie Gods Name in it;
now there is very much of God in his word, more of God there,
then in all his works of Creation and Providence. In <hi>Pſ.</hi> 138. 2.
<hi>Thou haſt magnified thy word above all thy name:</hi> There being
therefore ſo much of God in his word, we muſt Sanctifie the
Name of God in it.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly, God hath appointed his Word to be the great
Ordinance to convey the ſpecial mercies that he intends for the
good of his people. That we ſpake to before in the generall, in
ſhewing how the duties of Gods Worſhip are as a channel for
the conveyance of ſpeciall good to the Saints: But none more
then the Word, that's the Ordinance to convey the Firſt Grace
to thoſe that belong to Gods election. The Sacrament is for
frengthning, and therefore there is rather more in the Word
then in the Sacrament, and yet every one thinks in conſcience
that he is bound to come carefully to the Sacrament, and to
look to Sanctifie Gods Name there. It is an eaſier matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
men and women, that they are bound to Sanctifie the
name of God when they come to receive the holy Communion,
then for the hearing of the Word: they think not ſo much of
that, but certainly the Word is appointed to be an Ordinance.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:116352:81"/>
of conveying more bleſſing then the Sacrament, becauſe it is
appointed to convey the firſt Grace, and to convey ſtrength of
Grace as well as the Sacrament: Now being appointed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
ſuch great things to the ſouls of the elect, both the firſt grace
and ſtrengthning of grace, and comfort, and aſſiſtance thereof,
the Lord expects to have his Name Sanctified in it.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdly, The Name of God muſt be ſanctified in the
Word, becauſe the word is very quick and lively, it works men
or women to life or death, to ſalvation or damnation. In <hi>Heb.</hi>
4. 12. <hi>The word of God is quick and powerfull, and ſharper then any
two edged ſword, peircing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
&amp;c.</hi> It is very quick of opperation the text ſaith; that is,
when God hath to deal with men by his word, he will not ſtand
dallying and trifling with them, but he is very quick with them,
either to bring their ſouls to life, or to caſt them away. <hi>The
time of mens ignorance God winks at, but now he cals all men to repent.</hi>
Let them look to it now, God did forbear in the time of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
but he will not forbear ſo when the word comes, <hi>Now is
the Ax laid to the root of the tree:</hi> And when was that? When <hi>John
Baptiſt</hi> came to preach repentance becauſe the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is at hand. Though the tree were barren before, and did
not bring forth good fruit, yet it might ſtand ſtill and not be
cut down; but when the powerfull miniſtration of the Word
comes, then the Ax is laid to the root of the Tree; either now
come in and be ſaved, or reſiſt the word and periſh: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that is very obſervable when Chriſt ſends out his Diſciples
to preach, in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. ſaith he, <hi>Go ye into all the world
and preach the Goſpel to every creature, and he that beleeveth and is
Baptized ſhall be ſaved; but he that beleeveth not ſhall be damned.</hi> As
if he ſhould ſay, There ſhall be quick work made with them, go
and preach, &amp; thoſe that belong to my election ſhall be brought
in to beleeve and be ſaved, and the others ſhall be damned: As
if God ſhould ſay, If they will come in and imbrace the Goſpel
they ſhall be ſaved, If they will not, they ſhall be damned, and
there is an end of them: So that I ſay, we have need to look to
it that we ſanctifie the Name of God in his Word upon theſe
Three Grounds. Becauſe there is ſo much of God in his word.
Becauſe he hath appointed it to convey the greateſt Mercies to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:116352:81"/>
his Saints. And becauſe God is very quick in his Word, one
way or other.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now proceed to the Application of this Point:
And,</p>
               <p>Firſt by way of reprehenſion to all thoſe that do not Sanctifie
Gods name in hearing the word, and herein we ſhall ſhew their
fearful condition, and how God will Sanctifie his name upon
them in waies of judgement, and then when we come to the
uſe of exhortation, to exhort you to Sanctifie the name of God,
there we ſhall ſhew you likewiſe how God will Sanctifie his
name in waies of mercy upon thoſe that do Sanctifie him in
waies of obedience in hearing of his word.</p>
               <p>1 For the firſt: Certainly if that be to Sanctifie the name of
God that we have ſpoken of; Gods name is but very little San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by people that do come to hear his word, and we have
no cauſe to wonder that there is ſo little good got by the word,
becauſe there are ſo few that make conſcience to Sanctifie Gods
name in hearing it; Some there are that are ſo far from Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Gods name in it, as they altogether neglect it, and make
it a matter of nothing whither they come to hear it or no:
Saith Chriſt in <hi>Joh. 8. 47. He that is of God heareth my word, ye
therefore hear them not becauſe ye are not of God.</hi> Certainly he
that hath the knowledge of God and any intereſt in God, and
that belongs unto him, nothing is more ſweet to him then the
hearing of his word, but becauſe <hi>ye are not of God</hi> (ſaith Chriſt)
<hi>therefore you hear not his word.</hi> Thoſe men and women that have
no intereſt in God, but live without God in this world, they
regard not to hear his word. O how many have we that belong
to this place that do ſo! How many live without God in the
world, and do declare to all the world that they are not of God?
they have no part nor portion in God in that they hear not his
word. Some there are that come to hear it, but they come to
hear it as a meer matter of indifferency, in a meer formall and
cuſtomary way, or for companies ſake, or to give content to
others: Theſe are poor and low ends, thou ſhouldeſt come to
hear the word as expecting God ſhould ſpeak to thy Soul for
the furtherance of thy eternal good, but your conſciences may
tell you what vain and wandring hearts you have, when you
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:116352:82"/>
come to hear it. <hi>The eies of the fool</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) are in all the
corners of the earth,</hi> up and down wandring, little minding that
you are come to hear God himſelf ſpeak to you in the Miniſtry
of man. And if ſo be that it be minded, yet ordinarily the
hearts of men do put off the word, and if it come any thing neer
to them they think to ſhift it from themſelves to others. We have
a notable Scripture in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25. for ſuch men as ſhift off Gods
word when it comes many times very neer to them: <hi>See that ye
refuſe not him that ſpeaketh: for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him
that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away
from him which ſpeaketh from heaven:</hi> See that ye refuſe not him
that ſpeaks the word, ſee that you do not put him off: And that
that is the ſignification of it: If you compare it with <hi>Luke,</hi> 12.
18. you ſhall find that there is the ſame word uſed, where
ſpeaking of thoſe that were invited to the ſupper, it is ſaid,
<hi>They all with one conſent began to make excuſe,</hi> they began to ſhift
it off, that is the ſame word: O take heed of this that when
you are hearing the word and Chriſt comes and ſpeaks to your
hearts, and you begin to think that it may concern you, and
your conſciences begin to ſtir, take heed that you do not ſhift
him off, take heed that you do not put away the word from
you by any kind of pretence whatſoever. It may be you will
ſay, If I were certain it were the word of God, and that God
ſpake to me, God forbid but that I ſhould ſubmit unto it. But
though it may be the hearts of men are not ſo notoriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
as to reſolve to ſin againſt the word, which they will
acknowledge to be the word of God, yet this is the deceit of
the heart, when the heart hath no mind to obey, it will ſhift
off the word, and have pretences, and put offs, O take heed
that you do not ſhift oft him that ſpeaks from heaven by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any kind of excuſe whatſoever, but when thou heareſt,
if the word of God come to thy conſcience, do not liſten to vain
reaſonings that are againſt it. Others there are that cannot tell
how to ſhift off the word but it will come upon them when
they are hearing, it may be they are a little ſtirr'd, but it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
gone, ſo that they are far from houlding the word, far
from keeping it in their hearts. Oh how many of you have
been ſtirr'd when you have been hearing the word, and how
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:116352:82"/>
happy had it been for you if you had hid thoſe words in your
heart that the Lord hath ſpoken to you in the Miniſtry of it. If
you had but the Invitations of the Spirit now that ſometimes
you have had, how happy were it for you? But it is with many
in hearing the word, juſt as with you Marriners when you are
to go aboard, your friends come with you, take their leaves of
you, and then you ſee them ſtand upon the ſhore a while, but
when you ſail a little further your friends are out of ſight, and
then you ſee only the ſhore, you ſayl on a little further, and
then you ſee only the houſes, you ſayl a little further and then
you ſee only the ſteeples and ſuch high places, and you ſayl yet
a little further and then you ſee nothing but the Ocean: So
it is in hearing the word; It may be when you go home there
are ſome things freſh in your minds, but on the munday mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
you have loſt ſome, but then there are ſome others that
do yet preſent themſelves before you, and then you looſe more
and more until you have loſt the ſight of all: all truthes are
gone, you ſee no more of the word, as if you had never heard
it; this is not to Sanctifie Gods name, you ſhould treaſure up
the word as the moſt rich treaſure that may be.</p>
               <p>Another ſort to be rebuked are thoſe, who are ſo far from
falling down before the Lord to receive the word with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as they can bleſſe themſelves in their wicked waies, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the word comes and meets with them. I only
name this becauſe of that notable Scripture we have, In <hi>Deut.</hi> 29,
18, 19. ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> there to them, <hi>Take heed, leſt there ſhould be
among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood,</hi> (what's that root
that beareth gall and wormwood?) <hi>And it come to paſſe when he
heareth the words of this curſe, that he bleſse himſelf in his heart, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart,
&amp;c.</hi> Take heed there be not among you a root that beareth
gall and wormwood; This is a bitter root in mens hearts,
when they can hear the word of God, and have their hearts riſe
aganſt it, and think with themſelves that there is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
theſe are but meer words, but meer wind, let the Miniſter
ſay what he will, and talk as long as he will, I will go on in
my way, I ſhall do well enough, that which he ſaith it is but
his opinion, I ſay when men can bleſſe themſelves thus in their
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:116352:83"/>
way, and when there are ſuch tumultuous and rebellious
thoughts riſing in their hearts, this is a root of gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
and take heed of it, it will bring forth bitter fruit one
day. But I ſhould quickly be prevented if I ſhould lanch into
this argument, to reprove the ſeveral waies of ſinning againſt
God in the hearing of his word. And therefore I leave thoſe
and come to ſhew what a fearful thing it is for men and women
not to Sanctifie the name of God in the hearing of his word,
that ſo you may ſee that God will have his name Sanctified up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. And they are theſe;</p>
               <p>1 In the firſt place, You that do not Sanctifie Gods name
in hearing his word in thoſe waies that have been opened to
you, firſt you looſe the greateſt and happieſt opportunity of
good that ever creatures had, for an outward opportunity:
indeed when God moves by his Spirit if that be neglected, that
opportunity is more then meerly hearing the word, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
except it be at ſuch a time when God adds his Spirit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his word; I ſay you that are caſt by the providence
of God in ſuch a place where the word of the Goſpel is preached
to you, applied and urged upon you, if you Sanctifie not the
name of God, to hear as you ought and to profit by it, I ſay
you loſe the greateſt opportunity for good that is in the world?
Oh what haſt thou loſt that haſt lived many yeers under the
Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and yet haſt not been acquainted with
this myſtery of godlineſs in ſanctifying Gods name in the word.
There are many thouſand ſouls that are and ſhall be bleſſing
God to all eternity for what of God they have met with all in
the word, but thou haſt fifteen under it ſtupid as a block, dead
and barren, and no good hath been done; <hi>Wherefore is there a
prize in the hand of a fool, and he hath no heart to get wiſedome?</hi> this
will lie upon thee heavy one day, the loſſe of ſuch an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and that is the firſt.</p>
               <p>2 In the Second place, know that this word that is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God for the conveyance of ſo much mercy to his elect, it
will prove to be the greateſt aggravation of thy ſin that can be:
<hi>This is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men love
darkneſſe rather then light:</hi> This is [<hi>The</hi>] condemnation. If ſo
be that light had not come among you, then the condemnation
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:116352:83"/>
had not been ſo great your ſin had not bin ſo great, &amp; your pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
had not bin ſo great. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 14, 15. where ſpeaking
of thoſe that did injoy the word, and yet did not ſanctifie Gods
Name in it. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not receive you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his
Diſciples) <hi>nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that houſe or
City, ſhake off the duſt of your feet; Verely I ſay unto you, it ſhall be
more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorah in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then for that City.</hi> It is a moſt dreadfull Scripture; their
very duſt muſt be ſhaken off in token of indignation, and it ſhall
be more eaſie for the Land of Sodom and Gomorah in the
day of judgment, then for that place: You would be very loth
to be in a worſe condition then Sodom and Gomorah that was
conſumed by fire from heaven, <hi>And now ſuffer the vengeance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
fire,</hi> Jude 7. Certainly they ſhall not be ſo deep in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as thoſe that live under the Miniſtry of the word and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
not the Name of God in it. Your ſin is of a deeper dye,
then the ſin of the Heathens, yea and in ſome reſpects then the
ſin of the Devils, they never had the word of the Goſpel ſent to
be preached to them and therefore this will aggravate your ſin
not only beyond heathens but beyond devils. Look to it then,
that Gods Name be Sanctified in the hearing of his Word.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, Know that ſo much as the word is rejected, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt is rejected: <hi>Luk. 10. 16. He that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth
me, and he that deſpiſeth me deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> It is Chriſt
himſelf that is rejected when the word is rejected, thou haſt not
to do with man ſo much as with Jeſus Chriſt in the hearing
of the word: And the power of Jeſus Chriſt is to be
put forth either to do the good by the word, or to avenge thy
neglect of the word: Therefore in <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 18, 19. when Chriſt
ſends forth his Diſciples to preach, he makes this preface, <hi>All
power is given unto me in heaven and earth, go ye therefore and teach:</hi>
As if he ſhould ſay, I having received all power in heaven and
earth, through the power I received I ſend you to preach, <hi>and I'le
be with you to the end of the world:</hi> that is, All power in heaven
and earth ſhall go along with you to aſſiſt your Miniſtry, either
for the good of thoſe that ſhall imbrace it, or for the Miſery
of thoſe that ſhall reject it; So that whoſoever ſtands out againſt
the Miniſtry of the Word, ſtands out againſt all the power in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:116352:84"/>
heaven and earth that is given to Chriſt: Do not think that
thou doeſt reſiſt a poor weak mortall man, but thou doeſt reſiſt
all the power in heaven and earth. And is not this a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thing then, to be guilty of not ſanctifying of Gods
Name?</p>
               <p>4 Fourthly, It is an Argument of extreame hardneſſe of
heart not to be wrought upon by the word. <hi>Luk. 16. 31. If they
hear not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded
though one roſe from the dead,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abraham.</hi> Certainly that man
or woman that ſhall not be wrought upon by the word ſo as to
Sanctifie Gods Name in it, I ſay to ſuch, If one ſhould riſe from
the dead they would not have their hearts wrought upon, and
therefore much leſſe are they like to be wrought upon by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
It may be ſome of you think when you are upon your
ſick beds then you will repent; no ſurely, if this that is the
great Ordinance to bring men to God ſhall not work upon you
ſo as God ſhall be honoured in it; you cannot expect that ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and affliction ſhould do it, no if one ſhould come from the
dead to tell you of all the miſeries that were there, certainly if
the word work not upon you, that will not do it. But you will
ſay, One would think that there ſhould be more power to work
upon the heart: truly no, becauſe that is not ſuch an Ordinance
appointed by God for working ſuch great works upon the
hearts and conſciences of men, as the word is: It is true, the
word is but a weak thing in it ſelf, but here lies the ſtrength,
that it is an Ordinance of God appointed for to work upon the
hearts of men therefore if this work not upon you to give God
glory in the hearing it; there is no other means is like to do
it.</p>
               <p>5 Fiftly, When the word works not upon men, it is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſign of Reprobation <hi>If our Goſpel be hid</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle in
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3.) <hi>it is hid to thoſe that are loſt.</hi> It is a dreadfull Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that here is a loſt creature, one that God intends no good
to. One the Lord works upon, perhaps he lets paſſe another,
one in a family and not in another. Now where it is ſo that the
word worketh not, I ſay, there is no ſuch dreadfull brand of
Reprobation as this is. It is true, we cannot give any certain
ſign of Reprobation; therefore I cannot ſay of any man, he
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:116352:84"/>
hath now ſuch a mark upon him as doth evidently prove that
he is a Reprobate; we cannot tell that, becauſe we know not
what God may do afterwards, but we may ſay this, That it is
as dreadfull a ſign as any. There are not any more dreadfull
ſigns then theſe two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For a man to be ſuffered to proſper in a ſinful courſe;
For God to let men go on and have their hearts deſire ſatisfied
in an ungodly way.</p>
               <p>And then Secondly, For the Lord to leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſo as the Miniſtry of the word ſhall not work upon them,
that they ſhall be by Gods providence ſo diſpoſed of, as to live
under a faithfull and powerful Miniſtry, and that it ſhould not
work upon them: Theſe are the two blackeſt ſigns of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation:
and therefore it is a moſt dreadfull thing to ſit under
the Miniſtry of the word and not to ſanctifie Gods Name in
it.</p>
               <p>6 In the next place, Surely there can be nothing Sanctified
to thee who doeſt not ſanctifie Gods Name in his word. The
Scripture ſaith, <hi>That every thing is ſanctified by the Word and
Prayer.</hi> And how canſt thou expect that the word ſhould ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
any thing to thee, ſeeing that thou doeſt not make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Sanctifying Gods name in the word? The godly think
thus, 'Tis the word that muſt Sanctifie all things to my Soul,
and I had need then ſanctifie Gods name in that from which I
expect the ſanctified uſe of all bleſſings. You therefore that can
fit under it, and make not conſcience of ſanctifying Gods name
in it, I ſay you cannot expect no ſanctified uſe of any thing that
you have in this world.</p>
               <p>7 Such as do not ſanctifie Gods name in the word, are very
nigh to a curſe: There is a notable Scripture for this in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.
7, 8. where the Apoſtle compares the word to the rain that fals
upon the ground, <hi>For the earth that drinketh in the rain that cometh
oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dreſſed,
receiveth bleſſing from God: But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that which beareth thorns
and briers, is rejected and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned.</hi>
The meaning is this plainly. The rain here is the word, and
the good hearers they are like the ground that receive the rain
and bring forth fruit, and receive a bleſſing: But now ill hearers
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:116352:85"/>
that do not ſanctifie Gods name in his word, they are like
ground that receive the rain as much as the other, hear as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sermons as the other, but they bring forth nothing but
thorns and briers; and mark what a dreadfull expreſſion is
againſt them; Firſt, <hi>It is rejected.</hi> Secondly, <hi>It is nigh to curſing.</hi>
Thirdly, <hi>Whoſe end is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> burned.</hi> Thou rejecteſt the word, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thou? The Lord rejecteth thy Soul. If thou haſt no need of
the word, the word hath no need of thee it is a dreadfull thing
to be rejected of God. And then, thou art <hi>nigh unto curſing:</hi>
It may be the Lord may for the time withdraw himſelf from
the Soul, and manifeſt that it is as it were rejected; but yet the
Soul hath not the curſe of God upon it, to ſay, Well, let this
Soul periſh for ever: but ſome there are that are under an actual
curſe, and ſaith God, Well, my Word ſhall never do good
to this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oul, ſuch a one hath ſate under it thus long, and hath
rejected it, my word ſhall never do good to him: Like as in
<hi>Luk.</hi> 14. where thoſe that made excuſes when they were bidden
to the Supper, the text ſaith at length, <hi>That the Maſter of the feaſt
was angry,</hi> (which was God himſelf that invited them by the
Goſpel to partake of his Son; and when men would not come
in but make excuſes, and refuſed the offer of the Goſpel,) <hi>Verily</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>none of thoſe men that were bidden ſhall taſte of my Supper.</hi>
They ſhall never partake of any good of the Goſpel. This is
a dreadfull curſe. Now the Lord deliver you from having this
curſe pronounced againſt you, but yet I beſeech you tremble at
this Scripture in the <hi>Hebrews, They are nigh to curſing.</hi> Who knows
how nigh ſome ſoul in this place may be to this curſe, for God
to ſay, This ſoul hath been often invited, and yet hath made
excuſes and put off all, he ſhall never taſte of my Supper, of the
good things in Jeſus Chriſt, the word that hath been ſo rejected
ſhall never do them good more; you had better never been
born then to have this curſe actually upon you. Oh fear and
tremble leſt your condition be ſuch as to be nigh to curſing:
Who knows what a day, a week may bring forth? It may be
the Lord may ſpare and be willing to paſſe by the neglect of
former Sermons; but who knows what the next actuall rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
againſt the Lord in his word may do to bring the curſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee? And then if ſo, the next part of the verſe will prove
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:116352:85"/>
to be thy portion, <hi>Whoſe end is to be burned.</hi> Oh! It is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thing to ſin againſt the Word: God ſtands much upon
it.</p>
               <p>8 Eightly, Know that if Gods name be not Sanctified in it,
the end that God hath appointed it for, will be turned quite
contrary to thee; The proper end that God hath appointed
his word for, it is to ſave ſouls, but now, where Gods name
is not Sanctified it is turned quite contrary, ſo the Apoſtle in
2 <hi>Cor. 2. 16. To the one we are the ſavour of death unto death, and
to the other the ſavour of life unto life:</hi> It is a dreadful thing that
the good word of God in which there is ſuch treaſures of Gods
mercy, wherein the counſels of God, concerning mans eternal
eſtates comes to be revealed, that this ſhould prove to be the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of death unto death, unto any ſoul, that is, to have ſuch
an efficacy in it, as to kill them by the very ſcent of it as it were;
As ſome things have ſuch a poyſon in them, as the very ſcent is
enough to poyſon one. So ſaith the Apoſtle, to ſome our word
hath that efficacy being turned quite to the contrary end ſome
ſouls are ſav'd, and are and ſhal be bleſſing God to al eternity for
the word, and thy ſoul is dam'd by the word, ſo as thou wilt
hereafter curſe the time that ever thou cameſt to hear it: That
will be a dreadful thing that the ſame word that others ſhall be
bleſſing of God eternally in heaven for; that thou ſhalt be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
eternally in hell for, it will be turned to the quite contrary
end, If it works not in the right way it will work the other,
the truth is, it hardens mens hearts if it brings them not to
God; there is nothing that doth harden the hearts of men
more then the Miniſtry of the word: yet by accident, not by
its ſelf, there is no men in the world have ſuch hard hearts as
thoſe that are wicked under the Miniſtry of the word; It is not
only an argument that their hearts are hard, but they are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
by it: That in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 9. 10. is remarkable for this,
and the rather becauſe I find it ſo often quoted by Chriſt, I
think it is quoted three or four times in the Goſpel, <hi>And he
ſaid go and tell this people, hear ye indeed, but underſtand not, and
ſee ye indeed but perceive not; Make the heart of this people fat, and
make their eares heavy, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with their eyes,
and hear with their eares, and underſtand with their heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:116352:86"/>
and be healed.</hi> This is a ſtrange Scripture, what muſt a
Prophet go to them, to make their hearts fat, and to ſhut their
eyes, why, the word is appointed to open mens eyes, but here
the Prophet is ſent to ſhut their eyes that they might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
this is dreadful, this is for the puniſhment of ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
neglect of the word of God ſent unto this people, above
all Judgements you ſhould be afraid of this; It is not ſo much
that a fire ſhould be upon your houſes, as that God ſhould
make his word to be a means to harden your hearts. In <hi>Ezek.</hi>
14. we have a dreadful expreſſion to this purpoſe by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
there, where the Lord ſaith, that the people did come
to inquire of him, with ſetting up their Idols in their hearts,
but ſaith God, <hi>I will anſwer them according to their Idoll.</hi> If men
come to the Miniſtry of the word with their beloved ſins, and
reſolve that they will not part with them, the Lord many times
in his juſt judgment ſuffers ſome things in the word to be acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
a means to harden them in that ſin of theirs, <hi>I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
them according to their Idoll,</hi> thoſe men are in a dreadful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
whoſe hearts come to be hardened by the word.</p>
               <p>9 Ninthly, If thou doeſt not Sanctifie Gods name in the
hearing of the word, what comfort canſt thou ever have by the
word in the day of thy affliction? certainly when the day of
thy affliction comes, then there is nothing can comfort thee
but the word. <hi>Vnleſſe thy law had been my delight</hi> (ſaith <hi>David)
I ſhould then have periſhed in mine affliction,</hi> but thou having
been exerciſed in the word ſo much and Gods name not Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed,
thou muſt not expect to have thy ſoul comforted in the
day of thy affliction. No marvail then though the word hath
been applied again and again to your hearts, and nothing
would ſtick: I remember it was an expreſſion of one in a great
deal of terror of conſcience many came to apply comfortable
Scriptures to him, and he himſelf for a while did take thoſe
Scriptures and lay them upon his heart to paſſifie his troubled
conſcience, but a little before he dyed, he cries out with a
moſt fearful terror, <hi>there is a fair plaiſter made but it will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> on,
it will not ſtick on,</hi> ſo dyed deſpairing; ſo there is in the word ſuch
a plaiſter as may help a wounded and troubled conſcience, but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thou expect that haſt not Sanctified Gods name in thy life
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:116352:86"/>
time that it ſhall ſtick upon thy ſoul in the day of thy affliction?
never expect it, for the Lord hath ſaid otherwiſe, <hi>Prov. 1. Becauſe
when I cryed and call'd ye would not hear, you ſhall cry and call and</hi> I
<hi>will not hear;</hi> The Lord in his word cries to thee, Oh thou ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſoul who art going on in the waies of ſin and eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
Return, return, that is the way that will bring thee
to eternal miſeries, but here is the way that will bring thee to
life and eternal ſalvation: Thus the Lord cries and cals to day
to day, and thou ſtoppeſt thy eare, Oh how juſt is it with God
to ſtop his eare from thy crying and calling in the day of thy
affliction.</p>
               <p>10 Further, Know that thou that doeſt not Sanctifie the
name of God in his word, that all the word of God will be
made good one day upon thee, God hath his time <hi>to magnifie
his Law and to make it honorable Iſa.</hi> 42. 21. You ſight Gods
Law, you ſlight his word, and deſpiſe it, but God will mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
it and make it honorable, there is not any ſentence that
thou haſt heard in the word, but it ſhall be made good, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
becomes of thy ſoul, Thou thinkeſt that God is a merciful
God &amp; he will not damn thee; but though God be merciful &amp;
hath regard to his creatures, yet the Lord hath ten thouſand
times more regard to his word then to all the ſouls of men and
women in the world, and God will ſtand to make that good,
he will not have ſuch regard to that wretched vile ſinful ſoul
of thine as not to honour his word, he will honour his word
whatſoever becomes of thee, and all that thou haſt heard and
rejected ſhall be made good upon thee one day.</p>
               <p>11 Again the word that thou doeſt reject and ſin againſt, it
ſhall be the word that ſhall judge thee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 48. Look to it
as well as you will: this book of God out of which we preach,
and thoſe truths that we delivered to you from this word, they
muſt be called over again at the great day to judge your ſouls
by, the ſentence of every one of your eternall eſtates muſt be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of this book: Oh look upon it as the word that muſt
judge your Souls at the laſt day, and then you will ſee it a
dreadfull thing not to ſanctifie Gods Name in it. And then
when the word doth judge you, you ſhall obey it whether you
will or no. Now the word convinces you and you will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:116352:87"/>
it; but when God comes to judge you by the word, then
you ſhall obey it: Then when God comes to read that ſentence
out of the word, <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire:</hi> then I ſay you
ſhall be forced to obey it.</p>
               <p>12 Laſtly, There is yet one thing more (which ſhould have
been mentioned before) which is very remarkable; That thoſe
men which do not ſanctifie Gods Name in his word, they will
be blaſted, even here while they live their parts and common
gifts that they yet have will be blaſted, wither, and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
We find it ordinarily, that many that are young, had
very good beginnings, and very good parts, that were very
hopefull, and would ſpeak very favourly where they came, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
beginning by degrees to neglect the Word, the Lord
hath blaſted them, their gifts have withered, the common gifts
of the Spirit have been taken from them. I will give you one
Text for that in <hi>Luk. 8. 18. Take heed therefore how ye hear.</hi> (It is
an Exhortation that follows upon the parable of the Sower
that went out to ſow) becauſe it is ſo that when the word is
ſowen as ſeed, there is ſo little of it doth proſper, and moſt
hearers do not Sanctifie Gods name in it, therefore look to
your ſelves: Why? <hi>For whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given; and
whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken even that which he ſeemeth
to have.</hi> You had need look to your ſelves how you hear, for
the truth is, all depends upon it under God, have you got any
common gifts of the Spirit of God, or any abilities to do any
ſervice for God? do not be proud of them, neither be jolly, nor
think that you are able to do better then others, and that thoſe
are but ordinary things that the Miniſter ſpeaks, and you are
gotten into a higher forme. Look to your ſelves, take heed
you come not to the word with a proud Spirit, be not offended
at the plainneſſe of the word, take heed how you hear; for if
you do not, that that you ſeem to have ſhall be taken from you
ſaith Chriſt: You ſeem to have excellent gifts yea you ſeem to
have grace too, but take heed how you hear for all this, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
parts you have got, though you be highly eſteemed in
the company where you come, and you are able to do things
more then others, yet I ſay, Take heed how you hear, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
that that you have will be taken away from you: have
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:116352:87"/>
have we not ſeen this in our own experience? and it is apparent
that they began to be withered and to be blaſted by neglecting
of the Word. And therefore I beſeech you look to this, that
you do Sanctifie the name of God in his word, and let your
hearts bow unto it as unto the Ordinance of God, and waite
upon it in the Miniſtry of it, leſt you wither and be blaſted and
come to nothing.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewen the great evill of not Sanctifying
Gods Name, and how God will be Sanctified.</p>
               <p>I ſhall be very brief in the Uſe of Exhortation.</p>
               <p>Oh that the Lord by this would cauſe ſome thing to ſtick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your hearts, that what hath been preached in this point may
be made uſefull for many Sermons afterwards! that it might
be ſaid of you in this place as it was ſaid of them in <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48.
<hi>When the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of
the Lord, and as many as were ordained to eternall life beleeved!</hi> Oh
that God would make every one of you to be a means to glorifie
the word of God! That ſhould be our care that the word of God
may be glorified by us; we come to hear the word, but take
heed that the word of God be not diſhonoured by us, In 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi>
3. 1. <hi>Finally Brethren pray for us that the word of the Lord may have
free courſe, and be glorified, even as it is with you;</hi> Oh that we were
able to ſay ſo! and yet through Gods mercy in ſome degree we
hope we can ſay ſo and I could heartily pray that the word of
God might be glorified in all places as it hath been with many
of you; but yet go on in this, and labour every one of you
that it may be more glorified, that you may manifeſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the word in your converſations, that all that do behold
you may glorifie the word and ſay, Oh what hath the Lord
wrought in ſuch a place, in ſuch families, families that were
wretched, vild, carnal, and liv'd without God in the world,
Prophane, Swearers, foul-mouth'd, Unclean; Now ſince
they have attended upon the word, how hath it wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them! what a change is there in ſuch men and women!
That the carnal husband may ſay, ſince ſuch time as my wife
hath attended upon the word I have ſeen a Beauty in her conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
ſhee is more holy, more gentle, and meek; and ſo my
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:116352:88"/>
ſervant, more ſubmiſſive and faithful, and ſo my children more
obedient then before; Oh that the word may be thus glorified!
Take heed I beſeech you that the word be not blaſphemed by
any of you: In <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 5. there the Apoſtle gives divers exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and among others to wives, and to ſervants: <hi>To be

unto your husbands, and why? that ſo the word of God
be not blaſphemed, that is, that neither your husbands, nor
any of your friends may blaſphem the word, and ſay, what,
do you get this by going to ſermons? Oh it ſhould peirce your
hearts when as your conſciences tell you that you have given
cauſe whereby the word of God ſhould be blaſphemed: and ſo
he exhorts ſervants and others, and all in the ſtrength of this
argument, <hi>that the word of God be not blaſphemed:</hi> you get up ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a morning to hear the word, that's good, but take heed
you give no occaſion that the word be blaſphemed:</p>
               <p>Now, I ſhall ſhew what an excellent thing it is ſo to Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Gods name in the hearing of his word, as to honour it, and
how God will Sanctifie his owne name in mercy to you.</p>
               <p>1 Firſt, All the good in the word is thine if thou doeſt San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
Gods name. There is aboundance of good in this word
that we preach, it is the word of the Goſpel, and to have all
the good in that to be thine, that muſt needs be an excellent
thing; you will ſay, ſome times I read and hear ſuch things in
the word that if I were but ſure that theſe things were my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
how happy ſhould I be? Here's one ſign by which thou
mayeſt be aſſured that they are all thy portion: Is it thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained
care to Sanctifie Gods name in the hearing of his word?
Oh peace be to thee, all the good in the word is thine: And
here we might fall into a comendation of the word of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and if I ſhould give way to that a great deal of time would
quickly be gone, I will only give you one Scripture for your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to Sanctifie Gods name in the hearing of his word
by way of comendation of it. It is <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. (a place I am
afraid you have not had the ſweetneſſe of it for the want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
it) It is quoted out of <hi>Deut. For</hi> Moſes <hi>deſcribeth the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:116352:88"/>
Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, that the man which doth thoſe things
ſhall live by them. But the Righteouſneſs which is of faith ſpeaketh on
this wiſe; Say not in thine heart who ſhall aſcend into heaven, that is,
to bring Chriſt down from above, or who ſhall deſcend into the deep,
that is, to bring Chriſt again from the dead? But what ſaith it? the
word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart, that is the word
of faith which we preach.</hi> The text hath ſome difficulty and yet
exceeding ſweet to us to know it; I confeſſe if the Apoſtle <hi>Paull</hi>
had not quoted this place out of <hi>Deut.</hi> and thus interpreted it,
who could ever have thought in reading of <hi>Deut.</hi> that by the one
had been ment the word of the Law, and by the other the word
of the Goſpel, therefore the meaning is this, here is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
between the word of the Law, and the word of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
Concerning the word of the Law, there is two things
wherein that comes ſhort of the word of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is not ſo nigh thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is not ſo certain to aſſure thy Soul what ſhall
become of thee to all eternity: <hi>The word of the Law ſaith who ſhall
aſcend into heaven, &amp;c.</hi> But the word of the Goſpel <hi>is nigh thee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in thy mouth and in thy heart:</hi> You will ſay, Why is not the
word of the Law as nigh one as the word of the Goſpel? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
The word of the Law you hear it in your eares, but it is
not written in the heart as the word of the Goſpel is: The
Law cannot work ſavingly upon the heart of a man to bring
ſalvation: thoſe that are meerly Legall they can hear the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that are required, but that word hath no power to write in
their hearts what they do hear: But now when you come to
hear the word of the Goſpel, that is nigh you, even in your ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hearts as well as in your eares, God ſpeaks in it, and it comes
into your hearts and there it works efficaciouſly, which the
Law cannot. The Law is but as a dead Letter in compariſon
of the word of the Goſpel. If you come meerly to hear the Law
preached, and not in an Evangellicall way, you may hear it a
hundred times and it will never be written in your hearts, But
when you come to hear the Goſpel in an Evangellicall way,
that will come to be written in your hearts: So that the word
of the Goſpel is nigh you: But what is the meaning of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:116352:89"/>
                  <hi>Say not, who ſhall aſcend up into heaven, &amp;c?</hi> The meaning
is this, As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, The truth is, while you have
no other but the righteouſneſſe of the Law, you are at an infinit
uncertainty about your eternal eſtates. The Law ſaith, <hi>Do and
live:</hi> but you can never know when you have done enough ſo
as to be certain that you are well for eternity. That ſaith, <hi>Who
ſhall aſcend into heaven</hi> to know the mind of God concerning me?
whether he will accept of me, and of that obedience and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
that I tender up to him? <hi>Who ſhall go down into the deep?</hi>
Who ſhall go down to Hell to know there, whether that place
be prepared for him or not? It is a phraſe that only expreſſeth
an uncertainty that one cannot be ſatisfied about his eternall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
except he could go to heaven and there ſee and read Gods
book and ſo diſcover Gods mind concerning him; or go down
to hell, and ſo know whether that place be appointed for him
or not except I can do one of theſe, I can not certainly tell,
(meerly by the Law) whether I ſhall go to heaven or hell. As
you that are Merchants and dealers abroad, you are at a great
deal of uncertainty what ſhall become of your eſtates. Indeed
if I could ſend one over to the Indies to tell me how my Ship
proſpered, then I could be at a certainty, then I ſhould
hear whether I were a rich man yea or no, but except I could do
ſuch a thing I am at an uncertainty: Such is the expreſſion here.
As if a poor ſoul ſhould ſay, I would fain be ſaved, and loth to
periſh eternally; But all the while the ſoul remains under the
Law, it remains in an uncertain condition; but now ſaith he,
The Word of the Goſpel is nigh thee even in thine heart; And
that is the Word that we preach, that ſaith, <hi>Rom. 10. 9. If
thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt beleeve in
thine heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
As if he ſhould ſay, This word of the Goſpel that is come into
thine heart doth aſſure thy ſoul of thy eternall eſtate, ſo that
though thou canſt not go up to heaven, nor go down to hell,
yet thou haſt that in thine heart, that doth as it were aſſure thee
that thou ſhalt be eternally ſaved, as if thou wert able to go up
to the higheſt heavens and fetch newes from thence. Oh now
the good word of the Goſpel how ſhould we prize it, and keep
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:116352:89"/>
it in our hearts? for thats in our hearts that wil aſſure us of our
ſalvation to all eternity, &amp; of Gods eternal purpoſe to do the
good in heaven. You would account it a great happines if there
could be any art to ſend abroad to the Straits or to other place,
to know how things fare with you: but now if thou haſt the
word of the Goſpel within thee, if that prevails in thy Soul,
thou haſt alwaies got ſomething in thy heart that will tel thee
how things are with thee in heaven, and what ſhall become of
thee for all eternity. Oh who would not ſanctifie the Name
of God in hearing of his word, ſeeing it is ſuch a bleſſed word
wherein the Goſpel is opened with more clearneſſe then it hath
been to many of our fore-fathers.</p>
               <p>2 It is a certain evidence of your election, in <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5.
<hi>Remembring without ceaſing your work of Faith, and labour of love,
and patience of hope in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the ſight of God and
our Father; Knowing Brethren, beloved, your election of God.</hi> Why?
<hi>For our Goſpel came not to you in word only, but alſo in power, and in
the holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance.</hi> And know this excellency
there is in ſanctifying Gods name in hearing the word, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you mark it, that it is a more bleſſed thing, then if you
did bear Jeſus Chriſt in your wombes; You that are women,
would not you have accounted it a great happines if Chriſt had
been borne in your wombes? Now if thou comeſt to the
hearing of the word, and ſanctifieſt Gods name in it, thou art
in a better condition, and haſt a greater bleſſing upon thee, then
if thou hadeſt borne Jeſus Chriſt in thy womb. In <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 27. 28.
<hi>And it came to paſſe as he ſpake theſe things, that a certain woman of the
company lift up her voice and ſaid unto him, Bleſſed is the womb that
bare thee, and the paps which thou haſt ſucked.</hi> Seeing Chriſt and
what gracious things came from him, ſhe ſpake ſo; <hi>But he ſaid,
Yea, rather bleſſed are they that hear the word of God &amp; keep it.</hi> That
is, Labour to ſanctifie my name, (as hath been opened in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars)
rather is that women bleſſed that do ſo, then the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that bare Chriſt: Me thinks this one ſcripture ſhould be
ſuch a ſcripture for women, to cauſe them to ſanctifie Gods
name in hearing of the word, inſtead of a hundred ſcriptures;
certainly thou maieſt be ſo bleſſed, if thou wilt beleeve the word
that comes from Chriſts mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:116352:90"/>
3 Do you ſanctifie the name of God in the Word, that wil ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
you, by that your ſouls come to be ſanctified, &amp; it wil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
you in the day of your affliction, &amp; it will ſave you at laſt.</p>
               <p>4 You that do ſanctifie Gods name in the hearing of his
Word, you will be the glory of the Miniſters of God at the
great day of judgement. You will be an honour to them, before
the Lord, and his Saints, and Angels. In <hi>Phil. 2. 16. Holding forth</hi>
(ſaith the text) <hi>the word of life.</hi> This is the duty of all the hearers
of the word that they muſt hold forth the word of life; when
you go home, you muſt hold forth the power of the word you
hear, well what will become of that? That I may rejoyce in the
day of Chriſt, that I have not runne in vain, neither laboured
in vain; Let that be one motive among the reſt, ſaith the
Apoſtle, this will be ſuch a glory to me, that I in the day of
Jeſus Chriſt ſhall rejoyce that I have not laboured in vain, I
ſhall bleſſe God for all my ſtudies and care, and all the pains
that ever I have taken, and ventring my ſelf for this People, I
ſhall bleſſe God in the day of Jeſus Chriſt. Would it not be a
comfortable thing to you, that all the Miniſters of God that
come to preach the word faithfully to you, If at the day of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt you ſhould hear them bleſſing God that ever he did
ſend them to preach the Goſpel in ſuch a place, and you ſhould
hear them ſaying, Oh Lord, it may be had I been ſent to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place I ſhould have ſpent all my ſtrength in vain, but
through thy mercy I was ſent to a teachable people that were
ready to imbrace thy word, Oh this is my crown and glory.
Would it not do good to any whoſe hearts are faithful to think
this, that their holding forth the word of life will not only be
a glory to God, which is the cheif, but it will be a glory to the
Miniſters, to recompence all their labours, that you ſhall not
only be ſaved your ſelves in the day of Jeſus Chriſt, but you
ſhall adde to the glory of his faithful Miniſters likewiſe when
they do appear before Chriſt?</p>
               <p>5 I ſhall adde one particular more, There is a time coming
when God ſhall magnifie his word before men and Angels: In

What a joy ſhal it be to thee when the Lord before men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

of the name of God in the hearing
of his Word; and now wee will proceed to
the Sanctification of the name of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Sacrament; that's the next duty of
worſhip.</p>
               <p>Now firſt for the word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> I confeſſe wee have not
that word in all the Scripture, as neither have we the word Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
and divers other words that Miniſters make uſe of, to ſet
forth the Myſteries of Religion by, but yet it is uſefull to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the meaning why Miniſters in the Church have given this
name, unto thoſe ſignes and ſeals that the Church receives; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
is to hallow a thing, or to dedicate, becauſe in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
there are outward things, that are made holy, for holy
and ſpirituall ends.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee our ſelves do as it were hallow, or dedicate
our ſelves unto God in the uſe of theſe Ordinances; that's one
reaſon from whence it hath the name.</p>
               <p>Or otherwiſe as ſome will have it <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> becauſe it is
to be received <hi>Sacramente</hi> with a holy mind, and therefore cald
the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> The Churches have uſed it a long time; in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians</hi>
time (which was above fourteen hundred years agoe)
he was the firſt that we find uſed this word, and moſt that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:116352:92"/>
would open the word unto us, ſay, that eſpecially it was taken
from the practiſe of Souldiers, who when they came and liſted
themſelves, bound themſelves in a ſolemne oath to be faithful to
their Captaine, and to the Cauſe that they did undertake; and
the oath, they were wont to call <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> A <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
Now in regard that Chriſtians when they come to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
they come to ſeale a Covenant with God, and though
they doe not formally and explicitely take an oath, yet they
bind themſelves in a holy Covenant, which hath the ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of an oath in it; (For a ſolemne Promiſe to the high God
hath the ſtrength of an oath in it) and from thence they were
cald by theſe names, <hi>Sacraments:</hi> but that for the word, that
you may underſtand it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the word the Scripture uſeth to ſet out this Sacrament,
by that now I am ſpeaking of, is</hi> the Communion of the body and
bloud of Chriſt; <hi>ſo you have it in</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 6. The Cup of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
which we bleſſe, is it not the Communion of the bloud of Chriſt?
The bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the body of
Chriſt? <hi>I ſay we are now treating about this point, how wee
are to ſanctifie the name of God</hi> in that which the Scripture
cals the Communion of the body and bloud of Chriſt; <hi>And now for
the opening of that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, We muſt know that this is a part of the Worſhip of
God, and we <hi>draw nigh to God</hi> in this, or otherwiſe it will not
come up to our point.</p>
               <p>And then wee ſhall ſhew that God is to be ſanctifyed in this
duty of worſhip.</p>
               <p>And then thirdly how.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Wee doe in this draw nigh to God; We worſhip
God; For when we are comming to receive theſe holy Signes
and Seals, we come to preſent our ſelves before God; and we
have to deal with God himſelfe in a ſervice that hee himſelfe
requires of us, in a holy, in a divine ſervice: wee come to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
our ſelves to God for bleſſing, for Communication of ſome
higher good unto us, then poſſibly thoſe Creatures that we have
to deale with, are able of themſelves to convey to us, come for a
higher good then to taſt a peece of bread, or to drink a draught of
wine, we come I ſay to preſent our ſelves to God; that wee
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:116352:92"/>
might have Communion with him, and that we might have the
bleſſin of the Covenant of grace conveyed unto us through
theſe things; now certainly this is a drawing nigh to God; for to
preſent our ſelves, for the Conveyance of the bleſsing of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace through theſe Creatures, yea, that we might
have Communion with God himſelfe in them, this is drawing
nigh to him, when we come to his Table; therefore we draw
nigh to God; had not God inſtituted and appointed theſe
Creatures, Bread and Wine and the actions about them to be
the meanes of Conveyance of bleſsing unto us, it had been Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip
for us to have expected any further preſence of God in
ſuch Creatures, then there is in the nature of them. It is true,
God is preſent with every Creature, when we eat and drinke
at our Tables God is preſent there; but we cannot be ſaid to
draw nigh to God, and worſhip God there; for we there looke
for no further preſence of God with us in them, to convey fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good then the Lord hath put into the nature of thoſe things:
onely when godly people take them, and receive them as bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
ſanctified by the word, they take them as the bleſsings of
God that come out of love to them. But now when we come to
receive that which is cald <hi>the Communion,</hi> there we expect things
that are beyond the nature of theſe Creatures to convey that
that is by an inſtitution of God ſet apart for ſupernatural uſes
and ends, not to convey in any naturall way ſuch and ſuch
things but in a ſupernaturall way, through the inſtitution of God,
and ſo it comes to bee worſhip. Had we not I ſay a command
for this, it were ſuperſtition and Idolatry for us to make uſe of
ſuch Creatures for ſuch ends. If any man in the world ſhould have
appointed a peece of Bread, or a draougth of wine to have ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and, ſealed the body and blood of Chriſt it hath been ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
in any, and Wil-worſhip, and ſinfull and abominable to
you; but we are to look upon God ſetting apart theſe Creatures
for ſuch holy and ſolemne ends, and, therefore when we come
to be exerciſed in them, we come to worſhip God; and wee
come likewiſe to tendes up our homage to God when wee come
to attend upon him in ſuch Ordinances as theſe are to tender
up that homage that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> poor Creatures unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as

                  </gap> we draw nigh to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
in theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:116352:93"/>
Secondly, Wee muſt ſanctifie Gods name in drawing nigh to
him: whatſoever we doe, <hi>whether we eat or drinke we muſt do all
to the glory of God;</hi> Now if in our common eating and drinking
we muſt do all to the glory of God, then certainly in this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
eating and drinking there muſt be ſome ſpecial thing done
for the glory of God in this.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe there is ſo much of God in it, for here there is a
preſenting before us the great yea the greateſt myſteries of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the deep Counſels of God concerning eternall life, are
preſented before us in theſe outward Elements of the bread and
wine, and the action thereof; now when we come to eat and to
drinke thoſe things that are appointed to ſet forth the greateſt
myſteries of ſalvation, and the deepeſt of the Councels of
God concerning mans eternall good, wherein eſpecially God
will glorifie himſelfe; we had need there ſanctifie the name of
God, for the things are very great and glorious that are preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto us.</p>
               <p>2. This Ordinance of the Lords Supper, or the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it is an Ordinance that Chriſt hath left to his Church, out
of the abundance of his love, and therefore you ſhall find if
you read the inſtitution of it, <hi>in the</hi> 25. of <hi>Matth.</hi> that the
ſame night wherein Chriſt was betrayed, he took bread and
brake it; though Chriſt was to die the next day, and to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with the wrath of God, yea that very night he was to be in
an agonie, and to ſweat drops of water and blood, and the
next day to die and to have theſe Tryals of wrath poured upon
him, ſo as to put him to cry out <hi>my God my God why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
me:</hi> Yet he buſies his thoughts that very night to inſtitute
this Supper; ſurely it muſt be a great Ordinance, and there is a
great deale of the love of Chriſt in it. Chriſt ſaw that his
Church had need of it, that he ſhould that night when he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
have his thoughts buſied about ſuch a thing as this is.
One would thinke at that time, that he had enough to take up
his thoughts concerning himſelfe, being to encounter with the
Law, and with the wrath of God for mans ſinne; but for all
that great worke Chriſt had to encounter with, yet his thoughts
are bulied about this great Ordinance of the inſtitution of the
Supper, and therefore there was great love in it, Chriſt ſaw
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:116352:93"/>
that it was a matter of great moment; now if it is ſo, than
there is great cauſe why we ſhould ſanctifie Gods name in ſuch
an Ordinance as this is, and not to account it as a common and
ordinary thing.</p>
               <p>3. We muſt ſanctifie Gods name in this; becauſe it is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Communion with Chriſt; wherein we come to have
ſuch a neer union and communion with him as to eath's fleſh
and to drinke his blood, and to ſit at his table. We come to have
Communion with Chriſt even in all our Sences; now Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ſo fully to us, that cals upon us to ſanctifie his name when
we come before him.</p>
               <p>4. In this the Covenant of grace is ſealed, the Covenant of
grace comes to be ſealed in both the parts of it; now when wee
come to have to deale with God in the way of the Covenant of
grace, both to have the Seale on his part, and the Seale on ours,
ſurely this muſt needs call for a ſanctifyed uſe of ſuch a thing as
is ſo holy as this is. And thats the firſt reaſon why we are to
ſanctifie Gods name in this, becauſe if we be in ordinary eating
and drinking we muſt doe it, then in this, wherein there is ſo
much of God, wherein the Myſteries of Godlineſſe are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, wherein there is ſo much of the love of Chriſt, wherein
we are to have cloſe Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Covenant of grace comes to be ſealed on both ſides: there
had need therefore be a ſanctifying of Gods name in the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider this; that there is no duty in all the book
of God that I know of, that is urged with more ſtrength and
ſeverity then this is; as that place in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. ſheweth
where you have required of every one that comes to receive the
Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper, <hi>That they ſhould examine
themſelves and ſo eate,</hi> and you have the moſt dreadfull expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
againſt thoſe that doe not doe it, that I know are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againſt the neglect of any duty in all the Book of God;
there the holy-Ghoſt ſaith, that <hi>whoſoever eats and drinks unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,</hi>
Firſt, <hi>he is guilty of the body and bloud of Chriſt,</hi> and then
Secondly, <hi>he eats and drinks his owne damnation;</hi> Theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
have as much dreadfulneſſe in them as can be Imagined,
and we doe not find an exhortation to a duty backt with two
ſuch ſevere expreſſions, in caſe we ſhould neglect our duty, as this
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:116352:94"/>
exhortation. What if wee doe not ſanctifie Gods name in this
duty? wee come to be <hi>guilty of the body and bloud of Chriſt.</hi>
Bloud-guiltineſſe is a terrible thing; you know <hi>David</hi> cries out,
<hi>Lord deliver me from Bloud-guiltineſſe;</hi> to have but the bloud of
an ordinary man to lie upon one, to ſhed the bloud of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Rogue that lives, in a murderous way, it would lie upon
the Conſcience and be very terrible; it is impoſſible that ſuch a
man can be quiet all his dayes though he hath never ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Conſcience. A Heathen could not be at quiet, if he hath
the guilt of bloud lie upon him; but to be guilty of the bloud of
Chriſt, whoſe bloud is ten thouſand thouſand times more worth
then the bloud of all the men that ever lived upon the face of the
earth, muſt needs be a moſt dreadfull thing; It is a fearefull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
<hi>guilty of the body and bloud of Chriſt,</hi> that is, he offers
ſuch an indignity to the body and bloud of Chriſt, as the Lord
will charge him of being guilty of it, guilty of abuſing of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And then <hi>he doth eat and drinke his owne damnation;</hi> but wee
ſhall ſpeake more to that, when wee come to ſhew how God
will ſanctifie his name in thoſe that doe not ſanctifie it here in
this holy Ordinance. I will not therefore ſpend further time in
thoſe Scriptures, for I bring them only now to ſhew that
there is a neceſſity of it, that we do ſanctifie the name of God in
this Ordinance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is nothing that ſtrikes more upon a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
wee find it by experience; even upon wicked mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
and eſpecially upon ſuch as begin to be enlightned in
the holineſſe of this Ordinance, God hath put much honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; I confeſſe ſome men may uſe it ſuperſtitiouſly though it
be an Ordinance of Chriſt, yet God hath put a great deale of
honour upon this Ordinance, that men that are very wicked o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
yet their Conſciences tell them that when they come
to this Ordinance then they muſt be good, then they muſt not
ſinne, but have good thoughts, and good prayers at that time.
And many times they dare not come, if their conſciences tell
them that they live in ſome ſin. I knew one my ſelfe once that
was to be executed, and he had never received this Ordinance in
all his life, though about fourty yeares of Age, And being
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:116352:94"/>
askt the reaſon why, he confeſt he lived in ſome ſin that hee
was loth to leave, and therefore would never come to that
Ordinance all his life, though herein the Devill gull'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him; but I mention it to ſhew what a power there is in
the conſciences of men about this Ordinance; this ordinarily is
one of the firſt things that ſtrikes upon the ſoules of men,
when they come to have their Conſciences awakened, Oh how
have I prophaned the name of God in the Ordinance of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
communion and have not ſanctified his name in it.</p>
               <p>That God ſhould be ſanctified in this Ordinance, that's cleer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <p>But now the great work is (which is the third thing that I
promiſed to ſhew) how wee ſhould ſanctifie Gods name in this
Ordinance. Certainly the name of God hath bin much taken in
vain, there hath been a great deale of pollution in the uſe of
this Ordinance, and in mens Spirits when they have been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing
themſelves in ſuch an holy Ordinance as this is; therefore
I will open this to you, and ſhall not be very large in it, only to
ſhew you the maine and principall things that may ſerve for
the direction of us, that the name of God may not be ſo taken
in vaine and diſhonored as heretofore, and I ſhall caſt what I
intend to ſpeak of into theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>1 That whoſoever was to pertake of this muſt be holy himſelf;
none can ſanctifie God, but he muſt have a ſanctified heart
himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this Ordinance it muſt be received in a holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
There muſt be a Communion of Saints for this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
and it cannot be received anywhere elſe but in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The holy diſpoſition of ſoule particularly, or the
qualifications of ſoule that are required for the ſanctifying of
Gods name in this Ordinance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the manner of the explicite goings out of the ſoule,
that there are to bee at that very time of receiving.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The keeping of the inſtitution of Chriſt in our recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
Theſe things are required for the ſanctifying of the name of
God in this Ordinance.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, Thoſe that come muſt bee holy themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:116352:95"/>
This is an Ordinance not appointed for converſion, to make ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
others that are not converted may come to the word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the word it is appointed to worke converſion; tis appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to worke Grace, to worke the firſt grace, <hi>Faith comes by
hearing;</hi> but we doe not find in all the Scripture that this is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for converſion, but it ſuppoſes converſion; none are to
come to receive this Sacrament but men and women that before
are converted by the word; the word firſt therefore is to be
preached to men for their converſion; and then this is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
appointed for to ſeale them; therefore in the Primitive
times they let all come to hearing of the word, and then when
the Sermon was done, there was an Officer ſtept up and cried
<hi>holy things for holy men,</hi> and then all others were to goe out, and
therefore it was called <hi>miſſa</hi> (though the Papiſts did corrupt it
and ſo called it the <hi>maſſe</hi> afterwards, by mixing their own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in ſtead of the Supper of the Lord, but it had that name at
firſt) I ſay this holy Communion was calld by the name of <hi>miſſa,</hi>
becauſe that all others were ſent away, and only ſuch as were of
the Church, and accounted godly ſtaid; <hi>holy things to holy
men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this muſt needs be ſo, becauſe that the nature of it being
the Seal of the Covenant of grace requires it; it muſt be ſuppoſed
that all that come hither muſt be in Covenant with God, they
muſt be ſuch as have been brought to ſubmit to the Condition of
the Covenant. Now the Condition of the Covenant of grace
is, <hi>Beleeve and be ſaved;</hi> it is therefore appointed for beleevers;
And as the nature of it being a Seal ſuppoſeth a Covenant, ſo
none can have this Covenant ſealed to them, but thoſe that doe
firſt ſubmit to it, and are brought into Covenant; when you
make an Indenture, and put to the Seale, certainly the Seale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
only to thoſe that have their names in the Indenture: Now
tis true though mens names are not mentioned in the word, yet
the condition is to thoſe that are brought in to beleeve in Jeſus
Chriſt; ſaith God I come now to ſeale all my mercies in Chriſt
to their ſoules. We abuſe God if we come to take the Seal to a
blanke, it is to make this Ordinance a ridiculous thing; therefore
there muſt be ſome tranſactions between God and your ſouls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you come to the Seale; if a man ſhould ſay to you come ſet
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:116352:95"/>
to your ſeale to ſuch a thing, and there were never any kind of
tranſactions between this man and you before, you would account
it ridiculous; after there hath been agreements between you,
you uſe then to ſeale. So it muſt be here; I would appeal to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of your Conſciences that have come to the Lords Supper,
what tranſactions have there been between God and your ſoules?
canſt thou ſay the Lord was pleaſed to reveale himſelfe to mee;
to make known to mee my wretched condition, and the way of
grace and ſalvation, and ſhewed me that upon my comming in
to receive his Son, he would be mercifull to me and pardon
my ſins; and I have found the Spirit of God working my heart
to Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord from heaven ſpeaking to me, and I
ſending an Anſwer to heaven againe, how willing my ſoule was
to accept of the Covenant, which the Lord hath made with poor
Creatures in the word of his Goſpell? canſt thou ſay this in the
uprightneſſe of thy heart? if not, know that this Seale belongs
not to thee: untill the Lord hath by his word ſubdued thy
heart to this agreement firſt with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Ordinance, it is the Ordinance of ſpiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment,
of eating the fleſh of Chriſt and drinking his bloud in a
ſpirituall way. Now it muſt needs ſuppoſe that firſt there muſt be
life before there can be any nouriſhment received in. If it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to nouriſh and increaſe grace, then ſurely there muſt be
grace before; what nouriſhment can a dead child take? the very
firſt thing that is to be done is nouriſhment here, The word hath
power to convey life and then to nouriſh, but we read of no ſuch
thing here, but that which is to be done here is preſently to feed,
to eat, and to drinke, thats the end of the Sacrament; therefore
it muſt be ſuppoſed that thou muſt have ſpiritual life, there
muſt come no dead Soule to this Ordinance, but thoſe who
are quickned by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, they muſt come for
nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the act here required doth note that only thoſe that
are holy and godly can receive this Sacrament; we are required
by the Apoſtle <hi>to examine our ſelves.</hi> To examine our ſelves of
what? it muſt be of our godlineſſe, examine what worke of
God hath been upon the ſoule, how God hath brought the
ſoule to himſelfe, and what Graces of the Spirit of God are
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:116352:96"/>
there, And how we have been brought into Covenant with
God now if only thoſe can receive worthily, and are to come
that firſt examine themſelves, then certainly ſuch only as are
godly are to come, for they only can performe thoſe acts that
are required.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Its a Sacrament of Communion with God, and
Communion with the Saints; now <hi>what Communion hath Light
and Darkneſſe? or what fellowſhip hath Chriſt with Belial,</hi> If it
be a Sacrament of Communion, of coming to the Table of
God will God have his enemies to come to his Table? you will
invite no enemies to your Tables, but your children and friends,
ſo they muſt be the children of God and the friends of God,
theſe that are reconciled to God in the bloud of his Son, and
thoſe that are his children that muſt ſit at his Table, therefore
they muſt be holy. Now this may ſuffice for that firſt thing, that
this is not an Ordinance for all ſorts of people, but ſuch as have
ſubmitted to the condition of the Covenant before. Such as
have grace, and abilitie to examine themſelves of their graces,
and ſuch as are children and reconciled to God, and ſo are fit to
ſit at the Table of God, and to enjoy Communion with him and
with his Son, and with the Saints; for we are one body ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
when we come to this holy Ordinance; all others
therefore certainly are to be kept from this Sacrament but
ſuch.</p>
               <p>2 The ſecond thing will make it out more fully, and that is,
it is not enough that wee be holy our ſelves; (and ſo all ignorant,
prophane and ſcandalous, yea all that are meerly civil, that can
not make out any work of Godlineſſe upon their hearts in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to Chriſt, are excluded.)</p>
               <p>But 1 It is to be done in a holy Communion, and is cleer out
of that place in 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 16, 17. The Cup of bleſſing which
wee bleſſe, is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt? the bread
which wee break, is it not the Communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi>
and then ſaith the Apoſtle in the 17. verſe, <hi>for we being many are
one bread and one body;</hi> therefore all that come to receive the
Sacrament, they muſt ſo come as they muſt be one body, one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Corporation; this very conſideration, that thoſe with
whom we receive the Sacrament are one body with us, it hath a
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:116352:96"/>
great deale in it, for the helping of us to ſanctifie Gods Name;
this Ordinance I ſay, it is to be received only in a holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
one Chriſtian cannot receive the Sacrament alone; there muſt
be a Communion whereſoever it is to be adminiſtered; it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
there is one Godly man there, but there muſt be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints, and in that communion it is to be received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> You will ſay, muſt it be received in a communion of
Saints? what if wicked men doe come there? will that hinder us
from ſanctifying Gods name in partaking of the Sacrament with
them? doe not wee finde in Scripture that the Church had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
wicked men among them? there are alwayes tares grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up with the wheat: If you read even in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> you
ſhall find that there were ſome in that Church that were wicked,
yea and its thought that <hi>Judas</hi> himſelfe did receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
too; therefore what if wicked men be there, doth that
hinder?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, firſt it is true, that in the Church of God
there have been wicked men, and is like there will be wicked
men to the end of the World; but yet whereſoever there is a
right communion of Saints, there ought to be the power of
Chriſt exerciſed to caſt out thoſe wicked men, or at leaſt to
withdraw from them. This is the Law of Chriſt, that if there
be any that have communion with you, if any of them doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be wicked, you are bound in conſcience <hi>to goe and tell
them;</hi> if they do not reforme, you are bound <hi>to take two or three,</hi>
and if they doe not yet reforme, then you are bound <hi>to tell the
Church,</hi> to tell the Aſſembly of the Saints when they meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
for ſo the word <hi>Church</hi> doth ſignifie, and wee find in the
1 <hi>Cor. 5. chap.</hi> that when there was an inceſtuous perſon to bee
caſt out, it was done in the preſence of the congregation: Thus
farre you are bound to doe, otherwiſe you cannot ſay that it is
nothing to you if wicked men bee there, for you have not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
your conſcience, and ſo you come to be defiled, and
you doe not ſanctifie Gods Name in this Ordinance, becauſe you
have not done to the uttermoſt of your duty for the caſting out
of thoſe wicked men.</p>
               <p>And marke in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. there the Apoſtle writing to the
Church, bids them that they ſhould <hi>purge out the old leven, Know
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:116352:97"/>
yee not</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that a little leven leveneth the whole lump?</hi> the
Apoſtle doth not ſpeak there of ſin, but of the wicked inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſon, ſaith he, you muſt look to it that this man be purged
out from you, or otherwiſe you are all levened by it, that is,
the whole Church would be levened by it, if there were not care
taken to purge out that one man.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, ſhall we be the worſe for one wicked mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
no, if we be no way faulty of it, then we cannot be ſaid to
be worſe and it cannot leven us; but now when it is our duty
to purge him out and we doe not doe it, as in all communion of
Saints there is a duty, and there is not any one but may do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
towards it; thus far every communicant in every commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Saints muſt goe; if there be a wicked man there, if you
come to know it, and doe not goe thus far as I have ſpoken, you
art defiled by him, you are not defiled by the meer preſence of
wicked men, (for thats a meer deceit and gall that ſome would
put upon men that differ from them otherwiſe;) but thus now
you are defiled by their preſence, if you doe not doe your duty,
and the uttermoſt that you are able to purge them out; yea, then
the whole congregation is defiled, if they doe not doe their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
now this is the duty of every one in the congregation, to tell
their brother, or to take two or three, and after that to tell the
Church, and ſo come to profeſſe againſt them, or if the Church
will not doe their duty as they ought, yet then to free their
own ſoules, as to profeſſe, here is one that is ſo and ſo guilty, and
may be proved thus and thus, and ſo for my part I to free my
own ſoule profeſſe that this man or woman ought nor to have
communion here; and thus you come to free your own ſoules, and
when you have done thus, though wicked men be there you may
there eate and drink and not be defiled by their preſence, for
you cannot be ſaid properly to eate with them now, not to have
communion with them, no more than if a dog ſhould come and
skip upon the Table, and take a peece of bread; you cannot have
communion with him becauſe he takes it, no more have you with
thoſe wicked men when once you have dealt ſo far with them, you
for your ſelves profeſſe againſt them that you for your own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
cannot have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with them herein; this is not to eat
with them: The Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. latter end, he doth there require,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:116352:97"/>
in the 11. <hi>v.</hi> that <hi>If any man that is called a Brother be a fornicator,
or covetous, or an Idolater, or a Raylor, or a Drunkard, or an Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
with ſuch a one no not to eate; for what have I to doe to judge
them alſo that are without?</hi> that is, the Heathens, and thoſe that
were in no communion with them, I have nothing to do to judge
them; <hi>but doe not yee judge them that are within?</hi> When wee
have ſo far freed our ſelves as profeſſing againſt their ſin, then
we cannot be ſaid to have communion with them, and then wee
do withdraw <hi>from thoſe that walk diſorderly,</hi> when wee doe our
duty thus far. 1 <hi>Theſſ. 3. 14. If any man obey not our word by
this Epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him, that hee
may be aſhamed;</hi> and in the ſixt verſe of that Chapter hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
them in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>that they ſhould
withdraw themſelves from every Brother that walked diſorderly.</hi>
So that till we do our duty we come to be defiled; but now, if
we do our duty, then it is not the mixture of a Congregation
that is enough to hinder any from receiving the Sacrament there:
and this will tend much to ſatisfie men about the receiving in
mixt congregations where any are caſt into them and are actuall
Members there.</p>
               <p>But now on the other ſide, if we be in a place where either
this Congregation will not take upon them any ſuch power to
caſt out unworthy ones, or are not convinc'd of this power,
then there is no rule that Chriſt hath ſet, that we muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
all our dayes to continue to be in ſuch a congregation as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
one of the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt; if ſo be there be any
ſuch that are wicked, and we do firſt what we can to have them
caſt out, and we waite with patience in ſuch a congregation for
to have them caſt out, and yet we ſee that either the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth not underſtand that they have any ſuch power, or doe
deny ſuch a power that they have, and ſo upon that all people
are left in a mixt way, I ſay then there is no rule in all the Book
of God that ſhould force men to continue to bee members of
ſuch a communion where they cannot enjoy one Ordinance of
Jeſus Chriſt, which is the Ordinance of <hi>Separating the pretious
from the vile,</hi> the Ordinance of caſting out the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.
It were a very diſeaſed body and in danger quickly of
the loſſe of life, to take in every thing into it, and to have no

expulſive faculty to purge any thing out again; ſo a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is altogether without ſuch an Ordinance as that is of
expelling ſuch as are wicked and ungodly; I ſay, I find no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
that doth force people, and require them as bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to continue there where they may not enjoy all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of Jeſus Chriſt, and the right underſtanding of what I
ſay now, will help us to anſwer all thoſe Scriptures that are
brought. As if it be that of <hi>Judas,</hi> firſt it is hard to make it out
cleer whether it were the Lords Supper that he received yea or
no: but ſuppoſe it be granted that he did, yet I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
but ſuch as <hi>Judas</hi> was, that ſhall continue to make ſuch an
outward profeſſion as he did, and could not be diſcovered in
the Church-way, but that we may receive with ſuch as are cloſe
hypocrites.</p>
               <p>You will ſay Jeſus Chriſt knew him to be faulty, and he told
<hi>John</hi> that lay in his boſome what he was; but though he knew
him as he was God, yet he deals with him in his Miniſteriall
way, and he had appointed before that none were to be caſt out
but were to be dealt withall in ſuch a Miniſteriall way; ſo that it
is not enough though I knew by Revelation from God that ſuch
a man were an hypocrite; ſuppoſe God ſhould reveale from
heaven to me that ſuch a man were an hypocrite, I think I might
communicate with him ſtill, when he doth not ſo farre diſcover
himſelf that I can by witneſſes prove his evill; therefore though
men be wicked, yet it doth not defile the communion where
they are if there hath been that way uſed that Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for to be obſerved in his Church. And when that is
done then I am to withdraw from him, and to profeſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
communion with him, ſo that its enough to anſwer the
caſe.</p>
               <p>We read likewiſe that there were divers wicked men among
the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and of Tares that grew in the Wheat.</p>
               <p>It's true, there were wicked men among them, but they were
enjoyned by the Apoſtle to caſt out thoſe wicked men, and if
they did not do it, it was their ſin, and they were defiled by it.</p>
               <p>And for Tares that were among the Wheat, take it that this is
meant concerning the Church, ſuppoſe it were (and yet Chriſt
ſaith plainly that <hi>the field is the World,</hi> and 'tis the godly and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:116352:99"/>
the wicked living together in the World, and ſo I find many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
take it; but howſoeuer take it that it is meant of the
Church-communion; yet thus far is clear that it was through the
fault of the officers that there ſhould be any Tares among the
Wheat; for ſo the text ſaith plainly that while the ſervants ſlept
there did Tares ſpring up; therefore there ſhould have been
none.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they were not ſuch Tares as would ſpoyle the
Wheat, but as <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaith in thoſe countries the Tares did grow
much like Wheat all the while it was in the blade, ſo that they
were hardly to be diſtinguiſhed, though ſome that were of more
underſtanding were able to diſcern them from the Wheat; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though ſuch as do grow up like unto the Wheat may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
and yet in this caſe only, that is, in caſe that it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
the Wheat, that is, when they are ſo cloſe to the Wheat
as there will be danger by plucking them up to pluck up the
Wheat too, then they muſt be let alone; Mark, firſt it was
through the negligence of the officers; they ſhould have been
kept out. Secondly, if they do get in, yet while they grow ſo
cloſe to the Wheat as there will be danger that when you pluck
out them, to pluck out the wheat too, only in that caſe it muſt
be forborne; but this gives no liberty that therefore all ſorts
may be let into the Church, and there ſhould be no kind of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
to caſt out thoſe that are venomous weeds that will do
hurt and miſchiefe.</p>
               <p>But if you underſtand it (as many do) concerning the World,
then the meaning is thus, the Preaching of the Goſpell that
comes to a place, and ther's only good ſeed ſown, and is a means
of the converſion of many, but together with the converſion
of ſome, there are others that do heare the Goſpel Preached,
and the truth is, they being mingled among the hearers of the
Word, in ſtead of bringing forth good fruit according to the
Goſpel, they bring forth the Tares; now ſaith the ſervant, Lord,
how comes it to paſſe that we preach ſuch excellent truths in this
place, and yet there are ſo many wicked men that bring forth
ſuch wicked fruit? Lord, is it thy mind that we ſhould be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeparated from them and have nothing to do with them, that
there ſhould be a full ſeparation while we live in this world?
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:116352:100"/>
no ſaith Chriſt, not ſo; for then the truth is, if all godly men
ſhould wholly withdraw from wicked men, and beleeve that
they may not live among them, they could not live in the world.
if you did beleeve it were your duty not ſo much as to live near a
wicked man, nor to have any thing to do in any kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with him, there would be no Wheat growing in this field
of the world here; and therefore you muſt be content, when
you live where the Preaching of the Goſpel is, and the ſeed
brings forth good fruit in ſome, and in others it brings forth
Tares, you muſt not be offended by this, that here in this world
God doth not by ſome viſible ſtroke of judgement come and
ſtrike them dead, or that God doth not take ſome courſe that
there ſhould be a full ſeparation here, but that they might live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
till the day of judgement; here I ſay you ſhall not have
ſuch a full ſeparation; ſo that you ſee it carries a very faire ſenſe
to take the field to be the world, and the kingdome of Heaven
there to be the Preaching of the Goſpel in any place, and ſo
we muſt bee content while we live in this world to bee where
wicked and ungodly men are. But it doth not follow from
this place that we are to have converſe in the cloſeſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
in Church-communion with wicked men, to be made one
body by eating the ſame bread, and drinking the ſame wine;
it holds not forth ſuch cloſe communion as this is; ſo that ther's
little ſtrength can be taken from that place, but ſtill it holds
that whereſoever there is the Sacrament of the Lords Supper,
there muſt be a holy communion of Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Scripture only ſaith let us examine our
ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant for the benefit to mine own ſoule, I muſt look
to examine my ſelfe more eſpecially; but now for another I am
but onely ſo farre bound to looke to him as to keepe my ſelfe
clean; it is true I am not bound to goe and pry into his life and
all his waies, ſo as to force him to give an account of things that
are ſecret, but I am bound to keep a watch, and if any thing be
done that offends me, then I am bound to goe to him according
to the former Rule of Chriſt, and if he appears to be wicked,
then I am bound to ſee him purged from the Congregation; for
take but that other text in 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 6. know you not that a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:116352:100"/>
little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</hi> If I doe not do ſo much
as concerns my duty, then I am defiled by it. So as that you
muſt not thinke that it is nothing to you how many wicked men
come to the Lords Table, and that it belongs only to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
and they are to look to it; the truth is that every one in
his place is to look to it, and every one may be defiled if hee
doth not performe this duty that God requires of him; do not
ſay what have I to doe with my Brother; <hi>am I my Brothers
keeper?</hi> it was the ſpeech of <hi>Cain;</hi> if thou beeſt of the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
you are to have a care of your Brother; <hi>doe not yee judge
thoſe that are within?</hi> there is ſome kind of judgement that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one may paſſe upon ſuch as do joyne with them in the ſame
Body; ſurely it concernes me much; what ſhall I do in ſuch an
action as to joyne with them to eat bread, whereby I muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that I doe beleeve my ſelfe to be of the ſame body, that
this drunkard is of, that this Whoremaſter is of, that this ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
is of? whenever you receive the Communion with any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
you doe profeſſe your ſelves to be of the ſame body with
that Company; only in this caſe, If I have diſcovered any,
and can particularly profeſſe againſt anyone, then I doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
my ſelfe to be of the ſame body with him; but now when
I come in an ordinary way, and I know ſuch to be wicked, vile,
and prophane, and I profeſſe nothing againſt them, nor take
any courſe at all, I doe then by partaking with them, profeſſe
my ſelfe to be of the ſame body that they are of. Thou doeſt
as it were openly declare, Lord, here we come and profeſſe that
we are all of the body of Jeſus Chriſt; now when thou knoweſt
ſuch and ſuch as are notoriouſly wicked and profane, and doſt
nothing in the world to helpe to purge them out, doſt not thou
thinke that Gods name is taken in vaine? is not Gods name pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned
here? therefore it concerns us very much to look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, that it be a holy communion that we receive the Bread and
Wine in; I beſeech you therefore underſtands things aright that
I have ſpoken of; I have laboured to ſatisfie men that there is a
way that we may partake of the Sacrament though wicked men
be mixt with us: But this is that that is required of you for
doing your duty, to keep your ſelves clean that you may not
be acceſſory any way to any wicked mans comming to partake
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:116352:101"/>
of this holy myſtery of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, there
are divers things further about this, and the ſpeciall thing I
thought of was to ſhew you the holy qualifications that there
ought to be; but this I conceived to be neceſſary, and I ſhould
not have had peace in mine own conſcience as being faithfull
to you in what I am ſpeaking, of ſanctifying the Name of
God in this Ordinance, if I ſhould not have mentioned this
that I have ſpoken unto you, and there's an error on both ſides,
that I deſire to meet withall; either thoſe that come hand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
head, and think it concerns them not at all with whom
they come to the Sacrament, but to look to their own hearts:
and there's an error on the other ſide, that if they do what they
can to keep them away, and yet if they ſhould be ſuffered to
come, they may not come to partake of thoſe things, now it
is very uſefull for us to know what wee ſhould doe in this
caſe.</p>

from ſuch a Congregation where
they could not receive all the Ordinances of
Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As now, if I were in a Church where I
could have but a piece of the Sacrament, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they dealt with me as the Papiſts doe with the people, that
is, they will give them the bread and not the wine, Certainly
I were not bound to ſtay with them then, but I were bound to
goe where I might have the whole Sacrament. So if a Church
will give me ſome one Ordinance and not another, I confeſſe ſo
long as there is hope that I may enjoy it, and that they are in a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:116352:101"/>
way for injoyment, I thinke there ſhould be a great forbearance
to a Church as well as to a particular perſon; as I muſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from a particular man, where there is hope ſtill of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and that there may come good of my forbearance, ſo
towards a Church much more; but I ſay, if I cannot enjoy, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth there appeare any hope of the injoyment of all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
certainly it were but a cruelty to force men to ſtay
there, when as otherwhere they may enjoy all Ordinances for
the good of their ſouls. And this cannot be Schiſme thus to do;
as now is this Schiſme? ſuppoſe a man were in a place and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in ſuch a Communion, for his outward benefit he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
his dwelling from one place to another, if he can have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
trading in another place; then certainly if he may have more
Ordinances for the edification of his ſoule, he may as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
from one to another, as he may remove if his trading bee
betterin one place then another. Chriſt would have all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
look to the edification of their ſoules; and ſhould I account
that Schiſme? when a man or woman meerly out of tenderneſſe
and a deſire to enjoy Jeſus Chriſt in all his Ordinances for the
benefit of their ſoules, they find ſuch want to their ſoules of
all Ordinances, that though they may have ſome in one place,
yet if they cannot have all, their ſoules doe not ſo thrive; now
if this be all the end why they remove that they might have
more edification to their ſoules injoying the Ordinances of
Chriſt more fully, God forbid that this ſhould ever be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſuch a ſin, that the Scripture is to brand; no thats Schiſme
when there is a violent rending out of malice, for the want of
love; for as Apoſtafie is a rending from the head, So Schiſme from
the Body, that is, when it is out of an evill Spirit, from envie, or
from malice, from want of love, or from any baſe ſiniſter ends,
and upon no juſt Ground; but now when it is meerly out of
love to Jeſus Chriſt, that I might have more edification to my
ſoule, and ſtill I retain love to the Saints that are there as they
are in a Communion, and ſo farre as they have any thing good
among them, I hold Communion with them in that; onely I
deſire in humility, and in meekeneſſe that I may be in ſuch a
place, where my ſoule may be moſt edified, where I may enjoy
all thoſe Ordinances that Chriſt hath appointed for his Church,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:116352:102"/>
certainly, that ſoule that can give this account to Ieſus Chriſt
for going from one place to another, will be freed by Ieſus
Chriſt from ſuch a ſinne, as this that the world cals Schiſme; but
the truth is, this word is in mens mouthes that underſtand not
what it means, and the devill alwayes will have ſome word or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caſt upon them that are good; for hee hath heretofore gained
much by it, ſo ſtill he makes account to gaine much by words,
and Termes, and therefore men ſhould take heed of words and
Termes that they do not underſtand, and examine ſeriouſly
what the meaning of theſe words, and what is held forth in
thoſe words; and thus much for that point, that it muſt be in a
holy Communion; wherever there is the receiving of the
Lords Supper, it muſt be received in a holy Communion.</p>
               <p>Now wee are to proceed to that which is the maine thing,
and that is, What are the holy qualifications or diſpoſitions of
the ſoule, together with the actings fit in the receiving of the
Lords Supper, what is required in the ſoule, for the ſanctifying
of the name of God in this holy Sacrament; there are many
things required.</p>
               <p>As firſt, there is required knowledge; I muſt know what I doe
when I come to receive this holy Sacrament; knowledge apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

heaven and have ſaid thus to you, what are you doing now,
what do you go for, what account had you been able to have

that they may be ſet before my view; Lord, when I have
come to thy word, I have had in mine eares ſounding the great
myſteries of godlineſſe, the great things of the Covenant of
grace, and now I goe to ſee them repreſented before mine eyes in
that Ordinance of thine that thou haſt appointed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:116352:102"/>
Yea Lord, I am now going to receive the Seales of the bleſſed
Covenant of thine, the ſecond Covenant, the new Covenant,
the Seales of the Teſtimony and will of thine; I am going to
have confirmed to my ſoule thine everlaſting Love in Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Yea Lord, I am going to that Ordinance wherein I expect to
have Communion with thy ſelfe, and the communication of
thy cheife mercies to my ſoule in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I am going to feaſt with thee, to feed upon the body and bloud
of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Yea I am now going to ſet to the Seale of the Covenant on
my part, to renew my Covenant with thee, I am going to have
Communion with thy Saints, to have the bond of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with all thy people to be confirmed to me, that there might
be a ſtronger bond of union and love between me and thy Saints
then ever; theſe are the ends that I go for, this is the work
that I am now going about, thus you muſt come in underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
you muſt come with underſtanding, you muſt know what
you are going about; this is that which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of,
when he ſpeaks of the diſcerning the Lords Body; he rebukes
the Corinthians for their ſin, and ſhews them that they were
guilty of the body and bloud of Chriſt, becauſe they did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the Lords body, they lookt only upon the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but did not diſcerne what there was of Chriſt there, they
did not underſtand the inſtitution of Chriſt; they did not ſee how
Chriſt was under thoſe elements, both repreſented, and exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto them, thats the firſt thing, there muſt be knowledge and
underſtanding.</p>
               <p>And now for the knowledge and underſtanding of the nature
of the Sacrament; there need be knowledge in other points of
Religion, for we can never come to underſtand the nature of this
Sacrament, without knowing God, and knowing our ſelves,
knowing in what eſtate we were by nature, knowing our Fall,
knowing the way of Redemption, knowing Jeſus Chriſt what he
was, and what he hath done for the making of an Atonement,
the neceſſity of Jeſus Chriſt, and what the way of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is that God hath appointed to bring mens ſoules to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life by. The maine points of Religion muſt be known, but
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:116352:103"/>
eſpecially that that concernes the nature of a Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Now this knowledge likewiſe muſt be actuall, not meerly
habituall knowledge, but there muſt be a ſtirring up of this
knowledge, that is, by meditation, I muſt be meditating, have
actuall thoughts and meditations of what I doe know; that ought
to be the work of a Chriſtian in comming to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
to quicken up his knowledge, to have a renewed
work of his knowledge by actuall thoughts and meditations of
the maine points of Religion, and eſpecially of the nature and
the end of this holy inſtitution, that is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As wee muſt come underſtandingly, without
which wee cannot ſanctifie Gods name, ſo we muſt come with
hearts ſutable to the work that wee are about, that is, becauſe
the great thing that is here, is the breaking of Chriſts body, and
the pouring forth his bloud. A ſutable diſpoſition to this is
brokenneſſe of heart, ſence of our ſinne, of that dreadfull breach
that ſin hath made between God and the ſoul; our ſin ſhould
be upon our hearts ſo as to break them; But this brokenneſſe
muſt be evangelicall; it muſt be through the applying of the
blood of Chriſt unto my ſoule; I muſt come to be ſenſible of
my ſin; but eſpecially be ſenſible of it by what I ſee in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament, that muſt make me ſenſible of my ſinne: There
are a great many things to make me ſenſible of my ſin: The
conſideration of the great God that thou haſt ſinned againſt, and
the Curſe of the Law thats due to thee, the wrath of God that
is incenſed againſt thee for thy ſin, and thoſe eternall flames
that are prepared for ſinners, thoſe everlaſting burnings.</p>
               <p>But now thoſe are not the things that will break the heart in
an evangelicall way, in a gracious way; the maine thing by
which the ſoule muſt come to break its heart, muſt be the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the evil of ſin in the red glaſſe of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt,
the beholding him broken; and truely there is nothing in the
world, that hath that power to break the heart for ſin, as the
beholding of that which is to be beheld in the holy Sacrament;
and that heart is a hard heart that can ſee what is there to be ſeen,
and not break in the apprehenſion of ſin; when I here ſee what
my ſinne coſt, what a price was made for my ſoule, when I ſee
the hatred of God againſt ſinne, and the juſtice of God in not
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:116352:103"/>
ſparing his Sonne, but in breaking his Sonne for my ſinne, and
in ſhedding the blood of his Sonne for my ſinnes, I ſee here that
the making of my peace which God did coſt more then ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
worlds is worth; I ſee that by my ſin ſuch a breach was
made between God and my ſoule, that all the Angels in heaven,
and men in the world could never make up this breach; only the
Sonne of God, hee that was God and man, that was thus broken
by the burden of the wrath of his Father, for my ſins, could do
this. The truth is, when wee come to this holy Communion,
we are to look upon Chriſt as if we ſaw him hanging upon the
Croſſe; ſuppoſe thou hadſt lived at the time when Chriſt was
crucifyed, and hadſt underſtood as much concerning the death
of Chriſt as now thou doeſt, and what Chriſt was, if ſo bee that
thou ſhouldeſt have beheld him in the Garden, and there ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
drops of water and blood, and lie groveling upon the ground,
crying if it be poſſible let this cup paſſe from me: and ſhouldeſt
have followed him to the croſſe, and their have ſeen his hands and
feet nailed, and his ſide pierced, and the bloud trickling downe,
and have heard him crying out my God, my God, why haſt thou
forſaken mee, would not ſuch a ſight as this is, have broken
thy heart for thy ſinne; the truth is there is more, I won't ſay on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo much, but I ſay there is more in this Sacrament to breake
the heart for ſin then ſuch a ſight as that.</p>
               <p>You will ſay if you ſhould have Chriſt to be crucified again
before your eyes, if you ſhould ſee the body of Chriſt hanging
upon the Croſſe, and there behold him crucified, and hearing
of him cry out, my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me,
you would think if your hearts did not break for ſin then, that
they were deſperately hard; know every time that thou haſt
come to receive the Sacrament, thou haſt come to ſee ſuch a fight,
and it is as great an aggravation of the hardneſſe of thy heart if
it hath not broken at this ſight, as it would be if it ſhould not
break at that fight; We read in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeaking of
the preaching of the Goſpel, he ſaith that Chriſt was crucified
before thoſe that did hear the word; and, fooliſh Galatians, who
hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth, before
whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth, crucified
among you? hee doth not meane that Chriſt was crucified in
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:116352:104"/>
                  <hi>Galatia,</hi> but that where the word was preached he was evidently
ſet forth, and crucified among them; but now my brethren, the
crucifying of Chriſt in the word, is not ſuch a reall, evident, and
ſenſible ſetting forth of Chriſt crucified, as when he is ſet forth
in this Sacrament, and tis that which works with more efficacie
to break the heart, then that other ſight; and the reaſon that I
give is this.</p>
               <p>Becauſe you doe never find that God did ſet that apart as an
Ordinance, an inſtitution appointed to that end that they ſhould
come to look upon that for the breaking of their hearts; there
was indeed a naturalneſſe in it, that if they did behold Chriſt,
it might break their hearts, but it was not ſuch an Ordinance, it
was not a Sacrament as this is; now this being in a ſacramentall
way in the uſe of an Ordinance appointed by Ieſus Chriſt to ſet
forth his ſufferings, and all the riches of the Covenant of grace to
the ſoule, there may be expected here a further bleſſing then in the
other, though its true, the other might worke mightily upon the
heart; but yet this being a great Ordinance of Chriſt in the church,
a great inſtitution of Ieſus Chriſt, for the ſetting out of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
it hath a more ſpecial bleſſing that goes along with it;
every Ordinance hath a promiſe, and a more ſpeciall bleſſing then
any other thing that is not an Ordinance. So when you come
here to behold Chriſt crucified before you, you cannot ſee
Chriſt naturally crucified as upon the Croſſe: but you have
Chriſt crucified before you in the way of a Sacrament, in the way
of a ſolemne inſtitution of Ieſus Chriſt, that hath a ſpeciall Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
which goes along with it; therefore if the heart be not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
here, there is an aggravation of the hardneſſe of the heart as
great as if we ſhould behold Ieſus Chriſt upon the Croſſe and
our hearts not broken there; and indeed this is a ſpecial reaſon
why thoſe are ſaid to be guilty of the body and bloud of Chriſt
that receive unworthily; as if a man had been then alive, and
had been before the Croſſe, and there have ſeen how the blood
of Ieſus Chriſt was ſhed for ſinne, and ſhould not have been
affected with it, but ſhould have acounted it as a common thing;
this man in ſome regard might have been ſaid to be guilty of his
death; that is, to have joyned and conſented with thoſe that did
crucifie him; for if a man ſees another commit a ſin, if he bee not
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:116352:104"/>
affected with that ſinne, and it does not ſtirre his heart, he may
come to be partaker of his Sinne; ſo thoſe that ſhall come to
ſee Jeſus Chriſt crucifyed, and have not their hearts at all
ſtir'd with the crucifying of Chriſt, they are in ſome regard
truly ſaid to be guilty of the body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt;
and thats the ſecond thing, brokenneſſe of Spirit is ſuitable to
the light of a broken Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. The third thing that is here to be done in the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
of Gods name, is the purging and cleanſing of the
heart from ſinne; an actuall cleanſing and purging the heart
from ſinne there ought to be. The Iews in their Paſſeover
were to caſt out all leaven, and thoſe that write of the cuſtome
of the Jews, ſay that they were wont to doe three things in
the caſting out of their Leven.</p>
               <p>1. They made diligent ſearch for Leaven; they lighted Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
to look into every Corner leaſt there ſhould be any bit of
Leaven left in the houſe.</p>
               <p>2. When they found it they caſt it out.</p>
               <p>3. They uſed an execration, they did curſe themſelves if they
ſhould willingly keepe any Leaven in the houſe.</p>
               <p>So my brethren, when we come to partake of this holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
there ſhould be a diligent inquiſition for ſin, for Sin in
Scripture is compared to Leaven; thou ſhouldeſt make a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
ſearch what ſin there is in thy heart, in any of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of thy ſoule, what ſinne there is in thy thoughts, in thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
in thy underſtanding, in thy will, in any of thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
what ſinne there hath been in thy life, what family ſins,
what perſonall ſins. Thou ſhouldeſt make a diligent ſearch to
ſee whither there be not ſome Leaven, ſome evill in thy heart;
and what ever ſin thou ſhalt come to find out in thy heart,
there muſt be a caſting of it out; that is, thy ſoule muſt be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it to oppoſe it with all thy might; whatever beloved ſin,
whatever gainefull ſin, whatſoever become of thee, thy ſoule
muſt renounce that ſinne of thine; yea and in a kind of execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thy ſelfe; thats thus, Lord, as ever I expect to receive
any good by this body and blood of Chriſt, that I come now
to receive, ſo Lord, here I profeſſe againſt every ſin that I have
found out in my heart; I deſire to find out all, and profeſſe
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:116352:105"/>
againſt all, and renounce all, and would doe to the uttermoſt
that I am able for delivering of my ſoule fully, from every
knowne or beloved ſin; oh that there might not be any remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in my heart; this muſt be the diſpoſition of the ſoule com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
hither, and it muſt needs be thus or elſe we cannot ſanctifie
Gods name, becauſe there is nothing more ſutable then this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
unto the receiving of the Sacrament; for we come
here to profeſſe that we doe acknowledge that ſinne did coſt ſo
much as it did, that it coſt the blood of the Sonne of God; now
this cannot chuſe but cauſe the heart to renounce ſinne; If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I doe beleeve that ſinne hath coſt the bloud of Chriſt, that
it coſt him ſo deare as it did, that it did trouble Heaven and
earth, that there muſt be ſuch a mighty wonderfull way of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to God for my ſinne committed againſt him, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſinne hath a dreadfull evill in it; oh, let me never have to
doe with ſuch ſin that was the cauſe of ſuch ſufferings to my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
that did ſhed his blood. If ſo be that thou ſaweſt a knife
that had cut the throat of thy deareſt child, would not thy heart
riſe againſt that knife? ſuppoſe you come to a Table, and there
is a knife laid at your Trencher, and it was told you, this is the
knife that cut the throat of your childe, or Father, if you could
uſe that knife as another knife, would not any one ſay, there
was but little love to your Father or child? So when there is
a temptation comes to any ſin, this is the knife that cut the
throat of Chriſt, that pierct his ſides, that was the cauſe of all
his ſufferings, that made Chriſt to be a curſe; now wilt not
thou look upon that as a curſed thing, that made Chriſt to be
a curſe; oh with what deteſtation would a man or woman
fling away ſuch a knife! and with the like deteſtation it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that thou ſhouldeſt renounce ſin, for that was the cauſe of
the death of Chriſt; I remember it is reported of <hi>Anthony</hi>
when <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ſlaine, he comes to ſtir up the people againſt
thoſe that had ſlaine <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and he takes the cloathes that were
bloudy and holds them forth to the people, and ſaith, here is
the bloud of your Emperour, and upon that the people were
inraged againſt thoſe that had ſlaine him, and went and pulld
down their houſes upon them; ſo when thou comeſt to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
thou ſeeſt the bloud of Chriſt guſhing out, and for thy
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:116352:105"/>
ſin, if ever thy ſin be pardoned; either thy ſoule muſt be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
damn'd for thy ſin, or elſe thy ſin coſt the guſhing out of
the Blood of Chriſt; now when thou ſeeſt this; this ſhould
cauſe a holy rage in thy ſoule againſt ſin that cauſed this, ſurely
the putting away ſin, the riſings of the heart againſt ſin muſt
needs be a diſpoſition ſutable to ſuch an Ordinance as this is.
And thats the third thing required in the ſanctifying of Gods
name in this Ordinance, the purging out of ſin, and riſing of the
heart againſt it.</p>
               <p>4. The fourth thing that is to be done for the ſanctifying of
Gods name here, it is the hungering and thirſting of the ſoule
after Jeſus Chriſt; whoſoever coms hither, he comes to a feaſt,
and the Lord expects that all his gueſts ſhould come with ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks
unto this feaſt, come with hungring and longing for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt; this ſhould be the diſpoſition of the ſoule, oh that
my ſoule might injoy Communion with Jeſus Chriſt; now, this
is the end that I am come for; oh, the Lord: that knows the
workings of my heart, knowes that this is the great deſire of
my ſoule, that I might enjoy Communion with Jeſus Chriſt;
oh that I might have more of Chriſt, that I might meet with
Chriſt, that I might have ſome further manifeſtation with
Jeſus Chriſt, that I might have my ſoule further united to the
Lord Chriſt, and ſo have further influence of Chriſt to my ſoule;
I come with thirſting after the Lord Chriſt knowing my infinite
need of him, and the infinite excellency that there is in Jeſus
Chriſt; my ſoule doth famiſh and periſh for ever without
Chriſt; but in the injoyment of Chriſt there is a fulneſſe for
the ſatisfying of my ſoule; that I have had of Chriſt ſometimes
in the word, and ſometimes in prayer, that hath been ſweet unto
me, but I expect a further Communion of Chriſt here, for
this is the grand Ordinance for Communion with Jeſus Chriſt; in
deed the word in this reſpect it is beyond this Ordinance, that
is, it is not only for the increaſe of grace, but for the begetting;
this is only for the increaſe of grace and not appointed for the
begetting; now in that reſpect the Word is above the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but now this Sacrament is a more full Ordinance for
Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, this is the Communion of the
body of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his bloud, and therefore there ought
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:116352:106"/>
to be hungring and thirſting deſires of the ſoule after Jeſus
Chriſt, therefore you muſt take heed you doe not come with
your Stomacks full of traſh, as children when they can get
Plums and Peares and fill their ſtomacks with them, when they
come to your Tables, though there be never ſo much whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
diet, they have no mind at all to it; ſo it is with men of
the world, they fill their hearts with the traſh of this world,
and with ſenſuall delights, and hence it is that when they come
to ſuch a great Ordinance to enjoy Communion with Jeſus
Chriſt, that then they feele no want at all of Chriſt, only
they come and take a little peece of bread and a draught of
wine, but for any ſtrong pauſing deſires to meet with Jeſus
Chriſt there in the Ordinance, to come ſo as they know not how
to live without Chriſt, even as a man that is an hungred can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live without his meat and drinke, and ſo for the ſoule to
have ſuch a diſpoſition after Chriſt, this is a rare thing; but
know that Gods name is not ſanctifyed, unleſſe thou doeſt
come in ſuch a way unto this holy Sacrament; thats the fourth
thing, hungry and thirſty deſires after Chriſt, from a deepe
ſence of the need of him, and the apprehenſion of the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in him.</p>
               <p>5. In the fift place, there muſt be an exerciſe of Faith for the
ſanctifying of Gods name here; Faith, that is both the hand
and the mouth for the taking of this ſpirituall meat, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
drink; when thou comeſt to the Feaſt of the Lord, Faith firſt is
the eye, and then the hand and mouth; it is the eye of the ſoul to
give a reall ſight of what there is here, you are not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the body of the Lord but by the eye of Faith; if thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
only with bodily eyes to look upon what is here, thou ſeeſt
nothing but a little bread and wine; But now where the eye of
Faith is, there is a reall appearance of Jeſus Chriſt to the ſoule,
as if Chriſt were bodily preſent, and we need not have the bread
turned into his body; for Faith can ſee the body of Chriſt
through the bread, and the body of Chriſt guſhing in the wine.
And it is a mighty thing to have Chriſt and ſuch ſpirituall things
made reall and not to be a fanſie. If one look upon the fire that
is painted, one cannot heat ones ſelfe in cold weather with that,
but fire that is really burning upon the hearth; ſo thoſe that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:116352:106"/>
come to receive the Sacrament, and not come with Faith, that
have only the eye of their bodies, they only ſee as it were a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Chriſt, they doe not ſee Chriſt really: his body and bloud
and thoſe great Myſteries of the Goſpel are not preſented as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
things to their ſoules; and hence it is that they go away and
get nothing; but now when the ſoule comes with the eye of
Faith, the ſoule ſees the wonderfull things of God, it is the
moſt glorious ſight in the world; all the glory of God in the
heavens and earth is not like this ſight of Jeſus Chriſt and the
myſteries of the Goſpell that do appeare to the eye of faith;
therefore you may by this know whether you have come with
faith or no to the Sacrament; whether you have ſeen the
moſt glorious ſight that ever your eyes did behold, alas, with
our naturall eyes, we behold a Miniſter comming with a peece
of bread and a little wine: but when the eye of faith is opened,
then wee behold the glorious things of the Goſpell; many
times when you come to hear the word, your hearts burne
within you, as they that went to <hi>Emaus;</hi> but when you are
breaking bread, the eye of faith that muſt look upon Jeſus
Chriſt; and in this ſence, thoſe that have pierced Chriſt muſt
look upon him; that Scripture is fulfilled in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. latter end,
they ſhall look on him whom they have pierced by their ſins,
and then mourne and lament; this eye of faith will cauſe mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and lamenting for ſinne.</p>
               <p>And then as faith is the eye to make what is here reall, ſo
faith is the hand to take it; when you come to a feaſt, you
muſt have ſomething to take the meat to you; ſo ſaith Chriſt
he brake bread and gave it to his Diſciples; ſaying, take eat
this, take it; how ſhall we take it? by reaching out of the hand;
if you ſanctifie Gods name in this Ordinance, as you reach out
your hand to take the bread and wine, ſo there muſt be an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
reaching out of the ſoule by faith, putting forth an act of
faith to receive Jeſus Chriſt unto the ſoule, to apply the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt to thy ſoule with all his merits and good things
that he hath purchaſed; when the Miniſter doth give out that
Ordinance, you ſhould look upon God the Father giving out
his Sonne, as if this were your condition. I am now in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the eternall Father, who now doth actually give out
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:116352:107"/>
his Sonne to my ſoule, and ſaith ſoule, here receive anew, this
day my Sonne with all that he hath purchaſed for thy good;
now then the ſoule acts upon this, and by ſtirring up an act of
faith, comes and cloſes with this gift of the Father, and caſts
its ſelfe upon Jeſus Chriſt, and ſaith as it were <hi>Amen</hi> to what
the Father gives, oh Lord, here I come and imbrace thy Sonne as
my life, as my Saviour as the fountaine of all my good, in whom
I expect all the good I am like to have either here or to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity;
ſo that there muſt be a ſtirring up of the act of faith
in an actuall taking of Chriſt, if thou beeſt a beleever; canſt
thou remember what thou didſt, when firſt thou didſt take Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt? when the Lord in the preaching of his word did
reveale Jeſus Chriſt to thy ſoule, what didſt thou then oh ſoule?
how did thy ſoule work in cloſing with Chriſt; as thy ſoule
did then in cloſing with Chriſt, ſo it muſt now renew the work,
there muſt be a renewall of the worke at that time. So that
when you come to the Sacrament, you muſt not thinke that it is
then a time to liſten to doubts, feares, and ſcruples; no, but it is
a time that God cals for the exerciſe of faith, the caſting of the
ſoule upon Chriſt, and his merits for life and for ſalvation, or
elſe the name of God is not ſanctified as it ought; thou
doeſt not ſanctifie Gods name, when thou art buſying thy
foule in doubts and ſcruples in thy receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And then faith is as the mouth; when thou commeſt to eat
and drinke, how canſt thou if thou haſt not a mouth? thou
haſt a bodily month to take in bread and wine; but know that
without faith thy ſoule cannot take in Chriſt; faith is as it
were the mouth; that is, by the act of faith the ſoule doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
it ſelfe for Jeſus Chriſt, and not only opens it ſelfe, but
takes in Chriſt to the ſoule, and makes Chriſt and the ſoule as
one, as our bread and wine is made one with our body, ſo faith
takes in Chriſt, and makes him as one with thee, and turnes
Chriſt into the nouriſhment of thy foule, and thou and Chriſt
by faith are made as truly one, as the bread and wine that is put
into thy body, is made one with thy body. This is the
worke of faith, without which wee cannot ſanctifie the name
of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:116352:107"/>
Sixthly, there muſt be ſpirituall joy; that muſt be exerciſed
here; for it is a feaſt; here we come to ſit with Chriſt at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
wee come as children to our Fathers Table, and to ſit
there with Jeſus Chriſt our elder Brother; now as a Father doth
not love to have his child ſet in a ſullen and dogged way at
his Table, or to be crying, but he would have the child ſet in
comfort, and with a holy cheerfulneſſe with a holy freedome
of Spirit; not in a ſullen way, but as a child in the preſence of
his Father, and not as a Servant with the Maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You told us before that there ſhould be brokenneſſe
of Spirit and ſence of our ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That may be and joy; we rejoyce with trembling;
therefore that brokenneſſe of Spirit that I meant, muſt not bee
ſlaviſh horrour and feare, but a kindly melting of the ſoule from
the aprehenſion of the love of God unto it in Jeſus Chriſt, that
was willing to be at ſo great coſt to purchaſe the pardon of ſin:
ſuch a gracious mourning as may ſtand with joy, and the truth
is that that ſorrow for ſin in the Sacrament that is not mixt
with joy, is a ſorrow that doth not ſanctifie Gods name; godly
ſorrow and evangelicall joy may ſtand together very well. And
therefore know that this is not the time; neither to give liberty
to have your hearts ſinke; no, there muſt be no ſinking ſorrow
of heart, but ſuch a ſorrow of heart as in the midſt of it, you
may be able to look upon God as a reconciled Father to you,
and have a cheerfulneſſe of Spirit as in the midſt of it, you
muſt look upon your ſelves as Gods gueſt, to be merry at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
now this is a great myſtery of godlineſſe, that there ſhould
be at the ſame time, the ſight of Chriſt crucified, and yet at the
ſame time a ſpirituall cheerfulneſſe in the aſſurance of the love of
God in Ieſus Chriſt. I ſay it is a Myſtery and only thoſe that are
Beleevers are able to underſtand this myſtery, how to have
their hearts break, and yet how to rejoyce at the ſame time in
that unſpeakeable love of God that is here preſented unto them
in this Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In the next place there muſt be thankefulneſſe;
therefore it is called the Euchariſt, and in one of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
where it is ſaid, Chriſt bleſt the bread, in another it is ſaid,
Chriſt gave thanks; Chriſt when he inſtituted this Sacrament,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:116352:108"/>
hee gave thanks; he gave thanks; for what? he gave thanks to
God the Father, that he was pleaſed to ſend him into the world
to die for poor ſoules; now ſhall Ieſus Chriſt give thanks unto
God the Father for that that did coſt him his life? yea ſaith
Chriſt I ſee that here is a way to ſave ſoules; and let it coſt
me my life if it will, yet I bleſſe thee O Father, if ſoules may
come to be ſav'd though it coſt me my life. Chriſt rejoyced in
his Spirit in thanking his Father for this; then how ſhould our
hearts be inlarged with thankefulneſſe when we come to this
that the Ancients were wont to call the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that is a
thankſgiving? we are to give God thankes for every mercy, you
will not eate your owne bread without giving of thankes;
but when wee come to have this bread, this bread of life, here
is matter of thankefulneſſe, here is matter of inlargement of
ſoule; thou that haſt the deadeſt and dulleſt ſoule, and ſtraigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Spirit, yet when thou comeſt hither and underſtandeſt
what thou doeſt, here thou canſt not but ſee matter for the
inlargement of thy heart, and wiſh that thou hadſt ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
thouſand times more ſtrength to expreſſe the praiſes of
the Lord; here is a thing that muſt be the ſubject of the <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs</hi>
and doxologies, that Angels and Saints muſt for ever
ſound out in the higheſt heavens; doſt thou know what the
Lord preſents to thee here? it is more then if the Lord ſhould
ſay, I will make ten thouſand worlds for the ſake of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and give all theſe worlds to him, thou wouldeſt thinke
that thou wert bound to bleſſe him then; only when God in
the Bread and wine, reaches out to thee the body &amp; bloud of his
Sonne, here is more matter of praiſe, then if ten thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
worlds were given to thee, and therefore God expects
that thou ſhouldeſt ſay to thy ſoule, <hi>my ſoul praiſe thou the
Lord, and all that is within me praiſe his holy name; bleſſe the
Lord O my ſoule, and forget not all his benefits; who forgiveth
all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diſeaſes;</hi> O poor ſoule,
here is the foundation of all mercies; doſt thou praiſe God
for juſtification, for ſanctification? here is a glorious application
of the mercy of God to the ſoules of ſinners, and therefore if
ever thou wert thankfull, be thankefull here. The Sabbath
my Brethren, that is appointed to be the ſet conſtant day of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:116352:108"/>
thankeſgiving for the great mercies of God in Chriſt, and
there are other dayes for nationall mercies; now a ſpeciall
work of the Lords day is the celebration of this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Chriſtians in former times were wont to do it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Lords day, becauſe thats the day appointed by God for
to be the day of thankeſgiving for that great mercy, the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt: and that's the reaſon why the Sabbath was changed;
the laſt day of the week was the Iewiſh Sabbath, and that was
to celebrate the memoriall of the Creation of the world; and
the firſt day now, it is to be the day of thankſgiving for all the
work of God in mans redemption.</p>
               <p>Eightly, A further thing is this, if you would ſanctifie Gods
name, you muſt be willing to renew your Covenant, that's the
end of it; there muſt be an actuall renewing of your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God, that's thus, I come to receive this bread and
this wine, and this is to be as the Seale of the Covenant on
Gods part; now this will be emplyed in the nature of the
thing, that if I take the Seales of Gods Covenant, that I muſt
be willing to ſet to my Seale too, to renew the Covenant
that God calls me to; now know, all men and women that are
ſav'd, they are ſav'd by the vertue of the Covenant of grace; and
there God on his part promiſes and makes a Covenant, that
hee will beſtow his Son, life and ſalvation through him; and thou
muſt likewiſe come in on thy part, and beleeve on his Son and
repent, which is the Tenour of the Goſpel; now every time
thou comeſt to receive this Sacrament, thou commeſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
this Covenant; As if thou ſhouldeſt ſay, Lord, thou haſt
been pleaſed to make a Covenant of grace; as the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was broken, and all men were caſt by that Covenant,
now thou haſt made a Covenant of grace, and calleſt thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
whom thou intendeſt to ſave that they ſhould renew
their Covenant with thee in this Sacrament of thine; Lord here
I come; and Lord here I renew it and ſet to my ſeale, to
promiſe and Covenant with thee, that as ever I expect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any good from Chriſt, ſo Lord here I will be thine, I
will give up my ſelfe for ever to thee; as thou haſt given me
the Body and bloud of Chriſt for my ſalvation, ſo Lord, here
I conſecrate my body and bloud to thee, the laſt drop of my
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:116352:109"/>
heart blood ſhall be given up to thee, and ſo my ſtrength and
eſtate, and name, and whatever I am or have ſhall be thine.
Have you done thus when you have come to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?
have you actually renewed your Covenant with
God? you that have taken the body of Chriſt, have you given
up your body to Chriſt? whats the reaſon then that you ſinne
ſo much with your bodies? that you abuſe your body with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe?
and drunkenneſſe? and other wickedneſſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?
oh you prophane the name of God; and the very body
and blood of Chriſt in this, except thou giveſt up thy body and
ſoule to God in way of Covenant.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, In the laſt place for the ſanctifying of Gods name,
there is required a renewing of Love; the comming with love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſpoſitions and the renewing of the grace of love, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
towards God, but towards our Brethren; for it is the feaſt
of the Lord and it is an act of Communion; Communion, not
only with Chriſt, but with his Churches; with his Saints; and
as I have told you that there is a profeſſion of our ſelves to
be of the ſame body with Jeſus Chriſt, then the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
that his children ſhould not fall out that come to his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but that there ſhould be love and peace; there's a mighty
bond upon thee when thou commeſt to the Sacrament; and
therefore, firſt, all heart burnings, and heart grudges, muſt bee
laid aſide; and Secondly you muſt come with a willingneſſe to
be reconciled one to another, willingneſſe to paſſe by all infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in thy Brethren; here I have the Seale of Gods willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to paſſe by all my ſins, and therefore I muſt bee willing
to paſſe by all infirmities in my Brethren; I muſt now caſt out
all ill wiſhes towards others; and come with a deſire of all
good unto them; and with a heart ready to embrace any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to do any good; thou doeſt lye unto God except thou
commeſt with ſuch a heart as this is; Lord thou knoweſt that I
am willing to take all opportunities to doe good to thoſe,
that I now doe communicate with, for it is the neareſt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that poſſibly can be in this world, betweene one Creature
and another, and this is the reaſon why there ſhould bee that
Ordinance of Chriſt ſet up everywhere, to caſt out thoſe that
are unworthy, becauſe it is the greateſt union and Communion
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:116352:109"/>
that poſſibly can be, for it is the Sacrament and Communion of
the ſame body; they are the ſame members of Chriſt now if
thou doeſt not thinke ſuch a one to be a member of Chriſt,
why doeſt not thou what thou canſt to have him caſt out? but
ſo long as thou haſt done nothing in private to him, or in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Church, thou doeſt owne him to be a member of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt; if thou doeſt ſo, take heed how thy heart be
eſtranged from him, take heed how thou behaveſt thy ſelfe to
them; take heed how thou liveſt in a jarring way, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
way with them, and holdeſt them off at ſtaves end, or
walking at a diſtance from them, though they be never ſo poor
and mean, know that thou doeſt prophane this holy Ordinance
every time thou commeſt to it when thou commeſt with ſuch
a heart as this is; if thou doſt not find this renewed love, Lord,
there began to be a ſtrangeneſſe between me, and thoſe that
have communicated with me, but Lord thou art pleaſed to
vouchſafe us to come once more to this Ordinance, and Lord
here we do profeſſe that this Ordinance ſhall unite our hearts
together more then ever they were; I will ſtudy to doe what
good poſſibly I can to my brother; that is we joyne here to the
feaſt of the Lord with comfort, ſo we may live together in
peace and love as it becomes the Saints of God, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Body of Ieſus Chriſt; oh how farre are people from
any ſuch worke of God as this is; the Lord expects that this
ſhould be in you every time you come to the holy Communion;
here hath been nine particulars now mentioned, for the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the name of God when wee come to partake of the
Sacrament; but oh Lord what cauſe have we to lay our hands
upon our hearts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for if this be to ſanctifie thy name then it hath
been a riddle, a myſtery to us; certainly my brethren theſe
things are the truths of God that I have delivered, and ſo farre
as you have been wanting, in any of theſe, know ſo farre you
have taken Gods name in vaine, in this holy Ordinance, you
have not been worthy receivers of this Sacrament, you have
cauſe to look back to your former waies, and ſpend much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milation
for your ſin herein, and not to be ſo greedy of it as
ſome are; they muſt have the Communion, but I put it to your
Conſciences, have you repented you for the profaning of Gods
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:116352:110"/>
name, and thats that that we ſhould further have ſpoken of;
that God will be ſanctified; thats thus, if we doe not ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Gods name, it will quite turne to the contrary; it is the
proper end of the Sacrament, to ſeale up our ſalvation; but if
wee ſanctifie not Gods name, it will ſeale up our condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
if it hath not been thy endeavour to ſanctifie the name
of God, ſo many times as thou haſt received the Sacrament,
ſo many ſeales haſt thou upon thee for the ſealing up of thy
condemnation; many mens or womens condemnations are
ſealed with three or foure hundred ſeales it may be.</p>
               <p>But yet for thy comfort, while thou art alive, it is poſſible
that thſe Seales may be broken open; as wee read in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
that <hi>John</hi> ſaw the Book that had ſeven ſeals upon it,
and none could be found that was able to open it; at length
the Lamb that was ſlaine he was found worthy to open the
Book; So I ſay, thy condemnation is ſealed up with many
ſeales, and there is no Creature that is able to cancel theſe
ſeales, only the Lamb, Ieſus Chriſt, yea that Chriſt whoſe
blood thou haſt ſhed, and been guilty of, only he is worthy;
and he is willing to open theſe ſeales; for as it was with thoſe
that did crucifie Chriſt, yet they were ſav'd by the ſame blood
that they had ſhed, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. ſo though thou haſt been guilty
of ſhedding the blood of Chriſt againe and againe by thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
coming to the Sacrament, yet know, ſeeing there is life in
thee, and the day of grace is continued, it is poſſible that thy ſoul
may be ſav'd by that blood that thou haſt crucified; O how many
are cut off, that have thus prophan'd the name of God in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and never came to underſtand this danger! they are cut
of and now are undone for ever; why bleſſe God that thou art
alive to heare more about this Sacrament, and how Gods name
ſhould be ſanctifyed; that thou art alive, and haſt time to repent
thee of this great evill, of profaning the name of God in this
holy Sacrament.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is one thing more about the ſanctifying the
name of God in the Sacrament which cleerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
us: and that is,</p>
               <p>To keep to the inſtitution of the Sacrament;
for this is ſuch a worſhip of God, as depends
meerly upon inſtitution; that is, upon a poſitive
Law, upon the will of God; there are ſome duties of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
which are naturall, that we may know by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
they are due to God: but the Sacrament is a duty of
worſhip that is onely by inſtitution; and if God had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
it, we had not been bound to it; therefore in theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of inſtitution, God ſtands very punctuall upon them; we
muſt be very exact, neither to erre on the right hand nor the
left; to make any alteration in the points of inſtitution; Now
therefore for the inſtitution of this Sacrament we find it in
divers of the Evangeliſt; in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 26. there you ſhall
find that Chriſt and his Diſciples they eat the Sacrament to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and this was the way of it; they were together ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at the ſame Table; ſo it is called the Table of the Lord
ſometimes in Scripture; therefore thats the firſt thing that is
according to the inſtitution, that thoſe that doe communicate
muſt come to the Table as neer as they can; as many as can
ſet about it, and all to come as neer as they can, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, becauſe that otherwiſe you will not be able to attain the
end why God would have you come to receive; the end is to
remember the death of Chriſt; now except you be able to ſee
the ſight, to ſee what is done, to have your eye as well
as your eare exerciſed, you do not fully accompliſh the end that
is appointed; for this is a Sacrament, that doth preſent to our
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:116352:111"/>
eyes the death of Chriſt, and the great myſteries of ſalvation,
and therefore it is according to the inſtitution, that every
Communicant muſt be where hee may behold what is done,
he muſt be where he may ſee the breaking of the bread, and the
powring forth of the wine; certainly it hath been a diſorderly
way therefore for people to ſet up and downe in their pews e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verywhere
in the Congregation; and for the Miniſter to goe
up and downe after them; ſo that they could ſee nothing, nor
ſcarce hear any thing; it is much for the attaining to the end of
the inſtitution for all Communicants to look upon the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the bread, and the pouring forth of the wine in the
Sacrament; and therefore all ſhould come together; and there
as many as can ſit at his Table, or thoſe that cannot, neer to
it; and the rather becauſe this is not only from the example of
Chriſt, that he did ſo, though thats ſomwhat; but becauſe it hath
a ſpirituall ſignificancie in it, and thats the reaſon that it ſhould
be done; we find in <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 26. the inſtitution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
now marke upon their comming and being with Chriſt,
at the Table, ſaith Chriſt in the 29. and 30. verſes, and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
unto you a Kingdome as my father hath appointed unto
mee, that you may eat and drinke at my Table in my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and ſit on Thrones judging the twelve tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi>
he ſpake it upon that occaſion of the Diſciples ſitting with him
at the Table; when they did eat bread, and when they tooke
the Cup; upon that occaſion Chriſt ſpoke to his Diſciples, and
ſaid I appoint to you a Kingdome, and ſo ſit on Thrones judging
at my Table in my Kingdome, and ſo ſit on Thrones judging
the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, you can
ſit with mee at my Table here; and know that this ſitting
with me at my Table it is but as it were a <hi>praeludium,</hi> a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignification
of the Communion that you ſhall have with me in
my Kingdome: you ſhall have that familiar Communion with
me when I come unto my Kingdome, there to ſit as it were
with mee, to joyne with me in my Kingdome judging the
twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> even as you doe now in that holy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
joyne with me in ſitting at my Table; this is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Chriſt, ſo that the Geſture in the Sacrament is not a
meer indifferent thing; heretofore it hath been thought unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:116352:111"/>
to contend for what Geſture wee ſhould uſe.</p>
               <p>Now that that hath been the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and hath
a ſpirituall ſignificancie in it, is not indifferent; for not only the
eating the bread and drinking the wine is ſignificative, but the
geſture whereby we have fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt here, to
ſignifie that fellowſhip we ſhall have with him in the Kingdome
of Heaven; ſo that the people of God were depriv'd of a great
deale of comfort, and of one ſpeciall benefit of this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereas they might not receive it fitting; whereas
Chriſt ſaith that your ſitting with me here is a ſignification
of your ſitting with me when I come into the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
ſome ſay they muſt kneele becauſe they may receive it
with more reverence; certainly were it a thing as ſome ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
it were another matter; but for to ſay it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
to ſit, in that they accuſe Chriſt himſelfe for want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
as if he would appoint a way, or would have his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
uſe any ſuch way as were not reverent; ſaith Chriſt I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
by your very geſture to have this ſignified unto you, that
though you be poore wretched wormes, yet even ſuch is my
love to you, as you ſhall ſit with me when I come to my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and judge the twelve Tribes of Iſrael; and every time you
come to my Table, and there ſit at it, or about it, then you ſhould
be put in mind that there is a time, that though you be poore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
creatures, worthy to be among the dogges, yet the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God is ſuch unto us, as he hath appointed us to have a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
fellowſhip with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt when we come in
his Kingdome to ſit with him, and even to judge the twelve
tribes of Iſrael, yea to judge the whole world; for ſo ſaith the
Scripture, ſhall not the Saints judge the world? now this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
ſpirituall meditation and comfort, that the Saints have;
therefore we are to look to the inſtitution and to follow it; thats
the firſt thing in ſetting with Chriſt at his Table.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing in the inſtitution is, that the Bread being
taken by the Miniſter is to be bleſſed, broken, and then to bee
given; Chriſt took it, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave
it: and the people they are to look upon all this: to look upon
the Miniſters taking, bleſſing, breaking, and giving; and then
the cup by its ſelfe, wee find Chriſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 27. hee firſt
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:116352:112"/>
bleſt the bread, and then he bleſt the cup diſtinctly by its ſelfe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>this is my blood of the New Teſtament which is ſhed for many,
for the remiſſion of ſinnes;</hi> and you ſhall obſerve that the text ſaith
<hi>he drank it,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>drink yee all of it;</hi> ſo that this is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the inſtitution for a Miniſter to goe up and downe, and
to give it into every mans hand; certainly this was not ſo from
the beginning; this is a way of mans own deviſing; for the bread
and the cup to be given into every bodies hand by the Miniſter:
Chriſt did but give it once, hee gave it to them all, and ſaid,
<hi>drink yee all of this,</hi> ſo it was done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, is it not better for it to be given into
every ones hand?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, becauſe that the giving of it once for all, doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
more fully the fellowſhip and communion that they have
together; as at a Table it were a ſtrange thing that every bit of
meat muſt be given to every one particularly; no, but the diſhes
muſt bee ſet before them and they muſt take it themſelves: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if they be children you cut every peice of meat, and give
it into their hands or mouths; but thats ſutable to a fellowſhip
at Table, and communion, to have the meat ſet before them,
being bleſt, and then for all to partake of it.</p>
               <p>And beſides this, giving it into every ones hand, certainly, it
came to us from a Popiſh and ſuperſtitious conceit of the Papiſts;
for the Papiſts will give it into their mouths, becauſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
muſt not defile it with their hands. And it was to bring
more reverence to the Sacrament; now there's a great deale of
danger, for to bring in mens devices for to cauſe more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
we are to look to the Ordinance of Chriſt, hee gave it
once, and ſaid, drink yee of it, in General to them all; and ſo
the Miniſters ſhould do.</p>
               <p>And beſides there is this in it more, and one would wonder
that Miniſters ſhould give it in particular and not in generall to
the Church: for by this meanes Miniſters might abundantly eaſe
themſelves of a great deale of charge and guilt; for upon this
ground it will appeare, that a Miniſter, though as an eminent of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
he is to look to his Congregation that they be fit, yet the
truth is, it concernes the Church as well to look who comes
there, and likewiſe the Miniſter I ſay, to look about him that he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:116352:112"/>
doth not ſay, <hi>The body of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was given to thee,</hi>
when he knowes they are prophane and wicked; it concerns the
Miniſter to look that he doth not tell a lie; but now when the
Miniſter gives it generally to the Church, <hi>Take, eate,</hi> and <hi>Take
drinke,</hi> he gives it particularly to no body; Now then his
charge is divided to the Church, and if there be any body that is
unworthy, let the Church look to it as well as he: though he as
an eminent Officer, its more eſpecially in particular his duty
then any others; heretofore the charge would lie much upon
the Miniſter, but the Miniſter according to the inſtitution,
ſhould give the Sacrament to no particular; but in generall to
the Church, and therefore if there were but any particular,
that the Miniſter upon a particular knowledge did know to be
naught, he might in great part diſcharge himſelfe, as profeſſing
againſt this or that particular man; for it is not in his power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
to keep any from the Sacrament, but if ſo be that he ſhall
profeſſe againſt ſuch and ſuch men, the Church muſt joyne with
him to labour to keep them from the Sacrament, and that is the
next thing for the inſtitution, Chriſt gave it not into any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
mens hands; but he gave it to all, ſaying, Drinke,
and eat yee all of it.</p>
               <p>A third thing that is to be obſerved for the inſtitution of
this; that all the while the Communicants are taking, eating,
and drinking the bread and wine; they ſhould all of them
that while have their thoughts exerciſed about the death of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt; for thats the inſtitution; do this in remembrance
of mee; there ſhould be no action intermingled, in the time of
the receiving of the Sacrament; nothing but minding the work
that you are about, that is, to remember the death of Ieſus
Chriſt; and to diſcerne the body of the Lord, not only when
you take your ſelves the bread and wine; but when you ſee
the bread and wine, broken or powred forth, and you ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
taking the bread and wine, all that while, you ſhould
be thinking of the death of Chriſt, and diſcerning the Lords
body; and conſider what theſe outward elements do ſignifie,
and that they doe ſeale the great benefit of the Covenant of
grace; therefore it is not according to the inſtitution, to be
ſinging of Pſalmes in the mean time while the Sacrament is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:116352:113"/>
and ſo to have your thoughts about other things:
ſinging of Pſalmes in its due time is a good thing; but for you
to doe it at that time when as the death of Chriſt is preſented
before you, and Chriſt calls you to look upon his body, and
to thinke upon what he hath done and ſuffered; this is no ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
time of ſinging; and if you read the inſtitution, you
ſhall find, that Chriſt, after all was done (the text ſaith)
they ſung an hymne; ſo that according to the inſtitution, it
is after the action is done of eating and drinking, then for the
Church to joyne together and ſing a Pſalme in the praiſe of
God; and then they muſt mind all the ſame thing together; for
thats the thing to be done in the Sacrament; that look what
one doth all muſt mind together; for when one part ſings, and
the other are waiting for the bread and wine, this is not ſutable
to the holy Table action, and that Communion that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of us; though the things in themſelves are both good
that are doing; yet when we are about this holy Ordinance,
being it is an Ordinance for Communion, all are to be doing
the ſame thing at the ſame time; and ſo when all have done ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and drinking, then for all to joyne together in ſinging to
the praiſe of God.</p>
               <p>Now it may be, this at firſt ſeems ſtrange to many; yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
obſerve this; doe but keepe to the inſtitution in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
though you may thinke it a more mean way, yet you
will find a greater beauty in this Ordinance, then ever you
found in all your lives; for the more wee keep to Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and mingle nothing of our owne, the more glory, and
beauty, and excellency doth appeare in the Ordinances of Ieſus
Chriſt; but when any man ſhall mix any of his owne inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though he may do it to a good end, and think to adde
to and put a greater luſtre upon the Sacrament: the truth is,
that which he thinks to be a greater luſtre, reverence, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
put upon it, it doth rather take off the luſtre and glory of the
Sacrament; then are the inſtitutions of Chriſt glorious when
there is no mixture among them; thus wee ſhould ſanctifie the
name of God, in receiving this holy Sacrament; you have had
divers things propounded to you whereby you may come to
know and eaſily to ſee that there hath been a great deale of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:116352:113"/>
diſhonour done to this Sacrament, and the beauty and glory of
it hath been darkened, and the ſweet that the Saints might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
have received in plucking hath been exceedingly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
There is but one thing more that I ſhall propound to you,
and that is the ſeverall meditations that we ſhould meditate on
in receiving of the Sacrament; the moſt concerning meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are ſuggeſted in the holy Communion that are in any thing
whatſoever, more concerning, more efficacious, more various
meditations wee have ſuggeſted here then in any thing, and
it is a great figne that men and women, do not diſcerne the
Lords body if ſo be their meditations be barren at that time. I
will therefore ſuggeſt ſome nine or ten meditations that that
Ordinance of God may hold out very plainly, and familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to every Communicant, for the buſying of their thoughts
all the time that action is a doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meditation</hi> 1. As firſt, that the way of mans ſalvation it
was by a Mediator, it is not only by Gods mercy, Gods ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that hee is offended by ſin, but he will be content to paſſe
it by; no, but it is through a Mediator; now this meditation is
ſuggeſted thus, when I ſee the bread and wine, if I diſceren
what that ſignifyes it will hold forth this to me, that the way
of mans ſalvation, it is not meerly from hence that God ſaith,
well, I will pardon them, and no more, but there is required a
great worke of God to make an aronement, between ſinners
and himſelfe; this Sacrament doth hold forth thus much unto
us; wherefore elſe have we bread and wine, but to ſignifie that
the way of our rconciliation it muſt be through a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 2. The ſecond Meditation is this, that this Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
that ſtands between God and us, is verily and truely man;
hee hath taken our nature upon him; the bread that puts us in
mind of the body of Chriſt, and the wine of his bloud, and
therefore we are to meditate of the humane nature of Ieſus
Chriſt; and this is a meditation that hath abundance that
might ſpring out of it; what hath the Son of God taken our
nature upon him? hath hee body and bloud and humane nature
upon him? oh how hath God honoured humane nature?
then let me not abuſe my body to luſt, to wickedneſſe,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:116352:114"/>
ſeeing that Jeſus Chriſt hath taken the body of man upon him,
humane nature upon him, let me honour humane nature that is
ſo neerly united to the divine nature; thats the ſecond Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meditation.</hi> 3. Here's preſented unto us what this Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
hath done for the reconciling of us unto God, that his body
was broken; he hath ſubjected himſelf to the breaking of his
body, and to the pouring forth of his blood for the reconciling
of us; it is not meerly (as before) that God ſaith, <hi>Ile pardon
them;</hi> but Chriſt undertaking to make peace between his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and us, it coſt him the breaking of his body, and the pouring
forth of his blood; this is a uſefull Meditation; Oh what ſhould
we be willing to ſuffer for Jeſus Chriſt in our bodies, even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
unto blood, ſeeing Chriſt hath been content to have his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
body broken, and his blood ſhed for us!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meditation</hi> 4 Againe, a fourth Meditation is this, that here
we come to ſee we have occaſion of meditating of that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſaith, that we are by the blood of God ſaved, it is the
blood of God, <hi>they crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> thats the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
phraſe; we ſhould conſider when we ſee the Wine poured
out, and ſo put in mind of blood, whoſe blood and whoſe body
is this; It is no other but the body and blood of him that was
truly God, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity. This is the great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of the Goſpel, and this is very needfull for us to be think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of when we ſee the body broken and the blood poured out:
What will the breaking of the body and ſhedding of the blood
of a meere creature be ſufficient to make peace between God
and Man? ſurely no; therefore you muſt meditate whoſe body
this is, and whoſe blood this is, it is the body and blood of him
that was God; Its true, God hath no body nor no blood, but
the ſame perſon that was God, had a body and blood; that body
and blood was united unto the divine nature in a hypoſtaticall
union, and from thence it came to have an efficacie for to ſatisfie
God, for to reconcile God and us together, this is the great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 5. Another Meditation is this, when you ſee Bread broken
and Wine poured out, oh the infinite dreadfulneſſe of the juſtice
of God! how dreadful is the juſtice of God, that coming upon his
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:116352:114"/>
own Son, and requiring ſatisfaction from him, that ſhould thus
break him and bruiſe him, that ſhould have his blood, that ſhould
require ſuch ſufferings even from his Son! dreadfull is Gods juſtice,
the juſtice of God, it is to be feared and to be trembled at; here
we ſee what is required for the ſinne of man, and nothing would
be bated to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 6. Another Meditation is this, here I ſee preſented to me
what every ſoul that ſhall be ſaved coſt; whoever ſhall have his
ſoul ſav'd he hath it ſav'd by a ranſom, by a price paid that is more
worth then ten thouſand thouſand worlds; thou ſlighteſt thine
owne ſoule; but if it prove to be ſaved, it coſt more then if thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of worlds had been given for thee; even the ſhedding of
the blood of Chriſt, every drop of which was more precious then
ten thouſand worlds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meditation</hi> 7. Again, from hence ſee what is the evill of ſin, how
great it is that hath made ſuch a breach between God and my
ſoule, that only ſuch a way, and ſuch a means muſt take away my
ſinne; I muſt either have laine under the burden of my ſinne eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
or Jeſus Chriſt that's God and man muſt ſuffer ſo much for
it; oh, what Meditations are theſe to take up the hearts of men!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meditation</hi> 8. Behold the infinite love of God to mankind,
and the love of Jeſus Chriſt, that rather then God would ſee the
children of men to periſh eternally, he would ſend his Sonne to
take our nature upon him, and thus to ſuffer ſuch dreadfull
things; herein God ſhows his love; it is not the love of God ſo
much in giving you a good voyage, and proſpering you outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the world; But, <hi>ſo God loved the world that he gave his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begotten Sonne;</hi> And it pleaſed the Father to break his Sonne,
and to poure out his blood, here is the love of God and of Jeſus
Chriſt; oh, what a powerfull, mighty, drawing, efficacious
Meditation ſhould this be unto us!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 9. Thoſe that are beleevers they ſhall be nouriſhed to
eternall life, ſo that there is no feare that ever a beleever ſhould
quite fall off from God, and die in his ſin; Why? Becauſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and blood of Chriſt is given unto him for his ſpirituall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment:
though a beleever be never ſo weak, yet ſeeing God
hath appointed the body and blood of his Sonne for him to
feed upon and to drink in a ſpirituall way, ſurely then the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:116352:115"/>
in the world will be ſtrengthned to goe through all the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
and dangers that there are in the world; tis this that
ſtrengthens beleevers to encounter with all kind of dangers, its
this that preſerves the weakeſt grace in a beleever, namely the
ſpirituall nouriſhment that God the Father hath appointed to
them, even the feeding upon the body, and drinking the very
blood of his Son; this is meat indeed, and drinke indeeed that
will nouriſh to eternall life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 10. the laſt Meditation is this, when you come to this,
ſeeing the bread broken, and the wine powred out, you have
an occaſion to meditate of the whole new Covenant, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace that God hath made with ſinners; for ſo the
words of inſtitution are, This is the Cup of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
the new Teſtament which is all one with the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
only different in this particular; it containes the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the new Covenant, but calld Teſtament in this regard;
to ſhew that the Lord doth do all in the new Covenant, that is,
he doth not only promiſe ſuch and ſuch mercies upon condition
of our beleeving and repenting, but he doth work beleeving and
repenting, and works grace, and therefore the ſame thing that
is ſometime cald a Covenant, is calld a Teſtament; that is
the will of God wherein the Lord doth bequeath his rich lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to his Children, to thoſe that ſhall be eternally ſaved, ſo
that all the good things in the Covenant of grace they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
by way of Teſtament as well as Covenant, and this is
a mighty comfortable meditation to the Saints; for indeed
when they look upon the way of the Goſpell as in a way
of Covenant, why then they thinke this, this requires ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of our parts to be done, and indeed God will keep Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
on his part, but it may be we ſhall not keep Covenant on
ours, and ſo we may faile at laſt; but now when thou lookeſt
upon all the good things in the Goſpel diſpenſed in the way
of a Teſtament, that is the will of God, the legacies that
God doth bequeath to his ſervants, this is a mighty comfort to
the ſoule, that all the precious things of the Goſpel come to
mee in the way of a Teſtament, and thats the meaning of the new
Teſtament, that is, the mercies of God in Chriſt comming now
in the way of another adminiſtration, then they did before;
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:116352:115"/>
tis not only new in reſpect of the Covenant of workes that God
made with <hi>Adam,</hi> but new in reſpect of the adminiſtration;
our forefathers, the Patriarchs, they had the ſame thing in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
but adminiſtred in a darker way, and many differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
there are; but now when wee heare of the new Teſtament,
there is preſented unto us all the riches of the Covenant of
grace in the way of a legacie and in the adminiſtration of it with
cleerneſſe, and with a great deal of mercy and goodneſſe of
God, the terrour and harſhneſſe of the old adminiſtration being
taken away. Now theſe are the meditations, by which wee
ſhould labour to ſanctifie our hearts, when we are receiving
of the Sacrament; and in the working of theſe meditations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our hearts; wee ſhall come to ſanctifie the name of God,
when we are drawing nigh to him in that holy Ordinance of his;
thus for meditation.</p>
               <p>The next thing when wee are there, muſt be an actuating of
theſe holy diſpoſitions that before wee ſpoke of; tis not enough
for a Chriſtian to bring grace to the Sacrament: but there
muſt be a ſtirring of that grace at that time; or otherwiſe the
name of God is not ſanctifyed in the receiving of the Sacrament,
and above all graces the actuating of the grace of faith; tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
that thou beeſt a beleever, but thy faith muſt act at that
very inſtant, as thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when thou heareſt the Miniſter in the name of Chriſt
ſay thus, this is the body of Ieſus Chriſt which was given for
you, take, eat, thou ſhouldeſt have thy faith ſo acting upon the
mercy of God, in giving Ieſus Chriſt, for the nouriſhment of thy
foule to eternall life, as if thou didſt heare a voice from heaven
ſaying, here is the body of my Sonne given for thee particularly,
take it and eat, apply it to thee, and ſo make Chriſt one with
thee by faith, as the bread is made one with thy body when thou
doeſt eat it.</p>
               <p>And then when thou commeſt to take hold of the bread, thou
art to put forth an act of faith, faith being as the hand of the
ſoule, and at that inſtant, when thou takeſt the bread and putteſt
it into thy mouth to eat, thou ſhouldeſt ſtirre up the act of faith
afreſh, laying more hold upon Jeſus Chriſt; look as once thou
didſt in thy firſt converſion, when Chriſt was preſented to thee
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:116352:116"/>
in the word or in any other way, there was an act of faith
drawne forth whereby thy ſoule did caſt it ſelfe, and roule it
ſelfe upon Jeſus Chriſt; ſo ſhouldeſt thou renew it; renew
the ſame work of faith that thou didſt find in thy very firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion;
and thereby thou ſhalt come to have renewed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in the renewing of that act; I might name thee other
graces and diſpoſitions; how there ſhould be a ſtirring and an
acting of them; onely remember I leave all this point with this
note, that grace is not enough for partaking the Sacrament of
the Lords ſupper, except there be an actuating, and a ſtirring up
of that grace; many Chriſtians are carefull to prepare, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
before whether they have grace or no; but at that time
when they come to receive, then there is not a lively working
and ſtirring of that grace, and ſo they come to loſe the comfort
&amp; benefit of that Ordinance. Thus much ſhal ſuffice for this point
of ſanctifying Gods name in receiving the holy Communion;
I ſhall now come to the laſt point, which is the ſanctifying the
name of God in prayer.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Sanctifying the name of God in Prayer.</head>
                  <p>NOw this argument might take us up many Sermons; but
upon occaſion of the dayes of prayer and humiliation, I
have preached divers Sermons about the point of prayer;
therefore I ſhall be breife, and only now reckon up together,
and ſet before your view, the ſeverall things that are to bee
done for the ſanctifying of the name of God in prayer. Firſt,
for prayer in that wee draw nigh to God, and its a duty of
Gods worſhip, that I ſuppoſe all of you cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and that it is a naturall duty of worſhip; the other was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted,
but this is naturall; its naturall for the creature to draw
nigh to God in prayer, wherein the creature tenders up his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to God, and manifeſts his profeſſion of his dependance
upon God for all good that he hath, and acknowledges God
as the Author of all good, therefore this is worſhip, and its a
great part of worſhip, prayer it is ſuch a part of worſhip as
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:116352:116"/>
ſometimes in Scripture its put for the whole worſhip of God,
<hi>Hee that calls upon the name of God ſhall be ſav'd,</hi> that is,
hee that worſhips God aright, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10. 25. and, <hi>Pour out
thy wrath upon the Heathen that know thee not, and on the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
that call not on thy name,</hi> that do not pray, that is, that do not
worſhip thee; there one part of worſhip is put for the whole,
as being a principall part of the worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>Surely we muſt ſanctifie Gods name in <hi>prayer,</hi> for it is that
that ſanctifies all things to us; 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 5. every thing is
ſanctifyed by the word of God and prayer;</hi> And if the argument
of Chriſt was right, as no queſtion but it was, that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was greater then the gold upon the Temple, becauſe the
Temple did ſanctifie the gold; and the Altar was greater then
the offering that was offered upon it, becauſe it did ſanctifie the
offering; then prayer muſt needs be a mighty great Ordinance;
a greater thing then any other; becauſe that it ſanctifies all
things. The word ſanctifies the creatures; but prayer ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the very word unto our uſe; and therefore when wee read
the word we are to pray for a ſanctified uſe of the word;
Prayer is a great Ordinance; a great duty of worſhip that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies
all; prayer hath a caſting voice (as I may ſay) in all the
great works of God in the world, the great affaires of the
Kingdome of God, the Kingdome of his power, and the
Kingdome of Chriſt, I ſay prayer hath a kind of a caſting voice,
and doth order under God the great things of the world, they
are according to the prayers of the Saints, they bring down
bleſſings upon the godly, they poure forth judgements on the
wicked; the prayers of the Saints, they are the vyalls
that are poured forth in a ſpeciall manner upon the heads
of the wicked; therefore Gods name is to bee ſanctifyed
in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>It is to be ſanctifyed firſt in preparation; <hi>Pſalme</hi> 10. 17.
<hi>Thou wilt prepare their heart; thou wilt cauſe thine ear to hear;</hi>
it is the Lord that prepareth the heart; and then he cauſes his
eare to hear; and therefore in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. we are there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to <hi>watch unto prayer;</hi> men and women ſhould keep a
narrow watch over their hearts and minds, that they may not
be hindred in their prayers, that they may be alwaies in a fit po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:116352:117"/>
to pray; watch unto prayer, its that that would helpe us
againſt many temptations to evill; if I give way to ſuch and
ſuch temptations it, will hinder my prayers; I ſhall not have
that freedome and inlargement in prayer as otherwiſe, if I give
way to ſuch and ſuch things, therefore let me take heed of this,
for it will hinder my prayers. As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, this
ſhould be the care of Chriſtians; then they are like to ſanctifie
the name of God in prayer, if this be their great care that there
is nothing in the world that ſhall hinder their prayers; O let me
take heed I doe nothing to hinder my prayers; if I goe abroad
into company, and am merry and jocond, and there game and
drinke, and ſport my ſelfe in company; will not this hinder my
prayers? will not this hinder the ſpiritualneſſe of my heart in
Communion with God in prayer, when I come home at
night? I appeal to you, have you had that freedome in prayer,
afterwards? ſurely no, therefore watch unto prayer.</p>
                  <p>Now for the preparation of the heart to prayer, wee muſt
underſtand either,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, what is to be done in the courſe of ones life, or</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whats to be done juſt when one comes to prayer.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, the courſe of ones life: labour to keepe all
things even and cleare between God and your ſoules; that ſo
you may not come with ſhakels, about your legs; with guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
(I mean) upon your conſciences; men that have given
way to any baſe ſinfull way, when they come to prayer, the
guilt of their hearts doth even ſink them; but thoſe that can
keepe their peace with God in the courſe of their lives, they
have other manner of freedome in prayer, then you that walke
looſely and contract guiltineſſe upon your Spirits.</p>
                  <p>And then the ſecond thing is to keep our hearts ſenſible of
our continuall dependance upon God; ſenſible how wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon God, for whatſoever we are, whatſoever we have,
whatſoever we do; for the bleſſing of all is from God. The
beames of the Sun do not ſo depend upon the Sun, as we upon
God; that if he doth but withdraw himſelfe never ſo little
from us, wee all ſinke downe to nothing and periſh for ever;
that ſoule that every day and houre is ſenſible of the infinite
dependance it hath upon God for its preſent and eternall eſtate;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:116352:117"/>
will be fit for prayer; and that ſhould be our care for to carry
our ſelves, as any houre in the day, or minute in the houre, we
might be fit to go to prayer; &amp; thats one meaning of that place
in the Theſſalonians, <hi>pray continually;</hi> not that every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wee ſhould be praying; but that we ſhould keepe our
hearts in a praying frame; ſome of you when you have let
out your paſſions and are in a diſtemper, what will you goe
to prayer now? your conſcience will tell you that you are not
fit to go to prayer at that time, <hi>certainly if you be not fit to
pray, you are not fit to live;</hi> you are in an ill condition at any
time if you be not fit to pray; and there can be no excuſe
whatever that can be ſufficient to plead for your ſelves why
you ſhould not be fit to pray at any time; there is that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
dependance upon God for all, and that need you have
of the bleſſing of God for every thing, that there is reaſon
you ſhould bee in a fit condition for praying at all times; but
now when you come to prayer at the ſet time, then there
ſhould be a ſpeciall preparation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, you ſhould prepare your ſelves by getting freſh
and powerfull apprehenſions of the glory of God, before
whom you goe; prepare by meditation about the glory of that
infinite God that you are now addreſſing your ſelfe unto;
poſſeſſe yourſelves with thoughts and meditations of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the great God; thats the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, labour to get your hearts ſenſible of what you
go for. I am now going to God; for what? for pardon of
ſin, or for aſſurance of his love; or for power againſt ſin; or
for ſuch and ſuch mercies; let me by meditation work my heart
to be ſenſible of theſe things that I am going to God for, to
ſet a due prior upon thoſe mercies that I am praying for, and
to get my heart affected with them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, labour to get your hearts ſeparated from the world,
and from all things that are here below in the world; and that
ſhould have been a third thing in the courſe of your lives, you
ſhould never let out you hearts to any creature, either to buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
or pleaſures in the world ſo, but that you may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of your hearts to call them when you will; to call them
in to God in prayer; and then when you come to prayer
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:116352:118"/>
there ſhould be an actuall ſeparation of your hearts from all
things in the world; dedicating yourſelves to God for this
time, as one that hath nothing to do with the world, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with any thing but this duty that now you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
this is the preparation of your hearts to prayer in the
courſe of your lives.</p>
                  <p>Now then for the prayer its ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt we muſt conſider of the matter of prayer.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly of the manner of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt for the matter of it, we muſt look to it that it be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Gods will 1 <hi>John. 5. 14. this is the confidence that wee
have in him, that if wee ask any thing according to his will hee
heareth us;</hi> therefore for the matter we muſt be ſure it muſt be
good that we pray for; it muſt bee for the glory of God; for
the good of our ſelves and the good of our Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the glory of God, that ſhould be the cheife mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that we are to pray for; ſo Chriſt when he teaches us to
pray, he begins the very firſt petition, <hi>Matth. 6. 9, 10. hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
be thy name; thy Kingdome come; thy will be done;</hi> firſt
begin with the the glory of God, mind that in the cheife place,
above all other things. God gives you leave to pray for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things; but firſt for the glory of God, minding that before
your own benefit; before the pardon of ſin and your daily
bread; how few doe ſanctifie Gods name in this? people have
little mind to pray, but when they are in outward afflictions,
when they are upon their ſick beds then they will pray; or at ſea
in ſtormes then they will pray, then it ſeemes that the maine
matter of your prayer is onely for your ſelves; but how hath
the matters of the glory of the great God, and the good of the
Churches taken your hearts all this while? how have your
hearts been affected with this, that the name of God hath been
ſo little ſanctifyed in the world, and that the Kingdome of
God hath not come, and that the will of God hath not been
done, have theſe things taken up your hearts in prayer, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the glory of God and the good of the Churches, though
your ſelves have not any particular intereſt in them? if theſe
things did but take up your hearts in prayer, then, when you
are at ſea you would remember the cauſe of the Churches, as
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:116352:118"/>
much as your ſelves; the Church is as it were in the midſt of the
ſea, toſt up and downe and in a great ſtorme; now why do not
you pray as earneſtly for the Kingdome of Chriſt among his
Churches, as for your ſelves when you are in a ſtorme at ſea?
yea and ſpirituall things ſhould be the cheife matter of your
prayer; for they are the neereſt to the glory of God; though
God hath his glory from other things, yet ſpirituall things are
neereſt the glory of God; now in theſe dayes of prayer,
many will come to pray, that they might be freed from danger,
that they might have outward peace; this is good; but ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
things are the cheife things; and therefore the ſtrength of
your ſpirits ſhould be thus powred forth to God; O that I could
get my heart to God, and the aſſurance of the love of God!
O that I could get the ſhine of his face! O that I could get pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over ſuch and ſuch corruptions.</p>
                  <p>And I beſeech you obſerve this, <hi>that ſpirituall things may
be prayed for abſolutely; but outward things muſt be prayed for
conditionally.</hi> I may pray (and never put any condition in at
all) that the Lord would pardon my ſins, and help me againſt
my corruptions, &amp;c. But when I pray for the health of my
body, I ought to pray, if this bee according to thy will, then
reſtore mee to the health of my body, or the health of my
husband, or the health of my wife; but thou mayſt pray, Lord
convert the ſoule of my husband or the ſoule of my wife, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any condition at all; when your eſtates at Sea are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
when you pray for them, you muſt make conditions, Lord,
as thou ſeeſt beſt for me ſo do thou deale with me; this ſhewes
the excellencie that there is in ſpirituall things above outward
things, ſurely ſpirituall things are more to be deſired, for they
are to be prayed for abſolutely, and the other to be prayed for
only conditionally; thats for the firſt.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place we are to pray for our own good, God
doth give us leave ſo to doe; only here comes in a
queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether it be ſinfull to pray for afflictions, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſome will be ready to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer, firſt, take it abſolutely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
we may not pray that God would afflict us, becauſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:116352:119"/>
is in its ſelfe materially an evill thing, and a fruit of the
curſe, therefore we may not (I ſay) abſolutely pray for it: but
thus farre wee may pray for afflictions, disjunctively, conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
comparatively.</p>
                  <p>Disjunctively thus, Lord, either grant unto me a ſanctified uſe
of ſuch a mercy, or otherwiſe let me rather be without it; let
me have a ſanctified uſe of my ſickneſſe, or otherwiſe let my ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
be continued to mee; thus now you may pray for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in ſickneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Or thus, conditionally, Lord, if thou ſeeſt that my heart be
ſo vile and wretched that I will abuſe (through my corruption)
ſuch and ſuch mercies, Lord rather take them from mee, and let
mee be without them; if thou ſeeſt that there be no way to
break this proud heart of mine, but ſuch a way, Lord let that
be thy way to break it, if thou ſeeſt it according to thy will as
the fitteſt way.</p>
                  <p>Then comparatively thus, Lord rather let mee have any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
then ſin, rather let me ſuffer loſſe of my eſtate then ſin
againſt thee, then depart from thee: any thing Lord rather
then ſin. Thus you may pray for afflictions, but not abſolutely.
You muſt not pray that God would ſend you afflictions abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for you doe not know your hearts; it may bee if afflictions
ſhould come, your hearts may be as ſtubborne under your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
as they are now; for affliction hath no power in it ſelfe
to do us any good.</p>
                  <p>And then for the good of others, for Chriſt teaches us to
pray, <hi>Our Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There comes in here a rebuke of the wicked practice of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
in curſing, and then a queſtion about it.</p>
                  <p>It is a wicked thing to uſe curſes; but its a moſt wicked
thing to wiſh evill to others in a way of prayer; yet how many
doe ſo? though it may be they doe not think it, they ſpeak
to God, and deſire him to bring ſuch and ſuch evils upon their
neighbours; yea, ſometimes parents, upon their children; this is
a wicked practiſe of men; what, is it not wickedneſſe enough
for thee to have any deſire that there ſhould any evill befall
thy brother, but wilt thou dare to preſume to call God to be
an inſtrument of the execution of thy baſe ſinfull wrath, that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:116352:119"/>
God muſt be a drudge as it were to thy wrath and to thy
paſſion? this is abominable wickedneſſe. Any of you that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have been guilty of this ſinne of curſing others, wives,
children, ſervants, or friends the Lord rebuke you for this ſin;
how far haſt thou been from ſanctifying Gods Name in prayer?
whereas, in ſtead of ſanctifying the holy Name of God, thou
haſt called God to be a ſervant, and a drudge to thy paſſion,
God muſt be cal'd to help the venting of thy paſſion: oh,
remember this you that have been at ſea, and have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and things not going according to your mind, have fallen
a curſing, and a wiſhing ſuch and ſuch evills might come upon
thoſe you are angry with; thats a kind of prayer, but it is a moſt
fearfull taking the name of God in vaine in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and certainly God will not hold him guiltleſſe that ſhall
ſo take his Name in vaine; therefore be humbled for this
ſinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, do not wee read in the book of
the Pſalmes, where many times the Prophet <hi>David</hi> doth curſe
the enimies of God and wiſhes evill to come upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer, firſt, that the Prophets, and thoſe
that pen'd the Pſalmes they had a prophetical ſpirit; and thoſe
places that you read that are in way of curſing, they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
propheticall predictions of evill then direfull imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they are rather foretelling what ſhall be in a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
then wiſhing what ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if they be wiſhing what ſhould be, then I anſwer,
that thoſe that were indued with ſuch a propheticall ſpirit,
they did know who were the implacable enemies of God, and
who were not, as <hi>David</hi> prayed againſt <hi>Judas,</hi> ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years before hee was borne; by a propheticall ſpirit, he
knew that he was the childe of perdition; indeed if we could
certainly know a man that were to be a caſt-away eternally
from God, it were another matter; as the Church in the time
of <hi>Julian,</hi> becauſe of his Apoſtaſie being ſo abominable, it was
determined almoſt generally by them that he had committed
the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, and upon that they curſt him.
Now I ſay, thoſe that had an extraordinary ſpirit that did
know who theſe were, they might do it; but this is no example
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:116352:120"/>
for us in an ordinary way to wiſh evill and curſes upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
But thus far wee may do with the enemies of the
Church.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we may curſe them disjunctively, Lord, either take them
out of the way, or keep them that they may not doe ſuch
miſchiefe in the Church: or thus, conditionally, if thou ſeeſt
Lord that they be implacable, thou knoweſt them, if ſo, let
thy wrath and curſe purſue them; Lord thou ſeeſt what evill
they are ſet upon, and therefore rather then they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their miſchievous deſignes, let thy wrath and curſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
them; ſo we may do it, but not abſolutely to curſe any,
though they ſhould do us never ſo much wrong, we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to bleſſing; but now in zeale to God, take heed that we
be not carried on in our own paſſion. But being ſure it is
in a zeale to God, we may wiſh the curſes of God to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
thoſe that God knowes to be implacable; this is but an
appealing to God, and not at all faſtning it upon any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
perſons that wee know, but leaving it unto God for
the execution of it, and ſo in a zeale to the glory of God,
we may doe it, and we are warranted ſo to doe by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Petition, <hi>Thy Kingdome come:</hi> for that petition that
requires us to pray for the comming of the Kingdome of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, doth alſo require that we ſhould pray againſt all
meanes that hinder the comming of the Kingdome of Jeſus
Chriſt, ſo that every time that the Church prayes <hi>thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
come</hi> or any prayes <hi>thy Kingdome come,</hi> they doe as much
as ſay, O Lord, do thou ſet thy ſelfe againſt all the enemies
of thy Kingdome; if they belong to thy election, Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
them, but otherwiſe Lord confound them. Now thus
we ſee how we are to ſanctifie the Name of God in prayer,
in regard of the matter of the prayer; but now for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of prayer. The moſt things I confeſſe are there.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when we come to prayer, we muſt be ſure to pray
with underſtanding, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 15. What is it then? I will
pray with the ſpirit, and will pray with underſtanding alſo,</hi> God
doth not love the ſacrifice of fooles; we muſt not come babling
to God in prayer to ſpeak wee know not what, and to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
words we know not wherefore, but God doth require
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:116352:120"/>
that thoſe that come to prayer, come with underſtanding,
that they offer to God a rationall, a reaſonable, an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
ſacrifice; God is a Spirit, and he will be worſhipped
in ſpirit and in truth; now as it belongs to all other duties
of worſhip, ſo eſpecially in prayer, to know what we doe
when we pray, not to think to put off God with a meere
empty ſound; thats the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing in the manner of prayer, it is the
giving up all the faculties of our ſoules in it; I ſpake to that
in the worſhip of God in generall, wee ſhall apply it now
particularly to prayer, the giving up, not only out under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
but wills, thoughts, affections, ſtrength in prayer,
in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 3. it is ſaid of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> that he <hi>ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to ſeek the Lord,</hi> he did give his whole ſelfe to ſeeke
the Lord; we are to give our whole ſelfe, and not to divide
in prayer. Now this were an argument that indeed might
well take up a whole Sermon, in ſhewing the evill of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of our ſpirits in prayer; wee ſhould take heed of the
wandring of our ſpirits in hearing of the Word, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sacraments, and ſo in prayer; the people of God are
much troubled with the wandring of their thoughts both in
Word and Sacrament, and it is their great burthen, and ſhould
be ſo, but I never hear any more complainings of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of their ſpirits then in the time of prayer, the people
of God are much peſtered in their ſpirits with this evill, it is
very grievous unto them, and many of them goe under it as
a grievous burthen all their dayes; the chiefeſt burthen that
is upon their ſpirits is their wandring in prayers; ſo that if
God ſhould ſpeak to them as he ſpake unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> and bade
him aske what he ſhould give him, I verily beleeve there are
many in this Congregation, that have already good aſſurance
of Gods love in Chriſt, if they had not that, that would be
the maine thing that they would aske, but having attained
that, if God would ſpeak from heaven and ſay, what ſhall I
give you for your ſelves, if he ſhould aske you in the Generall,
it may be you would aske ſomething for the Churches; but
if it be for your ſelves, you would put up this petition, oh
Lord that I may be delivered from a wandring ſpirit in holy
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:116352:121"/>
duties, and eſpecially in the duty of prayer, that I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
come to enjoy more holy communion with thy ſelfe then
ever yet I enjoyed, and they would account this to be a
greater mercy then if God ſhould give them to be Kings or
Queens over the whole World; if God ſhould put theſe two
into the balance, either the whole world to poſſeſſe or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to have more free hearts in comming to God in prayer,
and to be delivered from that that hath ſo much hindred their
communion with God in prayer, they would deſpiſe and ſcorne
the world in compariſon of ſuch a mercy as this is: howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
carnall hearts they think little of it, but thoſe that are
the ſervants of God they finde it to be very grievous to them;
but being the time is paſt, I ſhall reſerve that to ſpeak yet a
little more largely for the helpe of thoſe that are under the
burthen of it.</p>
                  <p>I'le only ſpeak one thing further now, and that ſhall be to
thoſe that are wicked and vile, that not only have vaine wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
thoughts in prayer, but even in the very duty of prayer
many times have wicked and ungodly thoughts; how horrible
are they? unclean thoughts, murderous thoughts it may bee,
and moſt abominable. I confeſſe even thoſe that are godly
may ſometimes have ſome blaſphemous thoughts caſt into them,
for the devill is never more buſie then at the time of prayer;
but they rather come from the devill then from the ſtream
and corruption of their own hearts, which may be we may make
out more cleerely afterward; but now I ſpeak to ſuch as have
moſt wicked abominable thoughts, riſing from the ſtream and
corruption of their hearts, ſuch thoughts as their hearts doe
cloſe withall in prayer, and they can roule thoſe thoughts about
in their minds as a child will roule a piece of ſugar in its
mouth; and this is the wickedneſſe of many men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
hearts.</p>
                  <p>Take but this one note with you, that all thoſe dreadfull,
vile, unclean, covetous thoughts of thine in prayer, they have
been to God as if you had ſpoken them in words; thoughts to
God, are all one with him as words are to men; for God is
a ſpirit, and the ſpirit doth converſe with God in thoughts,
as well as men doe converſe with men in words; and what a
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:116352:121"/>
wofull guiltines would have been upon you, had you ſpoken ſuch
vile and wicked things to men as ſome times hath been in your
minds, even when you have been praying to God, how would
the company have even ſpit in your faces, and kickt you from
them? none that have any face of godlineſſe would have indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
you in their company; and yet here's the evill of it, your
hearts are not troubled, but you riſe off your knees and away
you go; thou haſt a cauteriſed conſcience, a ſeared conſcience,
that canſt entertain ſuch vile thoughts at any time without
having thy ſpirit afflicted, and going away with ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
as if the greateſt evill had befalne thee; therefore take
heed of this.</p>

occaſion to fall upon that Argument about the wandring of

that we ſhould have our thoughts, and wills, and affections, our
whole ſoules acting upon him in the duty of prayer, or eſe we
doe not pray to God as unto a God; vaine thoughts in prayer
do pick up the ſacrifice like the birds that <hi>Abraham</hi> drove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

luſts in mens hearts are like ſwine to take the meat and all to
hale it in the dirt, ſo their prayers are filthy and dirty with

taken away; as wine and beer that have the ſpirits of them
gone, ſo the life and ſpirit of our duties are gone by our vaine

much. So ſaith <hi>David</hi> in the 119. <hi>Turne away mine eyes
from beholding vanity, and quicken mee in thy Law:</hi> while our
eyes look upon vanity, there will be no quickneſſe in our hearts
in any ſervice that we tender up to God; now many of Gods
people have experience of the evill of this, and they groan under
the burden of this, and as I ſaid the laſt time, if ſo be that the
Lord ſhould ſpeak from heaven to them and aske them what
they would have, they having already the aſſurance of his love
in Chriſt, they would aske the deliverance from a vain ſpirit in
the performance of holy duties, <hi>Bring no vaine Oblations</hi> ſaith
God in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 13. Oh what vain oblations doe wee bring by
the vanity of our thoughts in prayer! tis true, the beſt of all
will have vaine thoughts ſometimes; but yet, as one compares
the vaine thoughts of men in prayer, like unto a ſpaniel that
goes out with a man, he walks perhaps but halfe a mile, but the
ſpannel will be running up and down, this way and that way,
and if all the ſpace of ground which the ſpaniel hath gone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhould be meaſured, it may be while you are walking halfe
a mile, the ſpaniel fetching compaſſes here and there would be
halfe a dozen miles, ſo our fancies are like a ſpaniel which will
have fetches about this way and that way, in a thouſand vaine
thoughts; but thus now it is with a godly man; as a ſpaniel
though running from his maſter, yet if he give him a call, he is
able to call him to him preſently; and it were well if it were ſo
with us, though our fancies be wild yet if we were able to call
in our fancies and to have them at command it were well with
us: And I find it very much that thoſe that are new commers
they complaine much of the vanity of their thoughts, they were
wont to pray before, and they never had ſuch vaine thoughts as
now they have; the reaſon why there is ſo much vanity of
thoughts, or at leaſt ſo much taken notice of,</p>

                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:116352:122"/>
It is firſt becauſe there is but a little grace in the midſt of a
great deale of corruption in young converts, like a ſpark of fire
in the middeſt of a great deale of aſhes; now if there lies a heap
of aſhes and nothing elſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ou do not ſtirre them; but if there
be aſhes and ſome fire, then you will ſtir them and be blowing
thoſe ſparkes to kindle another fire by. Now when you come
to make any motion, then the aſhes will fly about, whereas before
they lay ſtill; ſo it is here; before God wrought upon thy heart,
there was nothing elſe but aſhes upon thy ſoule, and then they
lay ſtill, but now God hath kindled ſome ſparks of grace in thy
heart, and God is blowing them up to a greater heat, and is
bringing of them to a flame; upon this motion that is in thy
heart, aud the ſtirring to kindle thoſe ſparks further in thy heart,
it is that the aſhes of thy corruptions do as it were fly about
thine eares, and that there is ſuch ſtirrings of corruption more
then there was before, 'tis not becauſe there is more corruption
then there was formerly, but before there being nothing elſe
but corruption it lay ſtill, and now becauſe there is ſomething
elſe, therefore it is that corruption doth ſo ſtirre; and beſides
you know a man that was wont to keep lewd company, if God
turne him that he will keep that company no more, at firſt he
ſhall be more troubled with them then he was before; and they
will keep oftener knocking at his doore, and labouring to get
him to them againe; ſo 'tis here, when the ſoule, vanity and
luſts were as friends together there was no diſturbance, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

out thoſe ſinfull diſtempers, and will have no more of them,
they for the preſent will be more importunate, active and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in their hearts, if God ſhould open the wickedneſſe that there is
in the hearts of men naturally, and ſo all unregenerate men they
would thinke you ſpeak ſtrange riddles, whereas they bleſſe
themſelves; they bleſſe God; they know no ſuch thing in
their hearts; not yes there are ſuch things, only they are not
ſtird, but they lie quiet as mudde in the bottome of a pond, there
it is, yet you cannot ſee it till it be ſtird; at firſt converſion
I ſay the Lord ſuffers thy corruption thus to ſtir, that hee
may diſcover to thee what an evill heart thou haſt, what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of ſin there is in thy heart, and therefore your young
converts, they look upon themſelves more loathſome and vile
then ever they thought they had been.</p>
               <p>And beſides the Devil ſees it a vaine thing to tempt a young
convert to any groſſe act of ſin; when conſcience hath life and
power in it, he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſhall never prevaile that way; but now hee
thinks he may prevail to diſturbe them with vaine thoughts,
and therefore he layes his ſtrength moſt that way; therefore let
not ſuch be diſcouraged, that find their Spirits anoyed and
peſtered with them, if they make them to be the burden of their
Soules; notwithſtanding much vanity of thoughts, the Lord wil
accept of any deſire that they have to ſanctifie his name in holy
dutyes, and I ſhall give you theſe three or four rules to helpe
you againſt theſe wandering and vaine thoughts in holy dutyes,
and eſpecially in prayer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when thou goeſt to prayer, account it to be a great
worke; ſet a high price upon thy prayer; not as having any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
in it as it comes from thee; but ſet a high price upon it
as a great Ordinance of God, wherein there is Communion
with God to be enjoyed, and the influence of the grace of
God to be conveyed through it; ſo ſet a high price upon prayer,
at every time thou art going to prayer; Lord, I am now ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon a worke that is of very great conſequence, and much
lies upon it, and I would account it to be a ſore and a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
to me, if I ſhould loſe but this prayer: this would bee a
ſpeciall meanes to compoſe thy Spirit; and to keep thee from
wandering, as <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 6. 3. a place that I have
ſometimes quoted upon ſuch an occaſion, when the enemies of
<hi>Nehemiah</hi> that would hinder the building of the Temple, ſent
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:116352:123"/>
to him that they might talke together, no ſaith hee; I am do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great worke ſo that I cannot come downe; ſo when the
Devill and the vanity of thine owne heart, would ſend to thee to
parly, and talke as it were with thee, give an Anſwer, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtand parlying with theſe things; the worke that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
is a great worke; there are very few people that do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the worke of prayer a great worke; if thou didſt,
it would helpe thee much againſt the vanity of thy thoughts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Every time thou goeſt to prayer, thou that art
moſt troubled with ſuch vaine thoughts, renew thy reſolutions
againſt them; I have been troubled with vain thoughts here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
and am afraid, if I looke not to it, that I ſhall loſe
this prayer alſo; and therefore O Lord, here I renew my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
to ſet againſt them in this prayer with all my might;
it is very much that may be done by ſtrong reſolutions, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
if thy ſtrong reſolutions be renewed reſolutions; for
an old reſolution begins to grow weak; a man that hath reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon a thing a great while agoe, it hath little power ever
him; but now when a man hath reſolved upon a thing but this
morning, and juſt at the time when he is going about it, now
hee doth reſolve upon it, and ſet himſelfe upon it, and doth
reſolve through the grace of God, that whatſoever difficultie
he meets with all, whatſoever it coſt him, that he will goe
through this worke, I ſay that reſolutions renewed have a great
deale of power; and you cannot imagine what a great deale
of power the renewing of reſolution againſt vaine thoughts
will have, if they were renewed every time thou goeſt to
prayer, untill thou getteſt power over thy thoughts, do but
make tryall of this; thou haſt loſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> prayer by vaine
thoughts; and thou haſt been troubled for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and yet they
come againe; do but try for this weeke; as I remember I
ſaid in the point of paſſion and anger, that we ſhould reſolve
with our ſelves, well, whatſoever fals out this morning, I am
reſolved I will beare it; ſo bethink thy ſelfe how many prayers
thou haſt loſt by vaine thoughts; and now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thy reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Covenant with God, that for this prayer, I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
my ſelfe againſt them, whatſoever paines I take, I will be
ſure yet withall to look up to Gods grace to aſſiſt one, I will
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:116352:124"/>
be ſure this prayer to keep my heart cloſe to what I am about; &amp;
perhaps that will helpe you a little; but yet ſome vain thoughts
will come for all that; then the next night renew them again;
and the next morning renew them again; and that till thou
commeſt to a habit of keeping thy heart cloſe to the duty,
though now thou feeleſt thy heart ſo wild, that thou thinkeſt
it is impoſſible to bring it into order, but certainly by ſuch a
means, thy heart will be brought into order.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Be ſure to ſet the preſence of God before you in
prayer, have a reall light of the infinite greatneſſe, Majeſtie,
and glory of that you preſent your ſelves unto, when you are
are calling upon him; if ſo be that thou canſt have a reall fight
of God in his glory, it wil keep thy heart cloſe to the duty,
as if a man be wandring with his eyes, and looking after every
feather, if the King or ſome great perſon come into the Room,
all his thoughts would be about the King, or the great perſon
that were comming in: ſo if you would preſent the Lord in his
glory and greatneſſe, excellencie, majeſtie, and power, before
you, and what a dreadfull God he is in himſelfe, and yet what
a mercifull God hee is to us in his Sonne: this would mightily
compoſe our hearts, certainly men and women that are ſo wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
in their prayers; it is becauſe their eyes are not open to
look upon God in his glory, they are as it were dreaming and
do not apprehend that God ſtands and looks upon them, and
obſerves them, and that God takes notice of every wandring
thought that comes from them; they doe not conſider that God
doth converſe with the thoughts of men, as well as men do with
the words of men; thats a third rule.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Take heed thou beeſt not deceived; becauſe that
thoſe thoughts thou haſt in prayer, doe not appeare to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
evill in themſelves. This is a great deceit and hinder ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in the ſanctifying of Gods name in prayer; there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
damed in ſome vain thoughts; now becauſe the thought
hath no great evill in it ſelfe, therefore they thinke they may
play with it; and their hearts cloſe with it, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> along
with it as the fiſh doth with the bait; if the Devill caſts in a
thought of blaſphemie, that makes thee quake and ſhake; but if
thy thoughts have no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> evill in them, but they are ſlight
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:116352:124"/>
things; matters of no moment one way or other, upon that
thy heart begins to be dandling, and playing with them;
therefore remember this rule, that in the time of prayer,
whatſoever thoughts be in thy mind that doe not concerne the
preſent duty, they are ſinfull before God, though the thoughts
for the matter of them be never ſo good, yet thou art to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
them as ſinfull at that time. Therefore never be deceived
with this, that the thoughts are not very ſinfull, thats ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rule.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place obſerve this rule, if ever God hath helped
thee at any time in prayer, that thy heart hath been kept cloſe to
a duty, and thou haſt had Communion with him, bleſſe God
for that, bleſſe God for that helpe; tis a rule of very great uſe
for us to get further aſſiſtance from God in any thing, if ſo bee
our hearts be inlarged to bleſſe God for any aſſiſtance wee
have had heretofore; and the reaſon why we gaine and proſper
ſo little in our Chriſtian courſe, it is becauſe we do not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of what God hath done for us, to give God glory for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes
formerly received, and therefore God takes little or no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in comming in with further mercyes to us; as if you had a
young nurſery of trees, and they began to thrive very well, but
there comes a company of Caterpillars and ſpoiles almoſt all
the young Trees that are ſet, only two or three are kept from
the Caterpillars; a man goes into his orchard, and looks upon
his Trees, and this is ſpoild, and that is ſpoiled; but he ſees two
or three and theſe flouriſh fairly, and theſe are full of buds,
and are like to come to ſomething, and he rejoyces mightily
in thoſe, becauſe they are ſav'd when ſo many others are ſpoil'd;
and ſo doe thou view thy prayers, and conſider how
many hath been ſpoiled as it were by theſe Caterpillars; for I
compare wandring vaine thoughts in prayer unto Caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
that are upon the trees; and we ſee that if ſtormy rainy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
comes the Caterpillars will fall; and one would thinke
that theſe bluſtering ſtormes and the hand of God that hath
been out againſt us, ſhould have clenſed our thoughts and ſoules
from theſe Caterpillars that have been upon our dutyes, but
many duties have been ſpoiled; yet thou maiſt ſay, that
through Gods mercy ſuch a Morning in my cloſet, the Lord
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:116352:125"/>
hath preſerved a prayer to himſelfe, and I have gotten power
over this vaine heart of mine, bleſſe God for this, and ſo the Spirit
of God will be more ready to come in and help thee another
time; but thus much ſhall ſuffice to ſpeak to this, thats the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
thing, we muſt give up our ſelves wholly to this duty.</p>
               <p>The third thing for the ſanctifying of Gods name in prayer
is this, there muſt be the breathings of the Spirit of God, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
Gods name is not ſanctifyed; that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. is
cleere for this, likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities,
for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but
the Spirit it ſelfe maketh interceſſion for us with groanings
which cannot be uttered; if any of you ſhould ſay how can
wee ſanctifie Gods name, we are poore and weak, we can doe
little? marke, it is ſaid here, that the Spirit helpeth our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to pray, and the word is exceeding emphaticall in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall;
in your books tis but meerly helping our infirmities,
but the meaning of the word is, in theſe two things, the Spirit
helpes; that is, look how a man that is taking up a heavy
peece of Timber at one end, he alone cannot get it up, but there
comes another and takes it up at the other end and ſo helps
him; The word ſignifies ſuch a kind of helping, as when a man
takes a thing at the other end, or on the other ſide, one ſtanding
the one way, and the other ſtanding the other way, or one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up one end, and the other the other end, that is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it; <hi>he helpes our infirmities,</hi> the poore foule is pulling
and tugging with its own heart, and finds his heart heavy
and dull, like a logge in a ditch, and have not many of you
found your hearts ſo? but now then when you are tugging
with your hearts, and would faine lift up your hearts to God
in prayer, there comes the Spirit of God at the other end, and
takes the heavieſt end of the burden and helpes you to lift it up;
if a child were at one end of the logge, and that were but light,
and the other end very heavy, if one come and take up the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
end, a little ſtrength will ſerve for the lighter end; ſo the Spirit
comes and takes up the heavier end in duty, and ſo helps our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
<hi>helpes together,</hi> and then the other word is <hi>The Spirit;</hi> that is
together with the acting of the graces of the Spirit in our hearts,
you muſt not ſay ſo; alaſſe, what can I doe? it muſt be the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:116352:125"/>
of God that muſt doe all; it is true, hee doth all.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he gives converting and habituall grace, and aſſiſting and
actuating grace; but now when the Spirit hath wrought grace
ſo as to convert the heart, and hath given habituall grace in
thy heart, why then when the Spirit comes to aſſiſt it, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that thou ſhouldeſt ſtirre up all the gifts and graces of
the Spirit, and the very ſtrength of thy body; the Spirit of God
expects that thou ſhouldeſt act to the uttermoſt thou art able,
what power hath been given thee by God, and when thou art
in acting, then the Spirit comes and helpes together with us;
noting that we are to put forth what ſtrength we have, and thus
Gods name will be ſanctified, when as wee putting forth the
graces of the Spirit in us, then the Spirit comes and helpes; and
what comes from us now, comes from the breathings of the holy-Spirit
in us, and then God who knowes the meaning of the
Spirit, will know now the meaning of our ſighs and groanes;
therefore when thou art going to prayer, thou art to eye the
Spirit of God; thou art by the eye of faith to looke upon the
Spirit of God, and to caſt thy ſoule upon the aſſiſtance of the
Spirit of God, thou art to looke upon the holy-Ghoſt, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Father and the Son to that office, to bee a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to his poore ſervants in the duties of worſhip, and eſpecially
in that great duty of prayer; now upon the reading of this text,
and having it thus opened, this is one good helpe for thee in
prayer; read this text, and then exerciſe thy faith upon it;
Lord haſt thou not ſaid that thy Spirit helpes our infirmities,
when we know not what to pray for, nor how to pray for any
thing as we ought? but the Spirit will come, now Lord make
good this word of thine to my ſoule at this time, and let mee
have the breathings of the Spirit of God in me; alaſſe the breaths
of men, if it come from gifts and parts, I know thou wilt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
regard it, except there be the breathings of the holy-Ghoſt
in mee in prayer; now, if you would know whether the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God doth come in or no, you may know it by this; the
Spirit of God carries unto God, and it makes the prayer ſweet
and delightfull, ſo much of the Spirit of God as is there, it
comes to the ſoule in the duty, and it leaves a ſavour behind
it; a gratious ſavour is alwaies left behind, when the Spirit of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:116352:126"/>
God comes to breath; O the breath of the Spirit of God is a
ſweet breath, and it makes prayers ſweet; it never comes into
the Soule but after it hath done any worke it came for, it leaves
a ſweet ſent, after that, the ſoule finds a ſweetneſſe in that prayer;
now many of you have been in the morning at prayer, but I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to you; what ſweet ſavour of the Spirit of God is left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind?
certainly if the Spirit hath been there it is like civil that is
put into a little box, though you ſhould take out the civit,
yet there will be a ſweet ſavour left behind; ſo though the Spirit
of God, in reſpect of the preſent aſſiſtance, withdraws it ſelf, yet it
leaves a ſweet ſavour behind.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing is, purity of heart; pure heart and hands, in
<hi>Heb. 10. 22. Rev.</hi> 5. 8. having every one of them harpes, and
golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of Saints; mark,
the prayers of the Saints are odours in golden vials, the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
vials I may compare to the heart; the hearts of the Saints
muſt be as golden vials, and then their prayers will be as odours;
in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. the holy-Ghoſt giving directions how wee ſhould
pray, it is with this qualification, I will therefore that men pray
every where lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the outward converſation muſt be pure, and the heart
pure; in <hi>Job</hi> 22. 26. marke whats ſaid concerning that holy
man; theres a promiſe made to him for the lifting up of his face
to God, putting away iniquitie from his Tabernacle, that by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
away evill from our Tabernacles, and ſo from our hearts,
we may be able to lift up our hearts with joy to goe; and thats
the fift thing, purity of heart and hands.</p>
               <p>The ſixt thing is, in truth, when we come to call upon God,
we muſt call upon him in truth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 18. the Lord
is nigh unto all, to all that call upon him in truth; you
will ſay what is the meaning of that? to that I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;</p>
               <p>Firſt, there muſt be inward diſpoſitions anſwerable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions;
as for inſtance, when I come to expreſſe the greatneſſe
of the majeſtie of God, then I muſt have an inward diſpoſition
ſutable to this expreſſion, I muſt have a feare and reverence of the
infinite majeſtie of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When I come to confeſſe my ſin, to judge my ſelfe
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:116352:126"/>
for my ſin, there muſt be an inward diſpoſition ſutable to ſuch a
confeſſion; O how many men and women will come and ſpeak
great things againſt themſelves for their ſins, and judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for their ſins, and yet there is no ſuch diſpoſition in their
hearts ſutable to their words; you ſhall have ſome in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with others, they will be a meanes to break the hearts of
others, they will ſo follow their ſin; and take ſuch ſhame and
confuſion upon themſelves for their ſin, and yet God knows
their hearts not ſtird all this while; and then they will call upon
God for pardon of ſin, and for power againſt their ſin, and
yet God knowes that their hearts do cloſe with their ſin, and
are loath to part with their ſin in the mean time, this is falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of heart; when the inward diſpoſition is not anſwerable
to outward expreſſions; I beſeech you my brethren conſider
of the prayers you have made, and eſpecially you that pray much
with others, look what expreſſions you have made, and ſee
whether there be anſwerable diſpoſitions to the expreſſions you
have made, and how that the Lord doth remember every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
that you have made.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee muſt call upon God in truth; that is, conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
to performe the ingagements of prayer, prayer puts an
ingagement upon the heart; now thoſe that call upon him in
truth are conſcionable to performe the ingagements; as now, do
I pray for any good thing, I am ingaged to endeavour in the
uſe of all meanes for the attaining of the good thing? when
you confeſſe a ſin, why, you are ingaged by that meanes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
all your might againſt that ſin; and when you pray
for my grace, you are ingaged to make uſe of all means you
can for the attaining of that grace; and then beſides, in prayer
there is much profeſſion unto God of our ſincerity and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe,
and of our willingneſſe to be at his diſpoſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
theſe ingagements that thou makeſt to God in prayer;
if God ſhould preſent to us all our profeſſions that we have
made to him in prayer, and tell us how we have come ſhort of
them, it would make us be in ſhame and confuſion in our
owne thoughts.</p>
               <p>Another thing in prayer muſt be faith; pray without doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as in the former Scripture, the prayer of faith prevailes
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:116352:127"/>
much; <hi>James</hi> 1. 6, 7. a man that wavereth and doubteth muſt
not thinke to obtaine any thing of God. But I ſhould have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
what that faith is that wee ſhould have in prayer, wee
muſt have faith to beleeve that the thing that we doe pleaſeth
God, and faith in Gods promiſes, and faith in Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
this ſhould be exerciſed in the time of our prayers;
And therefore after we have done, to goe away beleeving, as
<hi>Hannah</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 18. wee read of her, that after ſhee had
been praying ſhe went away, and lookt no more ſad; the
text faith, noting that after wee have been powring forth our
ſoules to God, wee ſhould beleeve and exerciſe faith and not
go in as drooping a way as ever we did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, yea, if wee knew certainly that God
will hear us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The way to be aſſured that God will hear you, is
by caſting your ſelves upon God, how can you know that he
will hear, but by reſting upon him? I have been with God, and
I have been doing the duty of a poore creature, and for
the ſucceſſe I leave it to God, and therefore it muſt bee with
faith.</p>
               <p>But I have ſo many ſins mixt with my prayers, how can I
beleeve?</p>
               <p>You have an excellent Scripture for that to helpe a ſoule,
to exerciſe faith in prayer, notwithſtanding there hath been
many infirmities; in <hi>Pſal. 65. 2, 3. O thou that heareſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
unto thee all fleſh ſhall come;</hi> Thou heareſt prayers, but
I have a great many ſins that hinders; no, marke, what
though iniquity prevailes againſt me, as for our tranſgreſſions,
thou ſhalt purge them away? O make uſe of this Scripture,
though you remember not other things; yet you that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
hearts and are afraid that God will not hear your
prayers, ſee what the text ſaith, <hi>Thou heareſt prayer Lord,</hi> but
will not my ſins hinder? no ſaith <hi>David, iniquity prevailes againſt
me, as for our tranſgreſſions thou ſhalt purge them away;</hi> exerciſe
faith in this; and know that God doth not heare prayer becauſe
thou art not ſinfull, becauſe of thy worthineſſe, but meerly for
his free grace.</p>
               <p>Another holy diſpoſition in prayer ſhould be this; the ſoul
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:116352:127"/>
ſhould come with a holy freedome, with the Spirit of adoption
to God, crying Abba Father; if thou comeſt to God meerly
as to a Judge, though its true, thoſe that doe not know that
God loves them, yet are bound as Creatures to pray, but
thou canſt never ſanctifie the name of God, till thou haſt a
child-like Spirit, the Spirit of adoption; the Lord loves to have
his Children come with freedome of Spirit to himſelfe in
prayer, to come as children, and not to come with dejected
countenances, and diſcouraged hearts; but come freely to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
thy heart to God, as any child would open his heart to a
gracious and loving Father.</p>
               <p>Another diſpoſition is fervencie in prayer; the effectuall
fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much, and that will
be a meanes to help againſt vain thoughts too, as when the
honey is ſcalding hot then the flyes will not come to it; if thy
heart were as it were ſcalding hot in prayer thou wouldeſt not
have ſuch vain thoughts.</p>
               <p>Next there muſt be conſtancie in prayer; in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 17.
by that I mean this never to give over untill we have that wee
pray for, or ſomething elſe in lieu of it; it may be thou haſt
prayed and nothing is come of it; be not diſcouraged, thou
haſt to deal with a great God, and therefore pray again and
again, and again, and pray with this reſolution, well, let God
doe with mee what he will, I will as long as I live call upon
him, and if God ſhall caſt mee away yet he ſhall caſt me away
calling upon him, as the poore woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> when Chriſt
call'd her dogge, and diſcouraged her, yet ſtill ſhe would pray;
I but dogges may have crums, that heart is in an ill condition
that is diſcouraged in prayer, becauſe it doth not get what it
would, and therefore to thinke with themſelves I had as good
not pray at all, take heed of any ſuch thoughts.</p>
               <p>Againe, if you would pray to God indeed, ſo as to ſanctifie
his name in prayer, there ſhould be humility in your hearts ſo as
to be ſenſible of your own unworthineſſe; I ſpake ſomwhat about
being ſenſible of the diſtance between God and us, when I ſpake
about ſanctifying of Gods name in general. The laſt that I
ſhall ſpeak of is this, when you have done all, this all, theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
will not ſanctifie Gods name, except all be tendred
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:116352:128"/>
up in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and in the power of his merits;
let a man or woman pray with as much fervencie, zeale, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie,
purity, in truth and ſincerity; yet except hee puts up
all in the name of Chriſt, I ſay hee cannot be accepted; our
ſpirituall offerings muſt be tendered up in his name; but I have
Preached much about that, but now put all that hath been ſaid
together, and this it is to pray.</p>
               <p>That is, when as I pray underſtandingly: when I give my
ſelf to prayer: when there are the breathings of the holy Ghoſt
in my prayer: when there is purity of heart like a golden viall:
together with ſincerity, when it is in truth of heart, when it is
in faith, when it comes from a ſpirituall Adoption, when its
in fervencie, when in conſtancie, reverence, humility, and all
put up in the name of Jeſus Chriſt; now a man prayes, as it is
ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> behold hee prayeth; ſo I may ſay of thoſe that
are inſtructed in this Art, behold they pray; you ſee now that
prayer is more then to read in a book, more then to ſay a few
words; yee ſee it is a very hard thing to pray, a work of great
difficultie, and no marvell though we have loſt ſo many of our
prayers as we have done; we muſt not charge prayer and God
with it, but look to our ſelves (I mean not charge the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of prayer) but the vileneſſe of our carriage in our
prayers; and let us for time to come know what a Chriſtian life
meanes, it is ſaid of Chriſt in <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 29. that <hi>as hee was praying
the faſhion of his countenance was changed.</hi> Oh thats an excellent
thing, that when wee have been in our cloſets at prayer, to
come away with our faces ſhining; my Brethren could we but
pray in ſuch a manner as this is, the very faſhion of our
countenances would be changed, as <hi>Moſes</hi> when he came from
the preſence of God upon the Mount, or as Chriſt that had
the faſhion of his countenance changed. Prayer, it is the
ſweet eaſe of ones ſpirit, its the help at a dead lift, its the
great Ordinance of our Communion with God in this world;
and therefore let us learne this Art of ſanctifying Gods name
in Prayer.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude all in this, you have heard the myſtery of the
ſanctifying the name of God in worſhipping God; now I
beſeech you, you that have been a long time in the ſchool of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:116352:128"/>
Chriſt, as it were Apprentices to Chriſt to learn Chriſtianity;
be aſhamed that you have underſtood ſo little of this art in San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
the name of God in prayer; It is an art and a myſtery
that you muſt be inſtructed in, and you are not Chriſtians till
you are inſtructed in this, as in an art and myſtery: And that
man and woman that ſhall be inſtructed truly in this art and
myſtery in Sanctifying Gods name now in the worſhiping of
him, ſuch a man and woman ſhall be to all eternity Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the name of God in prayſing of him. There is a time coming
when all the Saints muſt be in the preſence of God, and be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
praiſing of him, and they ſhall then Sanctifie Gods name
for ever; let us now learn this art of Sanctifying Gods name in
praying, that we may eternally Sanctifie his name in praiſing
of him.</p>
