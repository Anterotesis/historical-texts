            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <p>And all men ſhall fear, and ſhall declare the work of
God: for they ſhall wiſely conſider of his doing.</p>
                  <p>The righteous ſhall be glad in the Lord, and ſhall truſt

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT this Pſalm is a Prayer of
<hi>Davids</hi> for preſervation of his
Life from fear of the enemy,
we are aſſur'd from the title and
the firſt verſe: And if that rule
of Interpreters hold good, That
where nothing is new in the Title, there the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is the ſame with the foregoing Pſalm,
we may probably infer, that it was indited by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49111:3"/>
the Royal Prophet, when <hi>Saul</hi> and his aſſociates
ſought his life.</p>
            <p>However it be (for Expoſitors are not agreed
about it) without any force to the Text, or
any part of the Context, we may fitly apply it
to the Publick Solemnity of this day, wherein
we are aſſembled to magnifie the providence of
God for his memorable deliverance of the King
and Kingdom from the bloody deſigns of Popiſh
Traytors, and to implore his goodneſs for the
continuance of his favour to our preſent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
and the whole Nation; to give him thanks
for the great things he hath done for us already,
and to pray for the final defeat of the like helliſh
Plots againſt us. This is a day which the Lord
hath made, let us rejoyce, and be glad in it:
nay, this is a ſeaſon which he hath once more ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliz'd,
let us pray and ſing praiſes to the God of
our lives. And what great reaſon we have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in his Providence, and glory in his Power,
and truſt in his Goodneſs, will be evident from
the words when applied to the day: for it is
moſt remarkably of his own making; he hath
made it his, by a miracle of mercy; <hi>And all men
ſhall fear and ſhall declare the work of God, for they
ſhall wiſely conſider of his doing:</hi> and he hath made
it ours by a return of duty; <hi>The righteous ſhall be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49111:3"/>
glad in the Lord, and ſhall truſt in him; and all the
upright in heart ſhall glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words we have theſe three general
parts.</p>
            <p>I. An Act of God; ſomething of his doing.</p>
            <p>II. Its Effect upon men in general: <hi>All men
ſhall fear, and ſhall declare,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>III. A ſpecial Duty reſulting from it, incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on good men: <hi>The righteous, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. I begin with the firſt, as the ground of all
the reſt: An Act of God, which is twice men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
called <hi>The work of God,</hi> and <hi>His do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
The expreſſion is doubled, to make it at
once more certain, and to beſpeak our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of it: But what that <hi>work</hi> was, and by
what means accompliſhed, we muſt learn from
the precedent verſes. The Pſalm (as I ſaid) is a
prayer of <hi>Davids</hi> for deliverance from his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
with a deſcription of their intended cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and a prediction of Gods judgments on
them. His enemies were ſtrong and powerful,
but God was omnipotent, and in Him was his
help and truſt; they deſign'd his utter ruine, but
God turned the miſchief upon their own heads.
And that we may ſee how great a deliverance
God wrought for him, let us firſt conſider what
they plotted againſt him. In the deſcription we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49111:4"/>
have ſeveral characters of their rage and cruelty,
and as many intimations of his danger.</p>
            <p>1. Their ſecret counſels and midnight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances,
[ver. 2.] <hi>Hide me from the ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of the wicked;</hi> for ſo uſually all Treaſons and
Conſpiracies begin, in private Combinations
and clandeſtine Plots: And though it be true of
all ſins, that they are works of darkneſs, yet
Treaſons moſt of all hate and avoid the light,
being hatch'd in the dark receſſes of wicked
hearts, and promoted by ſecret Meetings and
Conſultations. But their malice was too great
to be long conceal'd by darkneſs it ſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it ſoon broke out,</p>
            <p>2. Into open Rebellion; for ſo it follows,
[ver. 2.] <hi>Hide me from the inſurrection of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of iniquity:</hi> that's the next degree of their
miſchief and his danger: They that harbour
Treaſon in their hearts want only an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to act it with their hands; and when men are
engaged in wicked Conſpiracies, they are ſoon
drawn on to open Inſurrections: They that dare
imagine evil againſt the King in their Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
will not ſtick to countenance Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt him in the Camp: For the malice of
Treaſon, like fire conceal'd, will either find or
force its paſſage. So their ſecret counſels here,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49111:4"/>
were ſoon formed into an Inſurrection, and the
heat of their rage kindled the flames of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>3. In their ſlanderous reproaches and unjuſt
inſinuations, ver. 3. <hi>They whet their tongue like a
ſword,</hi> and <hi>ſhoot out their arrows, even bitter words:</hi>
This is the uſual Prologue to all Traytorous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
to calumniate the Government, and ſpeak
evil of Dignities, to reproach the one and make
it odious, by traducing the other, and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them contemptible: <hi>They ſhoot out their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</hi>
intimating the number of their ſlanders;
for ſuch will be ſure to ſay enough, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at leaſt may be believed: Or if their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
be too groſs to find credit, then they
rail and diſcharge bitter words, ſharpned with
ſpight and envenomed with malice, and theſe
they dart in private ſuggeſtions and crafty inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations,
ver. 4. <hi>That they may ſhoot in ſecret at the
perfect, ſuddenly do they hit him, and fear not.</hi> And
when they have infected others with this poiſon
of aſps that is under their lips, we ſoon find 'em
in the next place</p>
            <p>4. Met at their private Cabals, to animate
the Traytors, and carry on the Treaſon, ver. 5.
<hi>They encourage themſelves in an evil matter, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
of laying ſnares privily:</hi> For Treaſon is uſually
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49111:5"/>
an underground work, and as far as poſſible is
brooded in the dark; miſchief is the deſign, and
ſecreſie is the midwife to bring it to the birth,
and no means unattempted leſt it ſhould prove
abortive; which is a further deſcription of their
deſigns, and his danger.</p>
            <p>5. Their great induſtry and diligence, ver. 6.
<hi>They ſearch out iniquity, they accompliſh a diligent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign:</hi>
There is not a more active Principle in
the world than malice, nor any malice more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh
and buſie than that of Rebels: 'Tis the
Devils malice that makes him reſtleſs, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
have ſo much at leaſt of his temper, that
they leave no ſtone unturn'd which may carry
on, or accompliſh their miſchievous deſigns:
and hence they are fitly ſtiled in Scripture, Sons of
<hi>Belial, i. e.</hi> of the Arch-rebel.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the characters which <hi>David</hi> gives us
of his enemies within the compaſs of this ſhort
Pſalm; and a true deſcription of all their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
ſuch as are enemies to Kings, and Traytors
to Governments: and when we have put 'em
all together, their ſecret counſels and their bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
Rebellion, their malicious ſlanders, and
their deep-laid Plots; and all theſe acted with
unwearied diligence, and reſtleſs induſtry, we
need no further proof of his enemies deſigns, and
his danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49111:5"/>
But in the midſt of all theſe dangers, and in
the height of their expectations the good man
looked up to God, and foreſaw his own ſafety,
and their ruine, ver. 7. <hi>But God ſhall ſhoot at 'em
with a ſwift arrow, ſuddenly ſhall they be wounded.</hi>
God who hath ſet up Kings, will defend 'em;
He that called <hi>David</hi> his Anointed, did preſerve
him; He that has ſaid, <hi>By me Kings reign,</hi> has
thereby entitled 'em to his protection: And that
it might appear that his reſcue was from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that both his deliverance and his enemies
deſtruction was Gods own Act, he has men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
two circumſtances, which I ſhall briefly
conſider as moſt applicable to the caſe before
us.</p>
            <p>1. The ſuddenneſs of their deſtruction. And
2. The manner of the diſcovery, and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his danger.</p>
            <p>1. The ſuddenneſs of the deſtruction; <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ſhall they be wounded.</hi> When they were in the
height of their hopes, priding themſelves in
their well-formed Plots, and ſecure of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
he that ſearched the ſecrets of their hearts
and knew their treachery, blaſted the deſign,
and rendred all their contrivances vain and
fruitleſs. The ſuddenneſs of events does uſually
enhance the wonder, and when things moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49111:6"/>
and unlikely are brought to paſs in the
twinkling of an eye, when men leaſt think of
'em, and have no reaſon to expect 'em, 'tis a
plain intimation that ſome more than ordinary
cauſe concurr'd to their production, and the
finger of God is clearly viſible in ſuch ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
and unaccountable events. When the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
were delivered from <hi>Babylon</hi> after a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
reſtraint, and all of a ſudden ſent back to
their own Country in peace, as the joy of ſuch
an unexpected return almoſt amaz'd 'em. <hi>When
the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion, then were
we like unto them that dream, [Pſ.</hi> 126. 1.] they
could ſcarce believe it to be real; ſo they right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concluded <hi>[ver.</hi> 3.] <hi>The Lord hath done great
things for us, whereof we rejoyce.</hi> Such ſudden
events are beyond the power of ordinary means,
and muſt needs be concluded to be Gods own
work. And ſo the ſudden deſtruction of the
wicked in the midſt of their proſperity, and
when they think themſelves moſt ſecure, is a
manifeſt proof that it is the Lords own doing.
To ſee fearleſs ſinners baffled in an inſtant, and
ſunk into confuſion when they think of nothing
leſs, is an undeniable argument that it was an
omnipotent arm which ſmote 'em. And it qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted
<hi>David</hi>'s doubts of the equity of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49111:6"/>
when he ſaw the wicked brought into
deſolation <hi>in a moment [Pſal.</hi> 73. 19.] To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them flouriſhing to day like a <hi>green Bay-tree,</hi>
and to morrow dried up like the <hi>Fig-tree
curſed</hi> by our Saviour, makes it notorious and
plain, that they were blaſted with a breath from
Heaven. So periſh'd <hi>David</hi>'s enemies, whereby it is
evident it was Gods own work: And ſo was it</p>
            <p>2. From the manner of the diſcovery, and
the prevention of his danger, ver. 8. <hi>They ſhall
make their own tongue fall upòn the head of themſelves.</hi>
Intimating, either that the miſchiefs which they
had deviſed for others, ſhould return upon
themſelves; or that their own tongues ſhould
be made their own betrayers. The firſt is the
Pſalmiſts common obſervation of the wicked,
and of the equity of Divine Juſtice in their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
that they are taken in the ſnares
which themſelves had laid, and are fallen into
the pit they had digg'd for others. And the other
is as certain (though not ſo common) that the
wicked are oft made the revealers of their own
ſecrets, and the contrivers of miſchief are the
betrayers of themſelves. And both are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of an over-ruling power in ſuch myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
events, and manifeſt that it is Gods own
doing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49111:7"/>
And thus have we ſeen what <hi>work</hi> it was that
<hi>David</hi> here aſcribes to God, namely, the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his enemies, evident to be <hi>his doing,</hi>
more eſpecially by the ſuddenneſs of their ruine,
and the manner of the diſcovery, and preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his danger. And the caſe ſuits well with
the occaſion and the day, wherein we eſcap'd as
great a danger, by as ſtrange a deliverance, and
that from God too, and of the <hi>Lords own doing;</hi>
which will plainly appear when I have paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd
the forenamed circumſtances with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of this days ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not need to deſcribe the greatneſs of
our danger, when I have but mention'd the
horror of this days Treaſon; how the King and
Prince, with the whole High-Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were all marked out for ſlaughter, to be
blown up alive, and involv'd in one common
death without a minutes warning: And 'tis
not hard to imagine, what tyranny and uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
what oppreſſion and blood-ſhedding had
enſued, what unſpeakable miſery had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd
upon us and our poſterity, to the loſs of
our liberty and fortunes, to the change of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Religion, to the continual haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of our lives, and of all that at preſent we
peaceably enjoy: which was all certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49111:7"/>
though by the infinite mercy of God, it
was never executed. A deſign ſo cruel, that they
who cannot but abhor it, if true, would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
perſuade themſelves and others, it is falſe;
and we are forbidden to truſt our ears, becauſe
we did not ſee it with our eyes. 'Tis hard, that
they who lay the greateſt ſtreſs on Tradition,
ſhould not allow us to believe one, eſpecially of
a matter of fact, of leſs than fourſcore years,
and within the memory of ſome now living:
But what will not they deny, who cry down the
Bible it ſelf, and vilifie the teſtimony of Gods
holy Spirit, when it makes againſt them? For
unleſs the ſeveral publick Records of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the joynt conſent of our deceaſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
unleſs the confeſſions of the Traytors
themſelves, and ſome of their own moſt credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Wtiters; nay, unleſs our own ſenſes at this
very day, and our freſh experience of the like
damnable deſigns, can be all ſuppos'd to deceive
us, a Conſpiracy no leſs certain than barbarous,
as firmly to be believed as heartily deteſted by
all that wiſh well to our <hi>Engliſh Iſrael,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
thoſe ungodly Principles, which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
or defend ſuch unchriſtian and bloody
practices. I know rhere are few (if any) that
hear me, unacquainted with the ſtory of this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49111:8"/>
days Plot; and therefore I ſhall leave it to your
memories to run the parallel between <hi>David</hi>'s
Conſpirators and theſe Traytors, in the ſecreſie
of their Counſels, deſigns laid deep as Hell, and
black as utter darkneſs, in the maliciouſneſs of
their calumnies and imbitter'd ſlanders, in the
inſolence of their inſurrection and bold-fac'd
Rebellion; and in their induſtrious ſedulity to
carry on their Treaſon, and an unquenchable
thirſt after blood and ruine; to all which they
wanted only ſucceſs to make 'em the moſt
matchleſs villains that perhaps ever trod on the
earths ſurface.</p>
            <p>But he that ſits in Heaven laugh'd 'em to
ſcorn; the Lord had them in deriſion: What
<hi>David</hi> foreſaw, God himſelf reveal'd, by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the Treaſon and confounding the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
which happy diſcovery gave birth to this
days joyful gratulations, to praiſe the Lord for
his goodneſs, and declare the wonders that he
doth for us the children of men. To which as
the proper matter of this days duty I haſten,
when I have firſt briefly evinc'd, that this was
alſo <hi>Gods own doing:</hi> which will be more evident
from the ſame arguments, wherewith <hi>David</hi>
manifeſted the deſtruction of his enemies to be
<hi>Gods own work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49111:8"/>
1. From the ſuddenneſs of their deſtruction.
When there was but one night between us and
ruine; and e're the next Sun had ſet, the whole
body of this flouriſhing Kingdom had either
bled its laſt, or fainted with the loſs of its beſt
blood; when the Treaſon was ripe for action,
and nothing wanting to the execution but only
ſtretching out an hand to fire the fatal train;
when the Traytors grew big with hopes, and
altogether fearleſs of diſappointment, <hi>God ſhoots
at 'em with a ſwift arrow, and ſuddenly they are
wounded.</hi> They had poſted themſelves in ſeveral
quarters of the Kingdom, looking for deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and it came ſo effectually on themſelves,
that as they did not ſuſpect it, ſo they could not
poſſibly avoid it. Their deſigns were ſo near the
iſſue, that their Confederates at a diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
'em done; and ſo nigh was our danger,
that we might truly ſay with <hi>David,</hi> [1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.
3.] <hi>As the Lord liveth, there was but a ſtep between
us and death.</hi> But God who reſcued <hi>Iſaac</hi> from
the knife and the fiery pile, withheld <hi>That terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Blow,</hi> and made them the ſacrifice to their
own mercileſs cruelty, delivered us from the
fire, and made them the offering, conſuming
'em in a moment by their <hi>own wickedneſs:</hi> For
'tis no new obſervation that ſeveral of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49111:9"/>
accomplices, who had prepared the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Pile, were firſt ſcorch'd and afterwards ſlain
by the direful effects of that very element, which
they had choſen as an inſtrument of our ruine:
And when we ſee ſuch notorious offenders cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by their own ſins, when they are puniſh'd
by the ſame thing wherein they have offended,
and made to drink (as it were) out of their own
cup, we may eaſily diſcern who adminiſters the
potion, and how juſt the retaliation is. And 'tis
oft the caſe of the wicked, that <hi>Gods</hi> hand may
be manifeſt, and his providence glorified by the
reſemblance of the puniſhment to the ſin: The
Pſalmiſt hath noted it <hi>[Pſ.</hi> 109. 27.] <hi>Hereby ſhall
they know that it is thy hand, and that thou Lord haſt
done it:</hi> and how's that? <hi>[ver.</hi> 29.] in that
<hi>they are cloathed with their own ſhame, and covered
with their own confuſion, as with a mantle:</hi> That
they fall as faſt as they riſe; are ſtill confounded
by their own devices, and ſtill thy ſervants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</p>
            <p>2. In the manner of the diſcovery, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the danger: That the Traytors
ſhould be made their own Betrayers; and one
of them by endeavouring to ſave a Friend,
ſhould deſtroy all the reſt of his accomplices:
That darkneſs ſhould bring their deeds to light,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49111:9"/>
and one night diſcover what ten months had
conceal'd: That the obſcurity of a Letter
ſhould prove the beſt comment to find out its
meaning, and the darkneſs of the Text give
light to its interpretation: That the Actors
ſhould be apprehended on the Stage, when they
were juſt ready to begin the Tragedy, and all
the danger blown over in a moment: That the
intended Maſſacre ſhould be the means to our
greater ſafety; and the ruine threatned to our
Church ſhould prove its eſtabliſhment. Theſe
are all undeniably ſuch effects, as carry on 'em
the <hi>Signacula Dei,</hi> the print of Gods finger, the
legible characters of infinite Wiſdom, and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence.
So that we may boldly appeal with
<hi>David</hi> to all that ſee it; <hi>O come hither and behold
the work of God, how wonderful he is in his doing!</hi>
Pſal. 66. 5. And what's that? that ſuch as are
<hi>rebellious are not able to exalt themſelves</hi> [ver. 7.]
but are ſnared in the work of their own hands:
for it was this day done, the ungodly were
caught in their own ſnare, and trapped in the
pit they had digged for others, even without a
figure. They ſaid among themſelves, Come,
and let us make havock of 'em all together, by
undermining 'em in that very place where they
have made ſuch Laws againſt us. They ſought
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49111:10"/>
deep to hide their counſel, and their works
were in the dark; and they ſaid, Who ſeeth it?
and who knoweth it? They took an Oath of
Secreſie, nay they received the Sacrament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it: Bleſſed Lord! that thy moſt Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
ſhould be thus prophaned; that men
ſhould call upon thy Name, while they delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
blaſpheme thine Honour! The Seal of
Confeſſion muſt not be violated to ſave the King
and Kingdom; but the Seal of our Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
is made the Bond of Iniquity without
any ſcruple: Such is the Piety of thoſe who
make Religion a cloak for Treaſon, and turn
Rebels out of Conſcience! They ſtuck (you ſee)
at nothing to lodge the Secret ſafe; but God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
their prophaneneſs by infatuating their
Counſels: He darts a ſcruple into one of their
minds <hi>[Leſt the righteous ſhould periſh with the
wicked]</hi> and makes his own Conſcience tell him
more than ſeven Confeſſors: He reveals the
Treachery by the hand of a Confident, and
makes the miſchief betray it ſelf, that he might
protect the Innocent, and make himſelf known
by the execution of his Judgments upon the
wicked, eſpecially on ſuch as delight in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Blood, and ſo horribly diſhonour Chriſt
as to call it <hi>His Religion.</hi> So the Plot was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49111:10"/>
and the crafty confounded, whereby
it is evident, it was <hi>Gods own doing.</hi> That's the
firſt general, the <hi>work of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. But when God makes bare his arm, and
ſtretcheth out his hand to work wonders, ſure
the world muſt be awakned into an obſervance
of them; and that's next to be conſidered:</p>
            <p>Its Effect upon men in general: and here's a
threefold Effect mention'd. 1. All men ſhall
fear. 2. Shall declare the work of God. 3. Shall
wiſely conſider of his <hi>doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The firſt effect is Fear, which naturally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes
in mens minds upon the apprehenſions of
Gods irreſiſtible power and greatneſs; For who
has an arm like God? or who can thunder with
a voice like him? yea, who can hear his voice
and not tremble? or ſee his hand ſtretched out
and not be afraid? <hi>Thou didſt cauſe thy judgment to
be heard from heaven; the earth trembled and was ſtill;</hi>
Pſal. 76. 8. <hi>Thou, even thou art to be feared; and
who may ſtand in thy ſight when once thou art angry?</hi>
[ver. 7.] And as the apprehenſions of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Majeſty ſtrike dread and terror into men,
ſo the wonders of his Providence, eſpecially the
eminent deliverances of his people, and the
confuſion of their enemies, muſt needs beget an
awful reverence of that Omnipotence, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49111:11"/>
alone doth wonders, and bringeth mighty things
to paſs. And all men that ſee ſuch things ſhall
fear, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhall tremble before his Power and
Providence, who by ſuch events makes it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
that he interpoſes his Wiſdom in the moſt
ſecret counſels of men, and over-rules all their
malicious contrivances, to the ends of his own
Counſel, and the deſigns of his Goodneſs. As
<hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to his Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 20. <hi>As for
you, ye thought evil againſt me, but God meant it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
good; to bring to paſs, as it is this day, to ſave
much people alive. And all men ſhall fear,</hi> i. e. ſhall
be afraid to conſpire againſt them, whoſe cauſe
God himſelf ſo miraculouſly owns and abets;
and ſhall be convinc'd, that the care of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
is with the moſt high; that with his right
hand he covers them, and with his arm he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects
'em. <hi>And all men ſhall fear,</hi> i. e. ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to do any more ſo wickedly, and ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from the tents of ſuch ungodly murmurers,
left they be conſumed in their ſins. <hi>And all men
ſhall fear,</hi> i. e. ſhall fear God and the King too,
whoſe Miniſter he is, in whoſe name and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
he acts; and into whoſe heart God was
pleaſed to put the firſt diſcovery of this days
happy deliverance, and to make him the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Peoples Preſervation, that they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49111:11"/>
might know him to be Gods viſible Deputy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth, and might fear before him; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the wiſe-mans advice, <hi>My ſon, fear God
and the King, and meddle not with them that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to change.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All men ſhall fear,</hi> but fear alone will not
profit us; for the Devils tremble before the
power they hate, and wicked men may dread
Gods vengeance, where they are unwilling to
ſee his hand: and therefore here follows another
effect, which ſuch ſignal actions have upon
men:</p>
            <p>2. <hi>They ſhall declare the work of the Lord.</hi> And
this is an effect as general and large as the other,
though upon different accounts; for even they
who are unwilling to own it, ſhall be forc'd to
acknowledge it, and they for whoſe ſake it is
done ſhall rejoyce to publiſh it. When God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued
his people from <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Pſalmiſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
that even the Heathen took notice of
their wonderful deliverance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. 2. <hi>Then
ſaid they among the heathen, the Lord hath done great
things for them:</hi> And if Strangers that have only
heard of ours, ſhall talk of Gods providence
over us, ſurely we that reap the benefits of his
goodneſs, ſhould ſing forth the honour of his
name, and make his praiſe to be glorious: If
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49111:12"/>
it was wonderful in their eyes, we were the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthieſt
perſons in the world, if it ſhould not
be ſo in ours too. And truly they deſerve not to
ſhare in ſo great a bleſſing, who neglect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
this work of the Lord, who refuſe to pay
him the honour due unto his name for the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
deliverances vouchſafed to our Land and
Nation. 'Tis no leſs than brutiſh ſtupidity that
makes men regardleſs of theſe wonders of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
which he that rightly conſiders, will
find reaſon enough moſt ſolemnly to admire and
adore; which is the third effect.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>They ſhall wiſely conſider of his doings.</hi> That
is, they ſhall better underſtand the method of
Gods proceedings, and the reaſons of his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in the world: for theſe things make it plain,
that God takes care of the affairs of his people,
and that the enemies of his Church, (enemies I
ſay in their minds, though the Church be ſtill in
their mouths, while they continue their wicked
works) with all their crafty devices, with all
their ſpite and malice, and the gates of Hell to
help them, ſhall not be able to prevail againſt
her. And theſe ſudden defeats, and remarkable
diſappointments of ſuch treaſonable deſigns, are
evidence ſufficient that they are hateful to God,
who is the governour of the world, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49111:12"/>
for his own Vicegerents; That venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
belongs to him, and he will ſurely repay
it for ſuch ſins. <hi>Whoſo is wiſe,</hi> ſays <hi>David</hi> [Pſal.
107. 43.] <hi>will obſerve theſe things, and they ſhall
underſtand the loving kindneſs of the Lord:</hi> And 'tis
the wiſe-mans obſervation in the like caſe <hi>[Prov.</hi>
24. 22.] having told us of thoſe that are given
to change, that their calamity ſhall riſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
and who knoweth the ruine of them
both? He immediately ſubjoyns, <hi>Theſe things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
belong unto the wiſe,</hi> [ver. 27.] that is, theſe
things are matter of weighty conſideration, and
thereby we may learn by experience, that God
for the better government of the world thinks it
fit, to make Rebels and Traytors the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
examples of Vengeance and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Search the Scriptures, and turn over
the Annals of all Ages, you ſhall ſcarce meet
in ſtory with a ſeditious Innovator or a Rebel,
who has not ruin'd himſelf: Deſtruction treads
cloſe upon their heels, and puniſhment will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
come from God; for <hi>they that reſiſt ſhall
receive to themſelves damnation,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, [Rom.</hi>
13. 2.] They <hi>ſhall utterly periſh in their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi>
ſays St. <hi>Peter,</hi> [2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12.] <hi>Their
judgment lingereth not, and their damnation ſlumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not,</hi> [ver. 3.] Not one of the mutinous ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49111:13"/>
among the Iſraelites came into the Land
of Promiſe, becauſe they rebelled againſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and in them againſt God. And
that all the earth may ſtand in awe of him, and
the Governours he hath appointed, God opened
the bowels of the earth, and ſhe ſwallowed up
<hi>Corah,</hi> and covered the congregation of <hi>Abiram;
They went down alive into the gulf, with their wives,
and their ſons, and their little children,</hi> Numb. 16.
27. And that we might perceive it to be Gods
own immediate <hi>work,</hi> we find <hi>Moſes</hi> putting it
upon this iſſue, [ver. 29.] <hi>If theſe men die the
common death of all men, then the Lord hath not
ſent me;</hi> then let me have no authority among
you: <hi>But if the Lord make a new thing,</hi> or create
a new creature (as the phraſe imports) ſuch a
thing as ye never ſaw, nor was ever heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<hi>If the earth open her mouth, and they go down
quick into the pit;</hi> what then? why, <hi>Then ſhall ye
underſtand that theſe men have provoked the Lord,</hi>
ver. 30. then ſhall ye know that 'tis his doing.
Beware of the way of <hi>Corah,</hi> leſt ye periſh in the
gain-ſaying of <hi>Corah:</hi> God hates the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which are the cauſe of Rebellion, and will
never let the practices go unpuniſhed. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we tremble at the vengeance, let us dread
the crimes, and ſo wiſely conſider of Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49111:13"/>
as to deteſt the ſins for which others have
been ſo notably puniſh'd. But there is ſomething
more yet to be done, as the proper work of the
day; and that is,</p>
            <p>III. A duty reſulting from all theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and chiefly incumbent on good men:
and that (as the other) is three-fold. 1. Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in the Lord. 2. Truſting in him. 3. Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and triumph. <hi>The righteous ſhall,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The righteous ſhall be glad in the Lord.</hi> A du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
no leſs eaſie than pleaſant, and that which we
all ſeem to covet and deſire moſt; that which
we eagerly purſue as the beſt of this worlds ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions,
joy and rejoycing: There is no ſuch
gladneſs of heart, as that which a good man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
in the contemplation of Gods goodneſs:
And ſure we need no invitations to what we are
all ſo naturally inclin'd: God himſelf requires
it, the deliverance of the Day, and the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
of a later date call for it: <hi>Rejoyce in the
Lord, O ye righteous, and again I ſay, rejoyce;
for the voice of praiſe is comely, and it beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
well the juſt to be thankful.</hi> And ſeeing
God requires a ſign, and ſome outward teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of your joy and thanks, let me beſpeak your
Charity to the Poor, in thoſe emphatical words
of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> [8. 10.] <hi>Go your way, eat the fat,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49111:14"/>
and drink the ſweet, and ſend portions unto them
for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto
our Lord; neither be you ſorry, for the joy of the Lord
is your ſtrength.</hi> God who frankly beſtows his
bleſſings, loves a chearful return of what he
gives; and ſince our goodneſs extends not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, but to the Saints that are in the earth, he
has left the Poor among us as his ſtanding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
by his own Patent, <hi>The poor ye ſhall have
always with you,</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>and whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ye will ye may do them good,</hi> [Mark 14. 7.]
Do it therefore at this time above all, and make
them partakers of your fulneſs and joyfulneſs:
for then we glorifie his name, when we joy in
his ſalvation, and are glad to do good to others,
as God hath done unto us; when the voice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
is heard in the Tabernacles of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and the tokens of our joy are ſent to the
poor and needy. And that our joy may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
let us temper it with Faith, and add the
next degree of our Duty:</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The righteous ſhall truſt in him.</hi> And good
reaſon indeed to truſt in him, of whoſe favour
and loving kindneſs we have had ſo large expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience;
well may we rely on that power which
is ſo able to protect us; well may we depend on
that providence, which ſo remarkably takes care
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49111:14"/>
of us. And herein lies the difference of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
that ſuch works of God have upon the
righteous and the wicked; that the one are ſtruck
with horror from the apprehenſions of his power
and providence, and confounded with the ſenſe
of their own guilt; whilſt good men glory in
the demonſtrations of Gods power, and make
all his Diſpenſations an argument of a more
chearful dependance on him. 'Tis this that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
the ſpirits of good men, under all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and diſtractions of the world, and keeps 'em
from deſpondence with fear of future evils, and
apprehenſions of miſchief and diſturbances,
when they call to mind the deliverances of paſt
times, and Gods manifold appearances in the
cauſe of his Church and People.</p>
            <p>And what if a cloud appear, or the ſtorms
ariſe? if we build our confidence on <hi>the rock of
ages,</hi> we have a ſhelter againſt the Tempeſts, a
ſtrong conſolation and <hi>a good hope, as an anchor
of our ſouls, both ſure and ſtedfaſt:</hi> And what if
the <hi>ſame</hi> danger threaten us, and the ſtorms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
from the <hi>ſame</hi> quarter? we have ſtill the
<hi>ſame</hi> God to flee unto, who hath manifeſted his
care of our Church by a continued ſeries of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
and Mercies. Though the unquiet ſpirits
of the world, and the powers of darkneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49111:15"/>
againſt us, yet if we hold us faſt by God, he
will never leave us nor forſake us; if we adhere
conſtantly unto him, his Faithfulneſs and Truth
will be our Shield and Buckler; and while we
are under the defence of the Almighty, we ſhall
not be greatly moved. This was <hi>David</hi>'s confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
whoſe deliverances always equal'd his
dangers, and from his own experience he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth
others to depend upon God, [Pſalm
62. 6, 7.] <hi>He only is my rock and my ſalvation; he is
my defence, I ſhall not be moved: In God is my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and my glory; the rock of my ſtrength, and my
refuge is in God:</hi> And then immediately it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
ver. 8. <hi>Truſt in him at all times, O ye peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge
for us. Selah.</hi> The times and ſeaſons to come are
in the hand of God alone, and we know not
what a day, much leſs what a year may bring
forth, though we cannot but know what our
ſins have deſerv'd if God ſhould enter into
judgment with us; yet even this is matter of
great rejoycing, that we are ſtill aſſembled to
give him thanks in the great Congregation, and
to praiſe him among the Heads of the people,
And this too is an encouragement to rely
on the ſame infinite Power and Goodneſs for
the continuance of our ſafety, That the next
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49111:15"/>
year ſhall be as this, and much more abundant;
That God will ſettle and root us faſter by ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
us a little; That he will perfect his own
work by a full detection and final defeat of all
our implacable enemies. And in this humble
confidence and aſſurance of his favour we tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
and glory: Which is the laſt branch of
our Duty.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>All the upright in heart ſhall glory:</hi> They
ſhall glory in his ſtrength, and triumph in his
favour. But that's not all; they ſhall glory in
the confuſion of the wicked, and rejoyce in the
continual diſappointment of ſuch treacherous
deſigns: And they that do not rejoyce and glory
in ſuch Diſcoveries and Deliverances are none of
the upright in heart; for they defraud God of his
due, and deny him the honour of his own <hi>work;</hi>
and they give us reaſon to ſuſpect, that they wiſh
the Treaſon had been acted. They that refuſe to
give thanks for the Deliverance, want only an
opportunity to contrive the like miſchief, and
put the Deſign in execution. But let us (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you) as men <hi>upright in heart,</hi> with all our
Souls, yea with heart and voice, offer up our
Thankſgivings to the God of our mercies, and
confeſs his Name, and glory in his Strength, and
triumph in his Goodneſs: As we are ſenſible to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49111:16"/>
whom we owe our ſafety, let us keep the Feaſt
with joyful and thankful hearts, making it (like
the Feaſt of the Paſſover) a day to be much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
throughout all our Generations; let us
all, as friends to <hi>Sion,</hi> the Church we wiſh well
to, give thanks to the preſerver of our <hi>Sion;</hi> as
Subjects of a Kingdom, whoſe peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
we pray for, let us bleſs the God of our
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> the mighty defender of our Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have heard with our ears, and our Fathers have
declared unto us, the noble works which God did in their
days, and in the time before them.</hi> How he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
our Nation from the Tyranny of the Pope,
the Uſurpations of his Sea, the Treaſons of his
Emiſſaries, and from the Idolatry, Superſtition
and Cruelty of his Religion (I call it His, for
Popery is no more like Chriſts Religion, than a
Wolf is like a Lamb.) How ſoon he extinguiſh'd
the fire of the <hi>Marian</hi> Perſecution; and in the
years next enſuing, gave us <hi>Beauty for Aſhes,</hi> even
ten for one: How he put to flight the Forces of
the Aliens, and diſplay'd his wonders in the
deep in 88: and how he delivered both our
Church and State as on this Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as we have heard, ſo have we ſeen,</hi> how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly
he diſpell'd that diſmal Cloud which
covered us, by bowing the hearts of all-the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49111:16"/>
as the heart of one man, to bring back the
King to his own Throne: How he made Him
among the Princes of the earth, <hi>the Firſt-born</hi>
(as it were) <hi>from the dead;</hi> How his Hand hath
held him faſt in the midſt of manifold dangers;
and by Gods protection of Him, we alſo are
protected in the quiet enjoyment of our Lives,
Liberties, Fortunes, and Laws, and in the free and
open Profeſſion of Chriſts true Religion. Oh! let
us walk worthy of theſe reiterated Deliverances,
and live as becometh a Reformed and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
People. Let not our Heats and Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on one hand, nor our Looſeneſs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs
on the other, give occaſion to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to triumph over us, leſt they ſay in their
hearts, <hi>There, there, ſo would we have it;</hi> leſt we
ruine our ſelves in a more effectual manner, than
all the Papal Conſpirators in Europe can deviſe.
But let us manifeſt our thankfulneſs to God, by
living piouſly and peaceably in the ſtedfaſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of his holy Goſpel, and in hearty Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Fidelity to our King; whoſe ſtrength and
ſecurity, next under Providence, does princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
depend on the Hearts and Affections of
his Subjects, on the Counſels and Aſſiſtance of his
Parliament: So ſhall we beſt ſecure our ſelves,
conſulting at once our Duty and our Intereſt;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49111:17"/>
ſo with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> may we hope in God, <hi>who hath
delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver,
in whom we truſt that he will evermore deliver us,</hi>
[2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10.]</p>
            <p>From all Sedition, privy Conſpiracy, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;
from all falſe Doctrine, Hereſie and

good Lord deliver us, through Jeſus Chriſt
our Saviour and mighty Deliverer.</p>
            <p>To whom, with thee, and thy Holy Spirit,
