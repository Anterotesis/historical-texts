            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

there is confuſion, and every evil work.] Look on thoſe Aſſemblies, where the people profeſſing the fear of God, are of one heart and mind, and walk together in Love and holy Order, and people give due honour and obedience to their faithfull Guides; and compare them with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations where profeſſors are ſelf-conceited, unruly, proud, and addicted to oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of themſelves, and to diviſions; and ſee which is likeſt to the Primitive pattern, and in which it is that the power of godlineſs proſpereth beſt, and the beauty of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moſt appears, and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans walk as Chriſtians indeed.

[I beſeech you therefore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions among you, but that you be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgement, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10.] The God of patience and conſolation grant you to be

our joy, that ye may be like minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, of one mind: Let nothing be done through ſtrife or vain glory, but in lowlineſs of mind, let each eſteem other better then themſelves. Look not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man on his own things, (his own gifts and graces) but every man alſo on the things (the graces and gifts) of others; Let this mind be in you which was in Chriſt Jeſus; who being in the form of God, thought it not robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be equall with God; but made himſelf of no reputation (or, emptied himſelf of all worldly glory: as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2, 3, 4. as if he had had no form or comelineſs, and no beauty to

As long as they build their faith and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation on the ſuppoſition that the eyes, and taſte, and feeling of all the ſound men in the world, are deceived in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread and Wine; and as long as they deny the certain experience of true believers (telling us that we are void of Charity and unjuſtified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not of their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61147:9"/>
Church,) and as long as they fly from the judgement and Tradition of the ancient and the preſent Church (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs their ſmall part may be taken for the whole, or the major Vote,) and as long as they reject our appeal to the holy Scriptures, I know not well what we can say to them, which we can expect they ſhould regard, any more then muſick is regarded by the deaf, or light by the blind, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument by the diſtracted. If they had the moderation and charity impartially to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe our writings, I durſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently promiſe the recovery of multitudes of them, by the three writings which I have already publiſhed, and

            <p n="5">5. It is the fifth ſort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I ſhall chiefly addreſs my ſpeech to; who, I fear, are not the ſmalleſt part. It is an aſtoniſhing conſideration to men that are awake, to obſerve the unreaſonableneſs and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of the ignorant, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſenſual part of men; How little they Love or Fear the God, whom their tongues confeſs; How little they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61147:10"/>
or mind, or ſeek the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory, which they take on them to believe; How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they fear and ſhun thoſe flames which muſt feed for ever on the impenitent and unholy; How little they care or labour for their immortall ſouls, as if they were of the Religion of their beaſts: How bitterly many of them hate the holy wayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Lord: while yet they pretend to be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves his Servants, and to take the Scriptures to be his word: How ſottiſhly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly they neglect and ſlight the Holineſs without which there is no ſalvation; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. How eagerly they deſire and ſeek the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61147:11"/>
of their fleſh, and the matters of this tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory life, while they call them <hi>vanity and vexation</hi>; How madly they will fall out with their own ſalvation, and from the errors and ſins of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites or others, will pick quarrels againſt the Doctrine, and Ordinances, and wayes of God; as if other mens faults ſhould be exceeded by you, while you pretend to loath them. If it be a ſin to crack our faith by ſome particular error, what is it to daſh it all to pieces? If it be odious in your eyes, to deny ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Ordinance of God, what is it to neglect or prophane them all? If it be their ſin that quarrel in the way to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61147:11"/>
heaven, and walk not in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as love requireth them; what is it in you to run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hell, and turn your backs on the holy Laws and wayes of God? If it be ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable to the Nation and themſelves, that ſo many have faln into ſchiſm and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; what is it then that ſo many are ungodly, ſenſual and worldly, and have no true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at all, in ſincerity, life and power? Ungodlineſs is all Hereſie tranſcendently in the lump, and that in practice. A man that is ſo fooliſh as to plead that Arſenick is better then bread, may yet live him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf if he do not take it: but ſo cannot he that eateth it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of bread. Hereticks
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61147:12"/>
only in ſpeculation may be ſaved: but practicall hereticks cannot. You think it haynous to deny with the mouth that there is a God, who made us, and is our only Lord and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs (and ſo it is.) And is it not haynous then to deny him with the heart and life; and to deny him the love and obedience that is properly due to God? It is odious Idolatry to bow to a creature as to God; and is it not odious to love, and honour, and obey a creature before him, and to ſeek it more eagerly, and mind it more ſeriouſly then God? If it be damnable Infidelity to deny Chriſt to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, it is not much leſs to turn away from him, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61147:12"/>
make light of him and refuſe his grace, while you ſeem to honour him. If it be damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blaſphemy to deny the Holy Ghoſt; what is it to reſiſt and refuſe him when he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He ſeeth you befooled in your ſecurity, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly paſſing on towards Hell, and cannot help it: He ſees you poſting to your miſery, where you will be out of the reach of all our exhortations, and where mercy will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you to be accepted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: and though he ſee you almoſt paſt remedy he cannot help you. He knoweth not when he ſpeaks to you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever he ſhall ſpeak unto you more, and whether ever you ſhall have another call
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61147:14"/>
and offer; and therefore he would fain ſpeak effectually if he could; but it is not in his power. He knows that the matter ſticks all at your own wills, and that if he could but procure your own conſent, to the moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and neceſſary buſineſs in the world, the work were done, and you might ſcape the everlaſting flames: And yet this is it that he cannot procure! O wonderfull, that any man ſhould be damned; yea that many men, and moſt men ſhould be damned, when they might be ſaved if they would, and will not! Yea that no ſaying will ſerve to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their conſent, and make them willing! That we muſt look on our poor miſerable
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61147:14"/>
neighbours in Hell, and ſay, they might have been ſaved once, but would not! they had time, and leave to turn to God, and to be holy and happy as well as others, but we could never prevail with them to conſent, and know the day of their viſitation! O what ſhould we do for the ſaving of careleſs, ſenſeleſs ſouls? Muſt we let them go? Is there no remedy? Shall Miniſters ſtudy to meet with their neceſſities, and tell them with all poſſible plainneſs and compaſſion, of the evil that is a little before them, and teach them how they may eſcape it? Why, this they do from day to day, and ſome will not hear them, but are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61147:15"/>
tipling, or idling or making a jeaſt of the Preacher at home, and others are hearing with prejudice and contempt, and moſt are hardned into a ſenſeleſs deadneſs, and all ſeems to them but as an empty ſound: and they are ſo uſed to hear of Heaven and Hell, that they make as light of them as it there were no ſuch States! Alas, that while millions are weeping &amp; wailing in utter deſperation, for the neglecting of their day of grace, and turning away from him that called them, our poor hearers at the ſame time ſhould wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully follow them, when they are told from God what others ſuffer! Alas, that you ſhould be ſleepy and dead under thoſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61147:15"/>
means, that ſhould waken you to prevent eternall death! and that ever you ſhould make merry ſo near damnation, and be ſporting your ſelves with the ſame kind of ſins that others at the ſame hour are tormented for? And is ſuch madneſs as this remedileſs, in people that ſeem as wiſe as others for worldly things! Alas, for any thing that we can do, experience tells us that with the moſt it is remedileſs! Could we remedy it, our poor people ſhould not wilfully run from Chriſt, and lie in the flames of Hell for ever. Could our perſwaſions and entreaties help it, they ſhould not for ever be ſhut out of Heaven, when its offered to them as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61147:16"/>
well as others. We bewail it from our hearts before the Lord, that we can entreat them no more earneſtly, and beg not of them as for our lives to look before them, and hearken to the voice of grace that they may be ſaved. And a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times in ſecret we call our ſelves hard-hearted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull, and unfaithfull, (in too great a meaſure) that ſpeak no more importunately for the ſaving of mens ſouls, when we know not whether we ſhall ever ſpeak to them any more. Is this all that we can ſay or do in ſo terrible a caſe, and in a matter of ſuch weight as mens ſalvation! The Lord forgive our great inſenſibility, and awaken us, that we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61147:16"/>
may be fit to waken others; But yet for all this, with grief we muſt complain, that our people feel not when we feel, and that they are ſenſeleſs or aſleep when we ſpeak to them as ſeriouſly as we can, and that tears and moans do not prevail; but they go home and live as ſtupidly in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is not your ſurlineſs and paſſions that will then ſerve turn to anſwer God.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61147:35"/>
uncovered, and here preſented to your view, the ſight would tell you more effectually then my words do, what an enemy Death is to our <hi>Nature.</hi> When corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath finiſhed its work, you <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>earth</hi> that once was fleſh: you <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>bones</hi>; you <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>skuls</hi>; you <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>holes</hi> where once were brains and eyes and mouth: This change Death makes: And that univerſally and unavoidably. The Prince cannot reſiſt it by his Majeſty: for he hath ſin'd againſt the higheſt Majeſty: The ſtrong cannot reſiſt it by their ſtrength: For it is the Meſſenger of the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. The commanders muſt obey it: The Conquerours muſt be conquered by it. The Rich cannot bribe it. The Learned Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor cannot perſwade it to paſs him by. The skilful Phyſician cannot ſave himſelf from the mortal ſtroak. Neither fields nor gardens,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61147:35"/>
earth or ſea affordeth any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to prevent it. All have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and all muſt die: Duſt we are, and to duſt we muſt return, <hi>Gen</hi> 3.19. And thus ſhould we remain, if the Lord of life ſhould not revive us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And it is not only to the Body, but to the <hi>Soul</hi> alſo that Death is naturally an Enemy. The Soul hath naturally a Love and Inclination to its Body: and therefore it fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſeparation before, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a Reſtauration afterward. Abſtracting Joy and Torment, Heaven and Hell, in our conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the ſtate of <hi>Separation</hi> as ſuch, is a natural evil: even to the humane Soul of Chriſt it was ſo, while his Body remained in the grave: which ſeparated ſtate is the <hi>Hades,</hi> that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> calleth <hi>Hell,</hi> that Chriſt is ſaid to have gone into. And though (the Soul of Chriſt, and) the ſouls of thoſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61147:36"/>
that die in him, do paſs into a far more happy ſtate, then they had in fleſh, yet that is accidentally, from Rewarding Juſtice, and the Bounty of the Lord, and not at all <hi>from</hi> Death as Death: the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as ſuch is ſtill an evil. And therefore the Soul is ſtill deſirous of the Bodies Reſurrection; and knoweth that its felicity will then be greater, when the re-union, and glorification hath perfected the whole man. So that Death as Death is unwelcome to the ſoul it ſelf, though Death as accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gainfull may be deſired.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And to the unpardoned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed ſoul, Death is the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to everlaſting miſery, and in this regard is far more terrible, then in all that hitherto hath been ſpoken. O could the guilty ſoul be ſure that there is no Juſtice to take hold on it after death, and no more pain and ſorrow to be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61147:36"/>
felt, but that man dyeth as a beaſt, that hath no more to feel or loſe, then Death would ſeem a tolerable evil. But its the Living death, the dying life, the endleſs woe, to which death leads the guilty ſoul, that makes it to be unſpeakably terrible. The utter darkneſs, the unquenchable fire, the worm that dyeth not, the everlaſting flames of the wrath of God, theſe are the chief horror and ſting of death, to the ungodly. O were it but to be turned into Trees, or Stones, or earth, or nothing, it were nothing in compariſon of this. But I paſs by this, becauſe it is not (directly) intended in my Text.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Saints themſelves being ſanctified but in part, are but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly aſſured of their Salvation; And therefore in that meaſure as they remain in doubt, or unaſſured, Death may be a double terror to them. They believe the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61147:37"/>
and know more then unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers do, what an unſufferable loſs it is to be deprived of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial glory! and what an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able miſery it is, to bear the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs wrath of God. And therefore ſo far as they have ſuch fears, it muſt needs make death a terror to them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But if there were nothing but <hi>Death it ſelf</hi> to be <hi>our Enemy,</hi> the <hi>foreknowledge</hi> of it would increaſe the miſery. A Beaſt that <hi>knoweth not</hi> that he muſt die, is not tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the fears of death (though nature hath poſſeſſed them with a ſelf-preſerving fear, for the avoiding of an invading e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.) But man <hi>foreknoweth,</hi> that he muſt die: He hath ſtill occaſion to anticipate his terrors: that which <hi>will be,</hi> and <hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>ſhortly will be,</hi> is in a manner as if it <hi>were</hi> already. And therefore <hi>fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> makes us as if we were alway
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61147:37"/>
dying: We ſee our Graves, our weeping Friends, our fore-deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed corruption and diſmal ſtate, and ſo our life is a continual Death. And thus Death is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But this is not all, nor the greateſt <hi>enmity</hi> that Death hath to the godly. It is a lamentable hinderance to the work of Grace, as I ſhall ſhew you next in ten par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>The fears of Death do much abate our Deſires after God, as he is to be enjoyed by the ſeparated ſoul.</hi> Though every believing holy ſoul, do love God above all, and take heaven for his home, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſincerely longeth after it; yet when we know that <hi>Death</hi> ſtands in the way, and that there is no coming thither, but through this dreadfull narrow paſſage, this ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth and lamentably dulleth our deſires: And ſo the <hi>Natural en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61147:38"/>
turneth to a Spiritual ſorer <hi>enmity.</hi> For let a man be never ſo much a <hi>Saint,</hi> he will be ſtill a <hi>Man</hi>; and therefore as Death will ſtill be death, ſo nature will ſtill be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And therefore death as death will be abhorred. And we are ſuch timerous Sluggards, that we are eaſily diſcouraged by this Lyon in the way. The ugly Porter affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us from thoſe grateful thoughts of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> the City of God, the heavenly inheritance, which otherwiſe the bleſſed object would produce. Our ſanctified af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections would be mounting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and holy Love would be working towards its bleſſed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: but Death ſtanding in the way, ſuppreſſeth our deſires, and turns us back, and frighteneth us from our Fathers preſence. We look up to Chriſt and the Holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to a precious Pearl in the bottom of the Sea, or as to a dear
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61147:38"/>
and faithfull Friend, that is beyond ſome dreadfull gulf: Fain we would enjoy him, but we dare not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; we fear this diſmal <hi>enemy</hi> in the way. He that can recover his health by a pleaſant medicine, doth take it without any great reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: But if a leg or an arm muſt be cut off, or a ſtone cut out by a painful dangerous Inciſion, what a ſtriving doth it cauſe between the contrary paſſions? the love of life, and the love of eaſe; the fear of death, and the fear of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p>Could we but come to Heaven as eaſily as innocent <hi>Adam</hi> might have done if he had conquered, what wings would it add to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires? Might we be tranſlated as <hi>Henoch,</hi> or conveyed thither in the Chariot of <hi>Elias,</hi> what Saint is there that would not long to ſee the face and glory of the Lord? Were it but to go to the top of a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61147:39"/>
Mountain, and there ſee Chriſt with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> in a glimpſe of Glory, as did the three Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who would not make haſte, and ſay, <hi>It is good for us to be here,</hi> Matth. 17.1, 4. But to travell ſo chearfully with <hi>Abraham</hi> to the Mount of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>riah,</hi> to ſacrifice an only Son, or with a Martyr to the flames, is a harder task. This is the principal <hi>enmity</hi> of death; it deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth our deſires and thoughts from heaven: and maketh it a far har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der matter to us, to long after God, then otherwiſe it would be: Yea it cauſeth us to fly from him, even when we truly love him: And where Faith and Love do work ſo ſtrongly as to overcome theſe fears, yet do they meet with them as an enemy, and muſt fight before they overcome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as this Enemy dulleth our Deſires, ſo doth it conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cool our Love, as to the exerciſe,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61147:39"/>
and it hindereth our hope, &amp; much abateth the complacency and Joy, that we ſhould have in the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoughts of Heaven: when we ſhould be rejoycing in hope of the glory of God (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2.) the face of death appearing to our thoughts, is naturally an enemy to our joy! When we think of the grave, and of diſſolution and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and of our long abode in the places of darkneſs, of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned duſt and ſcattered bones, this damps our joyfull thoughts of heaven, if ſupernatural grace do not make us Conquerors.</p>
               <p>But if we might paſs from earth to heaven, as from one room to another, what haſte ſhould we make in our deſires? How joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhould we think and ſpeak of Heaven? Then we might live in the joy of the Holy Ghoſt, and eaſily delight our ſelves in God, and Comfort would be our daily food.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61147:40"/>3. Moreover, as our Natural Enemy doth thus occaſion the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of Deſire, and Love, and Joy, ſo alſo of our Thankfulneſs for the Glory that is promiſed us. God would have more praiſe from us, if we had more pleaſing joyfull thoughts of our inheritance. We ſhould magnifie him from day to day, when we remember how we ſhall magnifie him for ever. Our hearts would be turned into thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and our tongues would be extolling our dear Redeemer, &amp; ſounding forth his praiſe whom we muſt praiſe for ever, if dreadful Death did not draw a veil, to hide the heavenly glory from us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And thus the diſmall face of Death, doth hinder the heavenli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Converſation. Our <hi>Thoughts</hi> will be diverted, when our complacency and deſire is aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Our minds will be willinger to grow ſtrange to Heaven, when
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61147:40"/>
Death ſtill mingleth terror in our meditations: Whereas if we could have come to God in the way that was firſt appointed us, and could be cloathed with glory, without being ſtript of our preſent cloathing, by this terrible hand, how familiarly ſhould we then converſe above? How readily would our Thoughts run out to Chriſt? meditation of that Glory would not be then ſo hard a work: Our hearts would not be ſo backward to it, as now they are.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Faith</hi> is much hindered, and <hi>Infidelity</hi> much advantaged by Death: Look either to the ſtate of <hi>ſoul</hi> or <hi>body,</hi> and you will eaſily perceive the truth of this. The ſtate of a <hi>Soul</hi> incorporated, we know, by long experience: what kind of apprehenſions, volitions, and affections belong to a ſoul while it acteth in the Body, we feel or underſtand: But what manner of <hi>knowledg, will</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> what Joy,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61147:41"/>
what ſorrow, belong to ſouls that are ſeparated from the Bodies, it is not poſſible for us now diſtinctly and formally to conceive. And when men find themſelves at a loſs about the <hi>manner,</hi> they are tempted to doubt of the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf. The ſwarms of irreligious Infidels, that have denied the Immortality and ſeparated exiſtence of the ſoul, are too full a proof of this: And good men have been haunted with this horrible temptation. Had there been no death, we had not been liable to this dangerous aſſault. The opinion of the ſleeping of the ſoul, till the Reſurrection, is but a ſtep to flat Infidelity; and both of them hence receive their Life, becauſe a ſoul in fleſh, when it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to its ſatisfaction, of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtate, or action of a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſoul, is the eaſier drawn to queſtion or deny it.</p>
               <p>And in regard of the Body the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61147:41"/>
difficulty and tryal is as great: That a corps reſolved into duſt; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps firſt devoured by ſome other body, and turned into its ſubſtance, ſhould be reunited to its ſoul, and ſo become a glorified body, is a point not eaſie for unſanctified na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to believe. When <hi>Paul</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of the Reſurrection, to the learned <hi>Athenians,</hi> ſome mocked, and others turn'd off that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.32. It is no ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to believe the Reſurrection of the Body, then the Immortality or ſeparated Exiſtence of the Soul. Moſt of the world, even Heathens and Infidels do confeſs the later, but few of them comparatively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the former. And if ſin had not let in Death upon our Nature, this perillous difficulty had been prevented: Then we ſhould not have bin puzzled with the thoughts of either a corrupted Body, or a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated Soul.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61147:42"/>6. And conſequently by all this already mentioned, our <hi>Endeavors</hi> meet with a great impediment. If <hi>Death</hi> weaken <hi>Faith,</hi> Deſire, and Hope, it muſt needs dull our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors.</hi> The deterred, diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſoul moves ſlowly in the way of life: Whereas if <hi>Death</hi> were not in our way, how chearfully ſhould we run towards Heaven? Our thoughts of it would be ſtill ſweet, and theſe would be a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Spring to action? When the <hi>Will</hi> goes with full Sails, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded faculty will the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow. We ſhould long ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to be in Heaven, if Death were not in the way, that nothing could eaſily ſtop us in our courſe? How earneſtly ſhould we pray?

The Believing Saints on earth perceive it, and therefore ſee that their bonds are broken,

and that to the <hi>righteous there is hope in death</hi>; and that our Head being actually riſen, aſſureth us that we ſhall alſo Riſe. <hi>For if we believe that Jeſus dyed and Roſe again; even ſo them alſo which ſteep in Jeſus, will God bring with him,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.14. <hi>And as Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dyeth no more, death hath no more dominion over him</hi>: So ſhall we Riſe and die no more.

That believers ſhall certainly Riſe, when their Head and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is Riſen, to prepare them an everlaſting Kingdom, and to aſſure them, that thus he will Raiſe them at the laſt.

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:61147:51"/>
(and therefore not worthy to be looked at) <hi>but the things that are not ſeen are eternal,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more prevalent with a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul, then either the enticing pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, or the light and ſhort afflictions, or the death that ſtandeth in our way, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16, 17, 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26.</p>

A ſecond Antidote againſt the Enmity of Death, that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us at the time of our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is, <hi>The Pardon of our ſins, and Juſtification of our perſons, by the blood and merits of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When once we are <hi>forgiven,</hi> we are out of the reach of the <hi>greateſt</hi> terror, being ſaved from the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death</hi>; Though we muſt feel the <hi>killing</hi> ſtroke, we are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>damning</hi> ſtroke.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61147:52"/>
by taking us from the preſence of our mortal friends: It ſhall help us into <hi>Eternity,</hi> by cutting off our <hi>Time.</hi> For in the hour that we were juſtified, and made the <hi>Adopted ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As Death was promoting the Life of the world, when it was killing the Lord of Life himſelf: So is it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening the deliverance of <hi>believers,</hi> when it ſeems to be undoing them. No wonder if Death be that mans terror, that muſt be conveyed by it into Hell, or that imagineth that he ſhall periſh as the beaſt: But to him that knows it will be his paſſage into Reſt, and that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſhall convey his Soul to Chriſt, what an Antidote is there ready for his faith to uſe againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and exceſs of fears? Hence
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61147:52"/>
faith proceedeth in its triumph, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56, 57. <hi>The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law: But thanks be to God that giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let him inordinately fear death, that is loth to be with Chriſt, or that is yet the heir of death eternall: Let him fear that is yet in the bondage of his ſin, and in the power of the prince of darkneſs, and is not by Juſtification delivered from the curſe: But joy and holy triumph are more ſeemly for the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Antidote againſt the Enmity of death, is the <hi>Holineſs of the ſoul</hi>: By <hi>this</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> is <hi>mortified</hi>; and therefore the fears of death cannot actuate and uſe it, as in others they may do: By this the Intereſt of the fleſh is caſt aſide as nothing, and the fleſh it ſelf is crucified with Chriſt: and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61147:53"/>
therefore the deſtruction of the fleſh will ſeem the more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the fears of it will be a leſs temptation to the Soul. By this we are already <hi>crucified to the world, and the world to us</hi>: and therefore we can more eaſily leave the world: <hi>We now live</hi> by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life then we did before; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>dead</hi> in our ſelves, <hi>our life is hid with Chriſt in God</hi>; and being <hi>crucified with Chriſt, we now ſo Live, as that it is not we, but Chriſt Liveth in us: the life which we Live in the fleſh is by the faith of the Son of God that hath loved us,</hi> Gal. 2.20. The things that made this life too dear to us, are now as it were annihilated to us; and when we ſee they are <hi>Nothing,</hi> they can <hi>do nothing</hi> with us. Sanctification alſo maketh us ſo weary of ſin, as being our hated enemy, that we are the more willing to die, that <hi>it</hi> may die that cauſeth us to die.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61147:53"/>
And eſpecially, the Holy Ghoſt, which we then receive, is in us a Divine and heavenly Nature, and ſo inclineth us to God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This Nature principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the ſuperlative Love of God. And Love carryeth out the ſoul to the beloved. As the Nature of a priſoner in a dungeon carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to deſire Liberty and light; ſo the Nature of a holy Soul in fleſh, inclineth it to deſire to be with Chriſt. As Love maketh huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife, and deareſt friends to think the time long while they are aſunder; ſo doth the Love of the Soul to God. How fain would the holy loving Soul behold the pleaſed face of God, and be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the beholding of his glory, and live under the fulleſt influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Love! This is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over the Enmity of death. As ſtrong as Death is, Love is ſtronger, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.6, 7. <hi>Love is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61147:54"/>
ſtrong as death — the coales thereof are coales of fire, a moſt vehement flame</hi> (which will not by the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble face of death be hindered from aſcending up to God.) <hi>Many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cannot quench Love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for Love</hi> (that is, to bribe it and divert it from its object) <hi>it would utterly be contemned.</hi> If the Love of <hi>David</hi> could carry <hi>Jonathan</hi> to hazzard his life and deny a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for him, and the Love of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to <hi>Abſalom</hi> made him wiſh that he <hi>had dyed for him,</hi> and the Love of friends, (yea luſtfull love) hath carryed many to caſt away their lives; no wonder if the Love of God in his Saints prevail againſt the fear of death. The power of holy Love made <hi>Moſes</hi> ſay, <hi>Elſe let my name be blotted out of the book of life.</hi> And it made <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, that <hi>he could wiſh that he were

               <p n="4">4. A fourth Antidote that is given us by Chriſt, againſt the Enmity of Death, is the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as he is the <hi>Comforter</hi> of the Saints. He made it his work to corroborate and confirm them: As ſin hath woven calamities into our lives, and filled us with troubles, and griefs, and fears; ſo Chriſt doth ſend his ſpirit to undo theſe works of Satan, and to be a <hi>Comforter</hi> as well as a <hi>Sanctifier</hi> to his members. As the <hi>Sanctifying</hi> Spirit ſtriveth againſt the <hi>enticing ſinfull</hi> fleſh, ſo the <hi>Comforting</hi> Spirit ſtriveth againſt the <hi>troubling</hi> fleſh; as alſo againſt the <hi>perſecuting,</hi> as well as the <hi>tempting</hi> world, and the <hi>vexing</hi> as well as the <hi>tempting</hi> Devil. <hi>And greater is he that is in us, then he

that is in the world,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.4. The Spirit of Chriſt overcomes the <hi>diſquieting</hi> as well as the <hi>tempting</hi> Spirit: But with ſome difference; becauſe our <hi>comforts</hi> are not in this life ſo neceſſary to us as <hi>our Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>: Joy being part of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is not to be expected cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly or conſtantly, in any high degree, till we come to the ſtate of our Reward: And therefore though the Holy Ghoſt will carry on the work of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, conſtantly and certainly in the Elect; yet in many of them his <hi>Comforting</hi> work is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and interrupted: And yet he is a Conquerour here. For his works muſt be judged of in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their ends: And our <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> on <hi>earth</hi> is given us for our encouragement in holy wayes, that we be not ſtopt or diverted by the fear of enemies; and alſo to help on ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So that when Death and the Grave appear before, and our <hi>fleſh</hi> is terrified with the ſight of theſe <hi>Anakims,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>[We are not able to overcome them]</hi> and ſo brings up an evil report upon the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Land, and caſts us ſometime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to murmuring, lamentation and weakning-diſcouragements, yet doth the Holy Ghoſt cauſe <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> (as <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi>) to <hi>ſtill</hi> the ſoul, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 13.) and cauſeth us to contemn theſe Gyants, and ſay <hi>[Let us go up and

The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting Spirit ſheweth us <hi>his</hi> death that conquered death, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15.) even the Croſs on which he triumphed openly, when he ſeemed to be conquered, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. He ſheweth us the glorious Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Head, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of our own Reſurrection: He ſheweth us our glorified Lord, to whom we may boldly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently commend our departing ſouls, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59. And he ſheweth us the Angels that are ready to be their Convoy: And he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all theſe Conſiderations effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and inwardly exciteth our Love and heavenly deſires, and giveth us a triumphing Courage and Conſolation: So that <hi>Death</hi> doth not encounter us alone, and in our own ſtrength, but finds us armed and led on by the Lord of life, who helps us by a ſling and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61147:57"/>
ſtone to conquer this <hi>Goliah.</hi> If a draught of Wine, or ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritfull reviving liquor can take off fears and make men bold; what then may the Spirit of Chriſt do by his powerfull encouragements and comforts on the ſoul? Did we but ſee Chriſt or an Angel ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by our ſick-beds, and ſaying <hi>[Fear not: I will convey thy ſoul to God: this day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.]</hi> What an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able comfort would this be to a dying man? Why, the Spirit is Chriſts Agent here on earth: and what the Spirit ſpeaks, Chriſt ſpeaks: And therefore we may take its comforting words, as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us by Chriſt himſelf; who ſpoke the like to the penitent Thief, to ſhew believers the virtue of his Croſs, and what they alſo may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him in their extremity. And our Phiſitian is moſt wiſe, and keeps his Cordials for a fainting
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61147:57"/>
time: The Spirit uſeth to ſuſtain and comfort us moſt, in our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt neceſſities. We need not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts againſt death, ſo much in the time of proſperity and health, as when Death draws near. In health we have ordinarily more need of quickning then of comforting: and more need to be awakened from ſecurity to a due preparation for death, then to be freed from the terrible fore-thoughts of it: though inordinate fears of Death be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to us, ſecurity and deadneſs hurt us more. And therefore the ſpirit worketh according to our neceſſities: And when Death is neereſt, and like to be moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, he uſually giveth the livelieſt ſenſe of the Joyes beyond it, to abate the enmity, and encourage the departing ſoul. And if the comfort be but ſmall, it is precious, becauſe it is moſt <hi>pure,</hi> as being then mixed with no carnal joyes;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61147:58"/>
and becauſe it is moſt <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> in ſo great a ſtrait. If we have no more but <hi>meer ſupport,</hi> it will be yet a pretious mercy. And thus I have done with the third degree of the deſtruction of Deaths Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by theſe four Antidotes, which we receive at our Converſion, and the Conſequents thereof.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth degree of this Enemies deſtruction is, by <hi>it ſelf,</hi> or rather by Chriſt at the time, and by the means of death, which contrary to its nature, ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage our felicity. When Death hath done its worſt, it hath half killed it ſelf in killing us: It hath then diſmiſſed our impriſoned ſouls, and ended even our fears of death, and our fears of all the evils of this life. It hath ended our cares, and griefs, and groans. It hath finiſhed our work, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all our wearineſs and trouble. And more then this, it ends our
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61147:58"/>
ſinning, and ſo deſtroyeth that which cauſed it, and that which the inordinate fears of it ſelf, had cauſed in us. It is the time when ſin ſhall gaſp its laſt, and ſo far our Phyſitian will perfect the cure; and our greateſt enemy ſhall follow us no further. It is the door by which the ſoul muſt paſs to Chriſt in Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>If any Papiſt ſhall hence plead that therefore all men muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect without ſin before death, or elſe go to Purgatory to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe as we die, ſo Chriſt will find us: or if they ask, How death can perfect us? I anſwer them: It is Chriſt our Phyſitian that finiſheth the cure, and Death is the time in which he doth it. And if he undertake then to do it, it concerns not us to be too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive, how he doth it. What if the patient underſtand not how blood letting cureth the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61147:59"/>
blood that is left behind? muſt he therefore plead againſt his Phyſitian, and ſay, It will not be done, becauſe he knoweth not how its done? We feel that here we have our ſinfull imperfections: we have for all that a promiſe that we ſhall be with Chriſt, when death hath made its ſeparation; and we are aſſured that no ſin doth enter there. And is not this enough for us to know?</p>
               <p>But yet I ſee not why the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Objection ſhould trouble us at all. Death doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move us from this ſinfull fleſh, and admits the ſoul into the ſight of God. And in the very inſtant of its remove, it muſt needs be perfected, even by that remove, and by the firſt appearance of his bleſſed face. If you bring a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle into a dark room, the acceſs of the light expelleth the darkneſs, at the ſame inſtant: And you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61147:59"/>
ſay that they conſiſt together one moment of time. So cold is expelled by the approach of heat. And thus when death hath opened the door, and let us into the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal light, neither before nor after, but in that inſtant all the darkneſs &amp; ſinful imperfections of our ſouls are diſſipated. Throw an empty Bottle into the Sea, and the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ceaſeth by the filling of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; neither before nor after, but in that inſtant.</p>
               <p>If this ſhould not ſatiſfie any, let it ſatiſfie them, that the Holy Ghoſt in the inſtant of death can perfect his work.</p>
               <p>So that we need not aſſert a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection on earth, (which on their grounds, muſt be the caſe of all that will eſcape Hell and Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;) nor yet any Purgatory tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after death, for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the ſoul from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts of ſin; ſeeing at the inſtant
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61147:60"/>
of death, by the the ſpirit, or by the depoſition of the fleſh, or by the ſight of God, or by the ſight of our glorified Redeemer, or by all, this work will be eaſily and infallibly accompliſhed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt degree and perfect conqueſt will be at the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And this is the victory that is mentioned in my Text. All that is fore-mentioned doth abate the enmity, and conquer death in ſome degree: But the enmity, and the enemy it ſelf is conquered at the Reſurrection, and not till then. And therefore Death is the laſt enemy to be deſtroyed. The Body lieth under the penal effects of ſin, till the Reſurrection. And it is penal to the ſoul to be in a ſtate of ſeparation from the Body, though it be a ſtate of glory that its in with Chriſt: For it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of glory, which it ſhall attain at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61147:60"/>
when the whole man ſhall be perfected and glorified toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Then it is that the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors work will be accompliſhed; <hi>and all things ſhall be reſtored; All that are in the graves ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God and ſhall come forth,</hi> John 5.28. <hi>For this is the Fathers will that ſent him, that of all that he hath given him; he ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up at the laſt day</hi>; John 6.39, 40. <hi>We have hope towards God, that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the dead, both of the juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,</hi> Acts 24.15. <hi>As by man came death, ſo by man came alſo the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead,</hi> I Cor. 15.21. <hi>Then ſhall there be no more death, nor ſorrow, nor crying, nor pain,</hi> Rev. 21.4. <hi>No more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, or fears of death, or grave, or of corruption.</hi> No terrible ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhall ſtand betwixt us and our Lord, to frighten our hearts from
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61147:61"/>
looking towards him. O what a birth-day will that be! when Graves ſhall bring forth ſo many millions of ſons for Glory! How joyfully will the ſoul &amp; body meet, that were ſeparated ſo long? Then ſin hath done its worſt and can do no more! Then Chriſt hath done all, and hath no more to do, as our Redeemer, but to juſtifie us in judgement, and give us poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the joy that he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring. And then he will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up the Kingdom to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>If you expect now that I ſhould give you Reaſons why Death is the laſt Enemy to be deſtroyed, though much might be ſaid from the nature of the matter, the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Will of God ſhall be to me inſtead of all other Reaſons, being the fountain and the ſum of all. He knows beſt the Order that is agreeable to his Works and Ends,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61147:61"/>
to his honour, and to our good: and therefore to his Wiſdom we ſubmit, in the patient expectance of the accompliſhment of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>

when we read, that <hi>death paſſeth upon all, for that all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5.11, 12. and that <hi>death is the wages of ſin,</hi> Rom. 6.23. Though Chriſt do us good by it, that proveth it not to be no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: For caſtigatory puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are purpoſely to do good to the chaſtiſed. Indeed we may ſay, <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting?</hi> becauſe that the mortal evil to the Soul is taken out; and becauſe we foreſee the Reſurrection by faith, when we ſhall have the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory by Chriſt.

                  <p>FROM all this Enmity in Death, we may ſee what it is that ſin hath done: and conſequently how vile and odious it is, and how we ſhould eſteem and uſe it. Sin hath not only forfeited our Happineſs, but laid thoſe impediments in the way of our recovery, which will find us work, and cauſe our danger and ſorrow while we live. And Death is not the leaſt of theſe impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. O fooliſh man, that ſtill will love ſuch a mortal Enemy! If another would rob them but of a groat, or defame them, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61147:63"/>
them of any accommodation, how eaſily can they hate them, and how hardly are they reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them? But ſin depriveth them of their lives, and ſeparates the ſoul and body aſunder, and forfeiteth their everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſets death betwixt them and the Glory that is purchaſed by Chriſt, and yet they love it, and will not leave it. Though God have made them, and do ſuſtain them, and provide for them, and all their hope and help is in him, they are not ſo eaſily drawn to love him; And yet they can love the ſin that would undo them. Though Chriſt would deliver them, and bring them to everlaſting bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and hath aſſumed fleſh, and laid down his life, to teſtifie his Love to them, yet are they not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily brought to love him; but the ſin that made them enemies to God, and hath brought them ſo
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61147:64"/>
near to everlaſting miſery, this they can love, that deſerves no love. A Miniſter or other friend that would draw them from their ſin to God, and help to ſave them, they quarrell againſt, as if he were their enemy: but their fooliſh companions, that can laugh and jeſt with them at the door of Hell, and clap them on the back, and drive away the care of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and harden them againſt the fear of God, theſe are the only acceptable men to them. O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, leave this folly to the world, and do you judge of ſin by its ſad effects. You feel (if you have any feeling in you) in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, what it hath done againſt your Souls! the weakneſs of your faith and love; the diſtance of your hearts from God; your doubts and troubles tell you that it is not your friend: You muſt ſhortly know what it will do to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61147:64"/>
your bodies. As it keeps them in pain, and wearineſs, and weakneſs, ſo it will ere long deliver them up to the jaws of death; which will ſpare them no more then the beaſts that periſh. Had it not been for ſin, we ſhould have had no cauſe to fear a diſſolution; nor have had any uſe for a coffin or a winding-ſheet, nor been beholden to a grave, to hide our carkeſſes from the ſight and ſmell of the living. But as <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were tranſlated when they had walked with God, even ſo ſhould we: as <hi>thoſe ſhall that are alive and remain at the coming of Chriſt, ſhall be caught up together in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and ſo ſhall they ever be with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.17.</p>
                  <p>Uſe ſin therefore as it will uſe you. Spare it not, for it will not ſpare you. It is your murderer, and the murderer of the world:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61147:65"/>
Uſe it therefore as a murderer ſhould be uſed. Kill it before it kills you; and then though it kill your bodies, it ſhall not be able to kill your ſouls; and though it bring you to the grave, as it did your Head, it ſhall not be able to keep you there. If the thoughts of death, and the grave, and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs be not pleaſant to you, let not the thoughts of ſin be pleaſant. Hearken to every temptation to ſin, as you would hearken to a temptation to ſelf-murder: And as you would do if the Devill brought you a knife, and tempted you to cut your throat with it; ſo do when he offereth you the bait of ſin. You love not Death: Love not the cauſe of Death. Be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſtand weeping over a buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friend, and never to weep over a ſinning or ungodly friend, nor once to give them a compaſſionate earneſt exhortation, to ſave their

                  <p>FROM the Enmity of Death we may further learn, that <hi>Man hath now a need of Grace for ſuch exceeding dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, which were not before him in his ſtate of innocency.</hi> Though <hi>Adam</hi> was able to have obeyed perfectly, without ſin, and had Grace ſufficient to have upheld him, and conquered temptations, if he had done his part, which by that Grace he might have done; yet whether that Grace was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the works that we are called to, is a doubt that many have been much troubled with. It is certain that he was able to have done any

thing that was ſuitable to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, if it were commanded him: And it is certain tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> much that is now our duty, would have been unſuitable to his ſtate. But whether it belonged to his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to be able and fit for ſuch duties (that were then unſuitable to him) or ſuppoſition they had been <hi>ſuitable</hi> and <hi>duties,</hi> this is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty: which ſome make uſe of to prove that ſuch works cannot now be required of us, without ſuitable help, becauſe we loſt no ſuch grace in <hi>Adam.</hi> But this need not trouble us: For 1. Though <hi>Adam</hi> was put on no ſuch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in particular, as to encounter death: yet the perfect obedience to the whole Law, required a great degree of internall Habituall holineſs: and to determine the caſe, whether our particular dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, or his ſinleſs perfect ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and help, is a matter of more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty then uſe. For 2. It is but about the <hi>Degrees</hi> of Holineſs in him and us, and not about the <hi>Kind,</hi> that the difficulty lieth. For it is the ſame <hi>End</hi> that he was created for and diſpoſed to by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that we are redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for and diſpoſed to ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
                  <p>But yet it is worthy our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, what a difficulty ſin hath caſt before us in the way of life, which <hi>Adam</hi> was unacquainted with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſo we may ſee the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our works, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Redeemers grace. <hi>Adam</hi> was but to ſeek the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his life, and a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Glory, without the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of interpoſing death: He was never called to prepare to die; nor to think of the ſtate of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated Soul; nor to mind, and love, and ſeek a glory to which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61147:67"/>
there is no (ordinary) paſſage but by <hi>death.</hi> This is the difficulty that ſin hath cauſed, againſt which we have need of the ſpecial aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, of the example, and doctrine, and promiſe, and Spirit of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. <hi>Adam</hi> was never put to ſtudy how to get over this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gulf. The threatning of death was to raiſe ſuch a fear in him as was neceſſary to prevent it: But thoſe fears did rather hold him cloſer to the way of life, then ſtand between him and life to his diſcouragement. But we have a death to fear that <hi>muſt</hi> be ſuffered, that <hi>cannot</hi> be avoided. The ſtrange condition of a ſeparated ſoul (ſo unlike to its ſtate while reſident in the body) doth require in us, a <hi>ſpecial Faith</hi> to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it, and a <hi>ſpecial revelation</hi> to diſcover it. To deſire, and love, and long for, and labour after ſuch a time as this, when one part

of us muſt lie rotting in the grave, and the ſeparated Soul muſt be with Chriſt alone till the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to believe and hope for that Reſurrection, and to deny our ſelves, and forſake all the world, and lay down our lives when Chriſt requireth it, by the power of this faith and hope, this is a work that innocent <hi>Adam</hi> never knew: This is the high employment of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.

for no man is unwilling to be happy, or to attain his end. But ſtay a little, and better conſider of your Caſe. Is it Chriſt that your heart is thus averſe to, or is it only <hi>Death</hi> that ſtandeth in the way? You are not, I hope, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſee the face of God, nor unwilling to be tranſlated from earth to heaven, but unwilling to <hi>die.</hi> It is not becauſe you love the creature better then the Creator, but becauſe you are afraid of <hi>Death.</hi> You may love God, and long to be perfected in holineſs, and to ſee his Glory, and to have the moſt near Communion with him, and yet at the ſame time you may fear this Enemy that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in your way: I mean not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Pain</hi> of death, but principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the diſſolution of our natures, and the ſeparation of the ſoul from the body, and its abode in a ſeparated ſtate, and the bodies

It is not our <hi>duty</hi> to love <hi>death</hi> as <hi>death.</hi> Had it not been naturally an evil to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and avoided, God would not have made it the matter of his threatning; nor would it have been a fit means to reſtrain men from tranſgreſſion. To threaten a man with a benefit as ſuch, is a contradiction. Enquire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore into your hearts, whether there be not a belief of heaven, a love to God, a deſire to enjoy and pleaſe him, even while you draw back and ſeem to be averſe? and whether it be not only loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>die,</hi> and not a lothneſs to <hi>be with Chriſt?</hi>

(becauſe I find that our comfort much dependeth on it) I ſhall try you by theſe following Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What is it that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to you in your meditations of your change? Is it God and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or is it Death?</hi> If it be only <hi>Death,</hi> it ſeems it is not the want of Love to God, and heaven, that cauſeth your averſneſs: If it be <hi>God himſelf</hi> that is ungratefull to your thoughts, is it becauſe you <hi>deſire not</hi> his nearer preſence, or communion with him in the ſtate of glory? or is it only becauſe you <hi>fear</hi> leſt you have no intereſt in his Love, and ſhall not attain the bleſſedneſs which you deſire? If it be the firſt, I muſt confeſs it proves a graceleſs ſoul, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the want of Love to God. But if it be the latter only, it may ſtand with grace: For Deſire is a true ſignification of Love,

though there be doubts and fears leſt we ſhall miſs the attainment of thoſe deſires.</p>

If it were but as <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to go with Chriſt into an exceeding high Mountain, and there to ſee him in glory, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 17.12.) would you not gadly do it? It ſeems then that thou deſireſt to ſee the Lord,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61147:74"/>
and thy love is to him, though thou be afraid of death.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 3. Conſider of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Heavenly felicity, and try whether thou love it in the ſeveral parts. One part is <hi>our perſonal perfection</hi>; that our ſouls ſhall be free from ignorance, and error, and ſin, and ſorrow, and enlarged for the perfect Love of God; and our bodies at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, made like the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body of our Lord, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. and wouldſt thou not be thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in ſoul and body? Another part is, that <hi>we ſhall live with the heavenly ſociety of Angels and glorified Saints:</hi> And wouldſt thou not have ſuch company; rather then the company of ſinners, and enemies, and imperfect Saints on earth? Another part is, that we <hi>ſhall ſee our glorified Head, and be with him where he is, that we may behold his glory.</hi> And doth
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61147:74"/>
not thy heart deſire this? But the perfection of our Happineſs is, that we ſhall ſee <hi>the face of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God,</hi> which is the light of that world, as truly as the Sun is the light of this: and that we ſhall be filled up with the feeling of his Love, and abound with Love to him again, and perfectly delighted in this Communion of Love, and expreſs it in the Praiſes of the Lord, and thus make up the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where God will place his glorious preſence, and in which he will for evermore take pleaſure. And is there any thing in this that thy ſoul is againſt, and which thou doſt not value above this wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d? If thou find that all the parts are ſweet, and the Deſcription of Heaven is moſt gratefull to thee, and that this is the ſtate that thou wouldſt be in, it ſeems then it is not <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> but <hi>Death</hi> that thou art averſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61147:75"/>
from, and that maketh thee ſo loth to hear the tydings of thy change.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 4. Couldſt thou not joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſee the coming of Chriſt, if it were this day (if thou have done thy work, and art aſſured of his love?) The Apoſtle hath told us by the word of the Lord, that <hi>the Lord himſelf ſhall deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this is the doctrine that comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth believers, <hi>verſe</hi> 18.

Though death be the enemy that ſeemeth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer us, and to deſtroy and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly undo us, yet being conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf by Chriſt, it is uſed by him to our great advantage, and ſanctified to be a very great help to our ſalvation. The ſuffering of Chriſt himſelf was in the hour of his enemies, and the power of darkneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.53. which ſeemed to have prevailed againſt him; when yet it was but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61147:78"/>
of death by death, and the purchaſing of life and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the world.

They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy themſelves when they ſeem to have deſtroyed us. As the Serpent bruiſed but the heel of Chriſt, who bruiſed his head; ſo doth he bruiſe but our heel, who in that conflict, and by the means of his own execution, through the ſtrength of Chriſt, do bruiſe his head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. And this is upſhot of all his enmity, againſt the womans holy ſeed. Though Death was unſuitable to innocent man, and is ſtill a natural enemy to us all, yet unto ſinners it is an evil that is ſuitable and fit to deſtroy the greater evil that did cauſe it, and to prevent the everlaſting evil.

The fore-knowledge of our cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain death, is a very great help to keep us humble, and diſgrace all the ſeducing pleaſures of the fleſh, and all the profits and honours of the world, and ſo to enervate all temptations. It is a ſingular help to quicken a ſtupid careleſs ſinner, and to waken men to prepare for the life to come, and to excite them to ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God, and to give all diligence to make their calling and election ſure; &amp; to conſider, ſeeing all theſe things muſt be diſſolved, what manner of perſons they ought to be, in all holy converſation &amp; godlineſs, looking for, and haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the coming of the day of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11, 12. When we drop aſleep, the remembrance of death may quickly awake us; when we grow ſlack, it is our ſpur to put us on, to mend our pace. Who is ſo mad as wilfully to ſin with

ſpeak of all, and bitterly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the vanity and vexation, when they come to die. And if our lives and the world be brought hereby into ſuch diſorders, when men live ſo <hi>ſhort</hi> a time on earth, what monſters of ambition, and covetouſneſs, and luxury would men be, if they lived as long as before the flood, even to eight hundred, or nine hundred years of age?

Should men live now but to the age of three hundred, or four hundred years, I fear it would ſo tempt them to overvalue the world, and ſo embolden them to delay repentance, that one would be as Wolf to another, and the

So far are men from own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their vanities, when that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent teacher ſtandeth by. It is Death that helps to humble the proud, and abate the arrogan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61147:81"/>
ſettle the light and the unſettled; and to reſtrain the worſt. As we are beholden to the Gallows for our purſes and our lives; ſo are we to the grave and hell, for much of the order that is in the world, and our peace and freedom procured thereby. But it is a greater good that it procureth to believers.</p>
                  <p>If you ask, How is all this to be aſcribed to Chriſt? I anſwer, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes: 1. It is he that hath now the Keyes or power of death and hell, even he that liveth and was dead, and that liveth for evermore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be feared by the world. 2. It is he that hath by his Blood &amp; Covenant brought us the Hope of everlaſting life; which is it that gives the efficacy to death. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this men would be but <hi>deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> and think that it is better have a little pleaſure then none at all, and ſo would give up
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61147:81"/>
themſelves to ſin, and deſperately gratifie their fleſh by all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs they could deviſe. 3. And it is Chriſt that teacheth men the right <hi>uſe</hi> of death, by his holy doctrine, having brought life and immortality to light by his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. 4. And it is Chriſt that ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth the holy Spirit, which only doth ſo illuminate the mind, and quicken and diſpoſe the heart, that Death may be ſavingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. The poyſon is our own: but it is his skill and love that hath made a Soveraign antidote of it. And let our bodies die, ſo our ſin may die. If the foreſight of Death deſtroy our ſin, and further our ſanctification, and the hour of death doth end our fears and enter us into the ſtate of glory, though we will love death as death never the better for this, much leſs the ſin that cauſed it; yet muſt we admire the love of our Redeemer.</p>

                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:61147:82"/>And it is not only the <hi>Peril</hi> but alſo the <hi>Terrors</hi> of Death that we are in part delivered from. Though Chriſt himſelf was in a bloody ſweat, in his agony before his death, and cryed out on the Croſs, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me; becauſe he bore the ſins of the world; yet death is welcome to many of his followers, that drink of his cup, and are baptized with his baptiſm: For they taſte not of theſe dregs which he drunk up, and they are ſtrengthened by his ſupporting grace. He that doth comfort them againſt ſin and Hell, doth alſo comfort them againſt Death. So great is the glory that he hath promiſed them, and ſo great is his comforting, confirming grace, that dreadfull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For when our joyes are overwhelmed with the fears of <hi>death,</hi> and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſorrows, our love to God will be abated, and we ſhall deny him the thanks and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full praiſes, which ſhould be much of the employment of our lives: and we ſhall be much diſcompoſed and unfitted for his ſervice, and ſhall much diſhonour him in the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61147:86"/>
world, and ſhall ſtrengthen our temptations to the overvaluing of earthly things. Think it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſmall or an indifferent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to fortifie your ſouls againſt theſe malignant fears of death. Make this your daily care and work; your <hi>peace,</hi> your <hi>ſafety</hi>; your <hi>innocency,</hi> and <hi>uſefulneſs,</hi> and the <hi>honour of God,</hi> do much lie on it. And it is a work of ſuch exceeding difficulty, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the beſt of your skill and diligence; and when all is done, it muſt be the illuminating quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning beams of grace, and the ſhining face of the Eternal Love, that muſt do the work; though yet your diligence is neceſſary, to attend the ſpirit, and uſe the means, in ſubſerviency to grace, and in expectation of theſe cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall rayes.</p>
                  <p>And above all take heed leſt you ſhould think, that carnal
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61147:86"/>
mirth, or meer ſecurity, and caſting away the thoughts of death will ſerve to overcome theſe fears; or that it is enough that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve againſt them. For it is your <hi>ſafety</hi> that muſt be lookt to, as well as your preſent eaſe and peace: and <hi>fear</hi> muſt be ſo overcome, as that a greater miſery may not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: Preſumption and ſecurity will be of very ſhort continuance. To die without <hi>fear,</hi> and paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to endleſs <hi>deſperation,</hi> which <hi>fear</hi> ſhould have wakened you to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,</hi> is no deſirable kind of dying. And beſides, <hi>reſolving</hi> againſt the Terrors of death, will not prevent them. When Death draws neer, it will amaze you, in deſpight of all your <hi>reſolutions,</hi> if you are not furniſhed with a better An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote. The more jocund you have been in carnal mirth, and the more you have preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſlighted death, its likely

your horror will be the greater when it comes. And therefore ſee that you make a wiſe and ſafe preparation; and that you <hi>groundedly</hi> and <hi>methodically cure</hi> theſe fears, and not ſecurely caſt them away. Though I have given you to this end, ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in other writings (in the <hi>Saints Reſt,</hi> and in the Treatiſe of <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> and that of <hi>Crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world,</hi>) yet I ſhall add here theſe following helps, which faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved and practiſed, will much promote your victory over death, which conquereth all the ſtrength of fleſh, and glory of this world.</p>

                     <p>ANother help againſt the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> is the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of the fleſh, with its affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and luſts: and the conqueſt of the world by the life of faith,</hi> and crucifying it by the Croſs of Chriſt; and dying daily by the patient ſuffering of the Croſs our ſelves. When we are looſe from all things under the Sun, and there is nothing that entangleth our affections on earth, a great part of the difficulty is then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. But death will tear the heart that is glued to any thing in this world. Poſſeſs therefore as if you poſſeſſed not, and rejoyce as if you rejoyced not, and uſe the world as not abuſing it: for the faſhion of this world doth paſs

away, I <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30, 31. It is much for the ſake of our fleſh that muſt periſh, that death doth ſeem ſo bitter to us: If therefore we can throughly ſudue the fleſh, and live above its pleaſure and deſires, we ſhall the more eſily bear its diſſolution. Shut up your ſenſes then a little more, and let your hearts grow ſtranger to this world; and if you have known any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, relations, accomodations after the fleſh, from henceforth know them ſo no more. How terrible is death to an earthly-minded man that had neglected his ſoul for a treaſure here, which muſt then be diſſipated in a moment? How eaſie is death to a heavenly-mind, that is throughly weaned from this world, and taketh it but for his pilgrimage or paſſage unto life, and hath made it the buſineſs of his dayes, to lay up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a treaſure in heaven? He that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61147:97"/>
hath unfeignedly made heaven his end in the courſe of his life, will moſt readily paſs to it on the hardeſt terms: For every man is willing to attain his end.</p>

                     <p>IT will much help us againſt the Enmity of death, <hi>to be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conformed to the Image of God, in the hatred of ſin, and love of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and in ſpecial in the point of Juſtice.</hi> When we hate ſin throughly, and find it ſo incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into our fleſh, that they muſt live and die together, it will make death the more eaſie to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe it will be the death of ſin, even of that ſin which we moſt hate, and that God hateth, and that hath coſt us ſo dear as it hath done. When we are in love with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61147:97"/>
holineſs, and know that we ſhall never be perfect in it, till after death; it will make death the more welcome, as the paſſage to our deſired life. When the Juſtice, even the caſtigatory and vindictive Juſtice of God, is more amiable in our eyes, and we are not blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſelf-love, to judge of God and of his wayes, according to the intereſt of our fleſh, we ſhall then conſent to his diſſolving ſtroke, and ſee that the bitterneſs of death proceedeth from that which is good in God, though from that which is evil in our ſelves. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as Juſtice is one of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Attributes of God, ſo ſhould it be amiable to man, there being nothing in God but what is love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It is the prevalency of <hi>ſelf-love</hi> that makes men ſo inſenſible of the excellency of Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, while they ſpeak ſo reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of his mercy. So far as men
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61147:98"/>
are carnall and ſelfiſh, they cannot love that by which they ſmart, or of which they are in danger. But the ſoul that is got above it ſelf, and is united unto God in Chriſt, and hath that Image of God, which containeth the impreſs and effect of all his Attributes, hath ſuch an habit of <hi>impartial juſtice</hi> in himſelf, and ſuch a hatred of ſin, and ſuch a deſire that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God ſhould be vindicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and maintained, and ſuch an <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation</hi> of the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, that he can the more eaſily conſent or ſubmit to the diſſolving ſtroke of death: He hateth his own ſin, and loatheth himſelf for all his abominations, and is poſſeſſed with that <hi>Juſtice</hi> that provoketh him to <hi>ſelf-revenge</hi> in an ordinate ſort, and therefore doth love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that <hi>Juſtice</hi> that inflicteth on him the penalty of death; (Eſpecially ſince Mercy hath made
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61147:98"/>
it a uſefull Caſtigation.) As ſome penitent malefactors have been ſo ſenſible of their crimes, that they have not deprecated death, but conſented to it as a needfull work of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> (as its written of the penitent Murderer lately hanged at <hi>London.</hi>) So Holineſs doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a hatred of our own ſins, and ſuch impartial Juſtice on Gods behalf; that it will cauſe us to ſubſcribe to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſentence, and the more quietly to yield to the ſtroke of death.</p>

cauſeth the unthankfull world to requite us with malicious uſage, for telling them the ungratefull truth, and ſeeking their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. it makes our friends to be but half-friends; and ſome of them too like our enemies. It puts a ſting into the ſweeteſt friendſhip, and mixeth ſmart with all our pleaſures; It worketh us grief from precious mercies; and abateth the comfort of our near Relations; So that our ſmart by the pricks, is often greater then our pleaſure in the ſweetneſs of the Roſe. No friend is ſo ſmoothed, and ſquared to the temper and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of another, but that ſome in equality and unevenneſs doth remain, which makes the cloſure to be leſs near and ſtedfaſt. Even family relations, are uſually ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly jointed and cemented, that when the winds of tryal are any thing high, they ſhake the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61147:104"/>
frame; and though they are but low, they find an entrance, and cauſe ſuch a coldneſs of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as is contrary to the nature and duty of the relations. Either a contrariety of opinions, or of natural temperature and humours, or elſe of the diſpoſitions of the mind; Sometime croſs intereſts, and ſometime paſſions and croſs words, do cauſe ſuch diſcontents and ſowrneſs, ſuch frowns or jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, or diſtances, that our near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friends are but as ſackloth on our skins, and as a ſhoo too ſtrait for us, or as a garment that is unmeet, which pinch and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us in their uſe, and thoſe that ſhould be to us as the Apple of our eyes, are as the duſt or ſmoak to them, that vex or blind them. And the more we Love them, the more it greiveth us to be croſſed in our love. There is ſcarce any friend ſo wiſe, ſo good, ſo ſuitable to us, or
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61147:105"/>
ſo near, that we can alwayes pleaſe. And the diſpleaſure of a friend is as gravell in our ſhoos, or as Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in our bed, oft-times more grievous then the malice of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. There is no ſuch doing as this in heaven: becauſe there is no ſuch gueſt as ſin. We ſhall love each other far more then we do here; and yet that Love ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be inordinate , nor in the leaſt divert our love from God, but every Saint and Angel in the Society, ſhall be loved with moſt chaſte and pure affections, in a perfect ſubordination to the love of God; and ſo as that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in them, ſhall be the chiefeſt object of that love. It is there that our friends being freed from all their imperfections, do neither tempt us to a carnal Love, nor have any thing in them to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the love that is ſpirituall and pure. We have here our paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61147:105"/>
friends, our ſelf-conceited friends, our unkind, unthankfull ſelfiſh friends; our mutable and unfaithfull friends; our contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous friends that are like to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and <hi>who</hi> have uſed us more hardly then our friends? But when we come to God, we ſhall have friends that are like God, that are wholly good, and are participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively turned into Love; and have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left behind them all that was unclean and noyſome, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to themſelves, they have alſo caſt off all that could be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to us. Our love will be there without ſuſpicions, without interruptions, unkindneſſes and diſcontents, without diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, fruſtrations and diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: For God himſelf will fully ſatisfie us; and we ſhall love his goodneſs and glory in his Saints, as well as immediately in himſelf. Our friends are now loſt at the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61147:106"/>
turning of a ſtraw: the change of their intereſt, their company, their opinions, the ſlanders of back-biters, and miſ-repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of malicious men, can cool their Love, and kill their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. But Heaven is a place of conſtant Love: The Love of Saints, as all things elſe, is there eternal: And yet it decline<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a world of Love that we are haſting to: It is a life of love that we muſt there live, and a work of love, and perfect love that we muſt be there employed in for ever. If here we have a pure, a dear, a faithful friend, that is without falſe-heartedneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that loveth us as his own ſoul, how quickly is he ſnatcht away by death? and leaves us melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into tears, and mourning over his earthly relicts, and looking upward with grieved hearts, as the Diſciples did after

If our friends are bad, or prove unkind, they gall and grieve us while they live: If they excell in holineſs, fidelity and ſuitableneſs, the dart that kills them, deeply woundeth us; and the ſweeter they were to us in their lives, the bitterer to us is their death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We cannot keep a mercy, but ſin is ready to take it from us, or elſe to marr it, and turn it into Vinegar and Gall. And doth not Death (accidentally) befriend us, that puts an end to all theſe troubles, and lands us ſafe on the Celeſtiall ſhore, and puts us into the boſome of perpetual Reſt, where all is calm, and the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61147:109"/>
ſtorms and billows that toſt us here, ſhall fear or trouble us no more? And thus Death ſhall make us ſome recompence at laſt, for the wrong it did us; and the mortal blow ſhall hurt us leſs then did the dreadfull apparition of it in our fore-thoughts. Let not our fears then exceed the cauſe; Though we fear the pangs &amp; throws of travel, let us withall remember, that we ſhall preſently rejoyce, and all the holy Angels with us, that a ſoul is born into the world of glory: And Death ſhall gain us much more then it deprived us of.</p>

                     <p>THE laſt Direction that I ſhall give you, to conquer the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Death, is this: <hi>Give up your wills entirely to the will of God, as knowing that his will is your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and your end, your ſafety, your felicity and reſt, in which you ſhould gladly acquieſce.</hi> When you think of Death, remember who it is that ſends it; It is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers meſſenger, and is ſent but to execute his will. And can there be any thing in the will of God, that his ſervants ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately fear? Doubtleſs his Will is much ſafer and better for us then our own. And if in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall it were offered to our choice, Whether all particulars of our lives ſhould be diſpoſed of by
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61147:110"/>
Gods will or by ours, common reaſon might teach us to deſire, to be rather in Gods hands then our own. The fulfilling of his will, is the care and buſineſs of our lives: and therefore it ſhould be a ſupport and ſatisfaction to us at our death, that it is but the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his will. His Juſtice and puniſhing will is good, though ſelfiſhneſs maketh it ungratefull to the offender. But his children that are dear to him, and taſte no evil but that which worketh for their good, have no cauſe to quarrell at his will: Whatſoever our ſureſt deareſt friends would have us take, or do, or ſuffer, we are ready to ſubmit to, as being confident they will do nothing for our hurt, (if they do but know what is for our good.) And ſhall we not more boldly truſt the will of God then of our deareſt friend? He knows what he hath to do with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61147:110"/>
us, and how he will diſpoſe of us, and whether he will bring us; and his intereſt in us is more then ours in our ſelves; and ſhall we then diſtruſt him, as if we had to do with an enemy, or one that were evil, and not with love and infinite goodneſs? It is the will of God that muſt be the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Reſt, the Heaven, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our ſouls: And ſhall we now ſo fear it, and fly from it, as if it were our ruine? Look which way you will through all the world, your ſouls will never find repoſe, nor ſatisfying quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and content but in the will of God. Let us therefore commit our ſouls to him, as to a faithfull Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; and deſire unfeignedly the fulfilling of his will, and believe that there is no ground of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence more firm. <hi>Abraham</hi> may boldly truſt his Son, his only Son,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61147:111"/>
on the will of God: And Chriſt himſelf when he was to drink the bitter Cup, ſubmitteth his own naturall love of life to his Fathers will, ſaying, Not my will, but thine be done. It is a moſt unworthy abuſe of God, that we could be quiet and rejoyce, if our own wills, or our deareſt friends might diſpoſe of our lives, and yet are diſtreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But perhaps you will ſay, <hi>It is the error of my own will that hath procured my Death: if it had been meerly the fruit of the will of God, It could be eaſily ſatisfied. Anſw.</hi> Wo to us, if we had not ground of comfort againſt the errors of our own wills. When our deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of our ſelves, our help is of God. So much as is of our ſelves in it is evil: but ſo much as is of God is good. I do not ſay that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61147:111"/>
you ſhould reſt in your <hi>own</hi> wills, nor in your own wayes, but in the will and wayes of God. The rod is good, though the fault that makes it neceſſary, be bad. The Chaſtiſing will is good, though the ſinning will be evil: And it is good that is intended to us, and ſhall be performed in the event.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But how can we reſt in the angry afflicting will of God, when it is this that we muſt be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled under: and it is the will of God that is the condemnation of the wicked. Anſw.</hi> The effect being from a twofold cauſe (the ſinning will of man, and the puniſhing will of God) is accordingly good as from the latter, and ſo far ſhould be loved and conſented to by all; and evil as from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſo may be abhorred: But to the Saints there is yet greater Conſolation: Though affliction is their grief, as it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth

Gods diſpleaſure, and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſmart or deſtruction of the fleſh; yet it is their mercy, as as it proceedeth from the Love of God, and prepareth them for the greateſt mercies.

Let faith therefore foreſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in the conflict; and let us not with too much deſpondency hang down our heads before any enemy that we know ſhall be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down at laſt.

Though we have heard, and read,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61147:113"/>

Our Love, and Joy, and Praiſe ſhall be everlaſting; but our ignorance, and unbelief, and pride, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall not be everlaſting: Our Holineſs ſhall be perfected and have no end: but our ſin ſhall be aboliſhed, have an end.

Our doubtings and perplexities of mind are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and grievous, but they will be but ſhort. When we have full poſſeſſion, we ſhall be paſt our doubts. Our work is now to pour out. our grieved ſouls into the boſome of ſome faithfull friend; or eaſe our troubled minds by complaining of our miſeries to our faithfull Paſtors, that from
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61147:114"/>
them we may, have ſome words of direction and conſolation: But O how different a work is it that we ſhall have in heaven? where no more complainings ſhall be heard from our mouths, for no more ſorrow ſhall poſſeſs our hearts; and we ſhall have no need of men to comfort us; but ſhall have comfort as naturally from the face of God, as we have light and heat in the ſummer from the Sun. When we all make one celeſtial Chore, to ſing the praiſes of the King of Saints, how unlike will that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody be to the broken muſick of ſighs, and groans, and lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which we now take to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt our beſt! We are now glad when we can find but words, and groans, and tears, to lament our ſin and miſery: But then our joy ſhall know no ſorrow, nor our voice any ſad and mournfall tune. And may we not bear a while the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61147:114"/>
ſorrows that ſhall have ſo good an end? We ſhall ſhortly have laid by the hard, unprofitable, barren hearts, that are now our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall burden and diſeaſe. Love not your corruptions, Chriſtians; but yet be patient under the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable relicts that offend you; remembring that your conflict will end in conqueſt, and your faith, and watchfulneſs, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will be put to it but a little while. Who would not enter willingly into the fight, when he may before hand be aſſured, that the field ſhall be cleared of every enemy? All this muſt be aſcribed to our dear Redeemer. Had not he wrought the conqueſt, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that vex us would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed us, and the Serpent that now doth but bruiſe our heel, would have bruiſed our head: and the ſorrows that are wholeſome, ſanctified and ſhort, would have

We make nothing to endure a ſudden prick, that by blood-letting we may prevent a long diſeaſe. The ſhort pain of pulling out a tooth, is ordinarily endured, to prevent a longer. A woman doth bear the pains of her travail, becauſe it is ſhort, and tends to the bringing of a child into the world. Who would not ſubmit to any labour or toyl for a day, that he might win a life of plenty and delight by it? Who would not be ſpit upon, and made the ſcorn of the world for a day, if he might have his will for it as long as he liveth on earth? And ſhould we not then
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61147:116"/>
cheerfully ſubmit to our momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany afflictions, and the troubles of a few dayes, (which are light, and mixt with a world of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,) when we know that they are working for us, a far more exceeding eternall weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. Our clamorous and malicious enemies, our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelſome brethren, our peeviſh friends, our burdenſome corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and imperfections will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trouble us no more. As our life is ſhort, and but a dream and ſhadow, and therefore the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this world are no better; ſo our troubles alſo will be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and are but ſad dreams, and dark ſhadows, that quickly paſs away: Our Lord that hath begun and gone on ſo far, will finiſh his victories, and the laſt enemy ſhall ſhortly be deſtroyed.</p>

The foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God ſtill ſtandeth ſure: the Lord knoweth his own, even when ſome of them know not that they are his own. He knoweth his mark upon his ſheep, when they know it not themſelves. God doubteth not of his intereſt in thee, though thou doubt of thy intereſt in him: And thou art faſter in the arms of his Love, then by the arms of thy own faith: as the child is ſurer in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers arms, then by its holding of the Mother. And moreover your doubts and fears are part of the evil that ſhall be removed, and your bittereſt ſorrows that hence proceed, ſhall with the reſt of the enemies be deſtroyed.</p>

Why doſt thou doubt (poor hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſoul) of thy intereſt in Chriſt, that muſt make the conqueſt? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me but theſe few Queſtions from thy heart.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Did Chriſt ever ſhew himſelf unkind to thee? or unwilling to receive thee, and have mercy on thee? Did he ever give thee cauſe to think ſo poorly of his Love and grace, as thy doubts do intimate thou doſt? Haſt thou not found him kind when thou waſt unkind, and that he thought on thee when thou didſt not think on him? and will he now forget thee, and end in wrath that begun in Love? He deſired thee when thou didſt not deſire him, and give thee all thy deſires after him: and will he now
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61147:117"/>
croſs and deny the deſires which he hath cauſed? He was found of thee, (or rather found thee) when thou ſoughteſt not after him: and can be reject thee now thou crieſt and calleſt for his grace? O think not hardly of his wonderous grace, till he give thee cauſe. Let thy ſweet experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences be remembred, to the ſhame of thy cauſeleſs doubts and fears; and let him that hath loved thee to the death, be thought on as he is, and not as the unbelieving fleſh would miſrepreſent him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. If thou ſay that it is not his unkindneſs, but thy own that feeds thy doubts; I further ask thee, Is he not kind to the unkind? eſpecially when they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their own unkindneſs? Thou art not <hi>ſo</hi> unkind to him as thou waſt in thy <hi>unconverted</hi> ſtate: and yet he then expreſt his Love in thy converſion: He then
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61147:118"/>
ſought thee when thou wenteſt aſtray, and brought thee carefully home into his Fold; and there he hath kept thee ever ſince: And is he leſs kind, now when thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home? Doſt thou not know that all his children have their frowardneſs, and are guilty of their unkindneſſes to him? And yet he doth not therefore diſown them, and turn them out of his family; but is tender of them in their fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward weakneſs, becauſe they are his own? How dealt he with the peeviſh prophet <hi>Jonah,</hi> that was <hi>[exceedingly diſpleaſed and very angry,]</hi> that God ſpared <hi>Nineve,</hi> leſt it ſhould be a diſhonour to his Propheſie; in ſo much that he wiſht that he might <hi>die and not live:</hi> and after repined at the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of his gourd, and the ſcorching of the Sun that beat upon him? The Lord doth gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly queſtion with him <hi>[Doſt thou
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61147:118"/>
well to be angry?]</hi> and after hence convince him that the mercy which he valued to himſelf, he ſhould not envy to ſo many, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. How dealt he with the Diſciples, that fell aſleep, when they ſhould have watcht with Chriſt in the night of his great agony? He doth not tell them, <hi>[You are none of mine, becauſe you could not watch with me one hour;]</hi> but tenderly excuſeth that which they durſt not excuſe themſelves, <hi>[The ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weak,]</hi> When he was on the Croſs, though <hi>they all forſook him and fled,</hi> he was then ſo far from <hi>forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them,</hi> that he was manifeſting to admiration that exceeding love, that never would forſake them; and knoweſt thou not poor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining ſoul, that the kindneſs of Chriſt overcometh all the unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his children? and that his blood and grace is ſufficient to ſave thee, from greater ſins then thoſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61147:119"/>
that trouble thee? If thou hadſt no ſin, what uſe hadſt thou of a Saviour? Will thy Phyſitian there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore caſt thee off, becauſe thou art ſick?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Yea hath not Chriſt already ſubdued ſo many of thy enemies, as may aſſure thee he will ſubdue the reſt? and begun that life in thee, which may aſſure thee of eternal life? Once thou waſt a deſpiſer of God and his holy wayes: but now it is far otherwiſe with thee? Hath he not broken the heart of thy pride and worldlineſs, and ſenſuality and made thee a new creature? and is not this a pledge that he will do the reſt? Tell me plainly, hadſt thou rather keep thy ſin, or leave it? Hadſt thou rather have liberty to commit it, or be delivered from it? Doſt thou not hate it, and ſet thy ſelf againſt it as thy enemy? Art thou not delivered from the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61147:119"/>
reign and tyranny of it, which thou waſt once under? And will not he perfect the conqueſt which he hath begun? He that hath thus far deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thee from ſin, thy greateſt enemy, will deliver thee from all the ſad effects of it. The bleſſed work of the Spirit in thy Converſion, did deliver thee from the bondage of the Devil, from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated thee into the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt; Then didſt thou enter the holy warfare, under his banners that was never overcome, in the victorious Army that ſhall ſhortly begin their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting triumph. The ſin which thou hateſt and longeſt to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from, and art willing to uſe Gods means againſt it, is the conquered enemy, which may aſſure thee of a full and finall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſuppoſing that thy hatred is againſt all known ſin, &amp; that there is none ſo ſweet or profitable in thy

                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. Moreover art thou not truly willing to yield to all the terms of grace? Thou haſt heard of the yoak and burden of Chriſt, and of the conditions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, on which peace is offered to the ſinfull world: and what Chriſt requireth of ſuch as will be his Diſciples. What ſaith thy heart now to thoſe terms? Do they ſeem ſo hard and grievous to thee, that thou wilt venture thy ſoul in thy ſtate of ſin, rather then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of them? If this were ſo, thou hadſt yet no part in Chriſt indeed. But if there be nothing that Chriſt requireth of thee, that is not deſirable in thy eyes: or which thou doſt not ſtick at, ſo far as to turn away from him, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, and refuſe his Covenant and grace rather then ſubmit to ſuch conditions, thou art then in
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61147:120"/>
Covenant with him, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Covenant belong to thee. Canſt thou think that Chriſt hath purchaſed, and offered, and promiſed that which he will not give? Hath he ſent forth his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and commanded them to make the motion in his name, and to invite and and compell men to come in, and to beſeech them to be reconciled to God, and that yet he is unwilling to accept thee when thou doſt conſent? If Chriſt had been unwilling, he had not ſo dearly made the way, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun as a ſuitor to thy ſoul, nor ſo diligently ſought thee as he hath done. If the bleſſings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant are thine, then Heaven is thine, which is the chiefeſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: And if they be not thine, it is not becauſe Chriſt is unwilling, but becauſe thou art unwilling of his bleſſings on his terms: Nothing can deprive thee of them but thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal:
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61147:121"/>
Know therefore aſſuredly, whether thou doſt conſent thy ſelf to the terms of Chriſt, and whether thou art truly willing that he be thy Saviour; and if thy conſcience bear thee faithfull witneſs, that it is ſo, diſhonour not Chriſt then ſo far as to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether <hi>he</hi> be <hi>willing,</hi> who hath done ſo much to put it out of doubt. The ſtop is at <hi>thy will,</hi> &amp; not at <hi>his.</hi> If thou know that thou art <hi>willing,</hi> thou maiſt know that Chriſt &amp; his benefits are thine. And if thou be not <hi>willing,</hi> what makes thee wiſh, and groan, and pray, and labour in the uſe of means? Is it not for Chriſt and his benefits that thy heart thus worketh, and thou doſt all this? Fear not then if thy own hand be to the Covenant, it is moſt certain that the hand of Chriſt is at it.</p>

it was alſo beyond our power to believe it, that ever the dead ſhould riſe to life, if Chriſt had not riſen as the firſt fruits, and convinced man, by eye-ſight, or certain teſtimony, that the thing is poſſible and already done.

What a word of Hope and Joy is this, that [<hi>Chriſt is riſen?</hi>] With <hi>this</hi> we will anſwer a thouſand Cavils of the tempter, and stop the mouth of the enemies of our faith, and profligate our infidelity.

This is the very Goſpel which we preach, and by which we muſt be ſaved; <hi>that Chriſt died for our ſins according to the Scriptures, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61147:130"/>
was buryed, and that he roſe again the third day according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; and that he was ſeem of</hi> Cephas, <hi>then of the twelve, and after that he was ſeen of above five hundred Brethren at once, of wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>No wonder therefore that the Chruch in all ages ever ſince <hi>the very day</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Reſurrection,</hi> hath kept the firſt day of the week as a holy feſtivall, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it: Wherein though they commemorated the <hi>whole work</hi> of our Redemption, yet was it from the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> as the moſt glorious part, that the ſpirit of Chriſt did chooſe the day, This hath been the joyfull day to

converſion of the Nations unto Chriſt; by which we may put even death it ſelf to a defiance; as knowing it is now a conquered thing. If it could have held Chriſt captive, it might alſo have held us.

Death ſhall do much for us; but the Reſurrection ſhall do more. Death ſends the ſeparated ſoul to Chriſt: but at his coming, both ſoul and body ſhall be glorified. There is ſomewhat in death that is penal, even to believers: but in the coming of Chriſt, and their Reſurrection, there is nothing but glorifying grace. Death is the effect of ſin, and of the firſt ſentence paſſed upon ſinners: but
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61147:134"/>
the Reſurrection of the juſt is the finall deſtruction of the effects of ſin. And therefore though the fears of Death may perplex us, me thinks we ſhould long for the coming of Chriſt, there being nothing in that, but what tends to the deliverance and glory of the Saints. Whether he will come before the general Reſurrection, and reign on earth a thouſand years, which ſome expect, I ſhall not preſume to paſs my determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But ſure I am, it is the work of faith, and Character of his people to <hi>love his appearance,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8 and to <hi>wait for the Son of God from Heaven, whom be raiſed from the dead, even Jeſus who delivered us from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.10. and <hi>to wait for the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.7. and <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
