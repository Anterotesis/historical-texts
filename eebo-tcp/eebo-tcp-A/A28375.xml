            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAving had the happineſs to be well acquainted with the Ingenious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this Treatiſe, while I ſpent ſome conſiderable time in <hi>Paris,</hi> in purſuance of thoſe advantages in Phyſick, which are now found there to be very great and extraordinary; by the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal care, and diffuſive munificence of the preſent Active Monarch; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Curious and Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther famous Univerſities, do now continually flock to <hi>Paris,</hi> for their better improvement; enjoying not only the pleaſure of this Author's good Converſation, but the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of his great Practice, in the
<pb facs="tcp:40248:3"/>
Cure of this Diſeaſe; Finding his Principles eſtabliſhed, not only by many good Ratiocinations, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by much Experience; And being an eye witneſs there, how well ſucceſs did anſwer his Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I have thought it not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uſeleſs to make <hi>England</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſame benefit of theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, that <hi>France</hi> did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by lately receive. And that <hi>France</hi> did indeed receive ſome benefit by this Book, we have reaſon enough to believe, if we can truſt the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the beſt Phyſicians there. For hardly hath Book been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with more numerous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations of Learned and Able men. The moſt Famous Faculty of <hi>Paris</hi> was pleaſed to atteſt the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of it, though I believe no Univerſity in the World is more cautious of admitting or approving
<pb facs="tcp:40248:3"/>
New Principles, or New Practice in Phyſick: None can keep cloſer to the Ancient Long-experienced Method than they. The King's firſt and chief Phyſician, the chief Phyſicians of the Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> and of Madam, the ſeveral Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons alſo of the Royal Families, and moſt eminent ones in <hi>Paris</hi> did all agree to put their Names to it, for to teſtifie their particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of this Book, and the great Uſefulneſs of theſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 'Twill therefore need no Rhetorick to recommend it to the Publick; the lamentable Practice, to ſay no worſe, that is here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed in the Cure of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, by many who do acquire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Reputation by nothing elſe but good ſtore of Confidence, will ſufficiently convince thoſe that read and underſtand it, of what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb facs="tcp:40248:4"/>
it may prove to the better performance of their undertakings.</p>
            <p>I know that the Author neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, before the publick appearance of this Work, whilſt his Deſign was the Subject of men's ill-grounded Diſcourſes, wanted not enemies in abundance to cenſure &amp; decry him; thoſe who were Maſters in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and had long and ſweetly taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pleaſant fruits, and plentiful rewards of men's unhappineſs and debauchery, became preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive; thought there was Treachery in the caſe; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to villifie the thing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon too, as much as they were able, 'till the Preſs had cleared, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed all their Jealouſies.</p>
            <p>Now the ſame exceptions may be made againſt its appearance in Engliſh, many may perhaps ſhrink, and fear ſome diminution of their
<pb facs="tcp:40248:4"/>
livelihood; others may indeed plead againſt our thus expoſing the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this, as well as other parts of Phyſick, to the ſmall underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every Good Woman or illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate pretender. The firſt muſt only be pitied, for that they build their Fortunes only on the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of others; but the latter may deſerve a more ample conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For many Sober and Learned men have been of the opinion, that our thus diſcovering all parts of Phyſick in the Language of every Goſſip, is far from being beneficial to the publick; that we hereby put edged tools into the hands of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and teach men to play too much with their own and others Healths.</p>
            <p>But if we well conſider what the moſt eminent Phyſicians in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages did in this matter, we ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:40248:5"/>
quickly diſſipate ſuch groundleſs fears, and reconcile our opinions to this Condeſcention to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Capacities. <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Celſus,</hi> and others, both Greek and Latine Oracles in Phyſick, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways write their works in Greek and Latine, becauſe thoſe were the Mother-languages of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys; and their Deſign was really to do their Countreys good. How eaſily do men grant, that every Good, the more it is communicated, the better it is! And certainly that man doth effectually do more good, who makes his labours conduce to the benefit of the Generality, than he who deſires to be Admired only in the Cloſets of Contemplative men, or the Schools of an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. The Honeſt Improvers of Husbandry, and Mechanicks, were the men Deified heretofore, and
<pb facs="tcp:40248:5"/>
that will ſtill deſerve Immortal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in all future Ages. <hi>Apollo</hi> could never procure that Favour for a man's being skill'd in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, or for the moſt admired Theories, that were uſeleſs, or little beneficial.</p>
            <p>And it is for this reaſon that I can never enough admire the truly No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deſigns of our Royal Society, who do not loſe their time in unty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frivolous Knots, and unfolding intricate Riddles: They take as large a proſpect into Univerſal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the Dioptricks of Man's Weak Underſtanding will give leave; and though the Subject of their Diſquiſition ſeems ſometimes low and mean, yet their end is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Noble and Great, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the advantages that can be deſired. I know giddy heads, and frothy ſpirits do often make
<pb facs="tcp:40248:6"/>
this Royal Aſſembly the ſport of their little Wits, and the mockery of ſuch as have as little underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as themſelves; but they may know, that long after their poor hearts are quite knaw'd with Envy, and become the proper food of Worms, this Auguſt Society will remain the Admiration of all Wiſe men, and the Glory of this Nation.</p>
            <p>It is not a little Obſervable, that the Ingenious Members of it have unanimouſly choſen to write their Works in Engliſh; and though they converſe or correſpond with all parts of the World, yet they chuſe to confine a little to us their vaſt Diſcoveries, and moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Improvements of Knowledg; which ſhews, they had rather do much real good at home, than make Oſtentation of Learning and gain Reputation abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40248:6"/>Now notwithſtanding what hath been ſaid on this Subject, though <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate their great Wiſdom in their plaineſt Language, and the moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious of this Age do ſo now, yet this muſt not be an encouragement for preſumptuous perſons to think themſelves hereby grow wiſe on a ſudden, or that the reading of this Book, will ſufficiently enable Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men to become Bold Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers. They are very much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, who think the printing of an Engliſh Diſpenſatory (as hath been of late years indeed done, but with the needleſs Additions of the moſt uncouth and ſilly Drollery, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Learned men have had the ill fortune to be abuſed in, and this by one who thought himſelf, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, abundance wiſer than ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly renowned a College, but
<pb facs="tcp:40248:7"/>
muſt expect to be thought ſo only in ſome poor Chimney-corners, and over the Winter-tales of ſome few harmleſs deluded people, who muſt be pitied as well as himſelf) 'tis not ſuch a buſineſs, I ſay, that can ſet up Good women for the Practiſing of Phyſick. Much ſweat, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Advantages, both Inward and Outward, God knows, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the right performing ſo weighty an employment. The moſt exquiſite Fabrick in the Univerſe, or the Anatomy of the Microcoſm, muſt be throughly underſtood; the moſt profound Principles of this Art muſt be maturely conſidered, and well digeſted in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; the Nature of Diſeaſes, their ſeveral Motions, and different Symptoms, be diligently ſearched into, either through thoſe great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances men uſually meet with in
<pb facs="tcp:40248:7"/>
other Countreys in all manner of reſpects, or the particular Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſome Friend here at home; the ſpacious Field of the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> muſt be often walk'd into, the many curious productions of Nature known, and the excellent Compoſitions that Art abundantly furniſhes us with, muſt deſerve Good Conſideration.</p>
            <p>If theſe things were but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently weighed, and the ſevere Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations that lye on every Honeſt man's Conſcience, to the right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what he undertakes of this high nature, were but a little ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought on, it might be able to deter many from ſo preſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venturing on the lives of others; and turning Mountebanks, with a few Receipts. It is a ſad and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reflection, what infinite miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, and frequent Murthers are
<pb facs="tcp:40248:8"/>
daily committed in this Great City, by thoſe who ſlily lurk in corners, or elſe, who impudently paſte their ſenſeleſs pretenſions in all the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but ſtinking places of the Town. And indeed it is a thouſand pities, that Able men had not more commonly a Declared Honeſty, and Known readineſs to ſupply the wants of the Multitude; who find themſelves in a manner conſtrained through the Pride and Avarice of ſome, and the Lazineſs of others, to commit the moſt precious of all Temporal Bleſſings, their Health, into the Mercileſs Hands, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Experiments of ſuch unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable Enemies to the Publick Good. But the College now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends in a ſhort time to prevent the encreaſe or continuance of theſe unhappy miſchiefs, by their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Care and Charity; and they may
<pb facs="tcp:40248:8"/>
thereby expect more bleſſing from Heaven on their daily endeavours. For let prophane Bravo's, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Naturaliſts, ſcoff, or ſmile, at the particular Dependence I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume every man's Health and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs certainly have on the Influence, and Providence of Heaven above us; if they will but ſeriouſly glance into the Hiſtory of their own paſt actions, and the moſt important e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of their lives, they'll be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confounded at their former fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſufficiently convinced of the the truth of what I aſſert.</p>
            <p>Thoſe therefore who love their Healths in earneſt, &amp; do not place it in the reach of Univerſal Pills, High-named <hi>Elixirs,</hi> and ſuſpected <hi>Arcanums,</hi> may be further pleaſed to know that Man's Body is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine of ſo very curious a Nature, that its Diſeaſes and Infirmities are
<pb facs="tcp:40248:9"/>
capable of as great variety of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and alterations, as there are infinity of different parts in it; that ſince Luxury and eaſe have ſo far prevailed upon us, as to render us uncapable of enduring thoſe hardſhips little Cottages do ſtill ſuffer, and thereby receive the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of; ſince there is ſuch variety of circumſtances in our ſeveral ways of living, and ſo great an inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy both in the quaility and quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of what we eat and drink, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes even of the ſame kind muſt needs have a very great Latitude, not only in different perſons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but even in the ſame perſon at different times.</p>
            <p>Nature doth ſufficiently declare the truth of this in the various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration of men's Faces; for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is ſo great curioſity ſhewn

in the outward contexture of ſo ſmall dimenſions, that not two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in all the World can ever be found exactly alike, if they are cloſely compared together; what may we then think, or how many little inſtruments muſt we imagine requiſite within us, for the orderly motion of the whole Maſs! We have no reaſon therefore to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that not only different Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but alſo particular perſons, we are once acquainted with, may be eaſily known, or diſtinguiſhed by their outward Geſt, and particular Martch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the ſubtil diverſity of their infinite little Organs, and various diſpoſition of the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, muſt needs incline them to very different motions.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not endeavour to fore-ſtall you with any Collection of the moſt conſiderable Remarks of this
<pb facs="tcp:40248:10"/>
Book. A very little Patience will be able to conquer them all. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſhall take notice to you, that he makes the Pox to be as Ancient as Fornication and Adultery; that wanton men in the days of Old were the Fathers of it, and Harlotry its Mother, when and whereſoever Beaſtlineſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs have much prevailed on the practice of men. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and Corruption of ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious a ſubſtance as is the Seed, is here ſuppoſed to degenerate into ſo high a malignancy, when the Seed of many different perſons do meet together in the Womb, are there cheriſhed by the natural heat, and at length exert their acttivities in this heterogeneous Fermentation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we may the eaſier conceive the truth of this, if we conſider what ſtrange and diſmall effects, how
<pb facs="tcp:40248:10"/>
numerous and dreadful Diſeaſes the Womb is often the Mother of, by Corruption of the Seed in one Woman alone; how much more exalted then muſt the putrefaction be, and the unhappy Parent of how degenerate an Off-ſpring, when the additional ſucceſſions of many new Corruptions do ſtill conſpire to the ſame end, and ſtill contribute to a further Advancement!</p>
            <p>Now though this and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things here, are very prettily conceived, and have my entire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of them, yet I would by no means be thought implicitely to embrace whatſoever is here eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, or at random defend all the delights of his thoughts, the ſcattered productions of his, or any man's wandering Fancy. Every man hath his roving, as well as lucid intervals; and though they may
<pb facs="tcp:40248:11"/>
very often be in the right, yet they may ſometimes be in the wrong too. We have all indeed our particular Talents, and it will be certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us, how we have employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or advanced them. It will not be enough for us ſluggiſhly to ſay, we have had ſuch or ſuch a Learned Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and carefully laid up the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he committed to our charge, unleſs ſome improvement be made of it, or at leaſt we ſhew our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make an encreaſe. I am very confident, nothing in all the World hath ever put ſo conſiderable a ſtop to the ſucceſſive career, true Science would daily make, as a blind Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, and mean ſubmiſſion to the dictates of perſons we have a good opinion of. And for this reaſon I cannot but commend, and admire the declared deſigns of ſome Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men among us; who, though
<pb facs="tcp:40248:11"/>
they do not tranſact Wonders eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Month, and ſhew themſelves Choſen Sons of Nature, yet ſure they deſerve good words at leaſt, and that Petulancy, with which ſome do daily nibble at them, might methinks be well ſpared. But to return again; as I do not profeſs my ſelf a Diſciple of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in all things he is pleaſed to utter; ſo I cannot but give him his due, and commend him much for his ingenious Attempts. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mercury be of ſuch abſolute importance to the cure of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, when Fermented a while in the Blood, and grown a little invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as this Author would have it; or whether the Ceremony of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Flux in ſome perſons of Quality, and eſpecially Women, be not the True and Latent Cauſe of their continual Indiſpoſitions, I
<pb facs="tcp:40248:12"/>
leave to every man to judge by his own Diſcretion and Experience. For my part, as I do not aſſent to thoſe who violently maintain, that nothing at all can be done without Mercury; ſo I much pity the poor Spirit of thoſe who think of it as a Hobgoblin; and are as apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of giving or receiving the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it, as they would be of meeting a hungry Lyon. Men ought indeed to be Wonderful Cautious, how they preſume to make uſe of ſo ſuſpected a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; yet he hath ſeen but little into the Nature of things, or is wholly involved in a popular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, who knows not, that Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, as quick as it is, may be tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Art; and may ſometimes, by Diſcreet Maſters, be very ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly employed to good purpoſe. I know 'tis very hard to ſpeak of this
<pb facs="tcp:40248:12"/>
ſubject without being miſtaken, on without being thought to have too great a kindneſs for it, if one doth not utterly Declare War againſt all who magnifie its effects: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I am ſure all knowing men will interpret what I have now ſaid, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably enough.</p>
            <p>There's a famous Doctor in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> one of the King's Profeſſors of Phyſick, but one who can never hear ſpeak of Mercury, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reckoning up twenty Mortal Diſeaſes it muſt needs be apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce: This perſon hath told me, when I took occaſion to ſpeak of the Salivation, that he hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Flux before ſome Doctors of his Faculty, without the aſſiſtance, or uſe of Mercury; and that he mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Ingredients, and gave them the Patient faithfully before their faces. The truth of it is, I had ſo
<pb facs="tcp:40248:13"/>
little Faith in the poſſibility of raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Flux, or at leaſt a ſufficient one, without Mercury; and had ſo much condeſcention, as rather to ſubmit with a complacent nod, than offer to diſpute ſo conſiderable, and perhaps beloved an aſſeveration, that I had not curioſity enough to enquire the manner how it could be done, though I know the perſon to be the greateſt enemy in the World to ſuch things as Secrets. But I am apt to believe, that thoſe Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diſeaſes he ſo zealouſly Fathers upon Mercury, do rather ariſe from the indiſcreet uſe of it, and groſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe that is eaſily made of ſo Active a Medicine; when Quacks or Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants boldly take it into their hands.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever is the Nature, and how dangerous or beneficial ſoever are the effects of Mercury, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Author of theſe Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:40248:13"/>
hath made a fair progreſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the clear Explication of its various Activities; and deſerves to be commended for ſo conſiderable a Deſign. If the French are able to begin well, &amp; lead the way with Courage, our Engliſh, I am ſure, can not only do the ſame, but be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful to them, in a brave proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of what they undertake. Let the French with their nimble Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſtart, and Invent things ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; the ſolid Judgment of an Engliſh man is required, to bring them to a due Perfection. As par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, ſo particular King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms have their peculiar Genius &amp; Abilities; we muſt, and ought to aſſiſt one another with our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications. One man's head is not big enough to comprehend, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently contain the vaſt extent of the Great, or Infinite Curioſities of
<pb facs="tcp:40248:14"/>
the Little World. And the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of this mutual correſpondence, and free intelligence among men, eſpecially of different Countreys, (whereby Envy and Jealouſie are not able to breed the Poyſon, they uſually do upon the ſame ſpot) puts me in mind of thoſe Advantages a Traveller may therefore meet with in Forreign Countreys, more than the Natives themſelves are capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to enjoy. For if he be not too raw and young, he ſhall eaſily gain admittance into the Cloſets of their moſt Ingenious men: all the Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they pretend to, and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they have made, will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by them, 'tis doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with more Ambition, of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Laſtly, all their <hi>Arcanums,</hi> and cloſe Reſerves of Knowledge, ſhall with a ſlight Promiſe of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, while among them, be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb facs="tcp:40248:14"/>
to his open view. The truth of what I now ſay, I have indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented more than I could any way pretend to, from ſeveral Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious perſons abroad, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly from the Worthy Author of this preſent Treatiſe; into whoſe Houſe, I had a long time free acceſs; there to ſee the ſeveral Degrees of the POX treated not Speculatively, but Practically, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Progreſs it uſually makes.</p>

Whence it comes to paſs that our Europeans have been pleaſed to call it American, Spaniſh, Neapolitan, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian, and French. Good men have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it the Name of the <hi>Shameful Diſeaſe,</hi> to render it the more odious unto all, or becauſe it hath really ſomewhat infamous in it, and is the mark as well as the fruit of Debauchery and lubricity. The Poets have given it the Name of <hi>Siphilis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have pretended a Shepherd of that Name was firſt infected with it. But it is now generally known in this part of the World under the Names of the <hi>Venereal Diſeaſe,</hi> or the <hi>Pox,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the parts which are ſubmitted to the influences of <hi>Venus</hi> have heretofore ſerved for its Origine, and do now more often than any others ſerve for its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; and becauſe it very often produces ſpots and puſtules on the skin, which are commonly ſuppoſed to be like thoſe of the Small Pox, though in good
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40248:18"/>
truth they have no ſimilitude at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But if there appears ſuch difficulty in giving it a proper Name that may be univerſally received, it will prove much more difficult to define it with all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary circumſtances to a regular Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reaſon it is ſo obvious to remark in its form almoſt all the kinds of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that Phyſicians uſe to ſpeak of; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed becauſe all the Accidents it produces are not able to furniſh us with one Eſſential Difference, they reſembling many others which nevertheleſs have Cauſes very different from that of this Diſeaſe. Wherefore the Definition that you'l here meet with is properly one of thoſe that may be called ſimply Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, or a Deſcription.</p>
                  <p>The Pox is a contagious Diſtemper occaſioned by Contact, and by means of a Venemous Salt, proceeding from the mixture and corruption of the Seeds of divers perſons, received and contained in the wombs of publick Women; by which all the liquid ſubſtances wherein it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes do thicken and corrupt the nerves, skin, and in general the fleſh to which it adheres, become prickt, gnaw'd, and dry; laſtly the bones and cartilages that it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40248:19"/>
penetrates, do riſe up, rot, and corrupt.</p>
                  <p>Some will perhaps ſay, that it might have been more exactly defined by a more comprehenſive <hi>Genus</hi> than Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſince the ſolution of Continuity, and a bad Conformation do accompany it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at all times; nay and that of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt Nature, which I might have choſen too, may ſeem to do better, but indeed would not have determined it ſo preciſely. For Diſtemper is abſolutely Eſſential to this Diſeaſe, whereas divers Examples may be given, which do prove it may ſubſiſt without ſolution of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, or a bad Conformation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they ought not to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but as ſeparable Accidents.</p>
                  <p>Now though this Definition be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long one, yet there is but little need of any ample explication. For though I do remark, for example, that the Pox is contagious by Contact, there is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of troubling you with the proof of this Truth, becauſe it is ſufficiently known to Phyſicians, and the moſt part of other Men; Again it may be eaſily remarked that the Venereal Matter is a Venemous Salt, only by making ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the effects which do reſult
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40248:19"/>
from its mixture, adhaeſion, or penetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And laſtly it may be eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that this Salt is partly Fixt, having the quality of Acids, and partly Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, as having that of Poiſons. It ſhould now remain to ſhew you how it can ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarily proceed from the mixture and corruption of the Seeds of divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But ſeeing this matter will be fully explicated in the following Chapter, ſpeaking of the cauſes of this Diſeaſe, I'll ſay nothing more particularly of it here to avoid needleſs repetitions; Let it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to tell you by the by, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which it contains are as probable as new, that they do agree throughout with the following Obſervations, and that they conſequently ought to be well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by thoſe who are deſirous to receive profit from them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As for, the Origine, or firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pox, nothing hath been ever canvaſſed with more heat, and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of opinion by the Authors who have written of it; ſome have maintained that it was an effect of God's Judgment on Men, and that the ſource of it was to be ſought only in the puniſhment that Men had drawn on themſelves by the Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40248:20"/>
of the laſt Age; Others have drawn it from the Indians, <hi>Spain, Naples,</hi> and other places, from whence they tell us it was not long ſince brought; Some have propoſed the carnal copulation of a Leper and a Strumpet, or the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Man with a mangy Beaſt; and others alſo have had particular Opinions on this ſubject, which we have reaſon to believe have as little truth in them, as thoſe I have already hinted at, becauſe all of them are either Theological or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous, and conſequently out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Phyſicians, who ought to have for their End nothing elſe but the conſervation of the Nature of Man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſimply as a reaſonable Creature; or elſe the deſtruction of what is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to it: Wherefore it may be ſaid that they ought not to uſe any other means to attain this end, but only ſuch as are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Natural, and that they ſhould not draw their Knowledges and Maximes but from things ſenſibly known.</p>
                  <p>In truth, if Natural Philoſophy ſerv's for a Baſis and Foundation to Phyſick, ought not Phyſicians to demonſtrate all things that depend on it, by the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Nature, or of Art that imitates
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40248:20"/>
Nature? And is not it very fit to leave Divines the conſideration of whatſoever is Supernatural, and alſo to the Poets by the ſame reaſon, all things feigned, Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical, and ſuppoſed? That we may the better obſerve the Rules now mentioned, and ſatisfy Reaſon it ſelf, by ſearching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Origine, Cauſes, and Remedies of all Diſeaſes, in the true Agents that have produced them, or may be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them: that is to ſay, in whatſoever cauſes the diminution, depravation, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolition of Natural Motions, or elſe in the Medicaments that can correct their Defaults; for otherwiſe we muſt be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to acknowledge Cures that are Miraculous, Magical, or Superſtitious for the Effects of Phyſick.</p>
                  <p>Moreover ſeeing the true Origine of the Pox is the ſame with that of its Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; that ſhall not be particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till the following Chapter, for the reaſon before marked, it ſeems the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt be ſent thither to learn the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it: Nevertheleſs as there have been at all times debauched Women, who have proſtituted themſelves indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to all ſorts of Men, it may here be obſerved by way of proviſion that the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40248:21"/>
Pox is almoſt as ancient as the World, and that its Origine ought to be drawn from the Impurity of the firſt Ages, in which it was but little leſs common than in the preſent times we live in; ſince the moſt ancient Phyſicians have ſpoken of all the Accidens that it produces, as well as other Indiſpoſitions that were then common &amp; familiar, and that they have known them as well as wee, under the Names of Heat of Urine, Gonorrheas, Virulent Ulcers, impure Buboes, dry Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtules, Tetters, Warts, and laſtly Nodes, and rottenneſs of the Bones.</p>
                  <p>We may alſo conceive that the ſettled inveterate Leproſie, which they ſpeak of as a Diſeaſe very rare and incurable, was what we now call Leproſie, and that the other ſpecies of ſimple Leproſies, which they have mentioned as very common, were the different impreſſions that Venereal Salts made upon the skin; ſince they were accompanied with the greateſt part of the other Accidents of the Pox, and that they were cured by the application of Mercurial Oyntments, which we now make uſe of to anoint and cure thoſe that are infected with the Pox.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:40248:21"/>But it is very likely, that the regulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which our Fore-fathers obſerved in their way of living, did render it more rare, and leſs apparent, than it is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes: As alſo it may be believed by the ſame reaſon, that the brutality of the Indians hath render'd them the more ſubject to it, and that the extreme heat they ſuffer in moſt places they inhabit, renders its Accidents more terrible, and apparent, by making the Blood boil more violently.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. THoſe who deſpiſe common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and affect to uſe terms extraordinary and unknown, to caſt (as they ſay) duſt into the eyes of their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40248:22"/>
Readers, divide the Cauſes of Diſeaſes into Occult and Manifeſt, Sympathick and Antipathick, in a word into Agents and Patients, to which they alſo often add by way of ſubdiviſion, thoſe which they pretend Efficient, Material, Formal, and Final; Primitive, Antecedent, and Conjunctive; Near, and Remote; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and External. Nay ſome Authors ſeem to ſtrain themſelves to divide things that appear indiviſible. Nevertheleſs it is obſerved, that theſe ſorts of Diviſions have no other profit, but to plung the minds of Men into confuſion, into igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and obſcurity, though they are, or ought to be taught with the deſign of inſtruction. An Example of this truth may be ſeen in the greateſt part of young Students, who often employ a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time to learn things that are either unuſeful, or of which they are not able to give any reaſon, whether it be that they do not underſtand them, or that they are really inconceiveable, and thoſe who write of them have not been able themſelves to conceive them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But that we may not fall into the like inconvenience, and to enlighten the matter I treat of, as much as it is capable,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40248:22"/>
I ſhall conſider but only two Cauſes of the Pox; to wit, that of its Generation, which conſiſts in the Mixture and Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Seeds of divers perſons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and retained in the ſame Womb; And that of its Communication, which conſiſts in the contact of impure Perſons.</p>
                  <p>It is ſo much the more neceſſary to prove the poſſibility of the former, as it is a new Opinion, that will conſequently be pretended falſe by thoſe who admit no Novelties at all: And I fear alſo that Reaſon and Experience do not furniſh us with proofs clear enough, to diſcover this truth before the eyes of Opiniators, that love rather to follow blindly what they conceive through prejudice, than take the pains to examine things, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh rightly the true from the falſe.</p>
                  <p>'Tis after this manner I reaſon on this Subject. Philoſophers, and generally the Learned, do acknowledge no conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able change in Nature, that is not made by a fermentation; of which no cauſe is found more evident than the motion and action of contrary Bodies: An Example of this truth, which may particularly ſerve for a proof of my Opinion, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Generation of perfect Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40248:23"/>
and principally in that of Man; for the Seeds of which he is generated do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not only the Idea and Form of all the parts, but alſo the good and ill Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, the Temperaments, and Natural Inclinations of thoſe from whom they are emitted; and this is ſo true, that the particles which convey theſe powers, act one upon the other, after the Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; and that Infants of the ſame Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are ſometimes Male, ſometimes Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, now like Father, another time like the Mother, and often partly like one, and partly like the other.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be true to ſay, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent qualities which are found in the Seeds of only two perſons may be agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo conſiderably, as to cauſe one to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rule the other, whileſt they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Womb, for Generation; that of a third perſon, which is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a little afterwards, may be lookt upon as a matter extraordinary, which muſt hinder Generation, or at leaſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it imperfect, by a more unequal mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſtronger agitation; this ſerves to perſwade me that Moles in Women may be as well the effects of Cuckolding, or Adultery as the production of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40248:23"/>
ſince it is known beſides, that the beſt Anatomiſts do eſteem great quantity of Menſtrual Blood (which is notwithſtanding another principle of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration) for one cauſe of this confuſion and diſorder: To which may be added, that it is by reaſon of this Confuſion that common Strumpets never conceive at all, though they often do the ſame with thoſe that have Children, &amp; perhaps alſo with more advantageous circumſtances; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the different Seeds that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, do cauſe a more vehement and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular fermentation, as they come from abundance of perſons, and are filled with a great many contrary and oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; from which fermentation there muſt conſequently proceed a very bad change, and further from Perfection, to which Nature doth always tend. On this ſubject it may further be obſerved, that Corruption is the change, which follows fermentations that are abſolutely againſt Nature; and it is eaſily to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how thoſe Seeds being mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, may paſs from their fermentation to corruption, almoſt at one and the ſame time, ſince this mixture doth render them improper for their Natural Uſe, and that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40248:24"/>
the heat and moiſture of the part which contains them, do quickly diſpoſe them to be corrupted. Now the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant thing that remains on this ſubject, is to let you ſee, how they can become Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous, that is to ſay, ſubtile, penetrant, and proper to coagulate and corrupt the Blood, as other Poiſons do. But as the Seed is generally acknowledged for the beſt part of our Blood, and every body knows, that Corruption is ſo much the worſe, as the matters corrupted were more pure and delicate before; It ſeems that this truth is ſufficiently proved of it ſelf, and that there is no neceſſity of ſearching Reaſons more ſtrong or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing to ſuſtain it. Nevertheleſs if we reflect on the great ſtore of Spirits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all the Seed is filled, and on the quality of the Part that receives them; we ſhall then ſee that there is no matter which can remain more Spirituous, and conſequently more Venomous after its Corruption; becauſe there is none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtor'd with Spirits, nor any more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently preſerved; this change being made in the Womb, which is a part Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally diſpoſed to receive the Seed, and conſerve all the parts of it: And what is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40248:24"/>
ſtill obſervable, is that in paſſing from its Natural ſubject into other ſubjects, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo much the more Venemous, as it hath paſſed a greater number of new Fermentations.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Furthermore, we may ſay of this Opinion, that it is one of thoſe that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well, be proved by any other way but our Reaſon, and that it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find ſubjects, on which Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments ſufficiently ſure and undoubted may be made; for beſides that the Pox doth not always appear, and that there are but few perſons who may be believed abſolutely pure and clear from it, there muſt therefore remain but few indeed who can be eſteemed proper for ſuch an Experiment. Nevertheleſs I ſhall here report an Obſervation, that meer chance was the cauſe of to one of my Friends, and which may alſo ſerve to prove my thoughts on this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>A young Girle of between 14 and 15 years of age, being purſued by her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who would needs beat her, throws her ſelf into the arms of one, who was a Brother of a certain Community of Workmen, eſtabliſhed in a part of the Town, that it is not neceſſary to name;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40248:25"/>
this Man conducts her to his Chamber, and forces her; he preſently communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the opportunity to him that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually lay with him, who failed not to make uſe of the occaſion, and to diſcover it alſo to another of his Camerades; in ſo much that in three days ſhe was there, ſix ſeveral perſons made uſe of her. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, the wiſeſt among them, foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this buſineſs was like to draw ſome dangerous conſequence, ſent her home again by a Woman, that feigned to have found her in a Church; her Mother preſently ſhuts her up in a Cloſet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no body was ſuffer'd to enter but her ſelf, and ſix days afterwards ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of great pains that ſhe ſuffered when ſhe made Urine; her Mother cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to be viſited, and was told that ſhe had got a Clap; nevertheleſs they neglected to make uſe of any Cure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not believe it, and twelve days afterwards there appeared a Bubo in her right Groin: then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to queſtion her about it, and ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the perſons ſhe had been with; they were all viſited by Order of Juſtice, and were all found clean, and in good health; And the Chirurgeon that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40248:25"/>
to me this ſtory, aſſured me that he had familiarly frequented their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a long time afterwards, and that he had never found any Venereal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper among any of them, though 'tis now twelve years ſince it hapned.</p>
                  <p>Though this Obſervation ſeems to be accompanied with all the Accidents that can be deſired, to maintain my Opinion, yet I do not pretend to make it paſs for a thing altogether unqueſtionable; both for that it is poſſible to be falſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there might have been ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Abuſes under equal and as good appearances, I therefore leave all curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons the liberty of making what other Experiments they pleaſe, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in particular that of judging the other circumſtances of this Opinion, according to their own Ideas, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Obſervations, as things Problema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and no way abſolutely neceſſary to the Art of curing the Pox.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. After having ſufficiently explicated what I mean by the Original Cauſe or Generative of the Pox, it is now neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to obſerve the ſeveral ſorts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, that can conduce to its Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, &amp; which are here conſidered as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40248:26"/>
Cauſes of this Diſeaſe, becauſe it is by them principally gained.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt not imagine that this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſe is always found in Coition, as the firſt; it matters not after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Contact is made, provided that it permits an adheſion or entrance to ſome part of the Venereal matter; it may be made either directly or indirectly, and here's an Example of it: A Woman with Child, who in the Company of one that hath the Pox, ſhall attract into her Womb, the corrupted Seed that ſhall be there ejaculated, will catch the Pox im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, by reaſon of the Coition and Contact that preceded; and the Infant that ſhall be in her Womb, will be alſo infected with it, by reaſon of the ſame Coition, but not by reaſon of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, becauſe the remoteneſs of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant hinder'd the Infection from being direct in reſpect of it. The ſame thing may be ſaid of Infants that are engender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of divers like Seeds, according to the ordinary courſe of Nature, or by way of Superfetation.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the Example that I juſt now gave, many other ſorts of Contacts may be found, which are made by other ways,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40248:26"/>
and yet fail not to cauſe the Pox: For Example, if one ſhould happen to drink after him that hath the Pox, and by chance put the Lips to the ſame place of the Glaſs, where ſome little Poiſon of the Ulcers of his mouth, or elſe ſome of his ſpittle fill'd with Venereal Salts, ſhall have ſtuck; it often happens, that this either cauſes other Ulcers, by ſuperficial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhering to the parts, or elſe without delay the univerſal Pox; when the Salt that they contain is volatil and penetrant enough to enter into the Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, without leaving any marks of its paſſage; for let ever ſo little of it be once mixt with the Blood, it will work like Leaven in a great deal of Dough, or rather it ferments and corrupts as other Poiſons do, which are always more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious by their quality, than by their quantity.</p>
                  <p>Another Example of this nature may be drawn from thoſe who are infected with this Diſeaſe, for having unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lain in the ſheets, wherein one in the Pox had ſweated, or in which there might remain ſome of the matter that run from his Ulcers.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe ſorts of Contact, all others
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40248:27"/>
may be ſaid to be immediate, becauſe they are made by the application of one part againſt another: Among them all the moſt ordinary is Coition, becauſe this Diſeaſe doth for the moſt part begin in the parts that ſerve for Generation, and its matter is not always diſperſed univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally through the Body: In this action, if a Man hath Venereal Ulcers on his Yard, ſome part of the Poiſon that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes them, and which is nothing elſe but a diſſolution of the Salts that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the Pox, doth almoſt always ſtick in ſome part of the Womb, or elſe in the wrinkles of the neck of her Womb, that he lies with, wherein he often cauſes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ulcers, by adhering to the skin, or <hi>pellicules</hi> that cover thoſe parts; on which matter it may be obſerved, that I have juſt reaſon to add this laſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by reaſon that this matter doth not always neceſſarily adhere in Women, either becauſe the Membrane that covers the <hi>Vagina,</hi> is very ſmooth, poliſhed, and cover'd with a ſlimy Humour, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Seed that is therein ejaculated doth often ſlide out at the ſame time, and carries away with it this Virulent matter ſo much the more eaſily, as it hath not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40248:27"/>
had time to adhere, and as the ſcituation and form of this part do much contribute to its eaſier ſliding out; it is alſo for this reaſon that common Strumpets do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give hurt to others, though they have none at all themſelves; becauſe the approaching them a little after they have enjoyed the Company of other men that are impure, doth give ſome part of the impurity they received, though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may be exempt from any adheſion, or effect of the remaining matter, by the means that I have mentioned.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable that a virulent Clap, and the univerſal Pox are able equally to render the Seed impure; in ſo much that if that of a Man who is infected with it, be attracted and retained in the Womb of a Woman, it may cauſe in her either a Virulent Clap by adhering particularly to the ſpermatick Veſſels, or elſe the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Pox, by paſſing through the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifices of the Arteries and Veins, that terminate in this part. In a word, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ſhall ſuffer ſuch Indiſpoſitions, may in like manner communicate them to a ſound Man, that ſhall converſe with her, by the adheſion or entrance of the matter that can cauſe them.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo obſerveable, that the Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40248:28"/>
of the Mouth of a little Infant that hath the Pox are able to infect the Nurſe, by adhering to her Teats, or elſe the air of his Reſpiration, that can eaſily pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate them through the pores that give paſſage to the Milk. In like manner an infected Nurſe can impart her Diſeaſe to the little One, by an adheſion of the matter of her Ulcers, or by the uſe of the corrupted Milk that is ſuckt from her Teats.</p>
                  <p>To ly with one that hath the Pox, and touch him naked while he ſweats, or when he hath Ulcers and Puſtules on his skin, is a thing that may well be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very dangerous, and chiefly for thoſe that have their pores very open, and therefore do eaſily receive the impreſſion of any thing that touches them. The cuſtom of Kiſſing with open Mouth, is another very dangerous buſineſs, for the reaſons I have ſpoken of. Laſtly, there are ſo many different Contacts which are capable of giving the Pox to thoſe who have it not, that when you ſhall once know it aſſuredly by its Signs, you need not trouble your ſelf but little about the manner how it was communicated, ſince you cannot always find it out,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40248:28"/>
and ſince it is often unknown, even to the perſons ſick themſelves.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. BEfore I come to ſpeak of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the Pox, it is good to acquaint you, that I do not conceive any different Species of it, nor own any Sanguine, Cholerick, Phlegmatick, and Melancholick ones, as ſome Men have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40248:29"/>
done; but on the contrary do always eſteem it as the ſame, in what degree, and whatſoever ſubject it may be found, ſince it is always produced by one and the ſame cauſe, that always acts after the ſame manner, and produces different Effects according to the various diſpoſition of the parts that receive its action.</p>
                  <p>This being once preſuppoſed, you will eaſily grant, that the differences of this diſeaſe can only be drawn from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of its degrees; that is to ſay, from the time that its matter hath been receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the progreſs that it hath made, and from the Accidents that it produces.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though I conſider the time that the Venereal matter hath been received, for one degree, from whence ſome differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Pox may be drawn; and that ſome Authors do think to aſcertain the Prognoſtick of it, by the conſequences they thence draw; yet it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that they are of no great conſideration. For though it may be ſaid that this Diſeaſe is either New or Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, according to the more or leſs time it hath been contracted, yet one cannot judge for all that of the eaſineſs, difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40248:29"/>
or impoſſibility of its Cure: becauſe this ſame matter is more or leſs active according to its quality or quantity, or elſe according to the particular diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Bodies, in which it enters. For 'tis certain, as I have already obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it becomes more Venemous, &amp; conſequently more penetrant &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, when it hath had duration in the change that may be made of it from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſubjects; and the great quantity of it doth very much advance the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is able to make, in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon. To which may be added, that it acts the more ſuddenly, when it is excited by the heat that is found in the Temperaments of Cholerick or Sanguine Bodies, which are ſo much the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſuffer its inſinuation, as their pores and other paſſages are naturally more open; but on the contrary it is ſometimes ſo fixt, and ſhut up in the cold, or groſs Humours of Phlegmatick or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick perſons, that it can lye there a long time like fire under aſhes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience lets us ſee, that it can lurk 10 or 12 years, before any effects of its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be felt; whence it follows, that the Judgment of the three Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40248:30"/>
I related, do chiefly depend on the examination that ought to be made, on the progreſs it hath already made, and the accidents it hath produced. For by the conſideration of the firſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Particular or Univerſal Pox may be judged of: and this diſtinction is of ſuch importance to the right pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſtick of the eaſineſs, or difficulty of its Cure, that it lets us ſee, in what degrees particular or common remedies may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or whether the ſtronger and more general are alſo neceſſary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Before we paſs further, it ſeems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper to explicate what I mean by this Difference, that I may let you ſee how it doth not ſerve only to diſtinguiſh the degrees of this Diſeaſe, and that it is not any way contrary to what I ſaid of it at the beginning of this Chapter. I do call then a particular Pox, when its mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth continue fixt to ſome parts, which ſuffer it to be dreſſed and cured with particular Remedies, external, or topical; and for which thoſe are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed chiefly that are called General, or Internal, as well as to hinder the progreſs it might make by the penetration of its Salts: ſuch are, for example, the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40248:30"/>
Ulcers and Chancres, or elſe Claps, and Virulent Gonorrheas; and which I call the Pox, as well as the others named before, becauſe they are all of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of an impure Contact, and of ſome Venereal matter received; of which all the effects may be obſerved, though it doth ſtill adhere to ſome particular parts, as well as when it is diſperſed over all the Body; for the coagulation and corruption that I have ſaid doth happen by it in the liquid ſubſtances may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Seed that runs in Virulent Gonorrheas, or elſe in the fixation of the Juyce that nouriſhes the parts in which the Venereal Ulcers are, that do by this means degenerate into Chancres, or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſities; The pricking, gnawing, or dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Fleſh, may be alſo obſerved in the beginning, augmentation, and changes of theſe ſame Ulcers; in a word, the elevation, rottenneſs, and corruption of ſolid parts are ſometimes the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of theſe firſt Evils, when they happen upon Bones or Cartilaginous parts; in ſo much that you may hence ſee with how much reaſon I do reckon them for degrees of the Pox, ſince it is commonly by then that it is found to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40248:31"/>
begin, and they are almoſt never ſeen to advance into a higher degree, when they ar<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> dreſt as they ought to be.</p>
                  <p>I do acknowledge nevertheleſs, that this name of the Pox was at firſt given to this Diſeaſe, only by reaſon of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance that was thought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the Small Pox, through their ſpots and puſtules; and it ſeems conſequently, that this Name ſhould then only belong to it, when it is in the degree that produces them. But we muſt obſerve, that it often paſſes from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to another, almoſt inſenſibly; ſo that ſometimes it cannot properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Name, if we ſtick cloſe to this Circumſtance; beſides it may be ſaid, that Names do not eſtabliſh the eſſence of Diſeaſes, and it matters not how this Diſeaſe is called, provided that it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as always of one Species accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my opinion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When the Venereal Salts are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile enough to penetrate through the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, without ſtaying in the places through which they paſs (as hath been ſeen in ſome perſons) or rather when they there ſtop, and cauſe the particular Poxes, of which I have ſpoken, without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40248:31"/>
taking care notwithſtanding to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe its inſinuation, by the means of fit Remedies that drive or attract from within outwardly; they then cauſe what I call the univerſal Pox, by inſinuating into the Veſſels that contain the Blood, and ſpreading univerſally over all the Body, by the Circulation.</p>
                  <p>They who have read the Authors that write on this ſubject, will wonder doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that I make the Venereal Salts paſs from the ſuperficial parts into the Veins and Arteries, without ſpeaking of that Species of the Pox they make conſiſt only in ſubtile Vapours and Spirits; but, as I have already told you, I cannot acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any different Species of it, and there is no reaſon beſides, for conſidering what they have propoſed on this ſubject, as one of its degrees, ſince it is not at all likely that theſe Spirits they pretend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, are able to circulate about the body, to penetrate the narroweſt pores, cauſe Itchings, Inquietudes, and fall of Hair, the conſequences of it, without mixing with the blood, by penetrating the Veſſels I now ſpoke of which are but too porous for this effect, and are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſperſed into all parts of the body.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:40248:32"/>5. Moreover it may be ſaid that the differences which may be drawn from the Accidents the Pox produces, are very conſiderable; for it may be ſaid to be Mobile, during the ebullition of the blood, the diſperſion and motion of its matter: that is to ſay, when it yet cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thoſe wandring pains, or other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that appear, and vaniſh away ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively one after another; and on the contrary, it may be conſidered as in a fixt condition, when this diſperſed matter doth adhere more particularly to ſome parts, out of which it is not able to get neither of it ſelf, nor by the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours that Nature uſes, unleſs ſeconded by proper Remedies, which alſo do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come uſeleſs, in thoſe that have their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and Principal parts much injured by the adheſion and action of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But as the diſperſion of it, as well as of all other Humours that are extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated, is cauſed moſt commonly in the Extremities; the moſt familiar Example of this degree may be obſerved in thoſe that ſuffer in the night fixt pains of theſe ſame parts, the elevation and corruption of bones and cartilages. Laſtly it may be ſeen by what I have ſaid, that theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40248:32"/>
are able to furniſh us with the moſt important conſequences for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter making a good Prognoſtick of the Pox; becauſe we can eaſily judge that the degree in which its matter continues ſtill in Motion, can be carried off with ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs enough, without leaving any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion at all of its ill effects; and on the contrary, we may judge it ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, where this ſame matter is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſtopt &amp; fixt, becauſe it hath made us ſee in ſome perſons all its effects on thoſe parts that are neceſſary to life, and it is alſo rarely carried off in thoſe I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for the ordinary Example, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving the ſad marks of its activity: ſince it is ſometimes impoſſible to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate thoſe parts that have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; for Example, the bones, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others thoſe of the Palate &amp; Noſe, which are often conſumed in this degree, and leave after their entire corruption very conſiderable deformities, that can never be repaired.</p>

                  <p>The Signs by which theſe things may be judged of, are the Symptomes that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company this Diſeaſe in all its degrees, and are of a very great number, and do therefore deceive ignorant Men, becauſe they do not all happen at a time, and Symptomes do often happen that much reſemble them, though they are indeed

This is that which gives, occaſion to Impoſtors to make but ill uſe of the credulity of thoſe that doubt of the condition they are in, and therefore find themſelves engaged in this uncertainty to ask Counſel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuccour of thoſe from whom they in Juſtice ought to expect it, if they had but Honeſty and Charity, which are things very neceſſary for all ſuch as do profeſs Phyſick.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon that I have to ſpeak after this manner <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Though I have learnt an infinity of Cheats of this nature, by the report of thoſe who have come to conſult me after others on this ſubject, and by what I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40248:34"/>
have ſeen my ſelf, by feigning my ſelf ſick, and ſeveral other ways; yet I will not by relating them encreaſe the bulk of my Book without profit, and I believe it will ſuffice, to relate ſome of the moſt remarkable of theſe Impoſtures, to ſerve for an Advertiſement or Warning to thoſe who may be for the future in the like perplexities.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The greateſt part of thoſe who think they know the World well, do believe themſelves ſufficiently aſſured, if they have eſcaped from falling i<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>o the hands of Empiricks, and ſuch as diſtribute ſecret Remedies; nevertheleſs it is too true that there are many of thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this ſort of Men, that are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Honeſt, but only in appearance, and do indifferently make profit of all the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions they meet with. This truth is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known to many curious perſons who have feigned themſelves to have the Pox, &amp; have found among thoſe I ſpoke of perſons that love their intereſt enough to confirm them in this Opinion upon the ſmalleſt ſuppoſitions; and I have ſeen my ſelf by chance that there are ſome among them, who do not ſo much as endeavour to hide their Impoſtures
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40248:34"/>
by affected appearances, but without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fear make ill uſe of the ignorance and eaſineſs of thoſe that go to conſult them, with a very ſtrange piece of confidence: The ſtory that I am going to relate may ſerve ſo much the better for a proof of what I here affirm, as it happened to a man of good credit, that is now living, and might be able to aſſert the truth of it. This man came to conſult me upon the account of ſeveral hard Puſtules, that grew over all his skin; Upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I made all the neceſſary remarks on his paſt Life, his Temperament, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition of his perſon, his Wife and Children; and by this examination I knew it was nothing elſe but what Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians call, the Gnawing or Corroſive Herpes, and I therefore propoſed to him the uſe of a Bath, and other Remedies both general and particular, that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſerve for the cure of this Diſtemper. But becauſe he was afraid he had the Pox, and people often think they have the misfortunes they are afraid of, he ſtill continued in the apprehenſion he was in before, and came to deſire me ſome few days afterwards to conduct him to ſome famous Practitioner, to ſee whether he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40248:35"/>
would joyn his Opinion with mine, that ſo he might be better aſſured what to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve of it. To this end I waited on him to a certain perſon, whom a fair ſhow of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Honeſty, ſtore of Riches, and a good Reputation of being an Able man, have aſſuredly placed above the common Rank, but was guilty nevertheleſs on this occaſion of an action altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of thoſe good qualities; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving leaſure to the Patient, or my ſelf, to relate thoſe things that the ſight cannot diſcover, without making any examination at all, and only after a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate inſpection of theſe Puſtules, he told him it was a very fine ſort of Pox, and therefore he had beſt preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve for a retreat of ſix weeks.</p>
                  <p>This new way of judging of Diſeaſes, will ſurely very much ſurprize all thoſe that ſhall make ſome reflections on the difficulty there is of knowing them, and chiefly thoſe Diſeaſes whoſe cauſes are abſconded in the ſecret internal parts, ſuch as is the univerſal Pox; ſince the difficulty of knowing them is ſometimes ſo great, that the moſt expert, profound, and moſt knowing Phyſicians, do happen to be miſtaken, in taking one for another;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40248:35"/>
and they do obſerve for this purpoſe, the common Rule of Lawyers, by which they do never offer to give determinate Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon the preſence of one Witneſs only. But beſides theſe conſiderations, it muſt alſo be remarked by the by, that thoſe words of <hi>Fine Pox,</hi> do ſhow at the ſame time both the ignorance, and quacking of thoſe who make uſe of them: But after all, this ſame Patient was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle afterwards comforted again by one that proved more honeſt, who after an ample knowledge of the circumſtances I related, gave the ſame Name to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe that I had done before, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to thoſe Remedies that I had propoſed to him, by the uſe of which Remedies he was quite cured in a ſhort time. Moreover it may be ſaid, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt was the ſole Motive of this treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous dealing; for there is no likelihood that the ambition of appearing a great Doctor, ſhould have been the cauſe, ſince he might have appeared ſo much more by reaſoning on the Diſeaſe, than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing ſuch fine words. Nor is there any reaſon to believe he did it to render me a good Office, ſince Offices of ſo high a nature are but ſeldom done without
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40248:36"/>
the hopes of receiving equal ones again, and we two were not of Intelligence enough for that. Therefore it is much more likely, he thought with himſelf that I deſired to put this perſon under his hands, for ſome particular conſideration, and ſo he might have no other thought but of embracing the occaſion offered.</p>
                  <p>Beſides thoſe that engage credulous perſons to ſuffer the Salivation, when there is no neceſſity of it, there are alſo a great many Mountebanks to be found, who give a falſe Judgment of the Pox, and perſwade men they have it when they are altogether free. The eaſineſs they have found in perſwading men ſo, hath given them encouragement for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſort of cheating: They cauſe Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets to be diſtributed in moſt parts of the Town, and clap up papers in the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted places, nay and ſometimes preſume to write little Pamphlets, filled with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but follies and lyes, wherein they confidently boaſt that they are able to cure the Pox, without Mercury, without garde, or keeping their Chamber; and they have ſo much the more eaſily found perſons who will believe them, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Impoſture ſomewhat likely by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40248:36"/>
their own miſtaken Experience, as there are many perſons who think themſelves ſick of this Diſeaſe, when they do really enjoy moſt perfect Health. But that which plainly ſhows us it had not ſubſiſted hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto but only by this means, is that they are known to give the Salivation to thoſe they think really in the Pox, for they do then ſuppoſe their Diſeaſe in a degree almoſt deſperate, and they are not able conſequently to cure them, but by making uſe of this Remedy, which they make paſs for the extreme one of all, and do nevertheleſs very familiarly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it under this diſguiſe, with ſuch a conduct as muſt always be believed very dangerous, in thoſe that have learnt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it but by Receipt.</p>
                  <p>Though this Impoſture be the more common and ordinary of all, yet it muſt not be eſteem'd the only one, and there are ſome among them that do practiſe another ſtill more remarkable. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Accidents thoſe that have the Pox do ſuffer, when they addreſs themſelves to theſe men, they will always aſſure them they have no ſuch thing as the Pox, and ſo will promiſe to cure them with ſuch Remedies as they call pleaſant, mild
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40248:37"/>
and inſipid, but are always notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtrongeſt and moſt violent Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſicks, Purgatives, and Vomitives, that do extremely exhauſt and dry up the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to make the Accidents ceaſe, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the ſeroſities that are ſpred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and are the Cauſes of them; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that theſe Patients find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cured in all appearance, till the next ebullition of the Blood begins again, and there happens a new diſperſion of the matter that is able to produce other Symptomes, which they then make paſs for unhappy Relapſes, or elſe new Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that muſt undergo a new Cure. So that theſe perſons thus affected do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with continual profit, as Cows with Milk, and a ſmall number of them will be able to provide them Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough.</p>
                  <p>But among all thoſe that impoſe on credulous perſons, there are none that make uſe of a more abominable Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, than theſe that follow; for they do endeavour to perſwade all their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients that apply to them for help, that all their bodies are filled with Mercury, or elſe with Venereal matter, that muſt be driven out as faſt as may be, if they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40248:37"/>
desire to eſcape death; and to convince them of the truth of this ſuppoſition, they tell them, they ſhall preſently ſee abundance of Impurities come out of their bodies, ſo ſoon as ever their Remedies begin to be applied. In effect, as this pretended Remedy is nothing elſe but an Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment applyed on their skin, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of <hi>Cantharides</hi>; this promiſe of theirs ſeems true to many men, becauſe it raiſes Bliſters full of ſeroſities, that ſeem to come through their pores, and becauſe it makes them Urine prodigiouſly, nay often blood it ſelf, by cauſing an inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and exulceration of the Bladder, which are mortal Accidents.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But after having ſufficiently ſpoken of the falſe Judgments of Impoſtors, and the means they make uſe of for commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Abuſes, it is time to let you ſee what are the true Signs that candid men muſt take notice of, for to judge aright of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Signs may be divided into ſuch as are known to the Patient alone, and ſuch as are ſenſible both to Patient and Phyſician.</p>
                  <p>The former are the impure Contacts that have preceded this Diſeaſe, the

pains they feel while they Urine, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes, and univerſal Itchings, the loſs of Appetite, the indifference for Coition, the Nocturnal pollutions without plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the ſuppreſſion of the Terms in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or of the regulated <hi>Hemorrhoides</hi> in ſome men: Laſtly the mobile or fixt pains of the Head, the Shoulders, and Extremities.</p>
                  <p>The latter Signs are Gonorrheas, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes or Poulains, Ulcers, and Chancres of the Yard, and of the Privities of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; or elſe the hardneſs that remains after their Cicatrices, the fall of Hair from Head and Beard, the Wounds and Ulcers that cannot be cured with ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Remedies, the Tetters, Puſtules, and Warts; laſtly the Elevation, Rotteneſs, and corruption of Bones.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt be ſure to obſerve that all, or moſt of theſe Signs that I have named, are but Accidents of the Pox it ſelf; that it produces not all of them at all times, nor in all ſubjects, and that they become different according to its divers degrees; in ſo much that they do not happen always in a conſtant and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Order. For there have been ſome perſons ſeen, whoſe bones have rotted
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40248:38"/>
with the Pox, before ever any of thoſe Accidents, Authors do call Antecedent, have been at all felt; which Accidents I had rather call Conſequent, becauſe they do moſt commonly follow thoſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the particular Poxes, of which I have ſpoken. Nevertheleſs as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to make a good Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe, without being able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh all the degrees it can happen in, it will be neceſſary to reflect on all that hath been already ſaid, to the end we may the better find, how it paſſes out of one degree into another, and why in each particular one it doth produce very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Symptomes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It may with Reaſon be ſaid, that the Ulcers which are cauſed by impure Contacts, do conſtitute the firſt degree of the Pox, becauſe they are the effect of ſome matter that very ſuperficially ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres; they cannot be diſtinguiſhed from ordinary Ulcers at their beginning, but by the preceding Contact, and the parts in which they happen; and they may be cured in this condition with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary Deſiccatives. But when the Salts that cauſed them, cannot be deſtroyed by theſe or other means,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40248:39"/>
they then penetrate into the Veſſels that contain the blood, or elſe mix with the Natural moiſture that remains in the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer'd part, and fix it in ſuch manner, that from Ulcers they degenerate into Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres; and then indeed they are much more dangerous and hard to cure, but are known by the elevation of their white ſides, by their obſcure colour, and by their hardneſs.</p>
                  <p>You may eaſily judge that Claps, or Virulent Gonorrheas, are of a yet higher degree than the Ulcers I now ſpoke of; becauſe the matter that makes them is more deeply driven into the bodies of thoſe who ſuffer them, and the parts that are infected with them are ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and concealed: The Bladder, for Example, and the parts adjacent or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on it, are the firſt that ſuffer the Inflammation, which is ſufficiently known by the heat and pains that are felt in urining, and ſometimes by an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſuppreſſion of the Urine; the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts, and the Seed it ſelf are not more free from an Alteration, ſince the loſs, thickneſs, &amp; corruption of the Seed, are undoubted marks of it. Laſtly the paſſages through which theſe Impurities
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40248:39"/>
are carried do not long remain free from their ill effects, but become exulcerated by the ſharp points of the Salts they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and this exulceration doth cauſe them to ſuffer very grievous pains, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the paſſage of their Urine.</p>
                  <p>While this particular Pox is but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contracted, it can be cured with a great deal of eaſe and ſafety, by prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which we ought otherwiſe to fear, and taking away whatſoever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, by the uſe and application of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedies to this effect. But when it hath had a conſiderable duration without neceſſary ſuccour, it muſt be then believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of a much more difficult and dangerous Cure, becauſe all its Accidents become greater, and the further pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration if its matter, that is, the univerſal Pox, may be then with juſt Reaſon ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected. Therefore it muſt then be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more care and precaution, and the Prognoſtick that is made of it muſt be more doubtful.</p>
                  <p>We may now obſerve that the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Salts do often paſs from the parts I ſpoke of into the orifices of the Veins and Arteries, and do ſometimes penetrate more directly by the ſubtilty &amp; keenneſs
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40248:40"/>
of their points. Nevertheleſs what way ſoever they enter, it is always true, that they cauſe in ſome a great ebullition of their blood, either by the particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions they find in it, or elſe by their own deleterious quality; during which ebullition, the Impurities do ſeparate, much after the ſame manner as Lees do in the fermentation of Wine, and ſo are driven out after a while by the force of Nature, or, if you will ſo, by the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Expultrive into the Glandules of the Groins, where it cauſes a Bubo, or Botch, that ſerves for a <hi>Criſis</hi> of the Pox, if it be attracted and brought to perfect Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>It may be diſtinguiſhed from other Tumours, that ſometimes happen in thoſe parts, by the impure Contact that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded it, by the Claps, Gonorrheas, Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and Chancres, that often happen a little before its diſcovery, but principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by its ſlow advancement, its durity, and large Baſis.</p>
                  <p>But this penetration of the Venereal matter into the maſs of the blood, is not always attended with ſo happy ſucceſs as the extruſion of ſuch a Tumour: the Venereal Salts do ſometimes participate
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40248:40"/>
more of fixt than volatile, and the blood is not equally hot and ſubtile in all ſorts of men, ſo that in ſome it preſently coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates by this means, much after the ſame manner as ſome curious perſons have experimented, by ſyringing Acid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quours into the Veins of Brutes; and this coagulation is often the Cauſe of thoſe ſuppreſſions I took notice of, and of their loathing all Meat, a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of their indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as to Coition, becauſe whil'ſt it continues, the Circulation grows very ſlow, and conſequently the Natural Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that depend on it, become inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Wherefore this time may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for another degree of the Pox, that can nevertheleſs be clearly carried off, by the inward Sudoriſicks, which do diſſolve and attenuate the blood, by new ebullitions, provided that Nature be alſo aſſiſted in her other evacuations.</p>
                  <p>At the time that this coagulation of the blood ceaſes, by the ſeparation of the different particles it then contains, we may conſider the beginning of its fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, which is performed ſo much the more gently, and by degrees, as it met before with Obſtacles to hinder it; whence it comes to paſs that this blood
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40248:41"/>
doth but only riſe and boil by little and little, though indeed this gentle ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fails not nevertheleſs to cauſe Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes very much different from thoſe I have already ſpoken of, and ſuch as I ſhall remark hereafter. For whil'ſt it laſts, light vapours ariſe from it, that are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all over the body, and do cauſe thoſe inquietudes of mind, and body, thoſe Itchings of <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> skin, and fall of the Hair from the Head and Beard.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore this time may be alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as another degree of the Pox, wherein nevertheleſs it may be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, as well as in the former, by a good uſe of ordinary Remedies, or elſe by a Critical Motion of ſome other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſupervening. But as theſe means do fail ſometimes of the deſired effects, it were much better in this condition to provoke a light Salivation, by which a quick, eaſie, and aſſured Cure may be hoped for.</p>
                  <p>When the fermentation encreaſes, or that it is in its height, the Venemous ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſities do ſeparate from the blood, and paſs <hi>á travers</hi> the coats of the Veſſels that contain it, after which they ſlide along, the Nerves and Membranes, and cauſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40248:41"/>
thoſe wandring pains that are felt now in one part, and now in another; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo Nature ſtrives to drive them forth through the pores; but as theſe ſeroſities are heavy and full of Salts, they adhere to the skin inſtead of going forth, and there cauſe Ulcers when they are mixt with ſome corrupted matter; or if on the contrary they are chiefly charged with fixt Salts, they there raiſe puſtules, that are flat, ſcaly, dry, and of a red drawing towards an Orange colour; or elſe if they are fill'd with volatil Salts, they riſe ſomewhat higher, and produce hard Tetters and Warts upon the Yards, privities of Women, the Groin, and other places.</p>
                  <p>This degree of the Pox is not the moſt difficult of all to be cured, but it is known very well by experience that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Mercury among Remedies that is able to excite the <hi>Criſis</hi> that can termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it.</p>
                  <p>Oftentimes after theſe matters have been thus wandring about the body, they altogether adhere and abſolutely ſtay in ſome parts, and cauſe by this means the laſt and moſt terrible degree of the Pox. For though their adheſion doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40248:42"/>
happen only in the Muſcles and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riostium,</hi> they fail not to cauſe moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Accidents, becauſe by prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gnawing, and continually drying the nervous Fibres of theſe parts, they there produce thoſe fixt and nocturual pains, ſome perſons have found inſupportable. The Cartilages, and eſpecially the bones, are alſo other parts that ſuffer great changes by their penetration; for they cauſe a ſort of fermentation in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or Juyce they contain, by the means of which Tumours are ſeen to happen, that are called <hi>Nodes,</hi> and which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an elevation of their very ſubſtance, that is at laſt rotted and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the preſence and action of theſe Impurities.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs though the Pox is very hard to cure, when its matter is thus ſtopt, and ſunk into the parts I named, it may be obſerved that it would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways curable even in this degree, if this ſame matter were not ſometimes ſtuck to parts that are ſtill more conſiderable. But it hath been unhappily proved in ſome Men, that the parts which are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Noble, and thoſe that immediately adminiſter to the Noble ones have not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40248:42"/>
been exempt from its activity and cruel effects. Wherefore the Prognoſtick that may be made of it, is ſo ſad and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it always conſiſts in judging the extraordinary difficulty, or elſe impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Cure.</p>
                  <p>But beſides the general Conſiderations that I have marked, for making a good Prognoſtick of the Pox in, all its degrees, there muſt be reſpect had to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circumſtances of each ſubject, as, for example, to the Temperament, Sex, Age, Strength, and alſo Employment of him we pretend to cure. For I have known by Experience that the inquietudes which important affairs do give ſome men, do heat and inflame the Spirits, and thereby cauſe the Mercury to enter into the Brain, where it finally cauſes moſt deplorable Accidents.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. AFter having thus remarked all the general things that I have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40248:43"/>
neceſſary for the underſtanding thoſe that more particularly relate to the Art of curing the Pox: It is now time to ſpeak of its Remedies, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that muſt be obſerved for the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them well and without danger. And ſeeing the matter that cauſes the Pox doth in a manner always adhere to ſome particular parts, before it advances to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the whole body; ſome Reflections ſhall here be made in the firſt place on the means of curing it, while it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue particular, and on the Preſervatives that ought to be uſed for hindring its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Univerſal.</p>
                  <p>But to the end we may avoid uſeleſs Repetitions, I ſhall ſay nothing more in general of particular Poxes, nor of the Reaſons for which I have ſo named them, becauſe theſe things have been already ſufficiently explicated, when I ſpoke of the Differences and Signs, which may ſerve for the Knowledge and Prognoſtick of all the degrees of this Diſeaſe. It will ſuffice to ſay here, that they maay be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſuch as appear only in the parts that may be ſeen and touched, and into ſuch as happen in other parts that our ſenſes cannot diſcover: ſo that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40248:44"/>
to this Diviſion, different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies may be given the more ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as occaſion requires.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The firſt are the Ulcers and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, which are cauſed by a light and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial adheſion of ſome matter, that hath not penetrated more inwardly. I add this diſtinction, becauſe I do not now intend to ſpeak of thoſe that are made in the Ureter, by the paſſage of Virulent matter in Claps or Gonorrheas; nor of ſuch as are the Symptomes of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Pox, ſince the manner of treating them is much different, and that they do depend on other degrees.</p>
                  <p>This particular Pox is nothing elſe in the beginning, but the ruption or dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration of the ſuperficial Fibres of the skin, or <hi>pellicules</hi> that cover the parts to which the matter doth adhere; ſo that no other Name muſt conſequently be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it, than that of Venereal Ulcers: eſpecially if we will not do like Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants or Impoſtors, who make the ſmalleſt Excoriations paſs for Chancres of a moſt difficult cure, and they do not indeed cure them, but with a great deal of pains and time, becauſe they dreſs them with cauſtick burning Medicines, which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40248:44"/>
make them become very painful, hard, and apt to ſuppurate, though oftentimes the gentleſt deſiccatives are ſufficient to cure them in three or four days.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Ulcers may indeed happen in all parts of the body, becauſe they are all capable of an impure Contact, but the more tender and delicate ones are moſt ſubject to them, by reaſon that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Salts do more eaſily ſtick in their ſuſceptible ſubſtance; whence it comes to paſs, that the Yards in Men, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities in Women, the Teats in Nurſes, and the Mouth in Infants, are the parts which are moſt commonly infected with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That which ought to be done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Cure while they are in this condition, conſiſts principally in drying them up like other Ulcers, only regard muſt be had to the matter that cauſes them, and proper Deſiccatives employed for breaking the points of the Salts they contain, and to oppoſe their penetration, which is ſo much the rather to be feared, as it is done inſenſibly.</p>
                  <p>The following Liquours will very well anſwer this firſt reſpect, if you waſh the Ulcers twice a day with them, and lay
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40248:45"/>
Tents upon them, that are dipt in theſe Liquours, obſerving always to give ſuch a ſtrength to them as is moſt agreable &amp; proper to the particular Temperaments of the bodies and parts, on which you ſhall apply them, and this by encreaſing the quantity of Pouders to render them the ſtronger, or elſe that of the Waters to make them the weaker.</p>
                  <p>Take of the ſeventh Water of unſlakt Lime one pound, Spirit of Vitriol, Salt of Saturn, and Verdegreaſe, of each half a drachme.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe, Roſe and Plantain Water, of each half a pound, Aqua-vitae two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Orpiment a drachme and a half, Verdegreaſe two ſcruples, Aloes half a drachm.</p>
                  <p>Or again, white Wine a pound, Roſe and Plantain Water, of each four ounces, Orpin two drachmes, Verdegreaſe one drachm, Mirrh and Aloes of each a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Make the Liquours according to Art, for the uſe above mentioned.</p>
                  <p>To anſwer the ſecond reſpect that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, you muſt uſe both Purgatives and Diureticks, if the Ulcers are upon the Yard of a Man, the Genitals of a Woman, or about the Groin of either of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40248:45"/>
them; or elſe you may uſe inwardly Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriſicks, that drive from the Center to the Circumference, if they are in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It muſt be eſpecially obſerved, that the Purgatives, which you ſhall make uſe of for this effect, be ſtrong enough to move Nature, and help it to drive by Stool any impure matter that might have penetrated a little more inwardly, than the Ulcers which appear to you; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that they be not violent enough to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Humours from the remoter parts; for this attraction would help the matter to make a further penetration, then it would otherwiſe have been able to do of it ſelf, and ſo cauſe by this means the univerſal Pox, which you do endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to avoid: And here you may take notice that the greateſt part of Men are themſelves the cauſes of the frauds and deceits that are done to them; for there are very many who will never think themſelves well purged, unleſs they have felt exceſſive pains, and cruel gripes in their guts, and unleſs they go to Stool fiveteen or twenty times at leaſt: though to ſpeak the truth, Nature can never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure theſe extraordinary and violent
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40248:46"/>
Motions without the diminution or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of their Functions, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs are the principal Agents in the ſeparation and expulſion of Impurities.</p>
                  <p>If you deſire therefore to avoid theſe exceſſes, you'll find nothing more ſafe than an Infuſion of Senna with Salt of Tartar, in which you may alſo diſſolve the Syrups of Roſes or Peachflowers; proportionating the doſes to the age and ſtrength of the Patient you take in hand.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Diuretiks you muſt make uſe of to repel by Urine, are Cryſtal Mineral, which you may give from half a drachm to two or three, and the Spirits of Vitriol and Sulphur, from ſix to thirty drops in Pellitory Water, or an Aperitive Pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanne, you may prepare with the Roots of Strawberries, wild Succhory, Graſs and Dandelion.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of Parſly, Fennil, Sperage, and Reſt-harrow, are much more aperitive than the former, and divers forms of Pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſannes may be prepared with them, that are uſeful indeed to ſome, but may have very ill effect on perſons extremely hot and dry, as well as Radiſh-ſeed bruiſed, and taken in white Wine, which is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a moſt powerful Aperitive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:40248:46"/>For the Sudoriſicks that are taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, you may ſucceſſively make uſe of the Spirit of Harts-horn, which you may give in half a Glaſs of Carduus-water, from ſix to twenty drops, or a like number of grains of its volatile Salt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in the ſame Water.</p>
                  <p>But among all you'll find none to have a greater effect than the Pouder, or vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt of Vipers, if you give the firſt from ten to thirty grains, and the latter from five to fiveteen, in equal parts of Cinnamon and Carduus-waters, or in the Water that remains in the diſtillation of this ſame Salt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It remains to ſay, that theſe Evils do not long continue under the Name of Ulcers ſimply; for it is well known that the matter which cauſes them doth ſometimes inſinuate more deeply, and by this means doth make another degree of the Pox; but it more often happens, that by long continuance in the exulcerated part, it makes the Ulcers turn into Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, after the manner I ſpoke of before. Wherefore it is good to obſerve, that you dreſs them in this condition with Eſcaroticks and Suppuratives, becauſe you muſt conſume the hardneſs that is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40248:47"/>
found in them, for fear of leaving a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the parts, that might produce af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a far greater Evil, than you are going to deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>They who follow the ordinary Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in this caſe, are content to apply Red Precipitate, which in truth makes a skar when it is good, but that a light and ſuperficial one, ſuch as is not able to hinder the hardneſs from encreaſing in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and profundity, and from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining alſo after their Cicatrice, what time ſoever is employed towards their conſumption.</p>
                  <p>Some do make uſe of ſublimate Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive, but beſides that it cauſes intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pains during the Operation, it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts watry fluxions on the parts it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to, which are very hard to diſſolve, and do beſides diſpoſe the parts to a Gangrene, and this principally in thoſe parts that are near the paſſages which ſerve for expulſion of the Excrements.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes of theſe misfortunes, and many others, is an Errour of ſome ancient Authors, that every body may eaſily be convinced of, yet hath nevertheleſs been received by way of Tradition, by the greateſt part of thoſe who have written
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40248:47"/>
ever ſince, or do ſtill write on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; according to which Errour they repreſent Quickſilver to be like a Ferret that goes and ſearches out the Venereal matter in all parts of the body, for to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel it thence preſently, as this little Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal doth the Connies out of their Holes: For which Opinion nevertheleſs they have had no other proof than an indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate prejudice, that hath for its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation nothing but pretended occult and ſpecifick qualities, which no body can underſtand. Nevertheleſs we know they look on no other Remedies to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than to be impotent of unuſeful for theſe ſorts of Maladies. And ſo we muſt not at all wonder, that they are ſo ſtiff and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory, in never making uſe of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſticks than ſuch as are made with Mercury, which in good truth is the moſt aſſured Remedy for raiſing the <hi>Criſis</hi> of the univerſal Pox: but this only by reaſon of ſuch Motions and Actions, as may be determinate and known. Whatſoever is the truth of it, you'll find by Experience, that the Cauſtick Stones, which are prepared of unſlackt Lime, and the <hi>Cineres Clavellati,</hi> have a much more certain effect, ſince they cauſe a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40248:48"/>
skar more profound than Red Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and act with leſs pain than Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Corroſive.</p>
                  <p>You muſt uſe them notwithſtanding with prudence and diſcretion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that a part already exulcerated is more eaſy to penetrate, than when it is covered with its skin; and conſequently you muſt uſe them in a ſmaller quantity, and they muſt be limited to fit places on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by means of a Plaſter with a hole in the middle of it, of the exact bigneſs you deſire to make your skar, and this to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Salts from overſpreading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, after they have been diſſolved by the moiſture of the Ulcer.</p>
                  <p>But if you will be ſtill more aſſured in what you do, you may then make uſe of the <hi>Lapis Infernalis,</hi> with which you may ſee and conduct the Operation as it were in an inſtant.</p>
                  <p>After having made a skar by ſome of theſe means, but more particularly by the two laſt, you may procure the fall of it with the common Suppurative, in which you may afterwards mix a little Red Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, and burnt Alum, to encreaſe the Suppuration, and conſume the hardneſs that may remain. But if it is conſiderable
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40248:48"/>
or you have to do with a body Dry and Melancholick; you may add with good ſtore of the foreſaid Ointment, a little Sublimate Corroſive, and waſh the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer every time you dreſs it with the laſt Collyre of Liquour I deſcribed, adding a little Aegyptiack when there is need, to make it more deterſive.</p>
                  <p>You may alſo lay over the Tents the Plaſter of Mucilages, in which you ſhall have mixed 4 or 6 ounces of Mercury for every pound, and rub the places about the part with the Neapolitan Ointment double or treble of Mercury, in the mean time not forgetting the Purgatives that you muſt reiterate on this occaſion, as well as the other general Remedies I have propoſed for a preſervation from the univerſal Pox.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When theſe ſorts of Miſchiefs are on the Yard of a Man, there happens ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>Phymoſis</hi> to the prepuce, either by the Patient's negligence, or the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of him that takes the cure in hand, and this hinders him from being able to uncover, or dreſs the Ulcers or Chancres that are underneath. The common way of remedying this Accident, is to make one or two Inciſions, and this Operation
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40248:49"/>
is ſo much the more ſubject to unhappy conſequences, as the part is already affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and therefore more diſpoſed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Fluxions; and therefore you will do much better to try ſome Emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient Fomentations, and Cataplaſms, that you may prepare with the Decoction and Reſidence of Mallow-leaves, Roots of Marſh-Mallows, and Lin-ſeed, not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the frictions of the Ointments, and application of the Plaſters I named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. During which, you muſt mundifie the Ulcers, and Chancres, as well as you can, with the Collyres or Liquours before deſcribed; of which Liquours you may often make Injections under the Prepuce, with a little Syringe, obſerving to ſtretch it by little and little with your fingers, by drawing it toward the root of the Yard, as often as you dreſs your Patient, till the Gland becomes again wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; but all this muſt be done ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gently, and without any violence, for otherwiſe there will happen a <hi>Paraphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſis,</hi> which is an Accident much worſe than the former; for beſides that the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi> is ſuffocated, and cannot by any means be uncovered, this ſuffocation cauſes ſuch a pain, as preſently draws
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40248:49"/>
Fluxion, Inflammation, and Gangrene, if all poſſible care be not ſuddenly uſed.</p>
                  <p>Some have indeed very happily cured this Indiſpoſition, by only bathing the Yard or Belly in cold Water, but this principally in its beginning.</p>
                  <p>All the Remedies deſcribed againſt the <hi>Phymoſis</hi> are alſo uſeful in the <hi>Paraphymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> when there is time to make uſe of them. But oftentimes one is obliged to practiſe and prefer the Inciſions before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the other.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſhall not ſay any thing of the means how to cicatrize the Ulcers and Chancres, ſince they do principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in mundifying them well, and Nature labours enough of her own accord to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite the divided parts, when the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician knows how to remove the Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. THe other particular Poxes, which I have ſaid do happen to the parts our ſenſes cannot diſcover, are Claps, and Virulent Gonorrheas; which are the effects of a very ſubtile, or rather volatile matter, ſince in Women it often paſſes from the <hi>Vagina</hi> (wherein the Seed is received) into the Ejaculatory Veſſels, and into their Teſticules; and ſince it paſſes in Men all along the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40248:50"/>
to make their adheſion to the ſame Veſſels, and to the Bladder, without leaving nevertheleſs in the one or in the other any marks at all of its paſſage, in the parts it goes through.</p>
                  <p>Though Virulent Claps, or Heats of Urine, do never happen without Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrheas, that is to ſay, without the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and flowing of the Seed, yet they muſt not be confounded indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together under theſe two Names, as ſome Authors have very inconſiderately done; becauſe this laſt Indiſpoſition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſometimes a great while after the former, and it is ſeen ſometimes to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen alone, that is to ſay, without Exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration, and apparent Inflammation, though indeed it be actually cauſed by the preſence of impure Salts which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the Spermatick Veſſels. Nevertheleſs as the Gonorrhea is inſeparable from a Clap, and the Remedies which agree to it as an Accident, do alſo ſerve for curing it, when it is a Diſeaſe apart, it will not be neceſſary to treat of it here more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly; it may ſuffice to acquaint you, that it is often taken in Women for the Whites, for want of obſerving, that its Flux is continual, whereas that of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40248:51"/>
Whites is almoſt always Periodical and Menſtrual.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore I have ſufficiently expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated otherwiſe what I mean by Virulent Claps, and after what manner I conceive them to be produced, that there is no need of making repetitions here; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve alſo that all the diviſions which I could make of it be altogether uſeleſs, becauſe I do not intend to ſpeak but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe that are cauſed by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance and adheſion of ſome Venereal Salt, or elſe becauſe its Accidents do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſtinguiſh it from ſuch as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by violent Exerciſes, by the uſe of fermented Liquours, and by other cauſes. Therefore I believe it will ſuffice to give you in this Chapter the circumſtances it is neceſſary to obſerve for the curing ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully all the Accidents that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this I am now going to ſpeak of, or elſe for aſſuredly preventing the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Pox, that might otherwiſe follow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Inflammation may be ſaid to be the moſt preſſing Accident of all that happen in this degree of the Pox, for 'tis by it that the matter which runs out is render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the more ſharp and corroſive, that the Ulcers of the paſſages become greater and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40248:51"/>
more profound, that the pains grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, and laſtly that the means of making Urine become ſo extream diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, nay and ſometimes in a manner im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: 'Tis therefore requiſite to take care betimes of preventing, or elſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it by cooling Remedies, ſuch as may be thoſe I am now going to propoſe.</p>
                  <p>Some perſons, whom we muſt by no means imitate, do begin with Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting in the Arm, which may be apt to attract or drive the Venereal matter more inwardly into the body, and muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be ſuſpected as dangerous; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are not afraid to let Blood in the Foot, which alſo may have the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or elſe precipitate the Defluxion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Stones; wherefore you ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from them both, and prefer the uſe of the following Ptiſanne, which will ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve at the ſame time to cool the parts, drive the matter outwards, and diminiſh its Acrimony.</p>
                  <p>Take the Roots of white Lillies, and Marſh-Mallows, of each a pound, Sorrel half a hand full, Liquoriſh a ſufficient quantity, Barley three hands full, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed two ounces, common Water four and twenty pounds; make a Ptiſanne
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40248:52"/>
the uſual way, remembring to preſs the remainder well, for to draw out the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilage the better.</p>
                  <p>Add in every Bottle of this Ptiſanne ten or twelve drops of the Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, and make, your Patient drink of it as much as his ſtomach will bear, and this indifferently at any hour, day, or night.</p>
                  <p>Though this Ptiſanne be often ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to anſwer the intentions I have named, when you begin in good time to make uſe of it; yet it is found every day in ſome perſons, that the malignity of the matter, and diſpoſition of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and parts, do cauſe the Inflammation to grow ſo great, as to communicate it ſelf to the Reins, and neck of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo that the Patients do ſuffer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme pains, when they are in Bed, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the erection, and in urining: but this more particularly in Men; for the Convulſion of the Nerves of their Yard, which by retiring toward their origine do ſwell, and thereby render this part crooked, or bended, doth cauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the Pox in which it is ſaid to be corded and ſtringed; and in which alſo you muſt add to the fore-named Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40248:52"/>
for the Ptiſanne, two ounces of the Cold Seeds, half an ounce of white Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Seed, and the Juyce of two or three Limons, for to render it more Anodyne, more refreſhing, and agreable.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall alſo give from time to time emulſions made of Whey, ſweet Almonds, and the Seeds and Juyce I have now named.</p>
                  <p>You may for the ſame intention rub the Reins, and <hi>Perineum</hi> with the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth of Galen, which you muſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cover with Linnen dipt in Oxye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat that is made of one part of Vinegar, and ſix of Roſe-water.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of cooling Clyſters muſt be frequent too, as well as Injections of this quality, which muſt be made into the Yard, by means of a little Syringe, and this with luke-warm Milk, for Example, which is marvellous for this effect, and one may make uſe of it much more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully than of common Water, to dip the Yard in whil'ſt he urines, and ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the paſſage of the Urine.</p>
                  <p>Some of thoſe who do not eſteem things that are common, chuſe rather to make uſe of the Waters of Night-ſhade, Roſes, and Plantain, to make Injections,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40248:53"/>
which are indeed Refrigerant and Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne, becauſe they hinder the matter from flowing, and drive it back by their aſtriction; but it is a dangerous thing to do ſo, and therefore you muſt have a care of uſing them, unleſs the matter be grown thick, and hath run ſufficiently.</p>
                  <p>Turpentine of <hi>Chios,</hi> or in defect of it that of <hi>Venice,</hi> hath a marvellous effect for aſſwaging and qualifying the matter, and driving it out, becauſe it very eaſily ſlides into thoſe parts, and is very Diuretick. You may give it in Bolus or Pills from two drachms to half an ounce, or its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit drawn Chymically from five drops to fifteen, in Aperitive Waters or Pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſannes.</p>
                  <p>Experience will let you know that the Salt, which is called Polychreſt, is a powerful Remedy to drive out the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Salts, if you diſſolve two drachms of it in two glaſſes of the former Ptiſanne, or of Pellitory-water, to give it a little after the Inflammation is paſt, and reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it after this manner two or three times, augmenting the Doſe each time with a drachm more.</p>
                  <p>After the uſe of theſe Remedies, you muſt begin to purge gently, with a light
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40248:53"/>
Infuſion of Senna, Cryſtal Mineral, and Caſſia, and may reiterate this Purge ſome days afterwards, augmenting the Doſe, or elſe adding other Medicaments that are moſt convenient to the preſent Diſpoſitions.</p>
                  <p>When the matter ſhall come to run more white, more thick, &amp; in leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, you may then hinder its effluxion for altogether, ſhutting up and cloſing the Spermatick Veſſels by aſtringent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Remedies, whil'ſt you are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and deſiccating the Ulcers of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reter, with deterſive and deſiccative In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
                  <p>Some of thoſe that abuſe Phyſick and its Remedies, do ſtrive to ſtop the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that runs in Claps, only with aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Injections; which cauſes the matter to ſink into the more inward parts, and ſo conſequently there happens a greater Evil then they pretended to cure, or at leaſt the effluxion begins again ſo ſoon as they have left off the uſe of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Remedies: in ſo much that they are compelled ſometimes fifteen or twenty times to reaſſume the uſe of them, without attaining the end they propoſed themſelves. For theſe Injections cannot
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40248:54"/>
go in Men further than the inward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the common paſſage to the Seed and Urine, nor in Women further than the neck of the Womb, or the neck of the Bladder; but this happens chiefly, becauſe by this means they hinder the evacuation of ſuch Impurities as may ſtill remain ſometimes after the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the former Medicaments, and are too often the only cauſe of the duration of this Diſeaſe. Now none of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, when Stiptick Remedies that are taken inwardly, are uſed with prudence; for they cloſe the Spermatick Veſſels by little and little, which by this reſtriction or compreſſion do diſcharge themſelves of their remaining Impurities; ſo that you may always make uſe of them with good ſucceſs, obſerving only that you give them at firſt in a very ſmall quantity and this a little after the Purgatives ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before. To this we muſt add ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, that it is ſometimes needful not to make uſe of them at all, and that Circumſtances do ſometimes happen wherein they are unprofitable, or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. For it is remarkable in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of thoſe that are thus affected, that the matter which runs out toward
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40248:54"/>
end of their Cure, is nothing elſe but the <hi>Virus</hi> of ſome of the Ulcers in the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp; ſo conſequently its effluxion muſt not be hindred by any other Remedies than ſuch as are cleanſing and deſiccative. Sometimes alſo the extraordinary heat of the Bowels doth nouriſh and continue the Inflammation and Dilatation of the ejaculatory Veſſels; ſo that the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and loſs of Seed cannot be hindered but by a proper Dyet, and cooling Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. At other times again the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhea is cauſed by Virulent ſeroſities, that fall into the Teſticules, and cannot be conſumed but by the uſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions of China-root, Salſaparilla, and the other Sudorificks. Laſtly it may be perpetual and incurable in Men, when the <hi>Caruncula Mammillaris</hi> (which ſhuts the Holes through which the Seed paſſes into the common paſſage from the <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulae Proſtatae</hi>) hath been unhappily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by ſome Ulcer, or elſe by corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Medicaments.</p>
                  <p>But you muſt obſerve that the greateſt of theſe Exceptions do not commonly come to paſs, and you muſt conſider the Aſtringents, of which I have ſpoken, as the moſt aſſured Remedies in the Cure
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40248:55"/>
of Gonorrheas; &amp; beſides it is by the uſe and effects of them, that you may beſt judge of the neceſſity of theſe others; wherefore you may always try them without danger, and make uſe of to this purpoſe, for Example, a great Glaſs of Water, wherein you ſhall have boiled, half a quarter of an hour, half an ounce of Myrobalans beaten together.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe, of the Tincture of red Roſes, drawn in common Water, or the Juyce of Berberries, with the Spirit of Vitriol, and given Morning and Evening from two to ſix ounces.</p>
                  <p>Or again, four parts of <hi>Electrum,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it Amber, with one part of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire poudered, and incorporated into the Conſerve of Roſes, the weight of both, to give of it every Morning from half a drachm to a drachm and a half.</p>
                  <p>But among all the Remedies that may be uſed to this intention, you'll find none more aſſured in their Operation than the following Pills:</p>
                  <p>Take of Maſtick in Tears, red Coral, and choſen Amber, of each two drachms, Camphir one drachm, <hi>Laudanum</hi> eight grains; make Pills according to Art, with a ſufficient quantity of Syrop of Quinces
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40248:55"/>
to make a Maſs, of which you may give from a ſcruple to a drachm, for each Doſe.</p>
                  <p>As for the Ulcers which may happen in the paſſages, you may mundifie them with deterſive Injections, made with the decoction of French Barley, and Agrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in which you ſhall mix the Syrop of Wormwood, or Honey of Red Roſes, with ſome drops of the Spirit of Vitriol.</p>
                  <p>After the deterſion you may dry them with the ſeventh Water of unſlackt Lime, in which you ſhall diſſolve a little Salt of Saturn.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe, take white Vitriol, Iris of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and Camphire, of each half a drachm, Roch-Alum one drachm, Roſe and Plantain-water, of each eight ounces, make Collyres for the foreſaid intention.</p>
                  <p>The Troches of Abbot Rhafis, mixt in the ſame Waters, in the Water of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled Alum, or its diſſolution in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water may alſo ſerve to the ſame effect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the Patients way of living is very irregular, and licentious, or elſe when the matter hath been driven back too ſoon by aſtringent Injections; laſtly, when it hath been precipitated by Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40248:56"/>
that are too violent, or inconſiderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, it ſpreads into the proper Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of one of the Teſticules, or of both together, where it cauſes a great and painful Tumour, which ſometimes creates more trouble to cure than all the other Accidents.</p>
                  <p>The ſituation of the parts where the Evil lyes, doth indicate to you the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of repoſe; the defluxion of Humours, Inflammation, and great pain that draws them thither, do alſo indicate to you the neceſſity of revulſive Phlebotomys, and Anodyne and cooling Clyſters, which you muſt reiterate as often as ſhall be found neceſſary, to ſtop or divert the Motion of the matter.</p>
                  <p>Cataplaſms made of Cows-milk, Crums of White-bread, Yelks of new-laid Egs, and Oyl of ſweet Almonds, are here very profitable at the beginning.</p>
                  <p>Fomentations and Cataplaſms made with Mallow-leaves, Marſh-mallow roots, Flowers of Camomille and Melilote, Line-ſeed and Fleawort-ſeed, may much contribute to the Cure of this Indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>When the Inflammation and pain ſhall be taken away by all theſe Remedies,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40248:56"/>
and the Tumour a little mollified, you may begin to uſe reſolvent Cataplaſms, ſuch as are made with the four ſorts of Farine or Meale boiled in Oxymel, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them a little Oyntment of Roſes, and Saffran.</p>
                  <p>Cummin-ſeed well bruiſed, and boil'd alſo in Oximel to the conſiſtence of a Cataplaſm.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the Balſom of Sulphur applyed alone, or mixed with Myrrh, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of a Cere-cloth, as it is deſcribed by <hi>Rulandus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the Ulcers of the paſſages have not been cleanſed and dryed, as they ſhould be, the remaining matter thickens, and fixes the Humour, which flows into the ulcerated part; in ſo much that the Fleſh there grows hard, riſes by little and little, and at laſt hinders the entrance of the Yard, when it happens in the neck of the Womb of a Woman, but doth more often hinder the paſſage of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine in both Sexes, if it be not conſumed before it poſſeſſes the Circumference of the Ureter.</p>
                  <p>It is more particularly requiſite in Men to take care of preventing this extremity, and endeavouring to conſume theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcencies,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40248:57"/>
ſo ſoon as ever it is perceived, that the Urine doth not make ſo large a ſtream as uſually, or that it runs out forked and divided. For when it comes to go out but only drop by drop, or is altogether thus ſuppreſſed, we are almoſt always obliged to open the <hi>Perineum</hi> by an Inciſion, or at leaſt to introduce a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theter into the Bladder, which in paſſing along doth cauſe very grievous pains.</p>
                  <p>You may eaſily conſume a Carnoſity in its beginning, by excoriating it with a Catheter, and applying thereupon (by the means of a little Candle made of Wax and Turpentine) red Precipitate, calcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Alum, Verdegreaſe, the pouder of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, and yellow Orpiment; of which Drogues you may prepare ſeveral ſorts of Remedies. But when it is become ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and hard, you muſt firſt of all try to render it tractable, by the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of emollient Remedies, ſuch as are the Fomentations that I have deſcribed for the ſwelling of the Teſticles, or elſe the reſidence of the Decoction, with which you may make Cataplaſms for the ſame effect, beating it and boiling it to the conſiſtence of Pap.</p>
                  <p>You may alſo make Liniments with
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40248:57"/>
the Oyl of Lillies, Man's Fat, or the Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan Oyntment, and apply thereupon the Plaſter <hi>de Vigo,</hi> or rather that of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilage with Mercury.</p>
                  <p>Some have found a great deal of help from a Fumigation that is raiſed from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua-vitae, or Vinegar, caſt upon hot ſtones or bricks.</p>
                  <p>When the Carnoſity ſhall have been a little mollified by theſe, or other means, you may make uſe of the Corroſives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed before, or put twelve grams of Sublimate Corroſive in an ounce of the Plaſter of Mucilage, which will aſſuredly prove of great effect, if you uſe it dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly; that is to ſay, if you apply it in a ſmall quantity, and this directly upon the excreſcence.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, I ſhall not ſpeak particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe that happen to Women in the ſame paſſages, by reaſon that you may alſo conſume them with the Remedies I have already deſcribed; and this alſo with much more eaſe than thoſe, which happen in the common paſſage or the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reter of Men.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You muſt obſerve that the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Poxes of which I have ſpoken are found to be ſometimes accompanied with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40248:58"/>
the univerſal Pox, becauſe it ſometimes happens to appear juſt at the ſame time; or the Venereal Salts are now and then ſo volatile and penetrant, that they force againſt the oppoſition of Nature and its Preſervatives. In this caſe it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to make uſe of the greateſt part of the particular Remedies I have propoſed; ſince by taking away the univerſal Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the body by the general Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that will be deſcribed in the ſequel of this Book, you'll deſtroy the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, whereſoever it may ly, and the Accidents will eaſily vaniſh almoſt all of themſelves by this means.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>SEeing the univerſal Pox doth conſiſt in a general Infection of the body, it cannot be-terminated but by ſuch <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> as are able to carry away all its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Criſes</hi> may be raiſed either by Motions purely Natural, or elſe by the proper Actions of Mercury, and the other Remedies.</p>
                  <p>I know well enough that thoſe who ſtick cloſely to what the Ancients have taught, will not allow of this diviſion, becauſe according to them the <hi>Criſes</hi> of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40248:59"/>
Diſeaſes are only the productions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not the effects of Remedies; Whereupon it is neceſſary to remark, that the Evacuations which follow the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Remedies againſt the Pox, and particularly that of Mercury, muſt not be conſidered ſimply like thoſe that are ſeen to follow, when the Veſſels are opened, or after the uſe of Vomits and Purges; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe laſt have always determinate Motions, whereas thoſe others I ſpeak of are made either by the mouth, or by the pores, or ſiege, or by urine, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Nature finds the Impurities or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages beſt diſpoſed; whence we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conclude that they are properly the works of Nature, and that the Remedies which are employed for this effect, do principally ſerve to move and diſpoſe the bodies to their purification by an agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Humours.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But to return to thoſe which are cauſed by Motions purely Natural, they may may be diſtinguiſhed into ſuch as are provoked by the Cauſes of ſome other Diſeaſes, which do render the Pox ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times complicated, or into ſuch as are made ſimply by the oppoſition of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:40248:59"/>The Diſeaſes which may cauſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, are, for Example, the Plague, Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and generally Feavours, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally thoſe that are called Malignant, whoſe <hi>Criſes</hi> may be able to carry off the Pox, becauſe they never happen but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Cauſes have procured a great ebullition in the blood, by which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſometimes ſo violently moved, that ſhe makes an extraordinary effort to ſeparate all the Impurities that are mixed with it. But ſeeing the Pox may be carried off after this manner as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ways as there are different Natural terminations of it, and becauſe this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot be treated of here without confuſion, I ſhall not ſpeak more amply of it, but do believe it will be ſufficient to explicate in this Chapter the other ſorts of <hi>Criſes,</hi> which may be ſaid to be peculiar to the Pox.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seeing the Venereal matter is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous, ſubtile, and penetrant, it rarely makes its Attache any conſiderable time on the ſuperficial parts, without entring into the Veſſels, and mixing with the blood; and as there is nothing more ordinary than thoſe ſorts of adheſion, there would conſequently be nothing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40248:60"/>
more familiar than the univerſal Pox, if Nature did not oppoſe its introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make uſe of all its force to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a mixture and inſinuation that is ſo contrary to it. Nay we ſee, that ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents as much as poſſible the diſorder that this poiſon may be apt to make. For when ſhe is not able to eſcape its Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, ſhe knows how to act againſt it another manner of way, by ſeparating it from the Humours that are pure, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it away with the ordinary Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments through commodious paſſages.</p>
                  <p>Theſe paſſages may be the ſame as ſerve alſo for Natural Purgations, ſuch as the Terms of Women, and the regulated <hi>Hemorrhoides</hi> of certain Men, or for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Evacuations, as ſordid Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or laſtly for the univerſal purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood, and the Emunctories. But as the Venereal matter is driven al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſenſibly through the former ways that I have mentioned, &amp; ſeeing Nature hath no need of aſſiſtance in this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall not give any more preciſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of them, and ſhall be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſcribe the means of making the <hi>Criſe</hi> ſucceed well, that often happens through the latter.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:40248:60"/>4. Whereas the Genital parts do ſerve oftner than any other for the introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Venereal Salts, the Groin which is very near them doth ſuffer the impure Tumours by which they are driven out, more commonly than the other Emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories; after the ſame manner as the Humours that ſerve for a <hi>Criſis</hi> to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, do rather happen to ſwell under the Arm-pits, becauſe they are nearer the Breaſt, which firſt received by inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the infected Air that cauſed this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. But though it be eaſy to remark that thoſe ſort of Tumours are always made by ſome Critical Motion, it is known nevertheleſs that the efforts, which Nature makes on this account would often prove to no purpoſe, if ſhe were not ſeconded by the application &amp; action of Remedies that Phyſick does furniſh us with. An Example of this truth is obſerved particularly in Buboes or Poulains, that often appear in the Groins, when the impure matter hath been driven thither, but yet diſappear again ſometimes, when it hath not been ſtopt there by Attractives; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens not in the <hi>Criſes</hi> that are made the other was I have ſpoken of, by reaſon
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40248:61"/>
that they have nothing to hinder the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Impurities, and becauſe the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that run through them do at the ſame time ſerve to extend and diſſolve the Venereal Salts, which are eaſily dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out by this means. But it is not the ſame when a Bubo begins to riſe, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Humour that there is mixed with thoſe Salts, thickens by this mixture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it remains a long time under the skin, and can have no iſſue at all but by piercing it; ſo that theſe <hi>Criſes</hi> can ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom become perfect, unleſs Nature is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with Art.</p>
                  <p>The intention which you ought to have for to anſwer this reſpect, doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally conſiſt in augmenting the Emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature, and procuring a Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>This Augmentation may be made two manner of ways. The firſt is, by driving it from within outwardly, by the uſe of hot Aliments, for Example, of Wine, or elſe of Remedies of the ſame quality, ſuch as Treacle, or Treacle-water. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is by attracting and digeſting the Tumour by Topicks.</p>
                  <p>The attraction and digeſtion of Buboes is wont to be made ordinarily, with the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40248:61"/>
Plaſter <hi>Diachylum,</hi> that is compounded of <hi>Galbanum, Opoponax,</hi> and the other hot and attractive Gums. But I know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that it attracts but weakly, when the Gums enter into it in a ſmall Doſe, and that it becomes on the contrary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent, when too great a quantity of them enters; ſo that its application doth not hinder the Tumours from diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes, and this chiefly in Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick and Phlegmatick perſons, whoſe Natural heat is but weak; wherefore you muſt prefer at leaſt for ſuch perſons the following Cataplaſm, which hath for certain a much better effect.</p>
                  <p>Take eight or ten Snails with their ſhells, ſix Lilly-roots, two ounces of freſh Butter, and three ounces of old Rye-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, make Cataplaſms of it, and apply them hot, and renew them every ſix hours; remembring to augment the Doſe of the Leaven, when you would attract more ſtrongly in robuſt Bodies, and alſo to diminiſh it for thoſe that have their skin tender and delicate, to avoid thoſe excoriations which might otherwiſe be feared. Moreover, this Remedy hath not only the vertue of attracting, but alſo that of ſtopping and fixing the Humour
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40248:62"/>
in the part, by contributing much to the Suppuration.</p>
                  <p>When the Tumour is rebellious, and advances not ſo much as may be wiſhed, a great Cupping-glaſs may be ſucceſsfully applyed upon it every twelve hours, which muſt be left each time, till it hath made a conſiderable attraction; after which you may take it off, and put upon the point of the Tumour a Tent of the bigneſs of a farthing, on which you may put an Ointment made of equal parts of <hi>Baſilicum,</hi> and Leaven fermented with the Spirit of Vitriol, to apply afterwards upon it the Plaſter, or ordinary Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm.</p>
                  <p>After you ſhall have brought the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Suppuration by theſe means, you muſt open the Bubo in the moſt eminent part of it, or a very little lower, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Longitude of the Fibres of the Groin, with Potential Cauters, and the Lancet; after which, you may make uſe of the ordinary Suppuratives and Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dificatives, by putting at firſt upon it the Plaſter <hi>Diachylum,</hi> and afterwards that of Mucilage with Mercury; and at laſt you may treat it like other impure Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, remembring to purge frequently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40248:62"/>
the latter end by Stool, and by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</p>
                  <p>It is remarkable that there are ſome Impoſtors here, and other where who do make ill uſe of theſe Remedies, and do make artificial Buboes appear, on thoſe that have none really, but ſometimes doubt of it, by reaſon of ſome <hi>Glandules</hi> filled with ſeroſities, or other edematous Tumours, which happen either during, or after ſome particular Poxes.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Before we ſpeak of the <hi>Criſes</hi> that are artificially raiſed to cure the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40248:63"/>
Univerſal Pox, I have thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to remark ſome uſeful Obſervations on the Sudorifick Plants, which were heretofore accounted infallible for this effect, and ſome others upon Quickſilver; which are of ſo much the more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as they are at preſent alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for its moſt aſſured Remedy, without any bodie's endeavouring ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs hitherto to underſtand why and how they come to have ſuch power.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Plants, or their parts which are ordinarily in uſe, are, for Example, the Wood <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> and the Roots of <hi>Saſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fras, China,</hi> and <hi>Sarſaparilla,</hi> which have been brought hither from divers places of both <hi>Indies,</hi> and at ſeveral times; they have all had their turns of the common advantage new things uſually meet with; the Deareſt, and Neweſt have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moſt eſteemed, and the greateſt part of Authors have uſed this occaſion to ſpeak Wonders of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make profit by this means of the prejudice of Men's minds; ſo that they have been generally acknowledged for the ſoveraign, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, &amp; aſſured Remedies of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Abuſes have made way for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, Empyricks have diſtributed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40248:63"/>
them for things of a moſt pretious value, the Chymiſts have drawn their Extracts and Quinteſſences out of them, which they have ſold at the price of their weight in Gold; Mountebanks, and ſuch as diſtribute ſecret Remedies, have put a diſguiſe upon them by the mixture of many other Ingredients; laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ignorant people have preferred the uſe of them before all other Remedies.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the Stories and Relations of thoſe that have made Voyages into the <hi>Indies,</hi> did perſwade us that the Indians were perfectly cured by a Decoction of theſe Plants, and the Impoſtors of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> took care to render their ſucceſs good in all appearance by the deceitful Cure of imaginary Diſeaſes; All people were a long time entertained in this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and every body continued obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the uſe of them, notwithſtanding the falſe Experiments that were daily made, which were rather imputed to the indiſcret and careleſs uſe of them, than to their proper fault. Wherefore Men tryed ſeveral ways of preparing and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying them, which nevertheleſs were acknowledged to be uſeleſs, as well as the common and ordinary Preparations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:40248:64"/>This obliged thoſe that had eſpecially ſtrived to keep them in vogue, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and declare that the ſame advantages could not be drawn from them here, as were pretended to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in their Natural Climats. But leſt it ſhould ſeem ridiculous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn abſolutely ſuch things as have been generally approved but a little before, ſome of them therefore taught, that the Providence of God had made them grow only for the Cure of thoſe Countries, where this Diſeaſe was ſuppoſed to have its origine, but that they could not be tranſported ſo far as us without the loſs and alteration of their Vertues.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Propoſitions do not prove ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs that the Indians are better cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red than we by the uſe of theſe Plants; ſince I have proved in another place that the Pox hath ſtill been in all places, and at all times; And it may be further add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if God had permitted the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of this Diſeaſe without altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its form, he would alſo by the ſame Reaſon have permitted the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of its Remedies too, without diminution of their Vertues. Beſides there would have been no need, but only
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40248:64"/>
of augmenting the Doſes, to render the Compoſitions that were made of them more ſtrong and active. But that which particularly lets us ſee, thoſe people are not cured but only in appearance too, by the Decoction of theſe Simples, is, that they do deſiccate the bodies here as much or little leſs than they do in the <hi>Indies</hi>; and that this deſiccation doth make the Accidents often diſappear for the preſent, &amp; leave only the appearance of a Cure; in ſo much that they do always cauſe a new fermentation afterwards, and appear ſome other time more terrible than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever you pleaſe to think of it, it is certain this Opinion was at laſt found and acknowledged to be true, and the greateſt part of our Phyſicians began at laſt to diſabuſe themſelves; ſo that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Eſſays were made to diſcover ſome other Remedy for this Evil. Our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries prepared for this effect divers ſorts of Purgative and Vomitive Potions, Antidotes, and Cordial Confections, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Ointments, and generally all kinds of Compoſitions of the Galenical Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie. The Chymiſts did not fail on their part to try their Elixirs, their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canums
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40248:65"/>
Magiſteries, Quinteſſences and Extracts, both Emetick, Cathartick and Diaphoretick. Laſtly, after a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proofs of the like nature, it was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily found out, that thoſe who had the Pox could be cured indeed by Frictions with Mercurial Ointments, which ſerved heretofore for the pretended Leproſie, of which I have ſpoken before. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſeeing theſe Sudorifick Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did heretofore take away the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it in ſome perſons, they were not neglected altogether; and the eſteem that had been made of them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did ſtill contribute much to the uſe that hath been made of them ſince, and is continued now a days, which is to give them for preparing the Bodies, on which Mercury is deſigned to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
                  <p>Moreover it is not hard to underſtand how the Accidents of the Pox can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear for ſome time, without deſtroying its Cauſe, ſince it is evident enough, by what I have already ſaid in the Firſt Section of this Book, that it eſſentially conſiſts in a venomous Salt mixt with the Blood, which ferments and ſets it a boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo that during this Ebullition there
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40248:65"/>
continually ariſes out of the Veſſels that contain it many vaporous or ſerous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which produce different Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, according to their Quality, or Quantity, or Parts where they adhere. Now ſeeing theſe ſame Matters can be eaſily conſumed by Sudorificks, Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and generally by deſiccative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; we muſt not at all wonder, if their Effects do not appear for a time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the uſe of a Decoction of theſe Plants, and if nevertheleſs the Ferment that raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up thoſe Vapours, do ſtill continue mixed with the Blood, ſince it is a Salt diſſolved, fermented and confounded with it, that cannot be ſufficiently car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off by matters that paſs away ſo quickly.</p>
                  <p>I know very well it may be ſaid, that one can hardly believe how the Indians ſhould be cured only in ſhow, and ſhould be ſo long deceived without perceiving their errour. But obſerve how I conceive that may be done: Strumpets are there wonderful common, and they make uſe of them with the Brutality that is uſual to ſuch as have little Religion in them; which makes this diſeaſe ſo familiar among them, that they have reaſon to think they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40248:66"/>
contract it ſtill anew again. For indeed it is not at all likely, that they ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd ſo frequently to reiterate their Cures, as Hiſtories and Relations tell us they do, if they really had any aſſured Remedies to deſtroy this Diſeaſe in its Root.</p>
                  <p>I do not mean (as I have already ſaid) that the Univerſal Pox can never be cured by theſe Sudorificks, or by other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies more ordinary and common, whilſt it is yet but in its firſt degree, that is to ſay, when its Matter hath not been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly united with the Blood by a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation: But beſides that this Degree doth continue but a little while, it is not always liable to be rightly diſtinguiſhed, and Mercury doth carry it off with ſo much promptitude and facility, that it were indeed vain to try other Remedies.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding that theſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are founded both upon Reaſon and Experience, and do prove by theſe two means that theſe Plants are not Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick againſt this Diſeaſe; we muſt avow nevertheleſs that there are ſome Occurrences, wherein they may much contribute to the Cure, ſeeing there are ſome Bodies that muſt be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deſiccated before the application
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40248:66"/>
of Mercury; Wherefore it is neceſſary to take notice of the Obſervations that I have made on each in particular, to know more preciſely the uſe that muſt be made of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Wood <hi>Guaiacum</hi> gives a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh Tincture, more ſharp, and more diſtaſteful, but alſo more deſiccative than that of the other three Simples named before. Some Authors pretend that this Effect proceeds from its Sudorifick ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and others contend to prove that it is much more Diuretick: but which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, 'tis always true that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the Phlegm and Seroſities, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them off either by Sweat or Urine. And that theſe different motions do principally proceed from the internal diſpoſition of thoſe that uſe them, ſince it is found by Experience that it doth make ſome ſweat and others urine. I have often obſerved, that it may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more proper to open the Pores, by adding to its Decoction ſome French Barley, which doth alſo render it ſweeter and more agreeable.</p>
                  <p>We have reaſon alſo to believe, that the manner of uſing it among the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Americans doth not a little
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40248:67"/>
contribute to the rendring of it Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick; for they firſt heat themſelves by violent and extraordinary Exerciſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they preſume to drink of its Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and after they have drunk of it, they lie in Cotton-beds hung up, and ſo continually ſwinging, which gives a new agitation to the Humours by ſuch conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued motions, and makes them evaporate more eaſily by wayes already diſpoſed.</p>
                  <p>We muſt grant indeed that the Volatil and Eſſential Salt, which cauſes it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this Effect, doth more abound in that which they employ, than this that is brought over to us; becauſe they cut it freſh from young Trees, and the Sprigs of old ones, in which the Univerſal Spirit, that cauſes the Vegetation of Plants, is doubtleſs more active, and leſs divided; and it is for this reaſon requiſite to make choice of the ſmalleſt and yelloweſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the greateſt &amp; blackeſt is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be taken from old ſapleſs Trunks.</p>
                  <p>Such as make the goodneſs of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to conſiſt in the ſtrength of their activity do rather employ the Bark of this ſame Wood, which is in good truth more drying than all the reſt of the Tree, but is accompanied with ſo much Heat and Acrimony, that I would not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40248:67"/>
any body to make uſe of it; and it would be much better on an occaſion to render the uſe of the ordinary Decoction longer and more frequent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The part of Saſſafras which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made choice of, and which I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem alſo to be the beſt, is its Root, of which nevertheleſs there is little uſe made at preſent; either becauſe its Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is not well known, or becauſe the other Sudorifick Roots are dearer, and ſo conſequently more eſteemed. It is true notwithſtanding, that its Decoction hath a very pleaſant and agreeable Smell and Taſte, and that uſe may be made of it as well as of Guaiacum, to conſume the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Humidities, in driving them either by Sweat, or Urine, or elſe by ſiege, adding ſome light Catharticks to it.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved nevertheleſs that its Root doth not deſiccate ſo powerfully as Guaiacum, and that it is conſequently good for ſuch as muſt be more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately dried. But more force may be found in the Bark of its Wood, which alſo gives a Tincture yet more Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, more quick and ſharp.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whereas the Root of China is the deareſt of ſudorifick Druggs, that ſerve to prepare or cure ſuch as are infected
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40248:68"/>
with the Pox, the Merchants and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, who have brought it hither from the places where 'tis found, have all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to boaſt its good effects very much to its advantage, that they might thereby have the better Market of it; and its Vertues have been alſo ſo much exaggerated by ſome Authors, that ſuch as have preferred their Report before the Experience and Obſervations which they might have made themſelves, would have thought they had laboured in vain, if they had preſumed to cure the Pox without employing it to this intent. Nevertheleſs we muſt acknowledge, that this preoccupation deſerves to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and that this Root hath nothing in it proportionable to the eſteem that hath been made of it, nor to the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with wich it hath been ſold: ſeeing the Decoctions that are made of all theſe Drugs, do principally and moſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve to dry the Bodies of ſuch as uſe them, and the Decoctions of the other two I now mentioned may be employed to this effect with more ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>Not that this may not be very uſeful, to prepare ſuch as ſhould be more gently deſiccated. Yet it may be alſo let alone,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40248:68"/>
when occaſion ſerves, only by diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doſes of thoſe that are ſtronger, or augmenting the quantity of thoſe that are weaker.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Root of Sarſaparilla is now-a-days more commonly employed to the aboveſaid uſe, becauſe it gives a Tincture very like that of Wine, and its Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath nothing diſagreeable for Smell or Taſte. Nevertheleſs I have obſerved that it dries ſomething leſs than the other three Sudorificks of which I have ſpoken, and that it paſſes more willingly by way of Urine, than through the Pores: whence it comes to be of great uſe for the curing Gonorrheas, that are cauſed by virulent Seroſities, which do ſometimes occupy the Teſticles and and other parts that ſerve for the Concoction and Diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Seed.</p>

mixed with it. <hi>8.</hi> That the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Bodies with which it joyns makes the diverſity of its Actions and Effects. <hi>9.</hi> That it is no way poyſonous in it ſelf, and that the divers diſpoſitions of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects on which it is applied, do cauſe the different Effects that do reſult from its application.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. SEing the Ancients have not explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Qualities of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but only by the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Hot and Dry, Cold and Moiſt, and theſe ſame degrees have not been at all known or diſtinguiſhed more preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than by the Actions and Effects that reſult from theſe Qualities; we muſt not at all wonder, if they have held Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſo very different on the ſubject of Quickſilver, ſince that this Mineral doth act ſo diverſly, and doth produce ſuch different Effects, not only in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bodies that receive it, but alſo at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent times, when received in the ſame ſubject: Whence it comes to paſs that ſome have maintained it to be cold, by reaſon of the cold Diſeaſes that it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates; and others have eſteemed it to be hot, becauſe it doth conſume Phlegm,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40248:70"/>
and deſiccates the bodies in which it is made to enter. Some alſo have judged it to be Venomous, by reaſon of the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that ordinarily arrive to ſuch as draw it out of the Mines, to Gilders, and other Artificers that make uſe of it; and yet ſome others again have aſſerted that it is an Antidote of poiſons, and an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Corruption, becauſe it generally kills all Vermine, and is uſed with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in malignant Feavours, the Peſtilence and Pox; laſtly all their Conceits on this ſubject have been ſo oppoſite, that they have determined nothing at all yet; and modern Authors who have ordained this Remedy againſt certain Diſeaſes, have been contented to ſay, that it acts by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known occult Properties.</p>
                  <p>Though there is nothing leſs known or underſtood in all Phyſick, it is true nevertheleſs that nothing doth really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be known more, ſince the uſe of it now a-days is acknowledged to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually familiar, profitable, and dangerous, and the little knowledge that is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had of its true Motions, is perhaps the only cauſe of all the misfortunes that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low its application. This therefore ought to engage you and I (good Reader) to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40248:70"/>
uſe our utmoſt endeavours to render them more ſenſible, that we may by this means avoid the Reproaches Poſterity might otherwiſe make to our Memory, much more juſtly indeed than to that of our Predeceſſours, ſince we now live in a more knowing and inquiſitive Age, and the Lights that this Age hath furniſhed us with are ſufficient for the diſcovery of an infinity of excellent Truths, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king rational Applications of what they and our Anceſtors have taught us, to what we do now ſee, and what curious and new Experiments do continually ſupply us with. This is that which I do hope to advance your knowledge in, by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of my Obſervations, wherein I ſhall endeavour to omit nothing of what may any way ſerve to render that Manifeſt, which hath been hitherto ſuppoſed to be Occult. Nevertheleſs as it is not my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to play the Naturaliſt altogether, you muſt not expect to find here the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Hiſtory of Mercury. So that if you deſire to know the Etymologie of its Names, its diverſe Definitions, the Mines from whence it comes, the manner of drawing it thence, the means of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting it, and infinite Circumſtances of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40248:71"/>
the like nature, you may have recourſe to many Authors that have amply writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of all theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The common ways of dividing Mercury in the Galenical Pharmacy, do ſhew us that it eaſily joyns with Sulphurs, ſeeing that Turpentine, Roſen, and fat Bodies that ſerve for this effect, are of ſulphurous and inflammable ſubſtances. But the truth of this doth principally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the compoſition of Cinnaber, which every body knows to be a mixture of Sulphur and Mercury together, ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated Naturally in the bowels of the Earth by the force of the Centrical Heat, or elſe Artificially in Furnaces by the violence of Actual Heat; which proves the Chymiſts do with reaſon make its principles conſiſt of a ſubtil and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous Earth, ſeeing it it true that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous Subſtances do always unite more willingly, and the particles of ſome mixt bodies do very eaſily quit thoſe to which they were joyned for to adhere to other bodies that are more Natural and agreable to them; from whence it comes to paſs, that Metallick Water which paſſes through one of its principles and may be ſaid to be the moſt evident,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40248:71"/>
doth ſuffer the mixture, union, and amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamation of this Metal with the greateſt part of other Metals: which gives occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Impoſtors to augment its quantity with Lead and Tin; ſo that it now becomes very difficult to find any of it truly pure, unleſs one mixes Cinnaber with the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of Iron to draw out pure Mercury by diſtillation. For by this means we are ſure to have it in its purity, becauſe the other Metals are not volatil enough to mount with it, but remain in the Retort united with the Sulphur and the Iron.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though Mercury unites it ſelf eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with other Metals, and a Metallick matter is ſenſibly perceived in its compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, yet it muſt be conſidered but as an imperfect Metal, ſeeing the crudity of its Water, and volatility of its Sulphurs do hinder it from being liable either to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution by Fire, or to extenſion by the Hammer; and that thoſe two ſubſtances are tyed and united together after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo proper for Motion, that it always eſcapes the power of thoſe Agents, and never ſubmits it ſelf to their violence, unleſs it be fixt by the mixture of other bodies that ſerve to hold it in diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:40248:72"/>That which renders the Mercury of ſuch a mobile, rowling, and fugitive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is its Sphaerical or round Figure, which is Natural to it, and conſerves it alſo in the ſeparation of its parts; ſo that after having diſſolved it with <hi>Acides,</hi> and reduced it into a moſt ſubtile Powder, it may ſtill be perceived to continue in its ancient Form by the means of a Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope; its Nature being ſo altogether ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, that it ſeems impoſſible to find means for the abſolute deſtruction of its accidental and exteriour form.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing its roundneſs ſeems loſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by falſe appearances, it may be alſo ſaid that it loſes its mobility only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it again, ſeeing this laſt Accident is but a production of the former; and it is very certain beſides that nothing in all the World hath been able to fix it in ſuch manner, but that it may be revived by the force of Fire, though ſome Impoſtors do maintain the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That which is moſt ſurprizing in this Mineral is, that notwithſtanding its Gravity, it riſes up with the gentleſt heat; that though it is Volatile, yet its own weight ſerves to precipitate it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The firſt of theſe contrarieties
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40248:72"/>
may be proved, by putting ſome of it upon burning Coals, or elſe by obſerving the Sublimations that Chymiſts make of it; the other contrariety may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſcovered by putting it upon Tin, Lead, Wood, and eſpecially upon the Earth, which it doth penetrate ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, that ſome have pretended to be able to dry up a great pond, only by caſting into it ſome ſtore of Mercury that might be able to make a hole big enough to give a paſſage to the Water which ſhould follow its Motion.</p>
                  <p>We know eaſily enough that Gold &amp; Lead are groſs and ſulphurous, by their malleability, but the Sulphurs that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Compoſition of Mercury ſeem to diſcover themſelves chiefly by its vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latility, and conjunction with ſulphurous ſubſtances. I have obſerved nevertheleſs that Metals which abound with this principle are more weighty than others, becauſe their parts are more perfectly tyed and united together; ſo that they always have ſo much the leſs weight, as they are better digeſted, or become more perfect, becauſe the parts do continually ſeparate in digeſtion, or elſe becauſe the greateſt part of its Sulphurs do exhale,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40248:73"/>
and ſo leave empty ſpaces in the mixed. Now ſeeing Mercury is a Metal very crude and weighty, we may for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſay, that it is alſo very ſulphurous, as you ſee by the things ſpoken before, that its Sulphurs do render it very proper for Motion; and ſo you ought not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it is Volatil, when moved or excited by any Heat, or that without Heat it is proper to penetrate, and ſink deep into bodies, ſince its weight, fluidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and agitation of its Sulphurs, are things ſufficient to bear it downwards.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Notwithſtanding you muſt obſerve that it doth not always neceſſarily ſink downwards, but that it may be rendered purely penetrant and volatil by its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; this truth appears in the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and Application of Mercurial Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Ointments, in which it is held divided into imperceptible particles by the means of reſinous ſubſtances, that they may the more properly be able to penetrate the pores of all the skin on which they are applyed.</p>
                  <p>But though this diviſion be very uſeful, it is nevertheleſs very imperfect, ſeeing the gentleſt Heat is able to melt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinous matters that held the Mercury ſo
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40248:73"/>
divided, and by this means it eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unites to appear again in its ancient form; which doth not happen, when it hath been diſſolved with <hi>Acids</hi>; for putting the Diſſolution over the Fire, the Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture will evaporate, and the Mercury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at bottom in form of Salt, or elſe continuing the Fire, it ſublimates to the middle of the Veſſel; ſo that after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been thus ſeveral times ſublimated, it remains at laſt alone, or mixt with very few <hi>Acids,</hi> without loſing never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the form of Salt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I do not mean that Mercury cannot be ſublimated by Heat without being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, but it is very certain that the Heat muſt be more or leſs ſtrong according as the <hi>Corpuſcules</hi> of Mercury are groſs or heavy; whence it comes to paſs that it is divided into very ſubtil particles in the Troches that are uſed for Fumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that it may the eaſier be carried of, and with the leſs violence.</p>
                  <p>But though it loſes its weight when ſo divided, and its lightneſs renders it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for precipitation, we know not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding by experience that <hi>Alkalis</hi> will precipitate it, ſince by caſting Lime-water, or the Oyl or Liquour of Tartar,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40248:74"/>
on the Diſſolution of Sublimate Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in common Water, the Mercury is ſeen to precipitate in a yellow powder by the firſt, and in a green powder by the ſecond.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Furthermore I am not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand why the Red powder of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury is now-a-days called Precipitate, ſeeing it is nothing elſe but its Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or the Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, which is afterwards made evaporate to ſiccity; unleſs it be becauſe the <hi>Acids</hi> do unite to all parts of it in theſe ſorts of Diſſolutions, and ſo by this means render it more fixt, heavy, and if you will too more penetrant than after the ordinary diviſions that are made of it with reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous bodies. Whatſoever is the Reaſon, it is always true that this is no Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all, and that the <hi>Acids</hi> thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with the Mercury, do not hinder it from being ſublimated, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from mounting ſo high, as it would do if alone, or mixed with reſinous Drugs; if ſo be the Mercury be not in too ſmall a quantity, or driven by too violent a Heat.</p>
                  <p>We may eaſily conceive, that nothing but the different quantity of <hi>Acids</hi> doth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40248:74"/>
render it more or leſs Corroſive, if we make reflection on the manner of dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Sublimate; one part of Sublimate Corroſive is mixed with another part of crude Mercury, till the whole Maſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears greyiſh; afterwards it is ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again, and after this ſecond Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is found to be leſs Corroſive than it was before; becauſe ſome part of the <hi>Acids</hi> of its Nitre and Vitriol do fly out of the Sublimatory Veſſel, and others ſtick to the neck like mill-duſt, but are eaſily ſeparated from the ſublimated Maſs beſides alſo that thoſe which ſtill remain are more extended by the augmentation of Mercury; ſo that by thus powdring and ſublimating it three or four times, it becomes at laſt ſo ducified, that it may be ſafely given inwardly in a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doſe, though it were at firſt the ſtrongeſt Corroſive and poiſon.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. From the fore-going Obſervations may be drawn ſeveral Circumſtances ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful for knowing the Motions of Mercury; but chiefly, that it always tends downwards by its own weight, when alone, and in its Natural form; &amp; on the contrary that it penetrates indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently upwards, downwards, and on
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40248:75"/>
every ſide, when it is divided into ſubtil particles; that it is heavy and corroſive when mixed with <hi>Acids</hi>; and on the contrary very benign and volatil when ſeparated and extended by reſinous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; that <hi>Alkalis</hi> can precipitate it, when diſſolved and mixed with Liquours; laſtly that the diverſity of bodies to which it joyns doth ſerve to diſtinguiſh its Actions and Effects: to which may be added alſo ſome following Obſervations, that ſerve for a proof of this truth, as well as the Applications that I intend to make of them, when I ſhall ſpeak of the <hi>Criſes</hi> that it excites. The firſt is, that Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cinnabre taken inwardly drives the Impurities by Sweat, or inſenſible Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, and that there are Sulphurs in our bodies which do mix with it, when taken alone, and do make it produce this effect. The ſecond is, that there are a great many <hi>Acids</hi> with which it may joyn too, becauſe all Natural Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made by their means, and the Venereal Salts do change all the Phlegm into this ſame quality. The third is, that the efferveſcences it produces do alſo ſhew that there are ſome <hi>Alkalis</hi> too, which may ſerve to precipitate it.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:40248:75"/>9. By what I have now ſaid, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by the laſt three Remarks, you ſee that the divers matters which are found to abound in bodies on which Mercury is applyed are the Cauſes of its different productions, ſeeing you may be alſo ſatisfied, that it is not poiſonous in its own Nature, and that all its unhappy effects do principally proceed from the inward diſpoſitions of mind and body; for when the Spirits are agitated by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions, they may then ſublimate the Mercury with Impetuoſity, even into the very Brain, and cauſe by this means the moſt doleful Accidents that are found to follow its Application. So there may happen Accidents very dangerous too, for not having well corrected the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Inanition or Repletion of bodies ill diſpoſed for its Reception. Laſtly, every body knows, or every body may know, that it is given inwardly without any danger at all againſt the Diſeaſe call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Miſerere mei,</hi> and there's the leſs fear, when a great quantity of it is given, which will then be the eaſier carried off by its own weight, for otherwiſe it might poſſibly ſtop in the Inteſtins, and there become Corroſive by its joyning with the Acid Juyces, which there abound.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. Of the <hi>Criſes</hi> that are provoked by common Remedies, and of the Seaſons proper for the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Mercury.</head>
                  <argument>

                        <hi>1.</hi> That the general Obſervations which were related in the preceding Sections are abſolutely neceſſary for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of particular Ones. <hi>2.</hi> General Diviſion of Artificial <hi>Criſes,</hi> and why common Remedies are tryed ſometimes to provoke them. <hi>3.</hi> What are thoſe Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and why they are not here treated of to the bottom. <hi>4.</hi> Of the choice of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seaſons for the Application of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury. <hi>5.</hi> Means to correct the ſoulneſs of the Air and Weather.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. WHen Nature is not able of her ſelf to raiſe Critical Motions, and one infected with the Pox requires
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40248:76"/>
the ſpeedy Application of your Art, to terminate his Diſeaſe by Artificial <hi>Criſes</hi>: You muſt then take into your thoughts thoſe general Ideas I have given you, and recal all the Circumſtances that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the particular uſe you would make of them, if you deſire to compleat happily the Cure of this Diſeaſe. For it is certain that they are of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as you cannot expect to ſucceed well without the Obſervation of them, and by judiciouſly applying them to the particular Maximes you'll find in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of this Book, you'll eſtabliſh for your ſelves and for others an infallible Practice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You muſt firſt of all obſerve that the <hi>Criſes</hi> of the univerſal Pox, which are Artificially made by Remedies, may be diſtinguiſhed into ſuch as are excited by common Evacuatives, or ſuch as are provoked by Mercury.</p>
                  <p>Though theſe firſt Remedies have leſs aſſurance in them, yet they are often put in practice, and chiefly when a perſon's Health is in a doubtful condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are very uſeful to aſſiſt Nature in preventing this Evil, and are ſufficient to Cure it, while it is but in the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40248:77"/>
beſides that it is according to the Order of Phyſick to begin with things that are moſt eaſy, and if they do not abſolutely Cure the Pox, they can ſerve to take away the preſent appearance of it which is a Circumſtance very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſometimes in the Junctures wherein, perſons may find themſelves engaged to retard their Cure.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Moreover theſe Remedies are ſuch as open the principal paſſages of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and expel Impurities through the ways that are moſt Natural; for Example the Sudoriſick and Diuretick Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Simples I have ſpoken of, which do carry off impure Humidities either, through the pores of the body, or by the way of Urine, or elſe all the other Drugs that may ſerve for this effect; Laſtly all the Purgatives that evacuate groſſer matters by ſiege, and in a need Emeticks too which Purge by Vomit. But ſeeing theſe Remedies are ſo very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and well known, and that their quality and quantity can never be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated but by the Judgment and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſuch as employ them, I cannot think it neceſſary to treat particularly of them, becauſe all expert and proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40248:77"/>
have a perfect knowledge of them already, and thoſe that are ignorant of them ſhould never dare to practiſe, or uſe them, without firſt demanding Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of ſuch as can inform them, and that eſpecially in things of ſo great Moment.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you have tryed in vain all the Remedies I now ſpoke of, if the Pox hath paſt its firſt degrees, laſtly if your Patient is willing to be cured once for all, without endangering the loſs of his time, money, and pains, to little or no purpoſe, you muſt procure the <hi>Criſis</hi> of his Diſeaſe by means of Mercury; and to do it the more ſucceſsfully you muſt chooſe the moſt temperate Months, ſuch as are <hi>March, April,</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> which do make up the Spring of Phyſicians, or elſe <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> which make up their Autumn. For the Summer by its exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Heats doth cauſe a diſſipation of the Spirits, and by this means the diminution of the Natural Heat and ſtrength, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which you cannot effect your Cure; and the Winter by its extream Cold doth condenſate the pores of the body, cloſes up all the Natural paſſages, concentrates the Natural Heat, Spirits, and Humours, and doth after this manner hinder Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40248:78"/>
from acting as ſhe ought to do in raiſing the <hi>Criſis</hi> you deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs it is not neceſſary to ſtick preciſely to the Months I named; for though they are commonly the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for this effect, it ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that they prove very intemperate, as on the contrary there often happens very ſeaſonable mild Weather in the others. Neither is it ſo very requiſite, that all the dayes of the <hi>Criſis</hi> ſhould be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; it may ſuffice the time of provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it be mild enough in Winter, that the Humours may the more eaſily be ſet in Motion; and not ſo extreme hot in Summer, as to keep the Pores too open, and to divert the Salivation by importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sweats. For when Nature hath but once well begun a good motion, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveres to the end, though the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an co-operates but little.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though the Seaſonableneſs of the Weather, and other Circumſtances that I have remarked, be very uſeful indeed for the well performing this buſineſs, yet occaſions do ſometimes happen, wherein they cannot be exactly obſerved. The Accidents which the Pox produces, or
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40248:78"/>
the particular affairs of ſick perſons do ſometimes require ſo ſudden and preſſing a Cure, even in very unſeaſonable times, that there is a neceſſity of preſent treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, notwithſtanding the unhappy occurrences which may then come to paſs; and you muſt not be too fearful in undertaking ſuch a Cure at this time. For 'tis certain, that the ill quality of the Air may be corrected, with a great deal of care and neceſſary application. You may, for example, put your ſick in the Shades of the exceſſive Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-heats, by chooſing a Chamber large enough, whoſe Windows are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the North, and cloſely ſhut in the day-time, to hinder the Air and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberation of the Rayes of the Sun from entring into it; the Coverlets of the Bed muſt be very light, and the place round abound it may be ſprinkled with Oxycrate, made of one part of Vinegar, and ſix of Roſe-water, and the reſt of the Chamber may be alſo ſprinkled with common water, in which you may mix a little Vinegar too. Laſtly the Windows may be opened ſome hours of the night to let in the cool refreſhing blaſts.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, during the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40248:79"/>
colds of the Winter, you muſt chooſe a little Chamber, whoſe Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows open to the South, and ſhut them very exactly in all places where the wind may enter; then ſee that the Bed be not far from the Chimney, in which you muſt be ſure to keep a good fire day and night, remembring to cover your patient carefully; and, if it may be had, a skreen about the Bed, to keep it the warmer.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of the Preparation of Bodies in which Mercury muſt enter.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>1.</hi> Confutation of the ordinary ways of preparing Bodies for the reception of Mercury. <hi>2.</hi> That the true Method of preparing them cannot be perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, but that a ſufficient Idea may be given of it, for ſuch as have been Experienced. <hi>3.</hi> Particular Preparation of Bodies of a good Conſtitution. <hi>4.</hi> Means of correcting the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch as are extremely Hot and Dry. <hi>5.</hi> The manner of diminiſhing the extreme Repletion of thoſe that are Cold and Phlegmatick.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. AMong thoſe that employ Mercury for the procuration of the <hi>Criſes</hi> of the Univerſal Pox, ſome prepare their Patients by Abſtinence, Fumigations, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorificks, and drying Decoctions, for to conſume the Phlegmatick humour, to which they pretend the Venereal Matter doth particularly adhere; others uſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40248:80"/>
Baths, Ptiſannes, and whatſoever is able to moyſten and cool the Body, to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the following Salivation hereby, and render the actions of Mercury the leſs pernicious; ſome others uſe partly things that moiſten, and partly ſuch as dry; and others again make uſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite different means, which I find to be all alike ridiculous, becauſe they are uſed indifferently to all perſons, and they all differ only becauſe each have found them practiſed on ſeveral perſons; whereas in truth the Age, Sex, Strength, Temperament, and generally the preſent diſpoſitions of the ſeveral Patients ought to conſtitute all the difference.</p>
                  <p>Indeed if it be by the means of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury alone that the <hi>Criſes</hi> of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Pox are intended to be raiſed, there is no need of employing the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies both Alterative and evacuative, before the application you would make of it, but only perhaps for the opening and dilatation of the paſſages that ſerve for Expulſion of Excrements, in ſuch as are of a good Temper, or elſe to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the faults of thoſe that are remote from this good Conſtitution. For if you ſhould offer to deſiccate a Body that is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40248:80"/>
of a middle Age, moderate Temper, and that rightly performs all its natural Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, 'tis certain it muſt receive great Alteration, and this Alteration muſt neceſſarily remove it from the Equality and Moderation it was in before, which nevertheleſs is exactly the eſtate in which Nature keeps its true vgour, and in which conſequently it muſt be better able to ſecond the force of Remedies; whence it follows, that it comes to be leſs proper for the Critical motions which do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the application of Mercury, in thoſe in whom a ſufficient quantity of acid Humours may be found, to ſtop and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Mercury in the ſeveral parts, for the time it ought to remain in them.</p>
                  <p>But if this Alteration can be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably pernicious, even to ſuch as are in a ſtate of perfection; you will not at all wonder, if the Salivation cannot be ſafely procured in Dry, Cholerick, or Melancholick Bodies that have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared after this manner: nay, you will find on the contrary, that all the parts will receive injury from the activity of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, ſeing it is now agitated by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Heat, and finds nothing that is able to fix and detain it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:40248:81"/>It is no leſs dangerous to make uſe of things that cool and moiſten, for the preparation of thoſe that are replete and phlegmatick; for by this means the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion is augmented, and the Humours become ſo diſpoſed for Fluxion, that Mercury ſoon draws them along with it in great abundance, and very often all the parts about the Throat do fill and ſwell in ſuch manner, that the Patients are ſoon ſuffocated thereby.</p>
                  <p>But now ſpeaking of the danger there is in making uſe of the ſame Remedies in all different Subjects, it comes into my mind, that I have read in a famous Author a certain Diſpute that he raiſes and reſolves himſelf; 'tis whether thoſe that have the Pox ought to be bled in their Preparation; he relates ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities and Reaſons <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and at laſt concludes in favour of Blood let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, of which he makes ſo general a Rule, that he will not except even ſuch as are Hectict: Whereupon you muſt obſerve, that this Maxim doth ſeem ſo much the more authentick, as it appears to be eſtabliſhed by a Learned Doctor, and founded on the examination and compariſon of contrary Opinions; from
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40248:81"/>
whence we may conclude that the faults which are committed by ſuch as blindly obſerve it, are ſo much the more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, as they are often irreparable; ſince there are a great many perſons who never dare go a ſtep further than the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas of thoſe that taught them. But I dare ſay, it is a ſhameful thing, &amp; diſparages Phyſick very much, that the greateſt part of thoſe who practiſe it, do apply themſelves ſo little to things of ſuch moment; and that many who have by their own induſtrry acquired ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular knowledges, are ſo covetous and fearful of communicating them, that they affect to keep them ſecret, even when they pretend to teach and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them. Let this be ſaid by the by.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nevertheleſs you muſt not imagin that infallible Rules can be given, for correcting exactly all the degrees of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments, and ſeveral diſpoſitions of all Bodies that are of different Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. For beſides that there are ſome inward and ſecret diſpoſitions, which can no way be known; the number of ſuch as may be known are in a manner infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and the endeavour I might here make for reckoning them up, would
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40248:82"/>
cauſe nothing but confuſion in this place. Notwithſtanding it is certain, a ſufficient Idea may be given of the Method that ought to be followed, for well preparing thoſe that are infected with the Pox, by the diſcovery of ſuch Remedies as may very happily ſerve to diſpoſe Bodies of a good Conſtitution, and correct the faults of ſuch as are extremely removed from this good eſtate by Repletion and Inanition; becauſe theſe patterns may ſerve to diſcover the compariſon of the Mean and two Extremes, from whence Formules may eaſily be drawn for all the greater and leſſer degrees, by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good Judgment, Application, and Experience (which are Qualities abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for eſtabliſhing a ſure practice) to the following Rules and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You may cauſe a light Emotion in Bodies of a good Diſpoſition and middle Age, by ſome gentle Purge; ſuch as may be an Infuſion of two Drachms of Senna, mixt with an Ounce of new-drawn Caſſia, which will ſufficiently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the way by ſiege, if you continue to repeat it four times, every Second day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:40248:82"/>In the intermediate days you may Bathe your Patient morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to diſſolve the coagulated Humours, and diſpoſe the Pores of the Body for a dilatation.</p>
                  <p>During all this time you may make the following Ptiſanne ſerve for his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Drink, which will open the Pores too, and alſo the paſſages of Urine, that ſerve for expulſion of Seroſities.</p>
                  <p>Take half a Pint of good white Wine, in which infuſe and ſteep before-hand half an Ounce of Guaiacum; then take two Ounces of French Barley, four Quarts of common Water, and ſo much Licorice as may be ſufficient for ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring your Ptiſanne pleaſant enough to drink; in each Quart you muſt mix ten or twelve Drops of the Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The faults which are oppoſite to this good Temperament of which I now ſpoke, are chiefly Inanition and Siccity, or elſe Repletion and Humidity.</p>
                  <p>The former are the effects of a boyling Heat, and therefore require for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectives, whatſoever is capable of moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and cooling at the ſame time; whence it comes to paſs that Blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40248:83"/>
which cools by allaying the Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, is notwithſtanding dangerous and to be ſuſpected on this occaſion, becauſe it alſo carries off the Humours, which are there already in too ſmall a quantity.</p>
                  <p>You may thence judge that Purges, and chiefly ſuch as are violent are alſo dangerous; for beſides that they conſume the little Moiſture which remains, they are extreme hot too; which are two Qualities abſolutely contrary to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention you ought to have.</p>
                  <p>It will be good nevertheleſs to keep the Body open, by giving every morning half a Pint of Whey, in which you muſt infuſe every fourth day, a Drachm of Senna, and half a Drachm of Cryſtal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to diſſolve in it afterwards half an Ounce of new-drawn Caſſia.</p>
                  <p>Seing Clyſters that ſerve to cleanſe the Guts are able to cauſe ſome Alteration, you muſt have a care of giving them, unleſs it be a Decoction of cooling Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbs, with two Ounces of Honey of white Lilies in each.</p>
                  <p>You muſt Bathe him morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for fifteen days together, and take care that the Bath be not hot enough to provoke Sweat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:40248:83"/>You may prepare a Ptiſanne for his ordinary Drink with French-Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and the Roots of wild Succory, Sorrel and white Lilies, to which you may add ſome Lycorice, and a little Lemmon, to render it more agreeable and cooling.</p>
                  <p>Broths and boil'd meat muſt ſerve for his nouriſhment, which you muſt diminiſh the quantity of by little and little; ſo that the Patient may find himſelf inſenſibly reduced to the conſtant uſe of liquid Aliments toward the end of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Exceſs of Repletion &amp; Moiſture is chiefly found in Bodies of a cold &amp; Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Temper, which you may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect by evacuating and drying them with the following Remedies.</p>
                  <p>You may frequently give them Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters made of the Decoction of the Leaves of Mallows, Marſh-mallows, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, the Flowers of Camomile and Melilot, Seeds of Aniſe and Fenugreek, adding to them Honey of Mercury.</p>
                  <p>You may here practiſe Blood-letting without any ſcruple, and repeat it ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, if you judge the Plenitude of the Veſſels to be very conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:40248:84"/>An Infuſion of three Drachms of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, one drachm of Agarick Trochiſcated, and as much of the Salt called Polychreſt, mixed with half an Ounce of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection Hamech, and an Ounce of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Peach flowers, will make up a Purge that may ſerve to evacuace abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Phlegm, if you repeat it ſeven or eight times every ſecond day.</p>
                  <p>You may prepare your Ptiſanne with two Quarts of ordinary Water, two Handfuls of French Barley, and three Ounces of Guaiacum, which you muſt have ſteeped beforehand in a hot place with a Pint of white Wine, and you may render it fit and eaſie to drink, by adding to the things aforeſaid, a little Cinnamon Coriander-ſeed, Licorice, or Lemmon, according to the Taſte and Palate of your Patient.</p>
                  <p>You may make him ſweat every eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by giving him a good large Glaſs of the foreſaid Ptiſanne to drink, in which you ſhall have dropt fifteen or twenty drops of the Spirit of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn; remembring to warm his Bed and Chamber as much as you can, and to put at the feet of ſuch as difficultly ſweat, Bottles filled with hot water. But if
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40248:84"/>
theſe things are not able to cauſe ſome perſons to ſweat, you will infallibly force them to ſweat ſufficiently, by making them receive the Vapour of the Spirit of Wine in a certain Stove made on purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>You muſt diminiſh his Nouriſhment by degrees, as I have already told you in the former Preparation; only you may make thoſe I now ſpeak of faſt with much leſs danger, than any others, and you muſt prefer Roſt-meat before Boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as being much more drying, becauſe the Particles of Fire do act more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the Middle Temperament and two Extremes, of which I have now ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, you will find many Bodies that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a leſs alteration, whether by Heat or Cold. In ſuch caſes you muſt uſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of a more moderate ſtrength; and for ſuch as are but indifferently Replete and Phlegmatick, you muſt lay aſide the ſtrong Sudoriſicks, and only uſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions of Saſſafras, China and Sarſapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla, according as there is more or leſs neceſſity of drying. In like manner you may bath leſs thoſe that are very hot and dry, or elſe forbear the other cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40248:85"/>
Moiſtning Ptiſanne. Laſtly, for them all you muſt be careful in augmenting or diminiſhing the ſtrength of Purgatives and in general of all Remedies that ſerve for Preparation, according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Conſiderations.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. HAving let you ſee after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you ought to prepare the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in which you would have Mercury
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40248:85"/>
to operate; it is now time to ſpeak of the ſeveral ways of uſing it, and the choice that ought to be made of them according to the degrees of the Diſeaſe, the ſupervening Accidents, and unhappy Circumſtances, in which perſons thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed do ſometimes find themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Mercury is uſually made enter into their bodies two manner of ways; either in at the Mouth, or elſe univerſally by the Pores.</p>
                  <p>It is worth obſerving, before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further, that the firſt of theſe ways is indeed none of the beſt, becauſe the Mercury that is thus taken at the Mouth, deſcends preſently into the Stomach, whence it is ſuddenly Sublimated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Heat of this part; which cauſes the Salivation that is raiſed by this means to continue but a very little time, and not to terminate completely the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Pox, unleſs the Natural Heat be found ſtrong enough to ſupply this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by vigorouſly following the Motion of Mercury.</p>
                  <p>I know well enough that ſome perſons do mix Purgatives with it, which do hinder its Sublimation, by precipitating it downwards. But this cuſtom ſeems to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40248:86"/>
have as little certainty as the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe only paſſing through the Guts, it cannot purify at moſt but that which is called the ſecond Region of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for there is no likelihood at all, that it ſhould be able to penetrate into the moſt remote parts, to mix with all the Acid Humours that are there extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated, and ſo draw them into the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I have ſpoken of, by a contrary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>By this way of arguing, and by the proof that I have made in this matter, and ſeen others make too; I cannot but think, ſuch as indifferently practiſe this way of adminiſtring it, and make it paſs for infallible in all that have the Pox, and in all the degrees of it, ought to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ignorant, or Impoſtors; and Patients ſhould in all reaſon rather rely upon the Honeſty and Experience of true Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, who do find but too many Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for diſcovering this truth, and are not wanting to advertiſe ingeniouſly ſuch as have an unhappy inclination to run the hazard of a falſe palliative Cure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been once falſly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or becauſe they are engaged by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Motives to ſearch out Remedies
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40248:86"/>
they fancy more eaſy, and leſs trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. I do not mean but there may be found abundance of perſons, who will maintain they have been cured by taking Mercury this way. But you muſt obſerve, that among them there are many who never had the Pox but only in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; that in ſome Nature did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Critical Motion of her own accord, near about the time they made this uſe of Mercury; that in others ſhe had been ſtrongly moved to the ſame effect, by the activity of other Remedies which have been mixed with it; laſtly that thoſe who have uſed it in the firſt degree of this univerſal Pox, that is to ſay, when its matter remains ſtill in the Veſſels, and hath not yet cauſed the ebullition of the blood, and conſequently diffuſion of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſities, might have been perfectly puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by receiving through the rough Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery ſome part of the Mercury that is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limated from the Stomach up to the Mouth, and might by that means be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Heart, from whence it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes univerſally ſpread through the Veſſels by the Circulation; or elſe by attracting through the Lacteal Veines ſome particles of that which is precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40248:87"/>
downwards by the conjunction of Purgatives, out of which Veins it may be alſo carried to the Heart, and thence diſperſed by the Motion of the blood, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner I now ſpoke of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nevertheleſs if you will be deſirous of trying to raiſe the <hi>Criſis</hi> of the Pox af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, you had beſt cauſe a looſneſs with it, by mixing crude Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or ſweet Sublimate with purging pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſuch as Aloes, Colocynth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Scammony, which you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into the conſiſtance of Pills, of which you may give every day a Doſe proportionable to the preſent condition of your Patient.</p>
                  <p>You may alſo provoke the Salivation, with theſe two ſorts of Mercury, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating as much as you can of the firſt with Turpentine and the Cruſt of Bread dryed and powdred, to reduce it afterwards into the form of Pills, of which you may give from half a drachm to one drachm; or elſe by mixing the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond from fifteen to thirty grains for each Doſe in a little Conſerve of Roſes; remembring always that this laſt ought to be preferred, and that the former is much more ſuſpicious, becauſe it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40248:87"/>
it ſelf in the Stomach, or in the Guts, after the Turpentine is diſſolved.</p>
                  <p>Beſides ſweet Sublimate, there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Chymical Preparations of Mercury, that are pretended to be Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative too, and do really Purge both by Vomit and Stool: Such as are red and white Precipitate, which are given from four to eight grains, and Turbith Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral from three to ſix. But you muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that this effect doth principally proceed from the Corroſion and Acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of corroſive Salts, that hold Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry under theſe ſeveral forms, and ſo the inward uſe that is made of them is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be accounted dangerous, unleſs you break the points of theſe <hi>Acids</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, by burning more then once theſe powders in the Spirit of Wine.</p>
                  <p>Almoſt all the Receipts, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Secrets of Empyricks, and generally of ſuch as promiſe to Cure the Pox with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obliging their Patients to quit their Employments for ſome time, or any way changing their uſual way of Living, do conſiſt in the uſe of the Powder of Algarot, and ſome other Preparations of Antimony, which have no conſiderable effect, beſides that of ſpoiling the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40248:88"/>
and diſordering all the Natural Functions; or elſe in the ſeveral ways of giving Turbith Mineral, and the two Precipitates I now ſpake of. For ſome of them give theſe things ſimply, and without any other Preparation, in the Conſerve of Roſes; and pretend to make them paſs quickly into all parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by giving preſently afterwards to their Patients as much Wine as they are able to drink; on which ſubject you muſt obſerve, that Wine taken in good quantity is mighty Diuretick, and that Mercury thus impregnated with Salts is eaſily diſſolved, and carried off by Urine, which for that reaſon then becomes very Salt and Acid, and is therefore the cauſe that there is but a very ſmall part of them that can enter or continue in the ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Veſſels, and ſo very ſmall help can be expected from them. Others again give theſe powders mixed with Gumme Gutta, the Reſine of Jalap, and other Purgatives alike violent, which truly do preſerve it in Motion, and do hinder it from adhering to the Stomach and Guts, but do often cauſe moſt terrible Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents by the fire that they enkindle in the body, and by the violence of the<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:40248:88"/>3. It remains then to make Mercury enter through the pores of the body, b<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> applying Mercurial Plaſters or Ointments upon it, and by reducing it into a Fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation when mixed with reſinous Drugs.</p>
                  <p>Mercurial Plaſters and Ointments are applyed to the ſame places, and have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near the ſame effect; the manner of uſing them doth not differ neither, only the firſt muſt be ſpread upon Leather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are applyed, whereas the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are applyed directly upon the skin, which is afterwards only covered with ſome Linnen.</p>
                  <p>That which is particular in this matter, is that the Mercury which enters into Plaſters requires a longer time to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the Maſs, than that which is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ointments, becauſe it is more cloſely confounded in the ſolidneſs of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore you muſt not change them but ſeldom or not at all, and cover from the beginning all the parts that ought to be covered.</p>
                  <p>The Plaſter which is ordinarily made uſe of, is that which is deſcribed by, and called <hi>de Vigo,</hi> and is found prepared in all Shops, ſimple, double, or treble with Mercury. But for as much as it is of too
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40248:89"/>
hard a conſiſtence, and doth not eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the skin, you may to better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe prepare another with eight ounces of Mercury, four ounces of Turpentine, and two pounds of the Plaſter of Muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That which is commonly called <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morbo,</hi> or the Grey Ointment, and by the Phyſicians Neapolitan, is found pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in Apothecaries Shops, and ſome make the friction with it. But becauſe the Doſe of Mercury is very ſmall in it, and, becauſe it is of an unſavoury ſmell; you may prepare another, more effectual Oyntment, with four ounces of Mercury, two ounces of Turpentine, one ounce of the Oyl of Bays, two drachms of Saffron, and a pound and a half of the Ointment of Roſes.</p>
                  <p>You may employ about two ounces of this Ointment for the firſt friction, which you muſt make from the Ankles till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Knees, and from the Wriſts to the end of the Shoulder-blades.</p>
                  <p>Though this quantity of Mercury be ſeldom ſufficient to bring Nature to a Critical Motion, nevertheleſs ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been found ſo tender and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40248:89"/>
or eaſy to put into this Motion, that they have received a Salivation even from the, very firſt Friction, and in which perſons a ſecond would have proved very dangerous; ſo that you muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve narrowly the Patient you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, ſo ſoon as you have thus given him Mercury, and you muſt diligently exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whatſoever happens to him anew, to the end you may preſently leave of your Frictions, ſo ſoon as the ſigns of a Salivation do appear, and this to avoid Suffocation, which doth always happen, when the Humours are carried up to the Throat in too great an abundance.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond Friction which muſt be made four and twenty hours after the firſt, you may employ up to four ounces of your Ointment, and rub the Legs and Thighs with it from the middle of the Foot to the upper part of the Hips, the Chine or Back-bone from the end of the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> to the middle of the Neck, and the Arms, from the Wriſts again to the Shoulder-blades, not forgetting the places where the <hi>Glandules</hi> are ſeated, which ſerve for Emonctories to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler parts.</p>
                  <p>This ſecond Friction is ſometimes ſufficient,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:40248:90"/>
but we are often compelled to make a third too, with the ſame Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the quantity of Ointment, and parts whereon it is applyed, which doth almoſt always produce the deſired effect, when the body is rightly prepared as it ought to be.</p>
                  <p>But you muſt not deſpair, though it ſhould fail to come yet; you muſt then uſe your beſt prudence and diſcretion, and have a care of going too faſt in your intention, leſt Nature ſhould chance to ſurprize you on a ſudden. For Example, you muſt let it alone for a day or two, before you begin a new Friction, and you muſt employ but a ſmall quantity of your Ointment, if you perceive any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Commotion. Be not obſtinate neither in filling a body with Mercury by fifteen or twenty repeated Frictions, as ſome Authors do unadviſedly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, becauſe it is a thing of very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a conſequence, and the <hi>Criſis</hi> you muſt deſire ſhould rather depend on a good Preparation, than ſuch an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this Medicament.</p>
                  <p>Howſoever you'll find by Experience that a Doſe of ſweet Sublimate will now prove wonderfully beneficial, if you give
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40248:90"/>
it after a reaſonable number of Frictions.</p>
                  <p>There remains ſomething ſtill to be ſaid of the time and manner of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, becauſe there are ſome very uſeful Circumſtances which depend on them; For Example, in a Cold Seaſon, it is needful to make choice of Noon, for the rubbing your Patients, becauſe the Air of our Climate is then rendred a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more benign; and in hot Weather on the contrary you muſt prefer the Mornings and Evenings, leſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Heat that is joyned with the Fire you muſt make ſhould weaken them too much; but in mild Weather you may indifferently make uſe of any hour of the Day, obſerving only that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of Aliments be then finiſhed, that Nature may have no other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take her off from conſpiring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Mercury to raiſe the <hi>Criſis</hi> you deſire.</p>
                  <p>As for the manner of making this Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, 'tis neceſſary to ſay it muſt always be made before the Fire, which muſt be very great, but eſpecially in Winter, and encloſed with a Skreen, or ſome ſuch like thing, to hinder the Wind, and ſerve to reverberate the Heat, that the Mercury
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40248:91"/>
may the better penetrate through the pores, and the Patient may not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted with any Cold; the Friction muſt be repeated ſeveral times on each part to facilitate this penetration.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Among the three ways of making Mercury enter through the pores, I have found by practice that the Fumigation is the worſt of all, and is ſo much the more dangerous, as it is commonly performed by the Smoke of Artificial Cynabre, which may prove a kind of poiſon in its ſelf, but is thought to be corrected by the mixture of Sublimate Corroſive, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Arſenick, and other like Druggs, which are indeed poiſons much more pernicious.</p>
                  <p>Howſoever I grant it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preferred before the others, when the Pox comes to be in the laſt degree of all, by reaſon that the Mercury being thus turned into Vapours, doth penetrate the bones the better. But if you deſire to draw the beſt effect that can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it, make uſe of crude Mercury reduced into Troches with Turpentin, Coals made of Willow, and <hi>Orris</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and leave all the other <hi>Formules</hi> to ſuch as Ignorance doth engage to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40248:91"/>
in a certain road they dare not ſtir a ſtep out.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, there is nothing more common than the way of giving the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migation; a certain Couch is covered all round with a ſheet, and a little Stool turned upſide downward is put under it, &amp; upon it a Chaffendiſh of lighted Coals, in which Troches are burnt, whoſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour the Patient receives all naked under the Covering, always excepting the Head, which is only kept within from time to time, when there are Ulcers in the Noſe, Mouth, or other parts of it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>1.</hi> That no Author hath ever yet explicated the Cauſes of theſe different Motions, and the neceſſity there was of doing it. <hi>2.</hi> Of the ways that ſerve for the <hi>Criſes</hi> which are excited by Mercury, and how that by sweat comes to paſs. <hi>3.</hi> Of the Critical Evacuations that are made by Siege. <hi>4.</hi> Of thoſe that are made by Urine. <hi>5.</hi> Of the Salivation. <hi>6.</hi> Of the ſigns that do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways demonſtrate a Salivation. <hi>7.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies againſt the Accidents that do commonly happen, and general Rules of the time it ought to laſt.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. THere are ſome Authors who have maintained, that Mercury ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied exteriourly on the skin, doth act on the body only by an irradiative ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and that the Doſe which was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to this effect, might eaſily be found again entirely in the Linnen and Plaſters, after provocation of the <hi>Criſis</hi>;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40248:92"/>
others have endeavoured to prove on the contrary, that it penetrates the pores, that it acts on all the inward parts, and laſtly that it goes out ſo ſenſibly with the Impurities of the body, that a piece of Copper may be whitened only by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing it a while in the Phlegm that runs out in the Salivation. But no body ever yet took the pains to enquire, why its Motions and Actions, and the <hi>Criſes</hi> that reſult from them do appear ſo very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, though it be prepared and given in the ſame form and manner.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who have made ſome Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on this ſubject, are contented to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire this Mineral, and conſider it as an <hi>Hydra</hi> with many Heads, or as the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus</hi> of Phyſick; they have pretended that there was ſome Analogie between it and the Mercury of Aſtrologers, which produces different effects according to its different Conjunctions with other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets; without taking notice of never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, or preſuming to teach us, what are thoſe matters it uſually joyns with, for to act ſo differently. They have made indeed many <hi>Elogiums</hi> of its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, without offering to give any expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of its effects; Laſtly they have
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40248:93"/>
told us that no Drug in all the Medicinal matter is fit to ſerve for a Subſtitute in its place, but have never diſcovered to us any reaſon of its ſingular qualities, or what's the matter that thoſe who have employed it have only acted like blind-men in it; ſo that young Students who have turned over all manner of Books for ſome illuſtration of this matter, have never been able to find any ſatisfaction, but have ſtill been compelled (as others have) to remain in their former obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and Patients who have been ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Events contrary to what they were made expect, have found no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons capable of building the comfort they give them on ſufficient or ſolid Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs the explication of theſe things was not really ſo difficult; Men might have made compariſon between the Principles of Art and thoſe of Nature, and between things Artificial in Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, and eſpecially in Chymiſtry, with what paſſes Naturally in the bodies wherein Mercury doth enter. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations which I have made on this ſubject, and which every body might have made as well as I, may perhaps prove ſufficient for the Evidence of what
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40248:93"/>
was hitherto hid, being alſo joyned with the Applications of them, perſons may make themſelves. In a word, the many Experiments and Events would clearly have diſcovered the truth, if men had been but curious enough to ſeek it out.</p>
                  <p>But whether it be that the knowledge of it was not judged neceſſary, or that no body was willing to take the pains of acquiring it, or elſe that thoſe who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the knowledge of it were not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to communicate what they knew; it is very certain that no Author hath yet undertook to teach it, and yet I cannot conceive, how the Artificial <hi>Criſes</hi> of the Pox can be perfectly explicated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out letting ſee at the ſame time what it is that renders them ſo different.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ways through which the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal matter doth ordinarily paſs in theſe ſorts of <hi>Criſes,</hi> are either ſuch as ſerve for Sweat, or for paſſage of the Urine, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of the groſſer Excrements, or eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that ſerve for the Salivation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Criſis</hi> that is made through the firſt of theſe ways doth happen, when the Mercury finds a great many Sulphurous Vapours which do ſerve for the matter of fat, in bodies wherein it enters; for as
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40248:94"/>
it doth ever mix willingly with Sulphurs, and is already diſpoſed to it by the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that hath been made of it with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinous bodies, it doth eaſily unite with fat and vaporous matters, which render it more light, more volatil, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more fit to follow their Motion from the Center to the Circumference. But as this ſame Motion is in ſome manner contrary to the penetration which Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury ought to make for ſufficiently puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the blood; it often happens that this <hi>Criſis</hi> is but imperfect, unleſs Nature her ſelf be that way exceedingly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some bodies are found to be ſo fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Tartarous Salt, or other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Nature of <hi>Alkalis,</hi> that the Mercury which enters into them precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates downwards by their means, and the Impurities are carried off by Siege. But as theſe matters do not hinder the Mercury from-penetrating into all the parts, this <hi>Criſis</hi> is much more certain than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, eſpecially when the Phyſician helps Nature to act, by often-repeated Purges and Diureticks.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That which cauſes the Mercury and Venereal Salts to be ſometimes carried
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40248:94"/>
off by Urine, is that <hi>Acids</hi> are found in ſome bodies, near in as great a Number as <hi>Alkalis</hi> is in others: The truth of this Opinion may be eaſily proved; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body knows that <hi>Acids</hi> taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly become Diuretick, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon Mercury do ſhew, that they may be ſublimated by Heat, when joyned with it, and that they can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated by <hi>Alkalis,</hi> even after this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation. Now you may perceive by what I have ſaid, that the property of <hi>Acids</hi> is to carry off Phlegm and Seroſities by way of Urine, but that they are not able to produce this effect, when joyned with Mercury, and agitated by the Natural Heat, unleſs <hi>Alkalis</hi> do alſo ſufficiently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, to precipitate it downwards. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore ſeeing impure Salts are eaſily diſſolved in watry ſubſtances, and this <hi>Criſis</hi> hath very much affinity with that which is made by Salivation, I conceive it muſt be more perfect than the other two, when its Evacuations continue long and large enough.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As 'tis the property of Leaven to extend it ſelf in the things that ferment, and render them hereby of a like Nature, ſo the Venereal Salts do diſſolve in the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40248:95"/>
blood, extend themſelves into all parts of the body, and render by this means almoſt all the Humours ſharp and Acid. This is the reaſon why the Salivation is the moſt ordinary <hi>Criſis</hi> of the Pox, that is provoked by the help of Mercury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it charges it ſelf with theſe Acid Liquours in ſo great a meaſure, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is able to carry it off ſo well by the other ways I mentioned; And it is this which may be eſteemed the ſureſt of all to cure this Diſeaſe; for beſides that it is very ſeldom ſeen to fail, when well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, the Circumſtances which do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it make us judge the better of its goodneſs. It is remarkable in the firſt place, that its Motion is from below up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and is commonly equal, moderate, and without any interruption, which ſhews that Nature acts rather of her own accord, than by the meer force of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Moreover all the Acid and impure Humours do aſcend ſo ſenſiby with the Mercury, that this mixture is near of the ſame quality with the diſſolution of this Mineral in the Spirit of Niter, or <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> in ſo much that being driven up by the Heat, there is made a kind of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate Corroſive which exulcerates all
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40248:95"/>
the parts of the Throat and Mouth, and penetrates them ſo exceedingly, that their Veſſels are opened, and blood runs out of them for ſome days, until the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becomes leſs acrimonious by a ſmaller quantity of <hi>Acids.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Impoſtors who give the Salivation to ſuch as have not the Pox, make theſe Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers paſs for effects of the Malignity of Venereal Salts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they may the better conceal their Villanies by ſuch perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But you muſt obſerve, that they do indeed happen as well to ſuch as have not the Pox, as thoſe who really have it, becauſe they are produced by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I lately ſpoke of, or by reaſon that there are Acid Juyces in all Men general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; in a word becauſe the Mercury is ſoon ſublimated, paſſes quickly, and doth but lightly heat the Mouth in thoſe who have too few <hi>Acids</hi> to govern its Motion, unleſs the other matters which I have ſpoken of do train or draw it ſome other ways: So that the Ulcers of the Mouth and Throat ought to be conſidered as inſeparable Accidents of this <hi>Criſis,</hi> whatſoever Indiſpoſitions it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Moreover you may know it in its
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40248:96"/>
beginning by the agitation of the Pulſe, the inquietudes of Mind and Body, the diminution or entire loſs of appetite, by the retiring of the Eyes, heat of Mouth, ſwelling of the Gums and Lips, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Tongue, ſtink of Breath, pain of Teeth, whiteneſs of the Palate, and interruption of ſleep.</p>
                  <p>When you ſhall find the <hi>Criſis</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by all theſe Signs, you muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear your Frictions, Fumigations, and generally all Mercurial Remedies, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Suffocation and other accidents which Mercury doth cauſe, when given in too great a quantity. But if its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication hath been reaſonably well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a Body rightly prepared, there will ſucceed to the Signs I named a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual trickling of white phlegm in a long thread, which will at firſt run but gently, but will augment by degrees for nine days time; ſo that the more Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick perſons may be able thus to ſpit up to eight pounds in four and twenty hours, and others in proportion.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt days of the ſublimation of Mercury, the Belly receives ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion from its paſſage, and this cauſes a Flux downwards, which laſts indeed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40248:96"/>
but a ſmall time, and requires no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular conſideration. It may be alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the increaſe of the Salivation, that the Ulcers which I ſpoke of do enlarge in latitude and profundity by the action of the matter that runs out of them; and that the motion of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery appears almoſt as ſtrong and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, as in burning Fevers, becauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities cannot be thus ſeperated from the Blood, without raiſing a great Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition in it, by the motion of Mercury, or ſtrength of the natural heat. But ſeeing theſe things do happen through an indiſpenſible, neceſſity, and are not at all contrary to what may fairly be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Action of Mercury, you need not trouble your ſelves to think of preventing or curing them by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Remedies.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Nevertheleſs you may mitigate the pains in the Belly, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very hard to endure, by the means of Anodyne and cooling Clyſters; or elſe diminiſh the corroding Acrimony, which cauſes Ulcers in the Mouth, with gentle affwaging Gargariſms; ſuch as are, for example, Cows Milk luke-warm, or the Decoction of French-Barley, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40248:97"/>
and Fleawort-ſeed; to which muſt be added, that it is ſometimes neceſſary to conſume the corrupted fleſh about them with Spirits of Wine, Vitriol, or Sulphur.</p>
                  <p>It ſhould remain to ſay ſomething of the Quantity of the Matter, and time of its running; but ſeeing theſe two Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances do abſolutely depend on the Temperaments of perſons, and degrees of the Diſeaſe, they cannot be preciſely regulated, but by the Judgment, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and Experience of him that treats them. Wherefore I ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you to no purpoſe on this Subject, but believe it may ſuffice to ſay general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking, that you ought not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin counting the days of the Flux, until it is able to furniſh at leaſt two pounds of Matter in four and twenty hours, and that it ought to continue a fortnight at leaſt, and a month at moſt.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs there are ſome Authors who pretend that the ceſſation of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and eſpecially of the Flux, are undoubted marks of a complete and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Cure. But you may eaſily perceive this Rule not to be infallible, ſince I have proved in another place, that the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40248:97"/>
Cauſe of the Pox may ſtill remain, when the ordinary Accidents are vaniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and that there are other Accidents on the contrary, which can never whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappear, but by the application of particular Remedies, either during, or after the univerſal Purification of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for example, the Rottenneſs of Bones, which muſt be corrected by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Cauteres; the Conſumption of Fleſh or Skin made by Tetters or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Ulcers, which can never be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated but by mundifying Medicines; laſtly the Relaxation and weakneſs of the Spermatick Veſſels, which cauſes in ſome perſons a continual Effluxion of the Seed, until they be cloſed up again by ſtyptick and aſtringent Remedies. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides you will find by experience, that the Flux often ceaſes before the Diſeaſe, and that it is ſometimes neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new it; or at leaſt to aſſiſt the former Evacuation with Remedies that purge through other paſſages, eſpecially when Nature is ſo inclined.</p>
                  <p>But you muſt not do like thoſe who think they can never enough drain the Bodies that are thus infected, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and exhauſt the Radical Moiſture
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40248:98"/>
it ſelf, which is the foundation of Life, after having drawn away all the other Humours. But remember rather, that it is of as great importance to preſerve what is natural to the Body, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy whatſoever is enemy to or againſt Nature. And to the end you may the better avoid this Exceſs, you muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve very exactly, how far the Body is dried, how the forces are ſpent, and all the other Circumſtances, which I gave you before; that ſo you may timely ſtop the Salivation after a ſufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it, by change of Linnen, Bed, and ſometimes Chamber too, or by the Precipitation of Mercury, which may be made with the Salt of Tartar taken alone in a Broth, or mixed with the ordinary Purges and Diureticks.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>1.</hi> In what this Diet doth conſiſt in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and why it is neceſſary to give par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular examples of it. <hi>2.</hi> The manner of governing thoſe who are of a good Complexion: <hi>3.</hi> Who are Hot and Dry: <hi>4.</hi> Who are Cold and Moiſt. <hi>5.</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Obſervations for them all.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. THE Method of governing ſuch as are in the <hi>Criſes</hi> that are raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mercury, doth in general conſiſt in preſerving them from the violence of ill Air and bad Weather, in regulating the Quality and Quantity of Aliments and Medicaments, and if you will alſo, in a Moderation of the Paſſions of the Mind.</p>
                  <p>The means of anſwering the firſt point have been already given, when I ſpoke of the proper ſeaſons to treat the Pox; and it ſeems that the prudence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Phyſician ought to make
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40248:99"/>
Rules for the other two. Nevertheleſs ſeing it is often impoſſible to correct perfectly in the Preparation, all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Diſpoſitions which proceed from the diverſe Temperaments of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and it is conſequently neceſſary to perſiſt until the end of the Cure, in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular uſe of things that are contrary to their pernicious Qualities; it may be expedient to do as I have here done in delivering the Method of Preparing ſuch as have this Diſeaſe, that is to ſay, of ſhewing here the proper management of Nouriſhment and Remedies for ſuch as are of an even and good Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for thoſe that are removed from this good Mean, by great Repleti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Inanition; after which you will here find ſome general Circumſtances it is convenient to obſerve, in all thoſe perſons who are treated with Mercury.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are two Rules particularly important for the Diet of one of a middle Temper; the firſt is, Not to give him any more Aliments than will preſerve his forces in good plight, that Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Superfluities may not too much abound: and the ſecond is, That you give him light Remedies for to open
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40248:99"/>
the chief paſſages, that Nature may not be diverted in her operations by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motions.</p>
                  <p>You will ſufficiently anſwer the firſt Rule, if you give him two new-laid Eggs at noon, and a Broth every fourth hour, all the reſt of the day and night, which you may make with a Leg of Beef, Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and ſome Succory.</p>
                  <p>The Ptiſanne which I have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for preparation of Bodies of this conſiſtence, may alſo ſerve them very well during the <hi>Criſis,</hi> to anſwer the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Rule I gave you; becauſe it is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifick and Diuretick, and may be alſo rendred proper for gently looſning the Body, by making a cold Infuſion of two Drachms of Senna four and twenty hours in a Quart of it, which you may make him drink every ſecond day at ſeveral draughts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When you ſhall come to treat a Body that is very Hot and Dry, you muſt remember it would be a dangerous thing to nouriſh him too little, or give him A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments of a Heating quality. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt prefer Broths before new-laid Eggs, and give him one at leaſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry third hour, made of a Leg of Veal,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40248:100"/>
Beef and Pullet, adding to it in Summer Sorrel, Lettice and Purſlain, or in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Succory. But if your Patient nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeates this kind of Nouriſhment, you may make him a Gelly with the above-mention'd meats, French-Barley, a little of the cold Seeds and Sugar.</p>
                  <p>You may ſafely make uſe of the moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and cooling Ptiſanne, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed when I ſpoke of the means of preparing theſe perſons; in a Quart of which you may infuſe a Drachm of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and ſo much Cryſtal Mineral to give him every fourth day.</p>
                  <p>Clyſters that cool and moiſten the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will prove very effectual, if you make them of Whey, or a Decoction of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbs, mixing with each an Ounce of Honey of Violets or white Lilies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. On the contrary, during the time you treat a Body that is extreme Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick and replete, you muſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented only with the Critical Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are commonly made by the Mouth; but you muſt endeavour al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways beſides to exhauſt his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; ſo that ſome Broths or new-laid Eggs given every ſix hours will ſuffice for his Nouriſhment, becauſe you muſt give
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40248:100"/>
him but only juſt enough to keep him alive.</p>
                  <p>The Ptiſanne made of Guaiacum will alſo ſerve to dry him the more, if you prepare it according to the Doſe I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Chapter of the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>You may often give Clyſters made of common Honey, and a Decoction of the Leaves of Sage, Wormwood, Rue and Fennil.</p>
                  <p>You may prepare laxative Potions, whoſe uſe muſt be frequent, with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Sage-leaves, an Infuſion of Senna and Hermodactyls, and the Syrup of Roſes or Peach-flowers; taking care of giving them to ſuch a Doſe, as may not be apt to divert the Salivation in its beginning, or diminiſh it when it is in its vigour.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By the Examples I have given you, and by what hath been already ſaid in delivering the means of preparing Bodies for the Motions and effects of Mercury, you will eaſily frame different Methods, for ſuch as are in the ſeveral degrees of more or leſs; and there is no neceſſity of preſcribing any others more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on this Subject. But it is ſo much
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40248:101"/>
the more neceſſary here to remark the following Obſervations, as they ought in general to ſerve for all thoſe who are in any <hi>Criſis</hi> that follows the application of this Remedy.</p>
                  <p>In all fainting and ſwooning fits you may prefer a little Wine before Cordial Liquours, or Acid Fruits, and you will find by experience that it hath a better Effect.</p>
                  <p>You muſt forbear Biscakes, Comfits, and generally all ſweet ſugar'd things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they make the Teeth black, and increaſe the acrimony and pain which they do then ſuffer in the Throat.</p>
                  <p>After the Evacuations have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and you have ſtopt the Flux, or hinder'd the others, you muſt draw your Patients by little and little, out of the great weakneſs they then ſubſiſt in, by a gradual augmentation of their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after the ſame manner as you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd it in their Preparation; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring always that you cannot ſuddenly change them out of Inanition into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion, without endangering their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation, or putting them into ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate and mortal Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as they ſhall be re-eſtabliſhed a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40248:101"/>
little by this means, you may reaſſume the uſe of Purgatives, Diureticks and Sudorificks, to ſet Nature at work again, and help to drive out ſuch Impurities as do ſometimes ſtill remain after all theſe former endeavours.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the Tranquility of the Mind is ſo neceſſary during all the Cure, that there is always a great deal of danger, where it is wanting, and conſequently it is your Duty to remove from your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients all things which may ſtir up the Paſſions of the Mind, and eſpecially Fear, Sadneſs, Anger, care of any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of concernment, or any kind of particular application of the Mind; ſo that you muſt always be ſure to entertain them with the hopes of a ſafe and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Cure, you muſt relate to them only things which may pleaſe and rejoyce their hearts, and you muſt give them all manner of ſatisfaction as far as you are able; or at leaſt pleaſantly repreſent to them the prejudice they would be apt to ſuffer from things which cannot be granted to them without danger. Nay, you muſt alſo take care of their affairs, where there is occaſion, either really or elſe in ſhews; Laſtly, you muſt take away
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40248:102"/>
from them all Books, Manuſcripts, and generally all ſuch things as are capable of engaging them in two much thoughtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, eſpecially after that Mercury is once applied.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. Whatſoever hath been hitherto ſaid concerning the way of curing the Pox, may equally ſerve for both Sexes, as well as alſo for all Ages, if you do but proportionate your Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40248:102"/>
to the ſtrength of your Patient. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there are indeed ſome particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances it is neceſſary to obſerve, for the better curing of Women, and little Children. For if the firſt of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have their Terms ſuppreſt, you muſt in the firſt place of all labour to provoke them, while you are in their Preparation for the reception of Mercury, becauſe you muſt always make the application of it, ſo ſoon as, or preſently after they have ſufficiently flowed, for fear leſt if they ſhould renew their Courſe too ſoon, they might create a great diſorder in the Oeconomy of Nature, by a contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that of the Salivation.</p>
                  <p>You muſt alſo take notice that there ſometimes happen very urgent Accidents which engage them to be treated while they are with Child; and you will find by experience that they can then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the Cure without danger, by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to manage them gently, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to chooſe a time wherein their groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a little advanced; becauſe the Infant is too weak in its beginning, to reſiſt the diſturbance which Mercury and the other Remedies do cauſe in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and becauſe it might be apt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerate
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40248:103"/>
celerate the Child-bed toward the end, before the Off ſpring doth receive a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect maturity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Infants are capable of catching the Pox, either in the Womb of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or by ſucking diſeaſed Nurſes; in a word, by being kiſſed or toucht ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wayes by perſons infected with this Diſeaſe. Whence it comes to paſs, that it may happen in all the times and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Youth, and ſo conſequently cannot be treated after the ſame manner, ſince the ſtripling that ſucks his nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Teat, is infinitely leſs fit to bear the violence of Remedies, than he that is able to live like other men, by advancement of years.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding there is no neceſſity of giving different Methods for all Ages, becauſe the many various Intentions, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and Remedies, which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, may alſo ſerve for the Cure of Infants, only obſerving a due proportion of them to their ſmall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it is needful nevertheleſs to preſcribe the particular Method of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring well the ſmalleſt of all; that ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving examples before you of the greateſt and leaſt, you may the more eaſily judge
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40248:103"/>
of the quality and quantity of things which ought to be employed in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees of mediocrity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So ſoon as you ſhall have diſcover'd the Pox in an Infant that ſucks, you muſt firſt of all endeavour to diſcover the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that did communicate it, to the end you may remove ſuch perſon before you entrepriſe any thing. After which you muſt chooſe a good Nurſe, to contribute towards the purification of his blood by the uſe of wholſom Milk, which you muſt carefully preſerve in all its purity by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing her a good Dyet, and ſeparating your little Patient from her; and you muſt give him Milk only with a little ſpoon, or elſe with fine Linnen, that he may ſuck after 'tis dipt in it. But you muſt know that the Milk of a Goat well fed is infinitely to be preferred before that of an unſound Woman.</p>
                  <p>It will be neceſſary to purge him in the beginning of all with a little Water of <hi>Caſſia,</hi> or the Syrup of Roſes, and repeat this Purge ſeveral times, according as he is more or leſs replete.</p>
                  <p>You may prepare a Ptiſanne for him with a handful of French-Barley, and three or four drachms of China-root,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40248:104"/>
which you may boil in three Quarts of common Water, to the diminution of the third part, adding to it toward the end a little Licorice, &amp; after you have paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ten grains of Cryſtal Mineral, for to give him to drink or ſuck of, from time to time day and night.</p>
                  <p>After having opened by this means the common paſſages of the Excrements, you may rub the bottom of his Feet every third day with a drachm of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ointment;</p>
                  <p>Take a drachm or a drachm and a half of Mercury revived from Cynnabre, and kill it in two ounces of the Balſom of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus, adding afterwards ſix ounces of Hogs-greaſe well waſhed, and make uſe of it ſix or eight times the way I have told you.</p>
                  <p>If theſe firſt Frictions don't procure a Flux, or do cauſe ſome other ſort of <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> you muſt even continue them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other Myſtery as long as they ſhall be thought neceſſary; or elſe you may make them ſtronger by the augmentation of the Doſe of the fore-ſaid Ointment, with half a drachm, or more for each Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and by employing it partly on the Feet, and partly on the hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:40248:104"/>During the time of the Critical Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, you may give him every ſix days two or three grains of the volatil Salt of Vipers, diſſolved in a little of the Tiſanne deſcribed before; and you may prefer this ſame Remedy before all the Treacle, Philoſophical, and Sudorifick Waters, from whence ſome Authors do promiſe ſuch falſe wonders.</p>
                  <p>Now the moſt important precept I have to give you on the account of little Infants, is to treat them as gently as they have but little ſtrength, and to ſpare neither time nor pains to encreaſe their ſmall ſtrength, or at leaſt to preſerve it; for if you weaken them by the force of your Remedies, you'll miſerably drive them into an inevitable death, inſtead of curing them as you deſigned; ſeeing the Operation of Medicaments is always ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dangerous, or unuſeful, if it be not ſeconded by the efforts of Nature.</p>

THough the Pox be not a Diſeaſe mortal of it ſelf, and I hold it curable in all its degrees, it is true ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs that Men may dye of it (as I have ſaid before) when its matter hath corrupted or deſtroyed the parts without which there is no living; when one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it hath fallen into the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py practices of Ignorants and Impoſtors: Laſtly when careleſs Phyſicians do not ſoon enough remedy the Accidents which ſometimes happen after the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Mercury.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:40248:105"/>Not but the precepts which I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are almoſt infallible, for curing this Diſeaſe ſuddenly, eaſily, and ſurely, and hardly can they fail in one of a thouſand, when they are regularly obſerved. But there are ſome diſmal Circumſtances, which it is impoſſible to remove. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that Men are neceſſarily mortal, the true Cauſe of their Death is often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, the time of it cannot be avoided, and the Cacochymie of bodies is now &amp; then ſo very great, that it cannot poſſibly receive Correction; to which may be added that there are ſome inward Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, which can no way be known, or there is no poſſibility of taking away. Whence it comes to paſs, that the ſucceſs of this undertaking is not always ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as we could wiſh, and Accidents may indeed happen which could in no wiſe be expected, to which nevertheleſs we ought to adhibite Remedies with all manner of care and exactneſs, which are things greatly neceſſary in all Occaſions where Life and Death are concerned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now though all theſe Cauſes are of the ſame conſequence, it would be but a vain attempt to deliver the means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying them all, ſince that ſome of them
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40248:106"/>
cannot be known, and others cannot poſſibly be removed. It may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſay ſomething of the ill Tempers of Bodies, and the too great quantity of Mercury which may be made enter into them, becauſe they are the uſual Cauſes of all the Accidents which follow its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and there are none but may happen by reaſon of them. For when all the things that cool and moiſten have been uſed to no purpoſe for quenching the Fire, and correcting the dryneſs of an extraordinary Melancholick body, there is often found to follow a looſneſs accompanied with unſufferable gripes &amp; pains, and which ſoon leaves a conſtipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on behind, that cauſes an Inflammation of the Entrals, Breſt, Throat, and Mouth, with difficulty of Breathing, Swallowing, and Speaking; which Symptoms ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a Fever, that in a ſmall time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes violent enough, to ſublimate the Mercury up to the Brain, and thereby cauſe Swoonings, Phrenſies, Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and very often Deafneſs, and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Apoplexies, and Palſies, or laſtly Death it ſelf, if care be not ſuddenly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to prevent it, by due applying fit Remedies againſt this train of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:40248:106"/>In like manner if the Dyet, drying Decoctions, and ſtrong Sudorificks have not been uſed ſufficiently to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient alteration of a very Phlegmatick and replete body, or elſe if Mercury hath been applyed in too much haſt, it will ſublimate along with it all on a ſudden, ſo great a confluence of Humours that the moſt part of the Accidents I now reckoned up will alſo appear, but more particularly an extraordinary Swelling of the Throat, Tongue, Cheeks, and often of all the whole Face, with conſiderable hardneſs, and looſneſs of Teeth, and with an immoderate Flux of Blood from the Ulcers of the Mouth, which in a ſhort time become great, ſpreading, black, ſtinking, and gangren'd, and which do at laſt cauſe Death, if a Suffocation don't prevent their malignancy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In all theſe miſerable Conjunctures the beſt means to be uſed do conſiſt in hindring the Activity of Mercury, in the diminution of its quantity by change of Bed, Linnen, and Chamber, and in the precipitation of the reſt downwards by aſtringent Gargariſms, Clyſters, Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomies in the Foot, and eſpecially by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated Purges, in which you muſt
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40248:107"/>
be ſure always to mix the Salt of Tartar, proportionating the reſt of the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients to the Age, Strength, and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of your Patients.</p>
                  <p>Some do make uſe of a Golden Pill, which they cauſe to be ſwallowed ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al times after as many Lotions, and which always indeed carries off ſome very little Mercury on its Superficies; but it is ſo very ſmall a quantity for ſo long a time, that no great effect can be expected from it, and its uſe muſt by no means hinder that of the former Remedies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. After having thus provided againſt all theſe Accidents in general, by the means that I have propoſed; 'tis time to think of ſuch as demand particular Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectives, and apply Cupping-glaſſes with ſcarifications on the nape of the neck, or on the ſhoulders, for all Phrenſies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, Apoplexies, Deafneſs, Blindneſs, and in general for all Indiſpoſitions of the Brain and Nerves.</p>
                  <p>A Gargariſm made with a Decoction of Plantain, red Roſes, and Agrimony in which you muſt drop a little Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, will prove aſtringent enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Blood or Phlegm that runs out of the Mouth, and deterſive enough to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40248:107"/>
cleanſe the Ulcers which ſhall be toucht from time to time with the Chymical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits before named.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable, that this ſame Garga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm may alſo ſerve to ſtrengthen the looſe Teeth, by cloſing of the Gums, which nevertheleſs may be much better faſtned by touching them with the <hi>Aqua ſecunda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An Oxyrrhodin made of one part of Vinegar, and two of Oyl of Roſes, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly applyed on the Throat, aſſwages it, takes down the Swelling, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the Inflammation.</p>
                  <p>You may alſo for the ſame effect make uſe of the Cere-cloth of <hi>Galen,</hi> mixt with the Oyl of ſweet Almonds.</p>
                  <p>A few ſpoonfuls of good Wine will do a great deal of good in all Faintings, and Swoonings, for to fortifie the Heart, and diſperſe again the ſuffocated Spirits, which you muſt prefer in this occaſion, before all the Confections, Cordial Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other artificial Cardiacks.</p>
                  <p>Cows-Milk luke-warm will wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully appeaſe the pains in the Guts, if you make Fomentations of it outwardly and Injections within, in which you may add ſome Yelks of Eggs, and ſome grains of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40248:108"/>
                     <hi>Laudanum,</hi> to render them yet more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodyne.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe Ordinary Remedies, the knowledge which you ought to have of things that appertain to Phyſick, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which you may learn, and the Counſel you may pleaſe to take, will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you with an infinity of others on particular Occaſions.</p>
