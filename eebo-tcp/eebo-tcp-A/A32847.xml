         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

laugh at the Tales of Immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as the Romantic and vain sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of a fond and groundless awe and superstition in the World. So they will do, 'tis like enough, at what is said in the following Pages of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in particular. But then it may be worth the while to observe, (for the caution and safety of all, at least, whose vitals are not yet tainted with the infection) not only, how bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they contradict the many plain and repeated declarations of sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which Christians certainly should reverence; but how unreasonably cross they appear to the strongest current of Traditionary Belief among the best of Men.</p>
                  <p>Next, for the Method and way of handling what I have undertaken: It is not, I confess, curious and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and yet not altogether careless, but such, as the Text prefixed most fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

suggests; and may competently serve, I hope, both to the satisfaction and ease, the edification and delight of unpr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And now, for the Dedication: I cannot say the Book it self needs any other Guardians than the Angels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, however the Author may; and, as there are none better qualified for his Protection than your Lordships, so there is none to whom he could more chearfully apply for shelter: But in this his design, I am sure, is honest and dis-interested, being only to testifie his bounden Gratitude to your Honours, (under whose Patronage and good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement

                     <p>THE chief scope and design of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in this Chapter, is to declare the exaltation and preference of Christ Jesus above the Angels. To which purpose, (not to lead you through the whole contexture) in the Verse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before-going, he thus argues,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>But to which of the Angels said he at any time, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine Enemies thy Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool?</hi> So God had said expresly to this his belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Son, <hi>Psal.</hi> 100.1 thereby to intimate that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar state of Royal Majesty and Honour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he had advanced him. But he never said the like to any of the Angels; no not to the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent among them all: They are not therefore Lords, like him, but Servants under him, for the good of his Disciples. So much the Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Text imports, with emphasis, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter to be decided by the Reader's judgment, and making an Appeal to every one upon it, as in a case known and granted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Are they not all</hi> [that is, undoubtedly all the Angels are] <hi>ministring Spirits, sent forth to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster for them who shall be heirs of salvation</hi>?</p>
                     <p>Abstracting then from the coherence of the words, we will observe, for the more orderly and profitable consideration of them, these six points.</p>
                     <p>First, The Persons spoken of [<hi>they</hi>] the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in the precedent Verse, as to their Name [<hi>Angels</hi>] and the certainty of their existence, [<hi>Are they not?</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Their Nature, [<hi>Spirits.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Their number and multitude, [<hi>all</hi>] and therein their order and distinction.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Their Function and Office, [<hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string Spirits, sent forth to minister.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The Character of such, for whose good and benefit this their Ministry is chiefly intended, [<hi>for them who shall be heirs of salvation.</hi>] And,</p>
                     <p>Lastly, By way of Application, those practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inferences, which are most proper and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to be made from the whole.</p>
                     <p>In which severals now that we may proceed with due success, I do here, in compliance with

the well-grounded piety of the Ancients, prefix the Prayer of a Learned Divine in his Proem to Cases of Conscience about this very subject.</p>

An Angel also invites Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel in <hi>Macedonia, ch.</hi> 16. — So forward are these celestial Spirits in promoting the knowledg of those blessed Mysteries, which themselves with admiration look down into; and to testifie unto us, that it belongs not to them to usurp the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Office in the Church of Christ, but to preserve and countenance it in the hands of such, as our Lord and Saviour hath appointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                        <p>It is indeed an high honour which God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts unto Men, to confer this Angelical-Office and imployment on them; but then it is also a gracious condescension to humane weakness, that he is pleased so to treat with us, and speak to us by these in our own Flesh. For we could not bear the glorious splendor of Divinity it self in this our mortal state, nor the apparitions of Angels, neither, without much of terror and consternation.

                        <p>But the way of Salvation is already prescribed to us, and setled by a sure word of Prophesie in the holy Scriptures, which we are to give heed unto, as an unerring Rule and Guide: So that we must not look for, or hearken unto any other Gospel. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> as to this is cleer and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; <hi>Though we or an Angel from Heav'n preach any other Gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed: as we said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, so say I now again, if any one preach any other Gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed,</hi> Gal. 1.8, 9. which we are the more carefully to mind, because there may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Diabolical delusions pretending to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical and Divine Revelations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15. and we are warned, <hi>Not to believe every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they be of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many false-Prophets are gone abroad in the World,</hi> 1.

                        <p>This then we are to conclude upon for our security against all dangerous Impostures, that a good Angel, an Angel of Light, can never come unto us upon any errand contrary to the revealed Word and Will of God by Jesus Christ, whom they all adore and worship.

Year of his Age, but conceived that the said
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48531:52"/>
Spirit had been present with him all his Life-time, as he gather'd from certain Monitory Dreams and Visions, whereby he was forewarn'd as well of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral dangers, as vices. That this Spirit disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd himself to him after he had for a whole Year together pray'd to God to send a good Angel to be the Guide and Governour of his Life and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. That every day he would knock at the Door about three or four a-Clock in the Morning to rouze him up, and a Voice would come, while he was asleep, saying, [<hi>Who gets first up to pray?</hi>] That by some sensible sign he did ever advertise him of things, as by striking his right Ear, if he did any thing amiss; if otherwise, his left: and if any body came to circumvent him, that his right Ear was struck; but his left, if a good Man, and to good ends, accosted him. If he was about to eat or drink any thing that would hurt him, or intended or purposed with himself to do any thing that would prove ill, that he was inhibited by a sign; and if he delay'd to follow his business, that he was quickned by a sign giv'n him. When he began to praise God in Psalms, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his marvelous Acts, that he was presently raised and strengthned with a spiritual and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Power. That he was often admonished to give Alms, and that the more charity he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd, the more prosperous he was. And that on a time, when his Enemies sought after his Life, and knew that he was to go by Water, that his Father in a Dream brought two Horses to him, the one White, the other Bay; and that therefore he bid his Servant hire him two Horses, and, though he told him nothing of the colours, that yet he brought him a White-one and a Bay-one. That in all difficulties, Journeys, and what other Enterprizes soever he used to ask Counsel of

God; and that one Night, when he had begg'd his Blessing, while he slept he saw a Vision, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Father seem'd to bless him.

And alittle after he heard the same Voice calling him in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which made a greater Impression upon him than before: so that now, being awakened, he call'd to his Wife lying by him, and told her what had hapned; and both of them for a time lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, expecting whether they might hear the Voice again, and whether it would say any thing more to them. At last the Voice awakened him a third time, calling him, as before, by Name, and advising him by all means to retire speedily out of that Town with his Family; for that within a few days the Plague would rage horribly there. To which the Chancellor added, that it was very well he followed the Direction giv'n him, for as much as soon after the Plague indeed began in the Town, and destroy'd a great Number of the

                        <p>We read of an Angel in the Book of <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> crying to the four Angels there, to whom it was giv'n to hurt the Earth and Sea, saying, <hi>Hurt not till we have sealed the Servants of our God in the foreheads,</hi> Revel. 7.2, 3.</p>
                        <p>King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in a great strait and distress, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt with the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> whose Power and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude he was no-ways able to resist, prayeth to God, and he sends his Angel to work a sudden and wonderful deliverance for him, destroying in one night (as hath been touch'd <note n="†" place="margin">Ch. 2. sect. 3.</note> before) an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fourscore and five thousand of the insulting Enemy, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.</p>
                        <p>And such another story we have of the great deliverance of <hi>Maccabeus,</hi> and the Jews, by an Angel [or helper from Heav'n] in the <hi>Apochry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 11.6, 8, 9, 10, 11. with his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at another time for the like aid, encouraged by this example of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Ch. 15.22, 23, 24.</p>
                        <p>The three famous Confessors, <hi>Shadrach, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> (whose proper names were <hi>Hananiah, Michael,</hi> and <hi>Azariah,</hi> Dan. 1.) when cast into a Fiery Furnace, heated seven times hotter than ordinary, were yet strangely preserved from all harm, and indemnified amidst the raging Flames by an Angel of God, who appeared there
<pb facs="tcp:48531:55"/>
with them, so that that most furious and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Element had <hi>no power upon their Bodies, nor was an hair of their Head singed, neither were their Coats changed, nor did the smell of the Fire pass upon them,</hi> though it was so fierce and scorching that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed the men, who cast them in, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.</p>
                        <p>And when <hi>Daniel,</hi> another of the Confessors of those times, (as they are reckon'd up, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. call'd there, <hi>The four Children, to whom God gave great knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom)</hi> when he, I say, was cast into the Lions Den, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be devoured, an Angel of God there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains the wild appetite of those greedy beasts of prey, and after a most unwonted manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves him in the very Jaws of Death, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. <hi>My God,</hi> saith he, <hi>hath sent his Angel, and hath shut the Lions mouths that they have not hurt me, for as much as before him innocency was found in me, and also before thee, O King, have I done no hurt,</hi> Ver. 22. And these four are the persons plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to in the Apostle's Martyrology, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.33, 34. <hi>Who,</hi> are said, <hi>through faith to have stopt the mouths of Lions,</hi> and <hi>quenched the violence of Fire, viz.</hi> God by his Angels, as hath been said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rescuing and delivering them.</p>
                        <p>When the Apostles were, by the procurement of the High-Priest, put in the Common-Prison, the Angel of the Lord by night open'd the Prison-doors, <hi>and brought them forth,</hi> and animated them to speak openly to the People in the Temple, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> after that, imprisoned by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> and deliver'd over for security to four Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternions of Souldiers to be kept, was thence, notwithstanding all their care, set at liberty by an Angel loosing of his Chains, causing the Iron-gates of the City to open to him, and conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of him through the Streets thereof, in such a manner as he thought himself but in a Dream for a great while, till he came at last to acknowledg, <hi>Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath sent his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and hath deliver'd me out of the hand of</hi> Herod, <hi>and from all the expectation of the People of the Iews,</hi> Acts 12.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus the Angels, we see, are the Commissioned Instruments of extraordinary Escapes, Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Deliverances.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes too they are sent, as Physitians, to cure and heal, in case of Hurt, Sickness, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.

                        <p>To this head we may refer, perhaps, those choice Receits, which <hi>M. Antoninus</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself a Debtor for to the Gods [<gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>And in the Book of <hi>Tobit</hi> we are told of the Angel <hi>Raphael</hi> [whose name, as I have said else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, signifies a Divine Physitian] sent to heal old <hi>Tobit</hi> of his blindness, and <hi>Sarah</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Raguel,</hi> his daughter-in-Law, of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached barrenness, <hi>To scale away the whiteness of</hi> Tobit<hi>'s eyes, and to give</hi> Sarah <hi>the daughter of</hi> Raguel <hi>for a wife to</hi> Tobias <hi>the son of</hi> Tobit, <hi>and to bind</hi> Asmodeus <hi>the evil Spirit, that had kill'd her seven former husbands before they had lain with her,

Tobit</hi> 3. And the good old man was so ready in his belief of this Divinity, concerning the help and protection of God's Angels vouchsafed to his Servants upon occasion, that he cheers and comforts his troubled and discontented Wife, upon his Son's journey from her, with it: <hi>Take no care,</hi> saith he, <hi>he shall return in safety, and thine eyes shall see him; for the good Angel will keep him company, and his journey shall be prosperous, and he shall return safe,</hi> Ch. 5.20, 21.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto I have given sundry apposite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as I conceive, of the Ministry of Angels to pious and good men, throughout their life, instructing, defending, comforting, helping and delivering them.

                        <p>At the Agony of Death therefore they may look for strength and support from them, even as they ministred to our Lord and Saviour in his as hath been more than once suggested <note n="†" place="margin">Sect. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of this Ch. and before in this Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Angelin.

                        <p>Now let us every one make a due reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our selves, impartially examining and judging of our selves, according to these Rules, that we be not hereafter judged and condemned by God.</p>
                        <p>But I return at length, from this digression (the profitableness whereof may yet plead sufficiently for it) unto that which is principally designed in the Text, the Reference, I mean, which the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of Angels hath unto those persons, whose character and description we have been looking into.

                        <p>They have not only the blessed Inheritance of Salvation secured to them in the end, but here in the way too the holy Angels have a special charge over them, as the Protectors of their minority, till they come to it.</p>

                        <p>It well becomes us to take some time particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to consider of the manifold Benefits we reap from the holy Angels, that we may admire and praise God, with devout S. <hi>Bernard, Lord,</hi>

                           <note place="margin">Soliloq. c. 27.</note> who having spent some Meditations upon this subject, thus piously concludes them. <hi>When I remember these things, O Lord, I confess before thee, and praise thee for thy great benefits, wherewith thou hast ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured us.

The Son of God incarnate is sent to save us. The holy Spirit is sent to sanctifie us. The Angels are sent to protect us.</hi> [Much to the same effect, as I noted before out of Saint <hi>Bernard.] Thus the whole heav'nly Court doth, in a manner, serve us, and hand down it's benefits to us.

and ministry, the stronger and more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, we shall do well to consider in our minds distinctly the many endearing qualifications of these our Guardians and Helpers; such as their knowledg and wisdom, their power and strength, their number and multitude, their unanimity and order, their care and watchfulness, their speed and agility, their fidelity and zeal in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their trust and commission, most of which points I have enlarged upon before, and therefore shall here again but sleightly touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
                        <p>Their knowledge and wisdom, as hath been said, is beyond the most improved intellectuals of any upon Earth. They have their advantage in the excellency of their faculties, and their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from such bodies, as we dwell in, [which <hi>press and weigh down the mind that museth upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things.</hi>

                        <p>Then, for their Power and Might, they [<hi>excel in strength</hi>] and are resembled not only to an [<hi>Host,</hi> or Army,] but to [<hi>Horses and Chariots of Fire.</hi>] — Both for skill and ability they surpass the evil Spirits, who are infatuated in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and enfeebled by their wickedness.</p>
                        <p>Then, for their Number and Multitude, that exceedeth our Arithmetick, as do the Stars in the Firmament.</p>
                        <p>And this vast number of knowing and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Beings is yet the more considerable, if we add the thoughts of their unanimity and order. They

are all of a mind, and have no contests or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders among themselves, which are often the undo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Add we next their Watchfulness. They are not like unto us Mortals, subject unto heaviness, weariness, drowsiness, sleepiness, and surprize. They are <hi>full of eyes,</hi> and <hi>rest not day nor night from imployment.</hi> The darkness is all one to them with the Light. And in the Prophesie of <hi>Daniel</hi> they are call'd <hi>Vigiles,</hi> or <hi>Watchers,</hi> Ch. 4.13. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, as Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> speaks on the place, [<hi>sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vigilant, &amp; ad Dei imperium sunt parati</hi>] they always watch, and are ready at the Almighty's beck and command. They neither slumber nor sleep, and so give not the enemy opportunity of advantage, nor lose not any themselves for making good their service.</p>
                        <p>And, then, such is their make and nature, that no external impediments retard or hinder their motion; but for speed and agility they fly, as it were, with wings, very swiftly, and pass to and fro, like Lightning.</p>
                        <p>And, then lastly, these knowing, powerful, numberless, unanimous, orderly, watchful, and nimble Spirits are both faithful and zealous in the charge committed to them. Not the least spot of neglect, unfaithfulness, backwardness, or indifferency to be fast'ned on them. They do always behold the Face of God to receive his pleasure, and they are as ready to do it. They are call'd <hi>Holy ones,</hi> Dan. 4.13, 17. and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented as clothed with <hi>pure and white linnen,</hi> Revel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15.6 without blemish. And their zeal puts life

and vigour into all their service, with reference to which they are a <hi>flame of fire,</hi> burning with the greatest ardors of affection to God's glory, and the good of his Church and Servants.</p>
                        <p>Now, having such a Guard as this about us, we are inexcusably guilty of ingratitude, if we observe not our heav'nly Father's love and care towards us, so as to bless his name for this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision among his many others mercies; or of neglect, if we open not our eyes to see, that there are always more with and for us, than those that can be against us; so as to gather from hence heart and spirit in the cheerful and undaunted prosecution of our Christian Duty in all the paths we are to tread in order to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Being therefore <hi>compass'd with so great a cloud of witnesses,</hi> [and mighty helpers] <hi>we are to lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and to run with patience the Race set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us,</hi> Hebr. 12.1 and having so great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and strong consolation, we are not at any time to be <hi>weary</hi> of well-doing, or frightned from it, but to be <hi>stedfast and immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,</hi> [1 Cor. 15. <hi>ult.</hi>] as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes persons of such hopes for hereafter, [<hi>the Heirs of Salvation</hi>] and such security in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, [attended with the holy Angels.]</p>

                  <p>And this also is the perswasion of <hi>Munster,</hi> that these things are here spoken [<hi>secundum stultam o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinionem pecuinorum hominum] according to the foolish opinion of bruitish men, who conceit that the whole Man doth perish by death, as other Animals,</hi> and therefore repute it the chiefest happiness to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease themselves in all voluptuousness, while they live, seeking their portion in this life only: To which purpose also it follows immediately, by way of inference, Vers. 22. <hi>Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoyce in his own works, for that is his portion; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</hi>

Is not that Candle of the Lord, our weak Understanding and Reason, more like to discover somewhat within doors, than to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister any steady light abroad, where the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger winds of uncertainty and opposition puff and blow about it?</p>
                  <p>Or lastly, Is there not as much of the Analogy of Faith, and the concurrent opinion of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the Angels, as about the Humane Soul?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:48531:105"/>I conclude therefore from the Premises, that there was no reason at all why he should thus, once for all, exclude and except forth the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Rational Soul, as not to be comprized in the same limits with Angelical Spirits, unless this only, that it was like to prove unserviceable to his Cause, nay an irreconcileable Enemy to it.</p>

In the very same verse, which asserts God to be a Spirit, we also are allowed a Spirit too, to serve and worship him in. And, if we once take the liberty to turn all other Spirits, so call'd, into Bodies; I doubt the Incorporeity of the Godhead will be hardly defensible by it self: Because, though he be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so plainly and clearly named a Spirit in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ, yet, for all that, according to our Author's reasoning, he may be really corporeal, since other Beings, that are also stiled Spirits there, are avouched so to be.</p>
                  <p>But in truth a corporeal Deity, is a dull and strange idea of that omniperfect Being; and the very next step unto down-right Atheism, or the denial of him. For <q>then he should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,

                  </p>
                  <p>Elsewhere, I remember, our Author puts in Souls instead of his Bodies here. [<hi>The Word of God doth particularly teach us the state and condition of Souls after death,</hi>

                  <p>But whatever Truth there may be in either Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position apart, and by it self, the H.

They run not, we say, on all four.</p>
                  <p>It is enough that our B. Saviour there resolves us, that we [whether in Body, or Soul, or both] shall at the Resurrection be like unto the Angels in Heaven in Immortality, and an estrangement from the sensual inclinations and entertainments of this present imperfect state, such as Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and giving in Marriage. —</p>
                  <p>And we may be like the Angels in many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as we are said to be like to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, though they should have no Bodies; so that, even upon that supposal, this Analogy, Comparison or Assimilation (as he speaks) would not be altogether false; nor would it follow, that <hi>Bodies after the Resurrection are made pure

                  <p>Now I find nothing in this clear reason, but clear confidence, which asserts boldly, but proves nothing, and may therefore be answer'd by as bare a denial, or saying, that there is no <hi>must</hi> in the case, but the words may still be otherwise understood.</p>
                  <p>For why may not one word or sentence in the same period be literally true, and the other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical; and so accordingly intended?</p>
                  <p>Or, what, if we should transpose the Subjects and Predicates, as some do? <hi>Who maketh Spirits his Angels, and flaming Fire his Ministers.</hi> Then both may be literally true without the least impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Angels Incorporeity.</p>
                  <p>Or, what, if we should affirm both were lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally true, only with this different respect, the former to the <hi>internum</hi> of Angels, the later to their <hi>

                  <p>I mention these things, only by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to declare, that there are divers ways of escaping his clear Reasons in this matter without any absolute absurdity.</p>
