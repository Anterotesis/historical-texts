         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable
CHARLES LORD BUCKHURST.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I was lately reviewing my loose Papers,
amongst the rest I found this Essay, the
writing of which in this rude and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
manner wherein your Lordship
now sees it, serv'd as an amusement to me
in the Country, when the violence of the
last Plague had driven me from the
Town. Seeing then our Theaters shut up, I was engag'd in these kind of
thoughts with the same delight with which men think upon their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Mistresses: I confess I find many things in this discourse which I
do not now approve; my judgment being a little alter'd since the writing
of it, but whither for the better or the worse I know not: Neither indeed
is it much material in an Essay, where all I have said is problema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.
For the way of writing Playes in verse, which I have seem'd
to favour, I have since that time laid the Practice of it aside, till I
have more leisure, because I find it troublesome and slow. But I am
no way alter'd from my opinion of it, at least with any reasons which
<pb facs="tcp:48941:3"/>
have oppos'd it. For your Lordship may easily observe that none are
very violent against it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but those who either have not attempted it,
or who have succeeded ill in their attempt. 'Tis enough for me to
have your Lordships example for my excuse in that little which I have
done in it; and I am sure my Adversaries can bring no such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against Verse, as the fourth Act of <hi>Pompey</hi> will furnish me
with, in its defence. Yet, my Lord, you must suffer me a little to
complain of you, that you too soon withdraw from us a contentment,
of which we expected the continuance, because you gave it us so early.
'Tis a revolt without occasion from your Party, where your merits had
already rais'd you to the highest commands, and where you have not
the excuse of other men that you have been ill us'd, and therefore laid
down Armes. I know no other quarrel you can have to Verse, then
that which <hi>Spurina</hi> had to his beauty, when he tore and mangled the
features of his Face, onely because they pleas'd too well the lookers
on. It was an honour which seem'd to wait for you, to lead out a
new Colony of Writers from the Mother Nation: and upon the first
spreading of your Ensignes there had been many in a readiness to have
follow'd so fortunate a Leader; if not all, yet the better part of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<q>Pars, indocili melior grege; mollis &amp; expes
Inominata perprimat cubilia.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am almost of opinion, that we should force you to accept of the
<pb facs="tcp:48941:3"/>
command, as sometimes the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Bands have compell'd their
Captains to receive the Empire. The Court, which is the best and
surest judge of writing, has generally allow'd of Verse; and in the
Town it has found favourers of Wit and Quality. As for your own
particular, My Lord, you have yet youth, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ime enough to give part
of it to the divertisement of the Publick, before you enter into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and more unpleasant business of the world. That which the French
Poet said of the Temple of Love, may be as well apply'd to the Temple
of the Muses. The words, as near as I can remember them, were these:
<q>
                  <l>La jeunesse a mauvaise grace.</l>
                  <l>N' ayant pas adorè dans le temple d' Amour:</l>
                  <l>Il faut qu'il entre, &amp; pour le sage</l>
                  <l>Si ce nest son vray sejour</l>
                  <l>Ce'st un giste sur son passage.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I leave the words to work their effect upon your Lordship in their
own Language, because no other can so well express the nobleness of
the thought; And wish you may be soon call'd to bear a part in the affairs
of the Nation, where I know the world expects you, and wonders
why you have been so long forgotten; there being no person amongst
our young Nobility, on whom the eyes of all men are so much bent.
But in the mean time your Lordship may imitate the course of Nature,
who gives us the flower before the fruit: that I may speak to you
in the language of the Muses, which I have taken from an excellent
Poem to the King.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48941:4"/>
As Nature, when she fruit designes, thinks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>it</l>
               <l>By beauteous blossoms to proceed to it;</l>
               <l>And while she does accomplish all the Spring,</l>
               <l>Birds to her secret operations sing.</l>
            </q>
            <p>I confess I have no greater reason, in addressing this Essay to your
Lordship, then that it might awaken in you the desire of writing
something, in whatever kind it be, which might be an honour to our
Age and Country. And me thinks it might have the same effect upon
you, which <hi>Homer</hi> tells us the fight of the Greeks and Trojans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Fleet, had on the spirit of <hi>Achilles,</hi> who though he
had resolved not to ingage, yet found a martial warmth to steal
upon him, at the sight of Blows, the sound of Trumpets, and the
cries of fighting Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For my own part, if in treating of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
I sometimes dissent from the opinion of better Wits, I declare it
is not so much to combat their opinions, as to defend my own, which
were first made publick. Sometimes, like a Schollar in a Fencing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>School
I put forth my self, and show my own ill play, on purpose to be
better taught. Sometimes I stand desperately to my Armes, like the
Foot when deserted by their Horse, not in hope to overcome, but onely
to yield on more honourable termes. And yet, my Lord, this war of
opinions, you well know, has fallen out among the Writers of all Ages,
and sometim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s betwixt Friends. Onely it has been prosecuted by some,
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ke Pedants, with violence of words, and manag'd by others like
<pb facs="tcp:48941:4"/>
Gentlemen, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>andour and ciuility. Even <hi>Tully</hi> had a Controversie
with his dear <hi>Atticus;</hi> and in one of his Dialogues makes him sustain
the part of an Enemy in Philosophy, who in his Letters is his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of State, and made privy to the most weighty affairs of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Senate. And the same respect which was paid by <hi>Tully</hi> to <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi>
we find return'd to him afterwards by <hi>Caesar</hi> on a like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
who answering his Book in praise of <hi>Cato,</hi> made it not so
much his business to condemn <hi>Cato,</hi> as to praise <hi>Cicero.</hi> But that
I may decline some part of the encounter with my Adversaries, whom
I am neither willing to combate, nor well able to resist; I will give
your Lordship the Relation of a Dispute betwixt some of our Wits
upon this subject, in which they did not onely speak of Playes in Verse,
but mingled, in the freedom of Discourse, some things of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
many of the Modern wayes of writing, comparing those with
these, and the Wits of our Nation with those of others: 'tis true they
differ'd in their opinions, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tis probable they would: neither do I
take upon me to reconcile, but to relate them: and that as <hi>Tacitus</hi>
professes of himself, <hi>Sine studio partium aut ira:</hi> without Passion
or Interest; leaving your Lordship to decide it in favour of which part
you shall judge most reasonable, and withall, to pardon the many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of,</p>

READER.</head>
            <p>THe drift of the ensuing Discourse was chiefly to vindicate the
honour of our English Writers, from the censure of those who
unjustly prefer the French before them. This I intimate, least
any should think me so exceeding vain, as to teach others an
Art which they understand much better then my self. But if this incorrect
Essay, written in the Country without the help of Books, or advice of Friends,
shall find any acceptance in the world, I promise to my self a better success of the
second part, wherein the Vertues and Faults of the English Poets, who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
either in this, the Epique, or the Lyrique way, will be more fully treated of,
and their several styles impartially imitated.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was that memorable day, in the first Summer of
the late War, when our Navy ingag'd the Dutch:
a day wherein the two most mighty and best appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Fleets which any age had ever seen, disputed the
command of the greater half of the Globe, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of Nations, and the riches of the Universe. While these vast float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bodies, on either side, mov'd against each other in parallel lines, and
our Country men, under the happy conduct of his Royal Highness, went
breaking, by little and little, into the line of the Enemies; the noise of the
Cannon from both Navies reach'd our ears about the City: so that al
men, being alarm'd with it, and in a dreadful suspence of the event, which
we knew was then deciding, every one went following the sound as his fancy
led him; and leaving the Town almost empty, some took towards the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48941:6"/>
Park, some cross the River, others down it; all seeking the noise in the
depth of silence.</p>
            <p>Amongst the rest, it was the fortune of <hi>Eugenius, Crites, Lisid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Taking then a Barge which a servant of <hi>Lisideius</hi> had provided for

bountifully thank'd upon the same condition, that they would never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Poets, whom this victory with the help of both her wings will never be able
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48941:7"/>
to escape; 'tis easie to guess whom you intend, said <hi>Lisideius;</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
naming them, I ask you if one of them does not perpetually pay us with
clenches upon words and a certain clownish kind of raillery? if now and then
he does not osser at a Catecresis or Clevelandism; wresting and torturing a
word into another meaning: In fine, if he be not one of those whom the
French would call <hi>un mauvais buffon;</hi> one that is so much a well-willer to
the Satire, that he spares no man; and though he cannot strike a blow to
hurt any, yet ought to be punish'd for the malice of the action; as our
Witches are justly hang'd because they think themselves so; and suffer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
for believing they did mischief, because they meant it. You
have described him, said <hi>Crites,</hi> so exactly, that I am affraid to come after
you with my other extremity of Poetry: He is one of those who having
had some advantage of education and converse, knows better then the other
what a Poet should be, but puts it into practice more unluckily then any
man; his stile and matter are every where alike; he is the most calm,
peaceable Writer you ever read: he never disquiets your passions with the
least concernment, but still leaves you in as even a temper as he found you;
he is a very Leveller in Poetry, he creeps along with ten little words in
every line, and helps out his Numbers with <hi>For to,</hi> and <hi>Vnto,</hi> and all the
pretty Expletives he can find, till he draggs them to the end of another
line; while the Sense is left tir'd half way behind it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he doubly starves all
his Verses, first for want of thought, and then of expression; his Poetry
neither has wit in it, nor seems to have it; like him in <hi>Martiall:</hi>
               <q>Pauper videri Cinna vult, &amp; est pauper:</q>
            </p>
            <p>He affects plainness, to cover his want of imagination: when he writes
the serious way, the highest flight of his fancy is some miserable <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48941:7"/>
or seeming contradiction; and in the Comick he is still reaching at
some thin conceit, the ghost of a Jest, and that too flies before him, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be caught; these Swallows which we see before us on the <hi>Thames,</hi>
are the just resemblance of his wit: you may observe how near the water
they stoop, how many proffers they make to dip, and yet how seldome
they touch it: and when they do, 'tis but the surface: they skim over it
but to catch a gnat, and then mount into the ayr and leave it. Well Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
said <hi>Eugenius,</hi> you may speak your pleasure of these Authors; but
though I and some few more about the Town may give you a peaceable
hearing, yet, assure your selves, there are multitudes who would think
you malicious and them injur'd: especially him who you first described;
he is the very <hi>Withers</hi> of the City: they have bought more Editions of his
Works then would serve to lay under all their Pies at the Lord Mayor's
<hi>Christmass.</hi> When his famous Poem first came out in the year 1660, I
have seen them reading it in the midst of Change-time; nay so vehement
they were at it, that they lost their b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rgain by the Candles ends: but what
will you say, if he has been received amongst the great Ones? I can
assure you he is, this day, the envy of a great person, who is Lord in the
Art of Quibbling; and who does not take it well, that any man should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
so far into his Province. All I would wish, replied <hi>Crites,</hi> is, that
they who love his Writings, may still admire him, and his fellow Poet: <hi>qui
Bavium non odit, &amp;c.</hi> is curse sufficient. And farther, added <hi>Lisideius,</hi> I
believe there is no man who writes well, but would think himself very
hardly dealt with, if their Admirers should praise any thing of his: <hi>Nam
quos contemnimus eorum quoque laudes contemnimus.</hi> There are so few who
write well in this Age, said <hi>Crites,</hi> that me-thinks any praises should be
wellcome; they neither rise to the dignity of the last Age, nor to any of
the Ancients; and we may cry out the Writers of this time, with more

            <p>If your quarrel (said <hi>Eugenius</hi>) to those who now write, be grounded
onely upon your reverence to Antiquity, there is no man more ready to
adore those great Greeks and Romans than I am: but on the other side, I
cannot think so contemptibly of the Age I live in, or so dishonourably of
my own Countrey, as not to judge we equal the Ancients in most kinds of

            </p>
            <p>But I see I am ingaging in a wide dispute, where the arguments are not
like to reach close on either side; for Poesie is of so large extent, and so
many both of the Ancients and Moderns have done well in all kinds of it,
that, in citing one against the other, we shall take up more time this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than each mans occasions will allow him: therefore I would ask <hi>Crite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
to what part of Poesie he would confine his Arguments, and whether he
would defend the general cause of the Ancients against the Moderns, or
oppose any Age of the Moderns against this of ours?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crites</hi> a little while considering upon this Demand, told <hi>Eugenius</hi> he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48941:8"/>
approv'd his Propositions, and, if he pleased, he would limit their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to <hi>Dramatique Poesie;</hi> in which he thought it not difficult to prove,
either that the Antients were superiour to the Moderns, or the last Age to
this of ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenius</hi> was somewhat surpriz'd, when he heard <hi>Crites</hi> make choice of
that Subject; For ought I see, said he, I have undertaken a harder Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
than I imagin'd; for though I never judg'd the Plays of the Greek
or Roman Poets comparable to ours; yet on the other side those we now
see acted, come short of many which were written in the last Age: but
my comfort is if we are orecome, it will be onely by our own Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
and if we yield to them in this one part of Poesie, we more surpass
them in all the other; for in the Epique or Lyrique way it will be hard for
them to show us one such amongst them, as we have many now living, or
who lately were so. They can produce nothing so courtly writ, or which
expresses so much the Conversation of a Gentleman, as <hi>Sir Iohn Suckling;</hi>
nothing so even, sweet, and flowing as Mr. <hi>Waller;</hi> nothing so Majestique,
so correct as Sir <hi>Iohn Denham;</hi> nothing so elevated, so copious, and full of
spirit, as Mr <hi>Cowley;</hi> as for the Italian, French, and Spanish Plays, I can
make it evident, that those who now write, surpass them; and that the
<hi>Drama</hi> is wholly ours.</p>
            <p>All of them were thus far of <hi>Eugenius</hi> his opinion, that the sweetnes
of English Verse was never understood or practis'd by our Fathers; even
<hi>Crites</hi> himself did not much oppose it: and every one was willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
how much our Poesie is improv'd, by the happiness of some
Writers yet living; who first taught us to mould our thoughts into easie
and significant words; to retrench the superfluities of expression, and to
make our Rime so properly a part of the Verse, that it should never
mis-lead the sence, but it self be led and govern'd by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48941:9"/>
               <hi>Eugenius</hi> was going to continue this Discourse, when <hi>Lisideius</hi> told him
it was necessary, before they proceeded further, to take a standing mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of their Controversie; for how was it possible to be decided who writ
the best Plays, before we know what a play should be? but, this once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on by both Parties, each might have recourse to it, either to prove
his own advantages, or discover the failings of his Adversary.</p>
            <p>He had no sooner said this, but all desir'd the favour of him to give the
definition of a Play; and they were the more importunate, because nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> nor <hi>Horace,</hi> nor any other, who writ of that Subject, had
ever done it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lisideius,</hi> after some modest denials, at last confess'd he had a rude No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it; indeed rather a Description then a Definition: but which serv'd
to guide him in his private thoughts, when he was to make a judgment of
what others writ: that he conceiv'd a Play ought to be, <hi>A just and lively
Image of Humane Nature, representing its Passions and Humours, and the
Changes of Fortune to which it is subject; for the Delight and Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Definition, though <hi>Crites</hi> rais'd a Logical Objection against it;
that it was onely <hi>a genere &amp; fine,</hi> and so not altogether perfect; was yet
well received by the rest: and after they had given order to the Water-men
to turn their Barge, and row softly, that they might take the cool of the
Evening in their return; <hi>Crites,</hi> being desired by the Company to begin,
spoke on behalf of the Ancients, in this manner:</p>
            <p>If Confidence presage a Victory, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> in his own opinion, has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
triumphed over the Ancients; nothing seems more easie to him, than to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
those whom it is our greatest praise to have imitated well: for we do
not onely build upon their foundation; but by their modells. <hi>Dramatique
Poesie</hi> had time enough, reckoning from <hi>Thespis</hi> (who first invented it) to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48941:9"/>
               <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> to be born, to grow up, and to flourish in Maturity. It has
been observed of Arts and Sciences, that in one and the same Century they
have arriv'd to a great perfection; and no wonder, since every Age has a
kind of Universal Genius, which inclines those that live in it to some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Studies: the Work then being push'd on by many hands, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
go forward.</p>
            <p>Is it no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> evident, in these last hundred years (when the Study of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
has been the business of all the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> in <hi>Christendome</hi>) that almost
a new Nature has been reveal'd to us? that more errours of the School have
been detected, more useful Expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>iments in Philosophy have been made,
more Noble Secrets in Opticks, Medicine, Anatomy, Astronomy, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
than in all those credulous and doting Ages from <hi>Aristotle</hi> to us?
so true it is that nothing spreads more fast than Science, when rightly and
generally cultivated.</p>
            <p>Add to this the more than common emulation that was in those times of
writing well; which though it be found in all Ages and all Persons that
pretend to the same Reputation; yet Poesie being then in more esteem
than now it is, had greater Honours decreed to the Professors of it; and
consequently the Rivalship was more high between them; they had Judges
ordain'd to decide their Merit, and Prizes to reward it: and Historians
have been diligent to record of <hi>Eschylus, Euripides, Sophocles, Lyc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>phron,</hi>
and the rest of them, both who they were that vanquish'd in these Wars of
the Theater, and how often they were crown'd: while the Asian Kings,
and Grecian Common-wealths scarce afforded them a Nobler Subject then
the unmanly Luxuries of a Debauch'd Court, or giddy Intrigues of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
City. <hi>Alit aemulatio ingenia</hi> (says <hi>Paterculus) &amp; nunc invidia, nunc
admiratio incitationem accendit:</hi> Emulation is the Spur of Wit, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48941:10"/>
But now since the Rewards of Honour are taken away, that Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>uous

               </gap>o condemn and cry down others, without attempting to do better: 'Tis a
Reputation too unprofitable, to take the necessary pains for it; yet wishing
they had it, is incitement enough to hinder others from it. And this,
in short, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> is the reason, why you have now so few good Poets;
and so many severe Judges. Certainly, to imitate the Antients well, much
labour and long study is required: which pains, I have already shown, our
Poets would want incouragement to take, if yet they had ability to go
through with it. Those Ancients have been faithful Imitators and wise
Observers of that Nature which is so torn and ill represented in our Plays,
they have handed down to us a perfect resemblance of her; which we, like
ill Copyers, neglecting to look on, have rendred monstrous and disfigur'd.
But, that you may know how much you are indebted to those your Masters,
and be ashamed to have so ill requited them: I must remember you that
all the Rules by which we practise the <hi>Drama</hi> at this day, either such as
relate to the justness and symmetry of the Plot; or the Episodical Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
such as Descriptions, Narrations, and other Beauties, which are
not essential to the Play; were delivered to us from the Observations that
<hi>Aristotle</hi> made, of those Poets, which either liv'd before him, or were his
Contemporaries: we have added nothing of our own, except we have the
confidence to say our wit is better; which none boast of in our Age, but
such as understand not theirs. Of that Book which <hi>Aristotle</hi> has left us

French call, <hi>Des Trois Vnitez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>,</hi> or, The Three Unities, which ought
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48941:10"/>
to be observ'd in every Regular Play; namely, of Time, Place, and
Action.</p>
            <p>The unity of Time they comprehend in 24 hours, the compass of a
Natural Day; or as near it as can be contriv'd: and the reason of it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to every one, that the time of the feigned action, or fable of the
Play, should be proportion'd as near as can be to the duration of that
time in which it is represented; since therefore all Playes are acted on the
Theater in a space of time much within the compass of 24 hours, that
Play is to be thought the nearest imitation of Nature, whose Plot or
Action is confin'd within that time; and, by the same Rule which
concludes this general proportion of time, it follows, that all the
parts of it are to be equally subdivided; as namely, that one act
take not up the suppos'd time of half a day; which is out of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the rest: since the other four are then to be straightned within
the compass of the remaining half; for it is unnatural that one Act, which
being spoke or written, is not longer than the rest, should be suppos'd lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
by the Audience; 'tis therefore the Poets duty, to take care that no Act
should be imagin'd to exceed the time in which it is represented on the
Stage; and that the intervalls and inequalities of time be suppos'd to fall
out between the Acts.</p>
            <p>This Rule of Time how well it has been observ'd by the Antients, most
of their Playes will witness; you see them in their Tragedies (wherein to
follow this Rule, is certainly most difficult) from the very beginning
of their Playes, falling close into that part of the Story which they
intend for the action or principal object of it; leaving the former part
to be delivered by Narration: so that they set the Audience, as it were,
at the Post where the Race is to be concluded: and, saving them the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
expectation of seeing the Poet set out and ride the beginning of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48941:11"/>
the Course) you behold him not, till he is in sight of the Goal, and just
upon you.</p>
            <p>For the Second Unity, which is that of place, the Antients meant by it,
That the Scene ought to be continu'd through the Play, in the same place
where it was laid in the beginning: for the Stage, on which it is represented,
being but one and the same place, it is unnatural to conceive it many; and
those far distant from one another. I will not deny but by the variation of
painted Scenes, the fancy (which in these cases will contribute to its own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit)
may sometimes imagine it several places, with some appearance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability;
yet it still carries the greater likelihood of truth, if those places be
suppos'd so near each other, as in the same Town or City; which may all
be comprehended under the larger Denomination of one place: for a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
distance will bear no proportion to the shortness of time, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
in the acting, to pass from one of them to another; for the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of this, next to the Antients, the French are to be most commended.
They tie themselves so strictly to the unity of place, that you never see in
any of their Plays, a Scene chang'd in the middle of an Act: if the Act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
in a Garden, a Street, or Chamber, 'tis ended in the same place; and
that you may know it to be the same, the Stage is so supplied with persons
that it is never empty all the time: he that enters the second has business
with him who was on before; and before the second quits the Stage, a third
appears who has business with him.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Corneil</hi> cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>La Liaison des Scenes,</hi> the continuity or joyning of the
Scenes; and 'tis a good mark of a well contriv'd Play when all the Persons
are known to each other, and every one of them has some affairs with all the
rest.</p>
            <p>As for the third Unity which is that of Action, the Ancients meant no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by it then what the Logicians do by their <hi>Finis,</hi> the end or scope of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48941:11"/>
any action: that which is the first in Intention, and last in Execution:
now the Poet is to aim at one great and compleat action, to the carrying on
of which all things in his Play, even the very obstacles, are to be subservient;
and the reason of this is as evident as any of the former.</p>
            <p>For two Actions equally labour'd and driven on by the Writer, would
destroy the unity of the Poem; it would be no longer one Play, but two:
not but that there may be many actions in a Play, as <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in his discoveries; but they must be all subservient to the great one,
which our language happily expresses in the name of under-plots: such as
in <hi>Terences Eunuch</hi> is the difference and reconcilement of <hi>Thais</hi> and <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
which is not the chief business of the Play, but promote<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the marriage
of <hi>Chaerea</hi> and <hi>Chremes's</hi> Sister, principally intended by the Poet. There
ought to be but one action, sayes. <hi>Corneile,</hi> that is one compleat action
which leaves the mind of the Audience in a full repose: But this cannot be
brought to pass but by many other imperfect ones which conduce to it, and
hold the Audience in a delightful suspence of what will be.</p>
            <p>If by these Rules (to omit many other drawn from the Precepts and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Ancients) we should judge our modern Playes; 'tis probable,
that few of them would endure the tryal: that which should be the business
of a day, takes up in some of them an age; instead of one action they are
the Epitomes of a mans life; and for one spot of ground (which the Stage
should represent) we are sometimes in more Countries then the Map can
show us.</p>
            <p>But if we will allow the Ancients to have contriv'd well, we must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
them to have writ better; questionless we are depriv'd of a great stock
of wit in the loss of <hi>Menander</hi> among the Greek Poets, and of <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and <hi>Seneca</hi> are to be had, I can never see one of those Plays which
are now written, but it encreases my admiration of the Ancients; and yet I
must acknowledge further, that to admire them as we ought, we should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
them better then we do. Doubtless many things appear flat to us,
whose wit depended upon some custome or story which never came to our
knowledge, or perhaps upon some Criticism in their language, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so long dead, and onely remaining in their Books, 'tis not possible
they should make us know it perfectly. To read <hi>Macrobius,</hi> explaining
the propriety and elegancy of many words in <hi>Virgil,</hi> which I had before
pass'd over without consideration, as common things, is enough to assure me
that I ought to think the same of <hi>Terence;</hi> and that in the purity of his style
(which <hi>Tully</hi> so much val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed that he ever carried his works about him)
there is yet left in him great room for admiration, if I knew but where to
place it. In the mean time I must desire you to take notice, that the greatest
man of the last age <hi>(Ben. Iohnson)</hi> was willing to give place to them in all
things: He was not onely a professed Imitator of <hi>Horace,</hi> but a learned Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Lucan, Petronius Arbiter, Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> had their own from

me therefore if I presume he lov'd their fashion when he wore their
cloaths. But since I have otherwise a great veneration for him, and you,
<hi>Eugenius,</hi> prefer him above all other Poets, I will use no farther argument
to you then his example: I will produce Father <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of our Age, or regard the good ones of the last, both the best and worst
of the Modern Poets will equally instruct you to esteem the Ancients.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crites</hi> had no sooner left speaking, but <hi>Eug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

impatience for it, thus began:</p>
            <p>I have observ'd in your Speech that the former part of it is convincing as
to what the Moderns have profitted by the rules of the Ancients, but in the
latter you are careful to conceal how much they have excell'd them: we own
all the helps we have from them, and want neither veneration nor gratitude
while we acknowledge that to overcome them we must make use of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ges
we have receiv'd from them; but to these assistances we have
joyned our own industry; for (had we s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>te down with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a dull imitation of
them) we might then have lost some what of the old perfection, but never
acquir'd any that was new. We draw not therefore after their lines, but
those of Nature; and having the life before us, besides the experience of all
they knew, it is no wonder if we hit some airs and features which they have

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d: I deny not what you urge of Arts and Sciences, that they have
flourish'd in some ages more then others; but your instance in Philosophy
makes for me: for if Natural Causes be more known now then in the time
of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> because more studied, it follows that Poesie and other Arts
may with the same pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ns arrive still neerer to perfection, and, that granted,
it will rest for you to prove that they wrought more perfect images of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
life then we; which, seeing in your Discourse you have avoided to
make good, it shall now be my task to show you some part of their defects,
and some few Excellencies of the Moderns, and I think there is none among
us can imagine I do it enviously, or with purpose to detract from them; for
what interest of Fame or Profit can the living lose by the reputation of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48941:13"/>
dead? on the other side, it is a great truth which <hi>Vell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ius Paterculus</hi> affirms,

prosequimur; &amp; his nos obrui, illis instrui credimus:</hi> That praise or censure
is certainly the most sincere which unbrib'd posterity shall give us.</p>
            <p>Be pleased then in the first place to take notice, that the Greek Poesie,
which <hi>Crites</hi> has affirm'd to have arriv'd to perfection in the Reign of the
old Comedy, was so far from it, that the distinction of it into Acts was not
known to them; or if it were, it is yet so darkly deliver'd to us that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make it out.</p>
            <p>All we know of it is from the singing of their Chorus, and that too is so
uncertain that in some of their Playes we have reason to conjecture they sung
more then five times: <hi>Aristotle</hi> indeed divides the integral parts of a Play
into four: First, The <hi>Protasis</hi> or entrance, which gives light onely to
the Characters of the persons, and proceeds very little into any part of the
action: 2ly, The <hi>Epitasis,</hi> or working up of the Plot where the Play grows
warmer: the design or action of it is drawing on, and you see something
promising that it will come to pass: Thirdly, the <hi>Catastasis,</hi> or Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
which destroys that expectation, imbroyles the action in new diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and leaves you far d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>stant from that hope in which it found you, as
you may have observ'd in a violent stream resisted by a narrow pass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ge; it
runs round to an eddy, and carries back the waters with more swiftness then
it brought them on: Lastly, the <hi>Catastrophe,</hi> which the Grecians call'd
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the French <hi>le denouement,</hi> and we the discovery or unravelling of the
Plot: there you see all things setling again upon their first foundations, and
the obstacles which hindred the design or action of the Play once remov'd,
it ends with that resemblance of truth and nature, that the audience are
satisfied with the conduct of it. Thus this great man deliver'd to us the
image of a Play, and I must confess is so lively that from thence much light
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48941:13"/>
has been deriv'd to the forming it more perfectly into Acts and Scenes;
but what poet first limited to five the number of the Acts I know not;
onely we see it so firmly establish'd in the time of <hi>Horace,</hi> that he
gives it for a rule in Comedy; <hi>Neu brevior quinto, neu sit productior actu:</hi>
So that you see The Grecians cannot be said to have consummated this Art;
writing rather by Entrances then by Acts, and having rather a general indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
notion of a Play, then knowing how and where to bestow the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
graces of it.</p>
            <p>But since the Spaniards at this day allow but three Acts, which they call
<hi>Iornad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> to a Play; and the Italians in many of theirs follow them, when
I condemn the Antients, I declare it is not altogether because they have not
five Acts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> every Play, but because they have not confin'd themselves to
one certain number; 'tis building an House without a Modell: and when
they succeeded in such undertakings, they ought to have sacrific'd to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
not to the Muses.</p>
            <p>Next, for the Plot, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> Call'd <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and often <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
and from him the Romans <hi>Fabula,</hi> it has already been
judiciously observ'd by a late Writer, that in their Tragedies it was
onely some Tale deriv'd from <hi>Thebes</hi> or <hi>Troy,</hi> or at least some thing that
happen'd in those two Ages; which was worn so thred bare by the Pens of
all the Epique Poets, and even by Tradition it self of the Talkative Greek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
(as <hi>Ben Iohnson</hi> calls them) that before it came upon the Stage, it was
already known to all the Audience: and the people so soon as ever they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eard the Name of <hi>Oedipus,</hi> knew as well as the Poet, that he had kill'd
his Father by a mistake, and committed Incest with his Mother, before the
Play; that they were now to hear of a great Plague, an Oracle, and the
Ghost of <hi>Laius:</hi> so that they sate with a yawning kind of expectation,
till he was to come with his eyes pull'd out, and speak a hundred or two
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48941:14"/>
of Verses in a Tragick tone, in complaint of his misfortunes. But
one <hi>Oedipus, Hercules,</hi> or <hi>Medea,</hi> had been tollerable; poor people
they scap'd not so good cheap: they had still the <hi>Chapon Bouillè</hi> set before
them, till their appetites were cloy'd with the same dish, and the Novelty
being gone, the pleasure vanish'd: so that one main end of <hi>Dramatique Poesie</hi>
in its Definition, which was to cause Delight, was of consequence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd.</p>
            <p>In their Comedies, the Romans generally borrow'd their Plots from the
Greek Poets; and theirs was commonly a little Girle stollen or wandred
from her Parents, brought back unknown to the same City, there got with
child by some lewd young fellow; who, by the help of his servant, cheats
his father, and when her time comes, to cry <hi>Iuno Lucina fer opem;</hi> one or
other sees a little Box or Cabinet which was carried away with her, and so
discovers her to her friends, if some God do not prevent it, by coming down
in a Machine, and take the thanks of it to himself.</p>
            <p>By the Plot you may guess much of the Characters of the Persons. An
Old Father that would willingly before he dies, see his Son well married;
his Debauch'd Son, kind in his Nature to his Wench, but miserably in
want of Money; a Servant or Slave, who has so much wit to strike in with
him, and help to dupe his Father, a Braggadochio Captain, a Parasite,
and a Lady of Pleasure.</p>
            <p>As for the poor honest Maid, whom all the Story is built upon, and who
ought to be one of the principal Actors in the Play, she is commonly a Mute
in it: She has the breeding of the Old <hi>Elizabeth</hi> way, for Maids to be
seen and not to be heard; and it is enough you know she is willing to be
married, when the Fifth Act requires it.</p>
            <p>These are Plots built after the Italian Mode of Houses, you see
thorow them all at once; the Characters are indeed the Imitations of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48941:14"/>
Nature, but so narrow as if they had imitated onely an Eye or an Hand,
and did not dare to venture on the lines of a Face, or the Proportion
of a Body.</p>
            <p>But in how straight a compass soever they have bounded their Plots
and Characters, we will pass it by, if they have regularly pursued them,
and perfectly observ'd those three Unities of Time, Place, and Action: the
knowledge of which you say is deriv'd to us from them. But in the first
place give me leave to tell you, that the Unity of Place, how ever it might
be practised by them, was never any of their Rules: We neither find it in
<hi>Aristotle, Horace,</hi> or any who have written of it, till in our age the French
Poets first made it a Precept of the Stage. The unity of time, even
<hi>Terence</hi> himself (who was the best and most regular of them) has neglected:
His <hi>Heautontimoroumenos</hi> or Self-Punisher takes up visibly two dayes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
sayes <hi>Scaliger,</hi> the two first Acts concluding the first day, were acted
over-night; the three last on the ensuing day: and <hi>Eurypides,</hi> in tying
himself to one day, has committed an absurdity never to be forgiven him:
for in one of his Tragedies he has made <hi>Theseus</hi> go from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Thebes,</hi>
which was about 40 English miles, under the walls of it to give battel, and
appear victorious in the next Act; and yet from the time of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to the return of the <hi>Nuntius,</hi> who gives the relation of his Victory,
<hi>Aethra</hi> and the Chorus have but 36 Verses; that is not for every Mile a
Verse.</p>
            <p>The like errour is as evident in <hi>Terence</hi> his Eunuch, when <hi>Laches,</hi> the old
man, enters in a mistake the house of <hi>Thais,</hi> where betwixt his Exit and
the entrance of <hi>Pythias,</hi> who comes to give an ample relation of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyles
he has rais'd within, <hi>Parmeno</hi> who was left upon the Stage, has not
above five lines to speak: <hi>C'est bien employè un temps si court,</hi> sayes the
French Poet, who furnish'd me with one of the observations: And
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48941:15"/>
almost all their Tragedies will afford us examples of the like nature.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, they have kept the continuity, or as you call'd it, <hi>Liaison des
Scenes</hi> somewhat better: two do not perpetually come in together, talk,
and go out together; and other two succeed them, and do the same through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Act, which the English call by the name of single Scenes; but the
reason is, because they have seldom above two or three Scenes, properly
so call'd, in every act; for it is to be accounted a new Scene, not every
time the Stage is empty, but every person who enters, though to others, makes
it so; because he introduces a new business: Now the Plots of their Plays
being narrow, and the persons few, one of their Acts was written in a less
compass then one of our well wrought Scenes, and yet they are often defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
even in this: To go no further then <hi>Terence,</hi> you find in the Eunuch
<hi>Antipho</hi> entring single in the midst of the third Act, after <hi>Chremes</hi> and <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi>
were gone off: In the same Play you have likewise <hi>Dorias</hi> beginning
the fourth Act alone; and after she has made a relation of what was done at
the Souldiers entertainment (which by the way was very inartificial to do,
because she was presum'd to speak directly to the Audience, and to acquaint
them with what was necessary to be known, but yet should have been so
contriv'd by the Poet as to have been told by persons of the <hi>Drama</hi> to one
another, and so by them to have come to the knowledge of the people) she
quits the Stage, and <hi>Phoedria</hi> enters next, alone likewise: He also gives you
an account of himself, and of his returning from the Country in <hi>Monologue,</hi>
to which unnatural way of narration <hi>Terence</hi> is subject in all his playes: In
his <hi>Adelphi</hi> or Brothers, <hi>Syrus</hi> and <hi>Demea</hi> enter; after the Scene was broken
by the departure of <hi>Sostrata, Geta</hi> and <hi>Canthara;</hi> and indeed you can scarce
look into any of his Comedies, where you will not presently discover the
same interruption.</p>
            <p>But as they have fail'd both in laying of their Plots, and managing of them,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48941:15"/>
swerving from the Rules of their own Art, by mis-representing Nature to
us, in which they have ill satisfied one intention of a Play, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
so in the instructive part they have err'd worse: instead of punishing
Vice and rewarding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

lust and murder ending in the victory of him that acted them: In short,
there is no indecorum in any of our modern Playes, which if I would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
I could not shaddow with some Authority from the Ancients.</p>
            <p>And one farther note of them let me leave you: Tragedies and
Comedies were not writ then as they are now, promiscuously, by
the same person; but he who found his genius bending to the one,
never attempted the other way. This is so plain, that I need not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to you, that <hi>Aristophanes, Plautus, Terence,</hi> never any of them writ
a Tragedy; <hi>Aeschylus, Eurypides, Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> never medled
with Comedy; the Sock and Buskin were not worn by the same Poet: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
then so much care to excel in one kind, very little is to be pardon'd
them if they miscarried in it; and this would lead me to the consideration
of their wit, had not <hi>Crites</hi> given me sufficient warning not to be too bold
in my judgment of it; because the languages being dead, and many of
the Customes and little accidents on which it depended, lost to us, we are
not competent judges of it. But though I grant that here and there we
may miss the application of a Proverb or a Custom, yet a thing well said
will be wit in all Languages; and though it may lose something in the
Translation, yet, to him who reads it in the Original, 'tis still the same;
He has an Idea of its excellency, though it cannot pass from his mind into
any other expression or words then those in which he finds it. When <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria—</hi>

times his wit is nothing, which questionless was one reason why <hi>Horace</hi> falls
upon him so severely in those Verses:

And <hi>Ovid</hi> once so modestly, that he askes leave to do it;

            <p>Calling the Court of <hi>Iupiter</hi> by the name of <hi>Augustus</hi> his Pallace, though
in another place he is more bold, where he sayes, <hi>Et longas visent Capitolia
pompas.</hi> But to do this alwayes, and never be able to write a line without
it, though it may be admir'd by some few Pedants, will not pass upon those
who know that wit is best convey'd to us in the most easie language; and is
most to be admir'd when a great thought comes drest in words so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
receiv'd that it is understood by the meanest apprehensions, as the best
meat is the most easily digested: but we cannot read a verse of <hi>Cleveland's</hi>
without making a face at it, as if every word were a Pill to swallow: he
gives us many times a hard Nut to break our Teeth, without a Kernel for
our pains. So that there is this difference betwixt his <hi>Satyres</hi> and Doctor
<hi>Donns,</hi> That the one gives us deep thoughts in common language,
though rough cadence; the other gives us common thoughts in abstruse
words: 'tis true, in some places his wit is independent of his words, as in that
of the Rebel <hi>Scot:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Had Cain been Scot God would have chang'd his doom;</l>

               <hi>Si sic, omnia dixisset!</hi> This is wit in all languages: 'tis like Mercury, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be lost or kill'd; and so that other;
<q>
                  <l>For Beauty like White-powder makes no noise,</l>

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48941:17"/>
You see the last line is highly Metaphorical, but it is so soft and gentle,
that it does not shock us as we read it.</p>
            <p>But, to return from whence I have digress'd, to the consideration of the
Ancients Writing and their Wit, (of which by this time you will grant us in
some measure to be fit judges,) Though I see many excellent thoughts in
<hi>Seneca,</hi> yet he, of them who had a Genius most proper for the Stage, was
<hi>Ovid;</hi> he had away of writing so fit to stir up a pleasing admiration and
concernment, which are the objects of a Tragedy, and to show the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
movements of a Soul combating betwixt two different Passions, that,
had he lived in our age, or in his own could have writ with our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
no man but must have yielded to him; and therefore I am confident
the <hi>Medea</hi> is none of his: for, though I esteem it for the gravity and senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of it, which he himself concludes to be suitable to a Tragedy, <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
genus scripti gravitate Tragaedia vincit,</hi> yet it moves not my soul enough
to judge that he, who in the Epique way wrote things so near the <hi>Drama,</hi>
as the Story of <hi>Myrrha,</hi> of <hi>Caunus</hi> and <hi>Biblis,</hi> and the rest, should stir
up no more concernment where he most endeavour'd it. The Master-piece
of <hi>Sencca</hi> I hold to be that Scene in the <hi>Troades,</hi> where <hi>Vlysses</hi> is seeking
for <hi>Astyanax</hi> to kill him; There you see the tenderness of a Mother, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
in Andromache, that it raises compassion to a high degree in the
Reader, and bears the nearest resemblance of any thing in their Tragedies
to the excellent Scenes of Passion in <hi>Shakespeare,</hi> or in <hi>Fletcher:</hi> for Love-Scenes
you will find few among them, their Tragique Poets dealt not with
that soft passion, but with Lust, Cruelty, Revenge, Ambition, and those
bloody actions they produc'd; which were more capable of raising hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
then compassion in an audience: leaving Love untoucht, whose gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness
would have temper'd them, which is the most frequent of all the
passions, and which being the private concernment of every person, is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48941:17"/>
sooth'd by viewing its own image in a publick entertainment.</p>
            <p>Among their Comedies, we find a Scene or two of tenderness, and that
where you would least expect it, in <hi>Plautus;</hi> but to speak generally, their
Lovers say little, when they see each other, but <hi>anima mea, vita mea;</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the women in <hi>Iuvenal</hi>'s time us'd to cry out in the fury
of their kindness: then indeed to speak sense were an offence. Any sudden
gust of passion (as an extasie of love in an unexpected meeting) cannot
better be express'd than in a word and a sigh, breaking one another. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is dumb on such occasions, and to make her speak, would be to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
her unlike her self. But there are a thousand other concernments of
Lovers, as jealousies, complaints, contrivances and the like, where not
to open their minds at large to each other, were to be wanting to their own
love, and to the expectation of the Audience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who watch the movements of
their minds, as much as the changes of their fortunes. For the imaging of the
first is properly the work of a Poet, the latter he borrows of the Historian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenius</hi> was proceeding in that part of his Discourse, when <hi>Crites</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
him. I see, said he, <hi>Eugenius</hi> and I are never like to have this
Question decided betwixt us; for he maintains the Moderns have acquir'd
a new perfection in writing, I can onely grant they have alter'd the mode
of it. <hi>Homer</hi> describ'd his Heroes men of great appetites, lovers of beef
broild upon the coals, and good fellows; contrary to the practice of the
French Romances, whose Heroes neither eat, nor drink, nor sleep, for
love. <hi>Virgil</hi> makes <hi>Aeneas</hi> a bold Avower of his own virtues.
<q>Sum pius Aeneas fama super aethera notus;</q>
which in the civility of our Poets is the Character of a Fanfaron
or Hector: for with us the Knight takes occasion to walk out,
or sleep, to avoid the vanity of telling his own Story, which the
trusty Squire is ever to perform for him. So in their Love Scenes, of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48941:18"/>
which <hi>Eugenius</hi> spoke last, the Ancients were more hearty, we more talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
they writ love as it was then the mode to make it, and I will grant thus
much to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that perhaps one of their Poets, had he liv'd in our Age.
<q>Si foret hoc nostrum fato delapsus in avum</q>   (<hi>as</hi> Horace <hi>says of</hi> Lucilius)
he had alter'd many things; not that they were not as natural before,
but that he might accommodate himself to the Age he liv'd in: yet in the
mean time we are not to conclude any thing rashly against those great
men; but preserve to them the dignity of Masters, and give that honour to
their memories, <hi>(Quos libitina sacravit;)</hi> part of which we expect may be
paid to us in future times.</p>
            <p>This moderation of <hi>Crites,</hi> as it was pleasing to all the company, so it
put an end to that dispute; which, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who seem'd to have the
better of the Argument, would urge no farther: but <hi>Lisideius</hi> after he had
acknowledg'd himself of <hi>Eugenius</hi> his opinion concerning the Ancients;
yet told him he had forborn, till his Discourse were ended, to ask him why
he prefer'd the English Plays above those of other Nations? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we ought not to submit our Stage to the exactness of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours?</p>
            <p>Though, said <hi>Eugenius,</hi> I am at all times ready to defend the honour of
my Countrey against the French, and to maintain, we are as well able to
vanquish them with our Pens as our Ancestors have been with their swords;
yet, if you please, added he, looking upon <hi>Neander,</hi> I will commit this
cause to my friend's management; his opinion of our Plays is the same
with mine: and besides, there is no reason, that <hi>Crites</hi> and I, who have
now left the Stage, should, re-enter so suddenly upon it; which is against
the Laws of Comedie.</p>
            <p>If the Question had been stated, replied <hi>Lysideius,</hi> who had writ best,
the French or English forty years ago, I should have been of your opinion,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48941:18"/>
and adjudg'd the honour to our own Nation; but since that time, (said
he, (turning towards <hi>Neander</hi>) we have been so long together bad
Englishmen, that we had not leisure to be good Poets; <hi>Beaumont
Fletcher,</hi> and <hi>Iohnson</hi> (who were onely capable of bringing us to that degree
of perfection which we have) were just then leaving the world; as if in an
Age of so much horror, wit and those milder studies of humanity, had no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
business among us. But the Muses, who ever follow Peace, went to
plant in another Countrey; it was then that the great (ardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi>
began to take them into his protection; and that, by his encouragement,
<hi>Corneil</hi> and some other Frenchmen reform'd their Theatre, (which before
was as much below ours as it now surpasses it and the rest of <hi>Europe;</hi>) but
because <hi>Crites,</hi> in his Discourse for the Ancients, has prevented me, by
touching upon many Rules of the Stage, which the Moderns have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
from them; I shall onely, in short, demand of you, whether you
are not convinc'd that of all Nations the French have best observ'd them?
In the unity of time you find them so scrupulous, that it yet remains a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
among their Poets, whether the artificial day of twelve hours more
or less, be not meant by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> rather than the natural one of twenty
four; and consequently whether all Plays ought not to be reduc'd into that
compass? This I can testifie, that in all their <hi>Drama</hi>'s writ within these last
20 years and upwards, I have not observ'd any that have extended the time
to thirty hours: in the unity of place they are full as scrupulous, for many
of their Criticks limit it to that very spot of ground where the Play is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to begin; none of them exceed the compass of the same Town or
City.</p>
            <p>The unity of Action in all their Plays is yet more conspicuous, for they
do not burden them with under-plots, as the English do; which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why many Scenes of our Tragi-comedies carry on a design that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48941:19"/>
of kinne to the main Plot; and that we see two distinct webbs in a
Play; like those in ill wrought stuffs; and two actions, that is, two Plays
carried on together, to the confounding of the Audience; who, before
they are warm in their concernments for one part, are diverted to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and by that means espouse the interest of neither. From hence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it arises that the one half of our Actors are not known to the other.
They keep their distances as if they were <hi>Mountagues</hi> and <hi>Capulets,</hi> and
seldom begin an acquaintance till the last Scene of the Fifth Act, when
they are all to meet upon the Stage. There is no Theatre in the world has
any thing so absurd as the English Tragi-comedie, 'tis a <hi>Drama</hi> of our own
invention, and the fashion of it is enough to proclaim it so; here a course of
mirth, there another of sadness and passion; a third of honour, and
fourth a Duel: Thus in two hours and a half we run through all the fits of
<hi>Bedlam</hi> The French affords you as much variety on the same day, but they
do it not so unseasonably, or <hi>mal a propos</hi> as we: Our Poets present you
the Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the Original civility of the Red-Bull;
<q>Atque ursum &amp; pugiles media inter carmina poscunt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The end of Tragedies or serious Playes, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>yes <hi>Aristotle,</hi> is to beget admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
compassion, or concernment; but are not mirth and compassion
things incompatible? and is it not evident that the Poet must of necessity
destroy the former by intermingling of the latter? that is, he must ruine
the sole end and object of his Tragedy to introduce somewhat that is forced
in, and is not of the body of it: Would you not think that Physician mad,
who having prescribed a Purge, should immediately order you to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringents
upon it?</p>
            <p>But to leave our Playes, and return to theirs, I have noted one great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
they have had in the Plotting of their Tragedies; that is, they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48941:19"/>
are always grounded upon some known History: according to that of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race,
Ex noto fictum carmen sequar;</hi> and in that they have so imitated the
Ancients that they have surpass'd them. For the Ancients, as was observ'd
before, took for the foundation of their Playes some Poetical Fiction, such
as under that consideration could move but little concernment in the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
because they already knew the event of it. But the French goes farther;
<q>
                  <l>Atque ita mentitur; sic veris falsae remiscet,</l>
                  <l>Primo ne medium, medio ne discrepet imum:</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He so interweaves Truth with probable Fiction, that he puts a pleasing Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy
upon us; mends the intrigues of Fate, and dispenses with the severity of
History, to reward that vertue which has been rendred to us there unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.
Sometimes the story has left the success so doubtful, that the Writer is
free, by the priviledge of a Poet, to take that which of two or more relations
will best sute with his design: As for example, the death of <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
whom <hi>Iustin</hi> and some others report to have perish'd in the <hi>Scythian</hi> war,
but <hi>Xenophon</hi> affirms to have died in his bed of extream old age. Nay more,
when the event is past dispute, even then we are willing to be deceiv'd,
and the Poet, if he contrives it with appearance of truth; has all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of his Party; at least during the time his Play is acting: so naturally
we are kind to vertue, when our own interest is not in question, that we take
it up as the general concernment of Mankind. On the other side, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Historical Playes of <hi>Shakespeare,</hi> they are rather so many Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles
of Kings, or the business many times of thirty or forty years, crampt
into a representation of two hours and a half, which is not to imitate or
paint Nature, but rather to draw her in miniature, to take her in little;
to look upon her through the wrong end of a Perspective, and receive her
Images not onely much less, but infinitely more imperfect then the life: this,
instead of making a Play delightful, renders it ridiculous.

Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For the Spirit of man cannot be satisfied but with truth, or at least veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simility;

            <p>Another thing in which the French differ from us and from the Spaniards,
is, that they do not embarass, or cumber themselves with too much Plot:
they lonely represent so much of a Story as will constitute one whole and
great action sufficient for a Play; we, who undertake more, do but mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
adventures; which, not being produc'd from one another, as effects
from causes, but barely following, constitute many actions in the Drama,
and consequently make it many Playes.</p>
            <p>But by pursuing close one argument, which is not cloy'd with many turns,
the French have gain'd more liberty for verse, in which they write: they
have leisure to dwell upon a subject which deserves it; and to represent the
passions (which we have acknowledg'd to be the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ets work) without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hurried from one thing to another, as we are in the Playes of <hi>Calderon,</hi>
which we have seen lately upon our Theaters, under the name of Spanish
Plotts. I have taken notice but of one Tragedy of ours, whose Plot has that
uniformity and unity of design in it which I have commended in the French<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that is <hi>Rollo,</hi> or rather, under the name of <hi>Rollo,</hi> The Story of <hi>Bassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi>
and <hi>Geta</hi> in <hi>Herodian,</hi> there indeed the Plot is neither large nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate,
but just enough to fill the minds of the Audience, not to cloy them.
Besides, you see it founded upon the truth of History, onely the time of
the action is not reduceable to the strictness of the Rules; and you see in
some places a little farce mingled, which is below the dignity of the other
parts; and in this all our Poets are extreamly peccant, even <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi>
himself in <hi>Sejanus</hi> and <hi>Catiline</hi> has given us this Oleo of a Play; this unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
mixture of Comedy and Tragedy, which to me sounds just as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48941:20"/>
as the History of <hi>David</hi> with the merry humours of <hi>

which is a pleasant Satyre upon the artificial helps of beauty: In <hi>Catiline</hi> you
may see the Parliament of Women; the little envies of them to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and all that passes betwixt <hi>Curio</hi> and <hi>Fulvia:</hi> Scenes admirable in
their kind, but of an ill mingle with the rest.</p>
            <p>But I return again to the French Writers; who, as I have said, do
not burden themselves too much with Plot, which has been reproach'd
to them by an <hi>ingenious person</hi> of our Nation as a fault, for he says they
commonly make but one person considerable in a Play; they dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and his concernments, while the rest of the persons are onely subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to set him off. If he intends this by it, that there is one person in the
Play who is of greater dignity then the rest, he must tax, not onely theirs, but
those of the Ancients, and which he would be loth to do, the best of ours;
for 'tis impossible but that one person must be more conspicuous in it
then any other, and consequently the greatest share in the action
must devolve on him. We see it so in the management of all affairs; even
in the most equal Aristocracy, the ballance cannot be so justly poys'd, but
some one will be superiour to the rest; either in parts, fortune, interest, or
the consideration of some glorious exploit; which will reduce the greatest
part of business into his hands.</p>
            <p>But, if he would have us to imagine that in exalting of one character the
rest of them are neglected, and that all of them have not some share or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the action of the Play, I desire him to produce any of <hi>Corneilles</hi>
Tragedies, wherein every person (like so many servants in a well govern'd
Family) has not some employment, and who is not necessary to the carrying
on of the Plot, or at least to your understanding it.</p>
            <p>There are indeed some protatick persons in the Ancients, whom they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48941:21"/>
make use of in their Playes, either to hear, or give the Relation: but the
French avoid this with great address, making their narrations onely to, or
by such who are some way interested in the main design. And now I am
speaking of Relations, I cannot take a fitter opportunity to add this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
favour of the French, that they often use them with better judgment and
more <hi>a propos</hi> then the English do. Not that I commend narrations in general,
but there are two sorts of them, one of those things which are antecedent
to the Play, and are related to make the conduct of it more clear to us, but,
'tis a fault to choose such subjects for the Stage which will inforce us upon
that Rock; because we see they are seldome listned to by the Audience, and
that is many times the ruin of the Play: for, being once let pass without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
the Audience can never recover themselves to understand the
Plot; and indeed it is somewhat unreasonable that they should be put to
so much trouble, as, that to comprehend what passes in their sight, they
must have recourse to what was done, perhaps, ten or twenty years
ago.</p>
            <p>But there is another sort of Relations, that is, of things hapning in the
Action of the Play, and suppos'd to be done behind the Scenes: and this
is many times both convenient and beautiful: for, by it, the French avoid
the tumult, which we are subject to in <hi>England,</hi> by representing Duells,
Battells, and the like; which renders our Stage too like the Theaters,
where they fight Prizes. For what is more ridiculous then to represent an
Army with a Drum and five men behind it; all which, the Heroe of the
other side is to drive in before him, or to see a Duel fought, and one slain
with two or three thrusts of the foyles, which we know are so blunted,
that we might give a man an hour to kill another in good earnest with
them.</p>
            <p>I have observ'd that in all our Tragedies, the Audience cannot forbear laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48941:21"/>
when the Actors are to die; 'tis the most Comick part of the whole Play.
All <hi>passions</hi> may be lively represented on the Stage, if to the well-writing of
them the Actor supplies a good commanded voice, and limbs that move ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily,
and without stifness; but there are many <hi>actions</hi> which can never be
imitated to a just height: dying especially is a thing which none but a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Gladiator could naturally perform upon the Stage when he did not
imitate or represent, but naturally do it; and therefore it is better to omit
the representation of it.</p>
            <p>The words of a good Writer which describe it lively, will make a deeper
impression of belief in us then all the Actor can perswade us to, when he
seems to fall dead before us; as a Poet in the description of a beautiful Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
or a Meadow, will please our imagination more then the place it self
can please our sight. Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n we see death represented we are convinc'd it is
but Fiction; but when we hear it related, our eyes (the strongest witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
are wanting, which might have undeceiv'd us; and we are all willing
to favour the sleight when the Poet does not too grosly impose upon us.
They therefore who imagine these relations would make no concernment
in the Audience, are deceiv'd, by confounding them with the other, which
are of things antecedent to the Play; those are made often in cold blood
(as I may say) to the audience; but these are warm'd with our concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which are before awaken'd in the Play. What the Philosophers say
of motion, that when it is once begun it continues of it self, and will do so
to Eternity without some stop put to it, is clearly true on this occasion; the
soul being already mov'd with the Characters and Fortunes of those ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
persons, continues going of its own accord, and we are no more
weary to hear what becomes of them when they are not on the Stage, then
we are to listen to the news of an absent Mistress. But it is objected, That
if one part of the Play may be related, then why not all? I answer, Some
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48941:22"/>
parts of the action are more fit to be represented, some to be related. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neille</hi>
sayes judiciously, that the Poet is not oblig'd to expose to view all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
actions which conduce to the principal: he ought to select such of
them to be seen which will appear with the greatest beauty, either by the
magnificence of the show, or the vehemence of passions which they produce,
or some other charm which they have in them, and let the rest arrive to the
audience by narration. 'Tis a great mistake in us to believe the French present
no part of the action upon the Stage: every alteration or crossing of a design,
every new sprung passion, and turn of it, is a part of the action, and much
the noblest, except we conceive nothing to be action till they come to blows;
as if the painting of the Heroes mind were not more properly the Poets
work then the strength of his body. Nor does this any thing contradict the
opinion of <hi>Horace,</hi> where he tells us,
<q>
                  <l>Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem</l>

are frequent, not onely among all the Ancients, but in the best<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> receiv'd of
our English Poets. We find <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> and tumult of the representation; the
other to shun the introducing of things impossible to be believ'd. In that
excellent Play the King and no King, <hi>Fletcher</hi> goes yet farther; for the
whole unravelling of the Plot is done by narration in the fifth Act, after the
manner of the Ancients; and it moves great concernment in the Audience,
though it be onely a relation of what was done many years before the
Play. I could multiply other instances, but these are sufficient to prove
that there is no errour in choosing a subject which requires this sort of
narrations; in the ill managing of them, there may.</p>
            <p>But I find I have been too long in this discourse since the French have
many other excellencies not common to us, as that you never see any of
their Playes end with a conversion, or simple change of will, which is the
ordinary way our Poets use to end theirs. It shows little art in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a Dramatick Poem, when they who have hinder'd the felicity during
the four Acts, desist from it in the fifth without some powerful cause to take
them off, and though I deny not but such reasons may be found, yet it is
a path that is cautiously to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rod, and the Poet is to be sure he convinces
the Audience that the motive is strong enough. As for example, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of the Usurer in the Scornful Lady, seems to me a little forc'd; for
being an Usurer, which implies a lover of Money to the highest degree of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48941:23"/>
covetousness, (and such the Poet has represented him) the account he gives
for the sudden change is, that he has been dup'd by the wilde young fellow,
which in reason might render him more wary another time, and make him
punish himself with harder fare and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rser cloaths to get it up again: but
that he should look upon it as a judgment, and so repent, we may expect to
hear of in a Sermon, but I should never indure it in a Play.</p>
            <p>I pass by this; neither will I insist upon the care they take, that no person
after his first entrance shall ever appear, but the business which brings him
upon the Stage shall be evident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which, if observ'd, must needs render all
the events in the play more natural<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for there you see the probability of
every accident, in the cause that produc'd it; and that which appears chance
in the Play, will seem so reasonable to you, that you will there find it almost
necessary; so that in the exits of their Actors you have a clear account of
their purpose and design in the next entrance. (though, if the Scene be
well wrought, the event will commonly deceive you) for there is nothing
so absurd, sayes <hi>Corneille,</hi> as for an Actor to leave the Stage, onely because
he has no more to say.</p>
            <p>I should now speak of the beauty of their Rhime, and the just reason I have
to prefer that way of writing in Trag dies before ours in Blanck-verse; but
because it is partly receiv'd by us, and therefore not altogether peculiar to
them, I will say no more of it in relation to their Playes. For our own
I doubt not but it will exceedingly beautifie them, and I can see but one
reason why it should not generally obtain, that is, because our Poets
write so ill in it. This indeed may prove a more prevailing argument then
all others which are us'd to destroy it, and therefore I am onely troubled
when great and judicious Poets, and those who are acknowledg'd such, have
writ or spoke against it; as for others they are to be answer'd by that one
sentence of an ancient Authour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:48941:23"/>
Sed ut primo ad consequendos eos quos priores ducimus accendimur, ita ubi aut
praeteriri, aut aequari eos posse desperavimus, studium cum spe senescit: quod,
scilicet, assequi non potest, sequi desinit; praeteritoq, eo in quo eminere non possu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
aliquid in quo nitamur conquirimus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lisideius</hi> concluded in this manner; and <hi>Neander</hi> after a little pause thus
answer'd him.</p>
            <p>I shall grant <hi>Lisideius,</hi> without much dispute, a great part of what he has
urg'd against us, for I acknowledg the French contrive their Plots more
regularly, observe the Laws of Comedy, and decorum of the Stage (to
speak generally) with more exactness then the English. Farther I deny
not but he has tax'd us justly in some irregularities of ours which he has men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd;
yet, after all, I am of opinion that neither our faults nor their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
are considerable enough to place them above us.</p>
            <p>For the lively imitation of Nature being in the definition of a Play, those
which best fulfil that law ought to be esteem'd superiour to the others. 'Tis
true, those beauties of the French-poesie are such as will raise perfection
higher where it is, but are not sufficient to give it where it is not: they are
indeed the Beauties of a Statue, but not of a Man, because not animated
with the Soul of Poesie, which is imitation of humour and passions: and
this <hi>Lisideius</hi> himself, or any other, however byassed to their Party, cannot
but acknowledg, if he will either compare the humours of our Comedies, or
the Characters of our serious Playes with theirs. He that will look upon
theirs which have been written till these last ten years or thereabouts, will
find it an hard matter to pick out two or three passable humours amongst
them. <hi>Corneille</hi> himself, their Arch-Poet, what has he produc'd except
<hi>the Lier,</hi> and you know how it was cry'd up in <hi>France;</hi> but when it came
upon the English Stage, though well translated, and that part of <hi>Dorant</hi>
acted to so much advantage by Mr. <hi>Hart,</hi> as I am confident it never receiv'd
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48941:24"/>
in its own Country, the most favourable to it would not put in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
with many of <hi>Fletchers</hi> or <hi>Ben. Iohnsons.</hi> In the rest of <hi>Corneilles</hi>
Comedies you have little humour; he tells you himself his way is first to
show two Lovers in good intelligence with each other; in the working up
of the Play to embroyle them by some mistake, and in the latter end to clear
it up.</p>
            <p>But of late years <hi>de Molier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>,</hi> the younger <hi>Corneille, Quinault,</hi> and
some others, have been imitating of afar off the quick turns and graces of
the English Stage. They have mix'd their serious Playes with mirth, like our
Tragicomedies since the death of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> which <hi>Lisideius</hi> and
many others not observing, have commended that in them for a virtue
which they themselves no longer practice. Most of their new Playes are
like some of ours, deriv'd from the Spanish Novells. There is scarce one
of them without a vail, and a trusty <hi>Diego,</hi> who drolls much afer the rate
of the <hi>Adventures.</hi> But their humours, if I may grace them with that name,
are so thin sown that never above one of them comes up in any Play: I
dare take upon me to find more variety of them in some one Play of <hi>Ben.
Iohnsons</hi> then in all theirs together: as he who has seen the Alchymist, the
silent Woman, or <hi>Bartholmew-</hi> Fair, cannot but acknowledge with me.</p>
            <p>I grant the French have performed what was possible on the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
of the Spanish Playes; what was pleasant before they have made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular;
but there is not above one good Play to be writ upon all those Plots;
they are too much alike to please often, which we need not the experience
of our own Stage to justifie. As for their new way of mingling mirth with
serious Plot I do not with <hi>Lysideius</hi> condemn the thing, though I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their manner of doing it. He tells us we cannot so speedily recollect
our selves after a Scene of great passion and concernment as to pass to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of mirth and humour, and to enjoy it with any relish: but why should
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48941:24"/>
he imagine the soul of man more heavy then his Sences? Does not the eye
pass from an unpleasant object to a pleasant in a much shorter time then is
requir'd to this? and does not the unpleasantness of the first commend the
beauty of the latter? The old Rule of Logick might have convinc'd him,
that contraries when plac'd near, set off each other. A continued gravity
keeps the spirit too much bent; we must refresh it sometimes, as we bait
upon a journey, that we may go on with greater ease. A Scene of mirth
mix'd with. Tragedy has the same effect upon us which our musick has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Acts, and that we find a relief to us from the best Plots and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Stage, if the discourses have been long. I must therefore
have stronger arguments ere I am convinc'd, that compassion and mirth in
the same subject destroy each other; and in the mean time cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
to the honour of our Nation, that we have invented, increas'd and
perfected a more pleasant way of writing for the Stage then was ever known
to the Ancients or Moderns of any Nation, which is Tragicomedie.</p>
            <p>And this leads me to wonder why <hi>Lisideius</hi> and many others should cry
up the barrenness of the French Plots above the variety and copiousness of
the English. Their Plots are single, they carry on one design which is push'd
forward by all the Actors, every Scene in the Play contributing and moving
towards it: Ours, besides the main design, have under plots or by-concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of less considerable Persons, and Intrigues, which are carried on
with the motion of the main Plot: just as they say the Orb of the fix'd Stars,
and those of the Planets, though they have motions of their own, are whirl'd
about by the motion of the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> in which they are contain'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that similitude expresses much of the English Stage: for if contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be found in Nature to agree; if a Planet can go East and West at
the same time; one way by virtue of his own motion, the other by the
force of the first mover; it will not be difficult to imagine how the under
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48941:25"/>
Plot, which is onely different, not contrary to the great design, may na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
be conducted along with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenius</hi> has already shown us, from the confession of the French Poets,
that the Unity of Action is sufficiently preserv'd if all the imperfect actions
of the Play are conducing to the main design: but when those petty intrigues
of a Play are so ill order'd that they have no coherence with the other, I
must grant <hi>Lisideius</hi> has reason to tax that want of due connexion; for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
in a Play is as dangerous and unnatural as in a State. In the mean
time he must acknowledge our variety, if well order'd, will afford a greater
pleasure to the audience.</p>
            <p>As for his other argument, that by pursuing one single Theme they gain
an advantage to express and work up the passions, I wish any example he
could bring from them would make it good: for I confess their verses are
to me the coldest I have ever read: Neither indeed is it possible for them,
in the way they take, so to express passion, as that the effects of it should
appear in the concernment of an Audience: their Speeches being so many
declamations, which tire us with the length; so that instead of perswading us
to grieve for their imaginary Heroes, we are concern'd for our own trouble,
as we are in the tedious visits of bad company; we are in pain till they are
gone. When the French Stage came to be reform'd by Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi>
those long Harangues were introduc'd, to comply with the gravity of a
Churchman. Look upon the <hi>Cinna</hi> and the <hi>Pompey,</hi> they are not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to be called Playes, as long discourses of reason of State: and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieucte</hi>
in matters of Religion is as solemn as the long stops upon our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.
Since that time it is grown into a custome, and their Actors speak by
the Hour-glass, as our Parsons do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay, they account it the grace of their
parts: and think themselves disparag'd by the Poet, if they may not twice
or thrice in a Play entertain the Audience with a Speech of an hundred or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48941:25"/>
two hundred lines. I deny not but this may su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e well enough with the
French; for as we, who are a more sullen people, come to be diverted at
our Playes; they who are of an ayery and gay temper come thither to
make themselves more serious: And this I conceive to be one reason why
Comedy is more pleasing to us, and Tragedies to them. But to speak ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
it cannot be deny'd that short Speeches and Replies are more apt
to move the passions, and beget concernment in us then the other: for it is
unnatural for any one in a gust of passion to speak long together, or for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
in the same condition, to suffer him, without interruption. Grief
and Passion are like floods rais'd in little Brooks by a sudden rain; they are
quickly up, and if the concernment be powr'd unexpectedly in upon us, it
overflows us: But a long sober shower gives them leisure to run out as they
came in, without troubling the ordinary current. As for Comedy, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partee
is one of its chiefest graces; the greatest pleasure of the Audience is
a chase of wit kept up on both sides, and swiftly manag'd. And this our
forefathers, if not we, have had in <hi>Fletchers</hi> Playes, to a much higher degree
of perfection then the French Poets can arrive at.</p>
            <p>There is another part of <hi>Lisideius</hi> his Discourse, in which he has rather
excus'd our neighbours then commended them; that is, for aiming onely
to make one person considerable in their Playes. 'Tis very true what he has
urged, that one character in all Playes, even without the Poets care, will have
advantage of all the others; and that the design of the whole <hi>Drama</hi> will
chiefly depend on it. But this hinders not that there may be more shining
characters in the Play: many persons of a second magnitude, nay, some so
very near, so almost equal to the first, that greatness may be oppos'd to
greatness, and all the persons be made considerable, not onely by their
quality, but their action. 'Tis evident that the more the persons are, the
greater will be the variety of the Plot. If then the parts are manag'd so
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48941:26"/>
regularly that the beauty of the whole be kept intire, and that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
become not a perplex'd and confus'd mass of accidents, you will
find it infinitely pleasing to be led in a labyrinth of design, where you
see some of your way before you, yet discern not the end till you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at it. And that all this is practicable, I can produce for examples
many of our English Playes: as the Maids Tragedy, the Alchymist, the
Silent Woman; I was going to have named the Fox, but that the unity
of design seems not exactly observ'd in it; for there appears two acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Play; the first naturally ending with the fourth Act; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
forc'd from it in the fifth: which yet is the less to be condemn'd in
him, because the disguise of <hi>Volpone,</hi> though it suited not with his character
as a crafty or covetous person, agreed well enough with that of a voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary:
and by it the Poet gain'd the end he aym'd at, the punishment of Vice,
and the reward of Virtue, which that disguise produc'd. So that to judge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
of it, it was an excellent fifth Act, but not so naturally proceeding
from the former.</p>
            <p>But to leave this, and pass to the latter part of <hi>Lisideius</hi> his discourse,
which concerns relations, I must acknowledge with him, that the French
have reason when they hide that part of the action which would occasion
too much tumult upon the Stage, and choose rather to have it made known
by narration to the Audience. Farther I think it very convenient, for the
reasons he has given, that all incredible actions were remov'd; but, whither
custome has so insinuated it self into our Country-men, or nature has so
form'd them to fierceness, I know not; but they will scarcely suffer combats &amp;
other objects of horrour to be taken from them. And indeed, the indecency
of tumults is all which can be objected against fighting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For why may not
our imagination as well suffer it self to be deluded with the probability of it,
as with any other thing in the Play? For my part, I can with as great ease
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48941:26"/>
perswade my self that the blowes which are struck are given in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
as I can, that they who strike them are Kings or Princes, or those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which they represent. For objects of incredibility I would be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
from <hi>Lisideius,</hi> whether we have any so remov'd from all appearance of
truth as are those of <hi>Corneilles Andromede?</hi> A Play which has been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
the most of any he has writ? If the <hi>Perseus,</hi> or the Son of an
Heathen God, the <hi>Pegasus</hi> and the Monster were not capable to choak a
strong belief, let him blame any representation of ours hereafter. Those
indeed were objects of delight; yet the reason is the same as to the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility:
for he makes it not a Balletteor Masque, but a Play, which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
truth. But for death, that it ought not to be represented, I have
besides the Arguments alledg'd by <hi>Lisideius,</hi> the authority of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iohnson,</hi>
who has fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>born it in his Tragedies; for both the death of <hi>Sejanus</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
are related: though in the latter I cannot but observe one irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of that great Poet: he has remov'd the Scene in the same Act, from
<hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Catiline's</hi> Army, and from thence again to <hi>Rome;</hi> and besides,
has allow'd a very inconsiderable time, after <hi>Catilines</hi> Speech, for the stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the battle, and the return of <hi>Petreius,</hi> who is to relate the event of
it to the Senate: which I should not animadvert upon him, who was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a painful observer of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the decorum of the Stage, if he had
not us'd extream severity in his judgment upon the incomparable <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speare</hi>
for the same fault. To conclude on this subject of Relations, if we
are to be blam'd for showing too much of the action, the French are as faulty
for discovering too little of it: a mean betwixt both should be observed
by every judicious Writer, so as the audience may neither be left unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by not seeing what is beautiful, or shock'd by beholding what is either
incredible or undecent. I hope I have already prov'd in this discourse, that
though we are not altogether so punctual as the French, in observing the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48941:27"/>
lawes of Comedy; yet our errours are so few, and little, and those things
wherein we excel them so considerable, that we ought of right to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
before them. But what will <hi>Lisideius</hi> say if they themselves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
they are too strictly ti'd up by those lawes, for breaking which he has
blam'd the English? I will alledge <hi>Corneille's</hi> words, as I find them in the
end of his Discourse of the three Unities; <hi>Il est facile aux speculatifs d'estre
severes, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>'Tis easie for speculative persons to judge severely; but if
they would produce to publick view ten or twelve pieces of this nature,
they would perhaps give more latitude to the Rules then I have done,
when by experience they had known how much we are bound up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
by them, and how many beauties of the Stage they banish'd from
it.</q> To illustrate a little what he has said, by their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ervile observations of
the unities of time and place, and integrity of Scenes, they have brought upon
themselves that dearth of Plot, and narrowness of Imagination, which may
be observ'd in all their Playes. How many beautifull accidents might natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
happen in two or three dayes, which cannot arrive with any probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the compass of 24 hours? There is time to be allowed also for matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of design, which amongst great and prudent persons, such as are often
represented in Tragedy, cannot, with any likelihood of truth, be brought
to pass at so short a warning. Farther, by tying themselves strictly to the
unity of place, and unbroken Scenes, they are forc'd many times to omit
some beauties which cannot be shown where the Act began; but might, if
the Scene were interrupted, and the Stage clear'd for the persons to enter in
another place; and therefore the French Poets are often forc'd upon ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities:
for if the Act begins in a chamber all the persons in the Play must
have some business or other to come thither, or else they are not to be shown
that Act, and sometimes their characters are very unfitting to appear there;
As, suppose it were the Kings Bed-chamber, yet the meanest man in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48941:27"/>
Tragedy must come and dispatch his business there rather then in the Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
or Court-yard (which is fitter for him) for fear the Stage should be clear'd,
and the Scenes broken. Many times they fall by it into a greater inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience;
for they keep their Scenes unbroken, and yet change the place;
as in one of their newest Playes, where the Act begins in the Street. There
a Gentleman is to meet his Friend; he sees him with his man, coming out
from his Fathers house; they talk together, and the first goes out: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
who is a Lover, has made an appointment with his Mistress; she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
at the window, and then we are to imagine the Scene lies under it.
This Gentleman is call'd away, and leaves his servant with his Mistress: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
her Father is heard from within; the young Lady is affraid the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingman
should be discover'd, and thrusts him in through a door which is
suppos'd to be her Closet. After this, the Father enters to the Daughter, and
now the Scene is in a House: for he is seeking from one room to another
for this poor <hi>Philipin,</hi> or French <hi>Diego,</hi> who is heard from within, drolling
and breaking many a miserable conceit upon his sad condition. In this
ridiculous manner the Play goes on, the Stage being never empty all the
while: so that the Street, the Window, the two Houses, and the Closet,
are made to walk about, and the Persons to stand still. Now what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you is more easie than to write a regular French Play, or more difficult
then to write an irregular English one, like those of <hi>Fletcher,</hi> or of <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they content themselves as <hi>Corn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ille</hi> did, with some flat design, which,
like an ill Riddle, is found out e're it be half propos'd; such Plots we can
make every way regular as easily as they: but when e're they endeavour
ro rise up to any quick turns and counterturns of Plot, as some of them have
attempted, since <hi>Corneilles</hi> Playes have been less in vogue, you see they
write as irregularly as we, though they cover it more speciously. Hence
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48941:28"/>
the reason is perspicuous, why no French Playes, when translated, have, or
ever can succeed upon the English Stage. For, if you consider the Plots, our
own are fuller of variety, if the writing ours are more quick and fuller of
spirit: and therefore 'tis a strange mistake in those who decry the way of
writing Playes in Verse, as if the English therein imitated the French.
We have borrow'd nothing from them; our Plots are weav'd in English
Loomes: we endeavour therein to follow the variety and greatness of
characters which are deriv'd to us from <hi>Shakespeare</hi> and <hi>Fletcher:</hi> the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piousness
and well-knitting of the intrigues we have from <hi>Iohnson,</hi> and for
the Verse it self we have English Presidents of elder date then any of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neilles</hi>'s
Playes: (not to name our old Comedies before <hi>Shakespeare,</hi> which
were all writ in verse of six feet, or <hi>Alexandrin's,</hi> such as the French now
use) I can show in <hi>Shakespeare,</hi> many Scenes of rhyme together, and the
like in <hi>Ben. Iohnsons</hi> Tragedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s: In <hi>Catiline</hi> and <hi>Sejanus</hi> sometimes thirty
or forty lines; I mean besides the Chorus, or the Monologues, which by
the way, show'd <hi>Ben.</hi> no enemy to this way of writing, especially if you
look upon his sad Shepherd which goes sometimes upon rhyme, sometimes
upon blanck Verse, like an Horse who eases himself upon Trot and Amble.
You find him likewise commending <hi>Fletcher's</hi> Pastoral of the Faithful She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherdess;
which is for the most part Rhyme, though not refin'd to that
purity to which it hath since been brought: And these examples are enough
to clear us from a servile imitation of the French.</p>
            <p>But to return from whence I have digress'd, I dare boldly affirm these two
things of the English <hi>Drama:</hi> First, That we have many Playes of ours as
regular as any of theirs; and which, besides, have more variety of Plot and
Characters: And secondly, that in most of the irregular Playes of <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speare</hi>
or <hi>Fletcher</hi> (for <hi>Ben. Iohnson's</hi> are for the most part regular) there
is a more masculine fancy and gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ter spirit in all the writing, then there is in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48941:28"/>
any of the French. I could produce even in <hi>Shakespeare's</hi> and <hi>Fletcher's</hi>
Works, some Playes which are almost exactly form'd; as the Merry Wives
of <hi>Windsor,</hi> aud the Scornful Lady: but because (generally speaking) <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speare,</hi>
who writ first, did not perfectly observe the Laws of Comedy, and
<hi>Fletcher,</hi> who came nearer to perfection, yet through carelesness made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
faults; I will take the pattern of a perfect Play from <hi>Ben. Iohnson,</hi> who
was a careful and learned observer of the Dramatique Lawes, and from all
his Comedies I shall select <hi>The Silent Woman;</hi> of which I will make a short
Examen, according to those Rules which the French observe.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Neander</hi> was beginning to examine the Silent Woman, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
earnestly upon him; I beseech you <hi>Neander,</hi> said he, gratifie the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and me in particular so far, as before you speak of the Play, to give
us a Character of the Authour; and tell us franckly your opinion, whether
you do not think all Writers, both French and English, ought to give place
to him?</p>
            <p>I fear, replied <hi>Neander,</hi> That in obeying your commands I shall draw a
little envy upon my self. Besides, in performing them, it will be first neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to speak somewhat of <hi>Shakespeare</hi> and <hi>Fletcher,</hi> his Rivalls in Poesie;
and one of them, in my opinion, at least his equal, perhaps his supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour.</p>
            <p>To begin then with <hi>Shakespeare;</hi> he was the man who of all Moder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>,
and perhaps Ancient Poets, had the largest and most comprehensive soul.
All the Images of Nature were still present to him, and he drew them not
laboriously, but luckily: when he describes any thing, you more than see
it, you feel it too. Those who accuse him to have wanted learning, give
him the greater commendation: he was naturally learn'd; he needed not
the spectacles of Books to read Nature; he look'd inwards, and found her
there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot say he is every where alike; were he so, I should do him
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48941:29"/>
injury to compare him with the greatest of Mankind. He is many times<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> flat,
insipid; his Comick wit degenerating into clenches, his serious swelling into
Bombast. But he is alwayes great, when some great occasion is presented
to him: no man can say he ever had a fit subject for his wit, and did not
then raise himself as high above the rest of Poets,
<q>Quantum lent a solent, inter viberna cupressi.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The consideration of this made Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton</hi> say, That there was
no subject of which any Poet ever writ, but he would produce it much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
treated of in <hi>Shakespeare;</hi> and however others are now generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
before him, yet the Age wherein he liv'd, which had contemporaries
with him, <hi>Fletcher</hi> and <hi>Iohnson</hi> never equall'd them to him in their esteem:
And in the last Kings Court, when <hi>Ben's</hi> reputation was at highest, Sir <hi>Iohn
Suckling,</hi> and with him the greater part of the Courtiers, set our <hi>Shakespeare</hi>
far above him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beaumont</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi> of whom I am next to speak, had with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of <hi>Shakespeare's</hi> wit, which was their precedent, great natural gifts,
improv'd by study. <hi>Beaumont</hi> especially being so accurate a judge of Playes,
that <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi> while he liv'd, submitted all his Writings to his Censure,
and 'tis thought, us'd his judgement in correcting, if not contriving all his
Plots. What value he had for him, appears by the Verses he writ to him;
and therefore I need speak no farther of it. The first Play which brought
<hi>Fletcher</hi> and him in esteem was their <hi>Philaster:</hi> for before that, they had
written two or three very unsuccessfully: as the like is reported of <hi>Ben.
Iohnson,</hi> before he writ <hi>Every Man in his Humour.</hi> Their Plots were
generally more regular then <hi>Shakespeare's,</hi> especially those which were
made before <hi>Beaumont's</hi> death; and they understood and imitated the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
of Gentlemen much better; whose wilde debaucheries, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of wit in reparties, no Poet can ever paint as they have done. This Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48941:29"/>
of which <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi> deriv'd from particular persons, they made it not
their business to describe: they represented all the passions very lively, but
above all, Love. I am apt to believe the English Language in them arriv'd
to its highest perfection; what words have since been taken in, are rather
superfluous then necessary. Their Playes are now the most pleasant and
frequent entertainments of the Stage; two of theirs being acted through
the year for one of <hi>Shakespheare's</hi> or <hi>Iohnsons:</hi> the reason is, because there
is a certain gayety in their Comedies, and Pathos in their more serious Playes,
which suits generally with all mens humours. <hi>Shakespeares</hi> language is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a little obsolete, and <hi>Ben. Iohnson's</hi> wit comes short of theirs.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Iohnson,</hi> to whose Character I am now arriv'd, if we look upon
him while he was himself, (for his last Playes were but his dotages) I think
him the most learned and judicious Writer which any Theater ever had. He
was a most severe Judge of himself as well as others. One cannot say
he wanted wit, but rather that he was frugal of it. In his works you find
little to retrench or alter. Wit and Language, and Humour also in some
measure we had before him; but something of Art was wanting to the
<hi>Drama</hi> till he came. He manag'd his strength to more advantage then any
who preceded him. You seldome find him making Love in any of his Scenes,
or endeavouring to move the Passions; his genius was too sullen and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnine
to do it gracefully, especially when he knew he came after those who
had performed both to such an height. Humour was his proper Sphere,
and in that he delighted most to represent Mechanick people. He was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conversant in the Ancients, both Greek and Latine, and he borrow'd
boldly from them: there is scarce a Poet or Historian among the Roman
Authours of those times whom he has not translated in <hi>Sejanus</hi> and <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</hi>
But he has done his Robberies so openly, that one may see he fears
not to be taxed by any Law. He invades Authours like a Monarch, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48941:30"/>
what would be theft in other Poets, is onely victory in him. With the spoils
of these Writers he so represents old <hi>Rome</hi> to us, in its Rites, Ceremonies and
Customs, that if one of their Poets had written either of his Tragedies, we
had seen less of it then in him. If there was any fault in his Language, 'twas
that he weav'd it too closely and laboriously in his serious Playes: perhaps
too, he did a little to much Romanize our Tongue, leaving the words which
he translated almost as much Latine as he found them: wherein though he
learnedly followed the Idiom of their language, he did not enough comply
with ours. If I would compare him with <hi>Shakespeare,</hi> I must acknowledge
him the more correct Poet, but <hi>Shakespeare</hi> the greater wit. <hi>Shakespeare</hi>
was the <hi>Homer,</hi> or Father of our Dramatick Poets; <hi>Iohnson</hi> was the <hi>Virgil,</hi>
the pattern of elaborate writing; I admire him, but I love <hi>Shakespeare.</hi>
To conclude of him, as he has given us the most correct Playes, so
in the precepts which he has laid down in his Discoveries, we have as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and profitable Rules for perfecting the Stage as any wherewith the French
can furnish us.</p>
            <p>Having thus spoken of the Authour, I proceed to the examination of his
Comedy, <hi>The Silent Woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Examen of the Silent Woman.</head>
               <p>To begin first with the length of the Action, it is so far from exceeding
the compass of a Natural day, that it takes not up an Artificial one. 'Tis
all included in the limits of three hours and an half, which is no more than
is requir'd for the presentment on the Stage. A beauty perhaps not much
observ'd; if it had, we should not have look'd upon the Spanish Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of five hours with so much wonder. The Scene of it is laid in <hi>London;</hi>
the latitude of place is almost as little as you can imagine: for it lies all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48941:30"/>
within the compass of two Houses, and after the first Act, in one. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity
of Scenes is observ'd more than in any of our Playes, excepting his
own Fox and Alchymist. They are not broken above twice or thrice at
most in the whole Comedy, and in the two best of <hi>Corneille's</hi> Playes, the Cid
and <hi>Cinna,</hi> they are interrupted once apiece. The action of the Play is
intirely one; the end or aim of which is the setling <hi>Moroses</hi>'s Estate on <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine.</hi>
The Intrigue of it is the greatest and most noble of any pure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd
Comedy in any Language: you see in it many persons of various
characters and humours, and all delightful: As first, <hi>Morose,</hi> or an old
Man, to whom all noise but his own talking is offensive. Some who would
be thought Criticks, say this humour of his is forc'd: but to remove that
objection, we may consider him first to be naturally of a delicate hearing, as
many are to whom all sharp sounds are unpleasant; and secondly, we may
attribute much of it to the peevishness of his Age, or the wayward autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of an old man in his own house, where he may make himself obeyed;
and this the Poet seems to allude to in his name <hi>Morose.</hi> Besides this, I am
assur'd from diverse persons, that <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi> was actually acquainted with
such a man, one altogether as ridiculous as he is here represented. Others
say it is not enough to find one man of such an humour; it must be common
to more, and the more common the more natural. To prove this, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in the best of Comical Characters, <hi>Falstaffe:</hi> There are many men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
him; Old, Fat, Merry, Cowardly, Drunken, Amorous, Vain,
and Lying: But to convince these people, I need but tell them, that humour
is the ridiculous extravagance of conversation, wherein one man differs from
all others. If then it be common, or communicated to many, how differs
it from other mens? or what indeed causes it to be ridiculous so much as the
singularity of it? As for <hi>Falstaffe,</hi> he is not properly one humour, but a
Miscellany of Humours or Images, drawn from so many several men; that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48941:31"/>
wherein he is singular in his wit, or those things he sayes, <hi>praeter expectatum,</hi>
unexpected by the Audience; his quick evasions when you imagine him
surpriz'd, which as they are extreamly diverting of themselves, so receive a
great addition from his person; for the very sight of such an unwieldy old
debauch'd fellow is a Comedy alone. And here having a place so proper for
it I cannot but enlarge somewhat upon this subject of humour into which I
am fallen. The Ancients had little of it in their Comedies; for the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
of the old Comedy, of which <hi>Aristophanes</hi> was chief, was not so much to
imitate a man, as to make the people laugh at some odd conceit, which had
commonly somewhat of unnatural or obscene in it. Thus when you see <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
brought upon the Stage, you are not to imagine him made ridiculous
by the imitation of his actions, but rather by making him perform some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
very unlike himself: something so childish and absurd, as by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it with the gravity of the true <hi>Socrates,</hi> makes a ridiculous object for the
Spectators. In their new Comedy which succeeded, the Poets sought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to express the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as in their Tragedies the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Mankind. But
this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> contain'd onely the general Characters of men and manners; as
old men, Lovers, Servingmen, Courtizans, Parasites, and such other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as we see in their Comedies; all which they made alike: that is, one
old man or Father; one Lover, one Courtizan so like another, as if the
first of them had begot the rest of every sort: <hi>Ex homine hunc natum dicas.</hi>
The same custome they observ'd likewise in their Tragedies. As for the
<hi>French,</hi> though they have the word <hi>humeur</hi> among them, yet they have
small use of it in their Comedies, or Farces; they being but ill imitations
of the <hi>ridiculum,</hi> or that which stirr'd up laughter in the old Comedy. But
among the <hi>English</hi> 'tis otherwise: where by humour is meant some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
habit, passion, or affection; particular (as I said before) to some
one person: by the oddness of which, he is immediately distinguish'd
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48941:31"/>
from the rest of men; which being lively and naturally represented, most
frequently begets that malicious pleasure in the Audience which is testified
by laughter: as all things which are deviations from common customes are
ever the aptest to produce it: though by the way this laughter is onely acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental,
as the person represented is Fantastick or Bizarre, but pleasure is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to it, as the imitation of what is natural. The description of these hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
drawn from the knowledge and observation of particular persons,
was the peculiar genius and talent of <hi>Ben. Iohnson;</hi> To whose Play I now
return.</p>
               <p>Besides <hi>Morose,</hi> there are at least 9 or 10 different Characters and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
in the <hi>Silent Woman,</hi> all which persons have several concernments
of their own, yet are all us'd by the Poet, to the conducting of the main
design to perfection. I shall not waste time in commending the writing of
this Play, but I will give you my opinion, that there is more wit and acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Fancy in it then in any of <hi>Ben. Iohnson's.</hi> Besides, that he has here
describ'd the conversation of Gentlemen in the persons of <hi>True-Wit,</hi> and
his Friends, with more gayety, ayre and freedom, then in the rest of his
Comedies. For the contrivance of the Plot 'tis extream elaborate, and
yet withal easie; for the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or untying of it, 'tis so admirable, that when
it is done, no one of the Audience would think the Poet could have miss'd
it; and yet it was conceald so much before the last Scene, that any other
way would sooner have enter'd into your thoughts. But I dare not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me to commend the Fabrick of it, because it is altogether so full of Art,
that I must unravel every Scene in it to commend it as I ought. And this
excellent contrivance is still the more to be admir'd, because 'tis Comedy
where the persons are onely of common rank, and their business private,
not elevated by passions or high concernments as in serious Playes. Here
every one is a proper Judge of all he sees; nothing is represented but that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48941:32"/>
with which he daily converse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>: so that by consequence all faults lie open to
discovery, and few are pardonable. 'Tis this which <hi>Horace</hi> has judiciously
observ'd:
<q>
                     <l>Creditur ex medio quia res arcessit habere</l>
                     <l>Sudoris minimum, sed habet Comedia tanto</l>
                     <l>Plus oneris, quanto veniae minus.—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But our Poet, who was not ignorant of these difficulties, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d prevail'd
himself of all advantages; as he who designes a large leap takes his rise
from the highest ground. One of these advantages is that which <hi>Corneille</hi>
has laid down as the greatest which can arrive to any Poem, and which he
himself could never compass above thrice in all his Playes, <hi>viz.</hi> the making
choice of some signal and long expected day, whereon the action of the
Play is to depend. This day was that design'd by <hi>Dauphine</hi> for the setling
of his Uncles Estate upon him; which to compass he contrives to marry
him: that the marriage had been plotted by him long beforehand is made
evident by what he tells <hi>Truwit</hi> in the second Act, that in one moment he
had destroy'd what he had been raising many months.</p>
               <p>There is another artifice of the Poet, which I cannot here omit, because
by the frequent practice of it in his Comedies, he has left it to us almost as
a Rule, that is, when he has any Character or humour wherein he would
show a <hi>Coup de Maistre,</hi> or his highest skill; he recommends it to your
observation by a pleasant description of it before the person first appears.
Thus, in <hi>Bartholomew Fair</hi> he gives you the Pictures of <hi>Numps</hi> and <hi>Cokes,</hi>
and in this those of <hi>Daw, Lafoole, Morose,</hi> and the <hi>Cellegiate Ladies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
all which you hear describ'd before you see them. So that before they come
upon the Stage you have a longing expectation of them, which prepares you
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48941:32"/>
to receive them favourably; and when they are there, even from their
first appearance you are so far acquainted with them, that nothing of their
humour is lost to you.</p>
               <p>I will observe yet one thing further of this admirable Plot; the business
of it rises in every Act. The second is greater then the first, the third
then the second, and so forward to the fifth. There too you see, till the
very last Scene, new difficulties arising to obstruct the action of the Play;
and when the Audience is brought into despair that the business can natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
be effected, then, and not before, the discovery is made. But that
the Poet might entertain you with more variety all this whille, he reserves
some new Characters to show you, which he opens not till the second and
third Act. In the second, <hi>Morose, Daw,</hi> the <hi>Barber</hi> and <hi>Otter;</hi> in the
third the <hi>Collegiat Ladies:</hi> All which he moves afterwards in by-walk, or
under-Plots, as diversions to the main design, least it should grow tedious,
though they are still naturally joyn'd with it, and somewhere or other sub-servient
to it. Thus, like a skilful Chest-player, by little and little he draws
out his men, and makes his pawns of use to his greater persons.</p>
               <p>If this Comedy, and some others of his, were translated into French
Prose (which would now be no wonder to them, since <hi>Moliere</hi> has lately
given them Playes out of Verse which have not displeas'd them) I believe
the controversie would soon be decided betwixt the two Nations, even ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them the Judges. But we need not call our Hero's to our ayde;
Be it spoken to the honour of the English, our Nation can never want in
any Age such who are able to dispute the Empire of Wit with any people
in the Universe. And though the fury of a Civil War, and Power, for
twenty years together, abandon'd to a barbarous race of men, Enemies of
all good Learning, had buried the Muses under the ruines of Monarchy;
yet with the restoration of our happiness, we see reviv'd Poesie lifting up
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48941:33"/>
its head, &amp; already shaking off the rubbish which lay so heavy on it. We have
seen since His Majesties return, many Dramatick Poems which yield not to
those of any forreign Nation, and which deserve all Lawrels but the English.
I will set aside Flattery and Envy: it cannot be deny'd but we have had some
little blemish either in the Plot or writing of all those Playes which have
been made within these seven years: (and perhaps there is no Nation in
the world so quick to discern them, or so difficult to pardon them, as ours:)
yet if we can perswade our selves to use the candour of that Poet, who
(though the most severe of Criticks) has left us this caution by which to
moderate our censures;
<q>—Vbi plura nitent in carmine non ego paucis
offendar maculis.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If in consideration of their many and great beauties, we can wink at
some slight, and little imperfections; if we, I say, can be thus equ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>l to our
selves, I ask no favour from the French. And if I do not venture upon any
particular judgment of our late Playes, 'tis out of the consideration which an
Ancient Writer gives me; <hi>Vivorum, ut magna admiratio ita censura difficilis:</hi>
betwixt the extreams of admiration and malice, 'tis hard to judge upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the living. Onely I think it may be permitted me to say, that as it is
no less'ning to us to yield to some Playes, and those not many of our own
Nation in the last Age, so can it be no addition to pronounce of our present
Poets that they have far surpass'd all the Ancients, and the Modern Writers
of other Countreys.</p>
               <p>This, my Lord, was the substance of what was then spoke on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and <hi>Lisideius,</hi> I think was going to reply, when he was prevented
thus by <hi>Crites:</hi> I am confident, said he, the most material things that can
be said, have been already urg'd on either side; if they have not, I must
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48941:33"/>
beg of <hi>Lisideius</hi> that he will defer his answer till another time: for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
I have a joynt quarrel to you both, because you have concluded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reason given for it, that Rhyme is proper for the Stage. I will not
dispute <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ow ancient it hath been among us to write this way; perhaps our
Ancestours knew no better till <hi>Shakespeare's</hi> time. I will grant it was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t by him, and that <hi>Fletcher</hi> and <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi> us'd it frequently in
their Pastorals, and sometimes in other Playes. Farther, I will not argue
whether we receiv'd it originally from our own Countrymen, or from
the French; for that is an inquiry of as little benefit, as theirs who in the
midst of the great Plague were not so sollicitous to provide against it, as to
know whether we had it from the malignity of our own air, or by transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
from <hi>Holland.</hi> I have therefore onely to affirm, that it is not allowable
in serious Playes; for Comedies I find you already concluding with me. To
prove this, I might satisfie my self to tell you, how much in vain it is for
you to strive against the stream of the peoples inclination; the greatest part
of which are preposses'd so much with those excellent Playes of <hi>Shakespeare,
Fletcher,</hi> and <hi>Ben. Iohnson,</hi> (which have been written our of Rhyme) that
except you could bring them such as were written better in it, and those too
by persons of equal reputation with them, it will be impossible for you to
gain your cause with them, who will still be judges. This it is to
which in fine all your reasons must submit. The unanimous consent of an
Audience is so powerful, That even <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> (as <hi>Macrobius</hi> reports of
him) when he was perpetual Dictator, was not able to ballance it on the
other side. But when <hi>Laberius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, at his request contended
in the <hi>Mime</hi> with another Poet, he was forc'd to cry out, <hi>Etiam favente me
victus es Liberi.</hi> But I will not on this occasion, take the advantage of the
greater number, but onely urge such reasons against Rhyme, as I find in
the Writings of those who have argu'd for the other way. First then I am
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48941:34"/>
of opinion, that Rhyme is unnatural in a Play, because Dialogue
there is presented as the effect of sudden thought. For a Play is the
imitation of Nature; and since no man, without premeditation speaks
in Rhyme, neither ought he to do it on the Stage; this hinders not
but the Fancy may be there elevated to an higher pitch of thought
then it is in ordinary discourse: for there is a probability that men of
excellent and quick parts may speak noble things <hi>ex tempore:</hi> but those
thoughts are never fetter'd, with the numbers or sound of Verse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
study, and therefore it cannot be but unnatural to present the
most free way of speaking, in that which is the most constrain'd. For
this Reason, sayes <hi>Aristotle,</hi> 'Tis best to write Tragedy in that kind of
Verse which is the least such, or which is nearest Prose: and this amongst
the Ancients was the Iambique, and with us is blank verse, or the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of verse, kept exactly without rhyme. These numbers therefore are
fittest for a Play; the others for a paper of Verses, or a Poem. Blank verse
being as much below them as rhyme is improper for the <hi>Drama.</hi> And if it
be objected that neither are blank verses made <hi>ex tempore,</hi> yet as nearest
Nature, they are still to be preferr'd. But there are two particular excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ons
which many besides my self have had to verse; by which it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
yet more plainly, how improper it is in Playes. And the first of
them is grounded upon that very reason for which some have commended
Rhyme: they say the quickness of repartees in argumentative Scenes receives
an ornament from verse. Now what is more unreasonable then to imagine
that a man should not onely light upon the Wit, but the Rhyme too upon
the sudden? This nicking of him who spoke before both in sound and
measure, is so great an happiness, that you must at least suppose the persons
of your Play to be born Poets, <hi>Arcades omnes &amp; cantare pares &amp; respondere
parati<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> they must have arriv'd to the degree of <hi>quicquid co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Nor will it serve you to object, that however you manage it, 'tis still known
to be a Play; and consequently the Dialogue of two persons understood to
be the labour of one Poet. For a Play is still an imitation of Nature; we
know we are to be deceiv'd, and we desire to be so; but no man ever was
deceiv'd but with a probability of truth, for who will suffer a gross lie to be
fasten'd on him? Thus we sufficiently understand that the Scenes which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
Cities and Countries to us, are not really such, but onely painted on
boards and Canvass: But shall that excuse the ill Painture or designment
of them; Nay rather ought they not to be labour'd with so much the more
diligence and exactness to help the imagination? since the mind of man doe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
naturally tend to, and seek after Truth; and therefore the nearer any thing
comes to the imitation of it, the more it pleases.</p>
               <p>Thus, you see, your Rhyme is uncapable of expressing the greatest
thoughts naturally, and the lowest it cannot with any grace: for what
is more unbefitting the Majesty of Verse, then to call a Servant, or bid a
door be shut in Rhime? And yet this miserable necessity you are forc'd
upon. But Verse, you say, circumscribes a quick and luxuriant fancy,
which would extend it self too far on every subject, did not the labour which
is requir'd to well turn'd and polish'd Rhyme, set bounds to it. Yet this
Argument, if granted, would onely prove that we may write better in
Verse, but not more naturally. Neither is it able to evince that; for
he who wants judgment to confine his fancy in blank Verse, may want it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48941:35"/>
as much in Rhyme; and he who has it will avoid errours in both kinds.
Latine verse was as great a confinement to the imagination of those Poets,
as Rhime to ours: and yet you find <hi>Ovid</hi> saying too much on every subject.
<hi>Nescivit</hi> (sayes <hi>Seneca) quod bene cessit r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

one famous instance in his Discription of the Deluge.
<q>Omnia pontus erat, deerant quoque Litora Ponto.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now all was Sea, Nor had that Sea a shore. Thus <hi>Ovid's</hi> fancy was not
limited by verse, and <hi>Virgil</hi> needed not verse to have bounded his.</p>
               <p>In our own language we see <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>n. Iohnshon</hi> confining himself to what ought
to be said, even in the liberty of blank Verse; and yet <hi>Corneille,</hi> the most
judicious of the <hi>French</hi> Poets, is still varying the same sence an hundred
wayes, and dwelling eternally upon the same subject, though confin'd by
Rhyme. Some other exceptions I have to Verse, but being these I have
nam'd are for the most part already publick; I conceive it reasonable they
should first be answer'd.</p>
               <p>It concerns me less then any, said <hi>Neander,</hi> (seeing he had ended) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to this Discourse; because when I should have prov'd that Verse may
be natural in Playes, yet I should alwayes be ready to confess, that
those which I have written in this kind come short of that perfection
which is requir'd. Yet since you are pleas'd I should undertake this
Province, I will do it, though with all imaginable respect and deference
both to that person from whom you have borrow'd your strongest Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and to whose judgment when I have said all, I finally submit. But
before I proceed to answer your objections, I must first remember you,
that I exclude all Comedy from my defence; and next that I deny not but
blank verse may be also us'd, and content my self onely to assert, that in
serious Playes where the subject and characters are great, and the Plot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd
with mirth, which might allay or divert these conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nments which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48941:35"/>
are produc'd Rhyme is there as natural, and more effectual then blank Verse.</p>
               <p>And now having laid down this as a foundation, to begin with <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
I must crave leave to tell him, that some of his Arguments against
rhyme reach no farther then from the faults or defects of ill rhime, to
conclude against the use of it in general. May not I conclude against
blank verse by the same reason? If the words of some Poets who write
in it, are either ill chose, or ill placed (which makes not onely
rhime, but all kind of verse in any language unnatural;) Shall I, for
their vitious affectation condemn those excellent lines of <hi>Fletcher,</hi> which
are written in that kind? Is there any thing in rhyme more constrain'd
than this line in blank verse? I Heav'n invoke, and strong resistance
make, where you see both the clauses are plac'd unnaturally; that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the common way of speaking, and that without the excuse of a
rhyme to cause it: yet you would think me very ridiculous, if I should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the stubbornness of blank Verse for this, and not rather the stifness of
the Poet. Therefore, <hi>Crites,</hi> you must either prove that words, though
well chosen, and duly plac'd, yet render not Rhyme natural in it self; or,
that however natural and easie the rhyme may be, yet it is not proper for
a Play. If you insist upon the former part, I would ask you what other
conditions are requir'd to make Rhyme natural in it self, besides an election
of apt words, and a right disposing of them? For the due choice of your
words expresses your sence naturally, and the due placing them adapts the
rhyme to it. If you object that one verse may be made for the sake of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though both the words and rhyme be apt; I answer it cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
so fall out; for either there is a dependance of sence betwixt the first
line and the second, or there is none: if there be that connection, then in
the natural position of the words, the latter line must of necessity flow from
the former: if there be no dependance, yet still the due ordering of words
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48941:36"/>
makes the last line as natural in it self as the other: so that the necessity of
a rhime never forces any but bad or lazy Writers to say what they would
not otherwise. 'Tis true, there is both care and Art requir'd to write in
Verse; A good Poet never concludes upon the first line, till he has sought
out such a rhime as may fit the sense, already prepar'd to heighten the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond:
many times the close of the sense falls into the middle of the next
verse, or farther of, and he may often prevail himself of the same advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
in English which <hi>Virgil</hi> had in Latine. he may break off in the <hi>Hemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stich,</hi>
and begin another line: indeed, the not observing these two last
things, makes Playes which are writ in verse so tedious: for though, most
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ommonly, the sence is to be confin'd to the Couplet, yet nothing that doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>perpetuo tenore fluere,</hi> run in the same channel, can please alwayes. 'Tis
like the murmuring of a stream, which not varying in the fall, causes at first
attention, at last drowsiness. Variety of cadences is the best rule, the greatest
help to the Actors, and refreshment to the Audience.</p>
               <p>If then Verse may be made natural in it self, how becomes it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
to a Play? You say the Stage is the representation of Nature,
and no man in ordinary conversation speaks in rhime. But you foresaw
when you said this, that it might be answer'd; neither does any man speak
in blank verse, or in measure without rhime. Therefore you concluded,
that which is nearest Nature is still to be preferr'd. But you took no notice
that rhime might be made as natural as blank verse, by the well placing of
the words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all the difference between them when they are both correct,
is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ound in one, which the other wants; and if so, the sweetness of it,
and all the advantage resulting from it, which are handled in the Preface to
the <hi>Rival Ladies,</hi> will yet stand good. As for that place of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> where
he sayes Playes should be writ in that kind of Verse which is nearest Prose;
it makes little for you, blank verse being properly but measur'd Prose. Now
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48941:36"/>
measure alone in any modern Language, does not constitute verse; those
of the Ancients in Greek and Latine, consisted in quantity of words, and
a determinate number of feet. But when, by the inundation of the <hi>Goths</hi>
and <hi>Vandals</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> new Languages were brought in, and barbarous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y
mingled with the Latine (of which the <hi>Italian, Spanish, French,</hi> and ours,
(made out of them and the <hi>Teutonick</hi>) are Dialects:) a new way of Poesie
was practis'd; new, I say in those Countries, for in all probability it was
that of the Conquerours in their own Nations. This new way consisted in
measure or number of feet and rhyme. The sweetness of Rhyme, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Accent, supplying the place of quantity in words, which could
neither exactly be observ'd by those <hi>Barbarians</hi> who knew not the Rules of
it, neither was it suitable to their tongues as it had been to the Greek and
Latine. No man is tied in modern Poesie to observe any farther rule in the
feet of his verse, but that they be dissylables; whether <hi>Spondee, Trochee,</hi>
or <hi>Iambique,</hi> it matters not; onely he is obliged to rhyme: Neither do
the <hi>Spanish, French, Italian</hi> or <hi>Germans</hi> acknowledge at all, or very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
any such kind of Poesie as blank verse amongst them. Therefore at most
'tis but a Poetick Prose, <hi>a Sermo pedestris,</hi> and as such most fit for Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
where I acknowledge Rhyme to be improper. Farther, as to that
quotation of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> our Couplet Verses may be rendred as near Prose
as blank verse it self, by using those advantages I lately nam'd, as breaks in
a Hemistick, or running the sence into another line, thereby making Art
and Order appear as loose and free as Nature: or not tying our selves to
Couplets strictly, we may use the benefit of the Pindarique way, practis'd
in the Siege of <hi>Rhodes;</hi> where the numbers vary and the rhyme is dispos'd
careles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y, and far from often chymeing. Neither is that other advantage
of the Ancients to be despis'd, of changing the kind of verse when they
please with the change of the Scene, or some new entrance; for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48941:37"/>
not themselves alwayes to Iambiques, but extend their liberty to all
Lyrique numbers, and sometimes, even to Hexameter. But I need not go
so far to prove that Rhyme, as it succeeds to all other offices of Greek and
Latine Verse, so especially to this of Playes, since the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ustome of all Nations
at this day confirms it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All the <hi>French, Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Tragedies are
generally writ in it, and sure the Universal consent of the most civiliz'd parts
of the world, ought in this, as it doth in other customs, include the rest.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you may tell me I have propos'd such a way to make rhyme
natural, and consequently proper to Playes, as is unpracticable, and that I shall
scarce find six or eight lines together in any Play, where the words are so
plac'd and chosen as is requir'd to make it natural. I answer, no Poet need
constrain himself at all times to it. It is enough he makes it his general Rule;
for I deny not but sometimes there may be a greatness in placing the words
otherwise; and sometimes they may sound better, sometimes also the variety
it self is excuse enough. But if, for the most part, the words be plac'd as
they are in the negligence of Prose, it is sufficient to denominate the way
practicable; for we esteem that to be such, which in the Tryal oftner
succeeds then misses. And thus far you may find the practice made good in
many Playes; where you do not, remember still, that if you cannot find six
natural Rhymes together, it will be as hard for you to produce as many lines
in blank Verse, even among the greatest of our Poets, against which I cannot
make some reasonable exception.</p>
               <p>And this, Sir, calls to my remembrance the beginning of your discourse,
where you told us we should never find the Audience favourable to this kind
of writing, till we could produce as good Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>yes in Rhyme, as <hi>Ben. Iohnson<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Fletcher,</hi> and <hi>Shakespeare,</hi> had writ out of it. But it is to raise envy to the
living, to compare them with the dead. They are honour'd, and almost
ador'd by us, as they deserve; neither do I know any so presumptuous of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48941:37"/>
themselves as to contend with them. Yet give me leave to say thus much,
without injury to their Ashes, that not onely we shall never equal them,
but they could never equal themselves, were they to rise and write again.
We acknowledge them our Fathers in wit, but they have ruin'd their Estates
themselves before they came to their childrens hands. There is scarce an
Humour, a Character, or any kind of Plot, which they have not blown
upon: all comes sullied or wasted to us: and were they to entertain this
Age, they could not make so plenteous treatments out of such decay'd For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
This therefore will be a good Argument to us either not to write
at all, or to attempt some other way. There is no bayes to be expected
in their Walks; <hi>Tentanda via est qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> me quoque possum tollere humo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This way of writing in Verse, they have onely left free to us; our age
is arriv'd to a perfection in it, which they never knew; and which (if we
may guess by what of theirs we have seen in Verse (as the <hi>Faithful She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherdess,</hi>
and <hi>Sad Shepherd:</hi>) 'tis probable they never could have reach'd.
For the Genius of every Age is different; and though ours excel in this, I deny
not but that to imitate Nature in that perfection which they did in Prose, is a
greater commendation then to write in verse exactly. As for what you have
added, that the people are not generally inclin'd to like this way; if it were
true, it would be no wonder, that betwixt the shaking off an old habit, and
the introducing of a new, there should be difficulty. Do we not see them stick
to <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternholds</hi> Psalmes, and forsake those of <hi>David,</hi> I mean
<hi>Sandys</hi> his Translation of them? If by the people you understand the
multitude, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>is no matter what they think; they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the right, sometimes in the wong; their judgment is a meer Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.
<hi>Est ubi plebs rectè putat, est ubi peccat. Horace</hi> sayes it of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
judging Poesie. But if you mean the mix'd audience of the populace,
and the Noblesse, I dare confidently affirm that a great part of the latter
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48941:38"/>
sort are already favourable to verse; and that no serious Playes written
since the Kings return have been more kindly receiv'd by them, then the
Seige of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> the <hi>Mustapha,</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> Queen, and <hi>Indian</hi> Emperour.</p>
               <p>But I come now to the inference of your first Argument. You said the
Dialogue of Playes is presented as the effect of sudden thought, but no man
speaks suddenly, or <hi>ex tempore</hi> in Rhyme: And you inferr'd from thence,
that Rhyme, which you acknowledge to be proper to Epique Poesie cannot
equally be proper to Dramatick, unless we could suppose all men born so
much more then Poets, that verse should be made in them, not by them.</p>
               <p>It has been formerly urg'd by you, and confess'd by me, that since no
man spoke any kind of verse <hi>ex tempore,</hi> that which was nearest Nature was
to be preferr'd. I answer you therefore, by distinguishing betwixt what is
nearest to the nature of Comedy, which is the imitation of common persons
and ordinary speaking, and what is nearest the nature of a serious Play:
this last is indeed the representation of Nature, but 'tis Nature wrought up
to an higher pitch. The Plot, the Characters, the Wit, the Passions, the
Descriptions, are all exalted above the level of common converse, as high
as the imagination of the Poet can carry them, with proportion to verisimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
Tragedy we know is wont to image to us the minds and fortunes of
noble persons, and to portray these exactly, Heroick Rhime is nearest Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as being the noblest kind of modern verse.

               </p>
               <p>Blank Verse is acknowledg'd to be too low for a Poem, nay more,
for a paper of verses; but if too low for an ordinary Sonnet, how
much more for Tragedy, which is by <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the dispute betwixt the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48941:38"/>
Epique Poesie and the Dramatick; for many reasons he there alledges
ranck'd above it.</p>
               <p>But setting this defence aside, your Argument is almost as strong against
the use of Rhyme in Poems as in Playes; for the Epique way is every where
interlac'd with Dialogue, or discoursive Scenes; and therefore you must
either grant Rhyme to be improper there, which is contrary to your asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or admit it into Playes by the same title which you have given it to
Poems. For though Tragedy be justly preferr'd above the other, yet there
is a great affinity between them as may easily be discover'd in that definition
of a Play which <hi>Lisideius</hi> g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ve us. The Genus of them is the same, a just
and lively Image of humane nature, in its Actions, Passions, and traverses of
Fortune: so is the end, namely for the delight and benefit of Mankind. The
Characters and Persons are still the same, <hi>viz.</hi> the greatest of both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>orts,
onely the manner of acquainting us with those Actions, Passions and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
is different. Tragedy performs it <hi>viva voce,</hi> or by action, in Dialogue,
wherein it excels the Epique Poem which does it chiefly by narration, and
therefore is not so lively an Image of Humane Nature. However, the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
betwixt them is such, that if Rhyme be proper for one, it must be for
the other. Verse 'tis true is not the effect of sudden thought; but this
hinders not that sudden thought may be represented in verse, since those
thoughts are such as must be higher then Nature can raise them without
premeditation, especially to a continuance of them even out of verse, and
consequently you cannot imagine them to have been sudden either in the
Poet, or the Actors. A Play, as I have said to be like Nature, is to be
set above it; as Statues which are plac'd on high are made greater then the
life, that they may descend to the sight in their just proportion.</p>
               <p>Perhaps I have insisted too long upon this objection; but the clearing
of it will make my stay shorter on the rest. You tell us <hi>Crites,</hi> that rhyme
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48941:39"/>
appears most unnatural in repartees, or short replyes: when he who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
(it being presum'd he knew not what the other would say, yet) makes
up that part of the verse which was left incompleat, and supplies both the
sound and measure of it. This you say looks rather like the confederacy of
two, then the answer of one.</p>
               <p>This, I confess, is an objection which is in every ones mouth who loves
not rhyme: but suppose, I beseech you, the repartee were made onely in
blank verse, might not part of the same argument be turn'd against you? for
the measure is as often supply'd there as it is in Rhyme. The latter half of
the Hemystich as commonly made up, or a second line subjoyn'd as a
reply to the former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which any one leaf in <hi>Iohnson's</hi> Playes will suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
clear to you. You will often find in the Greek Tragedians, and in
<hi>Seneca,</hi> that when a Scene grows up into the warmth of repartees (which
is the close fighting of it) the latter part of the Trimeter is supply'd by him
who answers; and yet it was never observ'd as a fault in them by any of
the Ancient or Modern Criticks. The case is the same in our verse as it was
in theirs; Rhyme to us being in lieu of quantity to them. But if no lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
is to be allow'd a Poet, you take from him not onely his license of <hi>quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet
audendi,</hi> but you tie him up in a straighter compass then you would
a Philosopher. This is indeed <hi>Musas colere severiores;</hi> You would have
him follow Nature, but he must follow her on foot: you have dismounted
him from his <hi>Pegasus.</hi> But you tell us this supplying the last half of a verse,
or adjoyning a whole second to the former, looks more like the design of two
then the answer of one. Suppose we acknowledge it: how comes this
confederacy to be more displeasing to you then in a Dance which is well
contriv'd? You see there the united design of many persons to make up one
Figure: after they have seperated themselves in many petty divisions, they
rejoyn one by one into a gross: the confederacy is plain amongst them;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48941:39"/>
for chance could never produce any thing so beautiful, and yet there is
nothing in it that shocks your fight. I acknowledg the hand of Art appears
in repartee, as of necessity it must in all kind of verse. But there is also the
quick and poynant brevity of it (which is an high imitation of Nature in
those sudden gusts of passion) to mingle with it: and this joyn'd with the
cadency and sweetness of the Rhyme, leaves nothing in the soul of the
hearer to desire. 'Tis an Art which appears; but it appears onely like
the shadowings of Painture, which being to cause the rounding of it, cannot
be absent, but while that is consider'd they are lost: so while we attend to
the other beauties of the matter, the care and labour of the Rhyme is carry'd
from us, or at least drown'd in its own sweetness, as Bees are sometimes
bury'd in their Honey. When a Poet has found the repartee, the last per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
he can add to it, is to put it into verse. However good the thought
may be; however apt the words in which 'tis couch'd, yet he finds himself
at a little unrest while Rhyme is wanting: he cannot leave it till that comes
naturally, and then is at ease, and sits down contented.</p>
               <p>From Replies, which are the most elevated thoughts of Verse, you pass
to the most mean ones: those which are common with the lowest of houshold
conversation. In these, you say, the Majesty of Verse suffers. You in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in the calling of a servant, or commanding a door to be shut in rhyme.
This, <hi>Crites,</hi> is a good observation of yours, but no argument: for it
proves no more but that such thoughts should be wav'd, as often as may be,
by the address of the Poet. But suppose they are necessary in the places
where he uses them, yet there is no need to put them into rhime. He may
place them in the beginning of a Verse, and break it off, as unfit, when so
debas'd for any other use: or granting the worst, that they require more
room then the Hemystich will allow; yet still there is a ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ice to be made
of the best words, and least vulgar (provided they be apt) to exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ess such
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48941:40"/>
thoughts. Many have blam'd Rhyme in general, for this fault, when the
Poet, with a little care, might have redress'd it. But they do it with no more
justice, then if English Poesie should be made ridiculous for the sake of
the Water Poet's Rhymes. Our language is noble, full and significant; and
I know not why he who is Master of it may not cloath ordinary things in it
as decently as the Latine; if he use the same diligence in his choice of words.
<q>Delectus verborum Origo est Eloquentiae.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was the saying of <hi>Iusius Caesar,</hi> one so curious in his, that none of them
can be chang'd but for a worse. One would think unlock the door was a
thing as vulgar as could be spoken; and yet <hi>Seneca</hi> could make it sound high
and lofty in his Latine.—
<q>Reserate clusos Regii postes Laris.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But I turn from this exception, both because it happens not above twice
or thrice in any Play that those vulgar thoughts are us'd; and then too (were
there no other Apology to be made, yet) the necessity of them (which is
alike in all kind of writing) may excuse them. Besides that the great eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and praecipitation with which they are spoken makes us rather mind the
substance then the dress; that for which they are spoken, rather then what
is spoke. For they are alwayes the effect of some hasty concernment, and
something of consequence depends upon them.</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Crites,</hi> I have endeavour'd to answer your objections; it remains
onely that I should vindicate an Argument for Verse, which you have gone
about to overthrow. It had formerly been said, that the easiness of blank verse,
renders the Poet too luxuriant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that the labour of Rhyme bounds and
circumscribes an over-fruitful fancy, The sence there being commonly
confin'd to the couplet, and the words so order'd that the Rhyme naturally
follows them, not they the Rhyme. To this you answer'd, that it was no
Argument to the question in hand, for the dispute was not which way a man
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48941:40"/>
may write best; but which is most proper for the subject on which he
writes.</p>
               <p>First, give me leave, Sir, to remember you that the Argument against
which you rais'd this objection, was onely secondary: it was built upon
this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that to write in verse was proper for serious Playes. Which
supposition being granted (as it was briefly made out in that discourse, by
showing how verse might be made natural) it asserted, that this way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
was an help to the Poets judgment, by putting bounds to a wilde over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
Fancy. I think therefore it will not be hard for me to make good
what it was to prove: But you add, that were this let pass, yet he who
wants judgment in the liberty of his fancy, may as well show the defect of
it when he is confin'd to verse: for he who has judgment will avoid er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and he who has it not, will commit them in all kinds of writing.</p>
               <p>This Argument, as you have taken it from a most acute person, so I co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it carries much weight in it. But by using the word Judgment here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely,
you seem to have put a fallacy upon us: I grant he who has
Judgment, that is, so profound, so strong, so infallible a judgment, that he
needs no helps to keep it alwayes pois'd and upright, will commit no faults
either in rhyme or out of it. And on the other extream, he who has a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
so weak and craz'd that no helps can correct or amend it, shall write
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>urvily out of Rhyme, and worse in it. But the first of these judgments is
no where to be found, and the latter is not fit to write at all. To speak
therefore of judgment as it is in the best Poets; they who have the greatest
proportion of it, want other helps than from it within. As for example<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
you would be loth to say, that he who was indued with a sound judgment
had no need of History, Geography, or Moral Philosophy, to write cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly.
Judgment is indeed the Master-workman in a Play: but he requires
many subordinate hands, many tools to his assistance. And Verse I affirm
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48941:41"/>
to be one of these: 'Tis a Rule and line by which he keeps his building com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
and even, which otherwise lawless imagination would raise either ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly
or loosly. At least if the Poet commits errours with this help, he
would make greater and more without it: 'tis (in short) a slow and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but the surest kind of working. <hi>Ovid</hi> whom you accuse for luxuriancy
in Verse, had perhaps been farther guilty of it had he writ in Prose. And
for your instance of <hi>Ben. Iohnson,</hi> who you say, writ exactly without the
help of Rhyme; you are to remember 'tis onely an aid to a luxuriant Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
