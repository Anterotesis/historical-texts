            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

known to moſt Great men, that ſeveral Perſons of Quality of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and many more in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> have been Examined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter; whoſe <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> agreed with my <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi> beſides Mrs. <hi>Labodies</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to her Father, concerning the whole Intriegue, being taken and remitted to Their Majeſties, did plainly Demonſtrate the Management of this Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious <hi>Birth:</hi> And it is well known, that the <hi>Queen</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Copies of Madam <hi>Labodies</hi> Letters to be Printed, which the Lord <hi>N.</hi> prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by pretending they were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106797:5"/>In your <hi>Second</hi> Inquiry, you ſay, <hi>You cannot Imagin, that the Late King</hi> James'<hi>s Queen, being ſo diſcreet a Woman, ſhould truſt me, a mere boy, at that time, with matters that ſo nearly concern'd their Intreſt:</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that many knows, that I not only went off with the late <hi>Queen,</hi> at her firſt going for <hi>France,</hi> but I was the firſt by her ſent back into <hi>England,</hi> after her Arrival there, with Letters to King <hi>James,</hi> when he was taken at <hi>Feverſham:</hi> I overtook his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and delivered the Queens Letters to his own Hand, and waited on him to <hi>London,</hi> and back to <hi>Rocheſter</hi> again; from whence <hi>I</hi> was Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatcht

with his Majeſty's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters back to the late Queen in <hi>France</hi> again: How much I was favoured, and truſted by the late King and Queen at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> is generally known to moſt Intelligible Perſons; for whilſt I was there, it was matter of Admiration to moſt about the <hi>Court,</hi> that I had ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Admittance to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties daily in Private,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You ſay, <hi>You admire, that having been under the Cenſure of the Honourable</hi> Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <hi>and Convicted of a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor, I ſhould aſſume ſo much as the leaſt hopes of being Credited:</hi> In anſwer therefore, permit me to tell you, and all the World, That
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106797:6"/>
my Misfortunes before the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> was not the Effects of my <hi>Informations;</hi> for when thoſe were laid before the <hi>Houſe,</hi> it was on the ſame Day that the Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Crones</hi>'s Confeſſions on <hi>Oath,</hi> were read, and Corroborated mine; inſomuch, that the <hi>Houſe</hi> made an humble Addreſs to His Majeſty, to advance my Penſion; which was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done: My <hi>Misfortunes</hi> were occaſioned thro' the Immaturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my Judgment, which was too eaſily Impos'd upon by the perfidiouſneſs of my falſe Friends, viz. <hi>Dalleval</hi> and <hi>Hayes</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned; of which you have a particular Relation in my <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106797:6"/>
Therefore, I now only touch on this point, flinging my ſelf intirely on the Juſtice of any Judicious Member of <hi>Parliament,</hi> (for the Confirmation of what I relate,) that was preſent in the <hi>Houſe,</hi> when my <hi>Informations,</hi> and the others <hi>Confeſſions</hi> were read: And furthermore, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the late horrid <hi>Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy</hi> againſt His Majeſties Sacred Perſon, and the Kingdom in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is juſt the ſame, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by the very ſame Perſons, which I ſo long ſince Diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Therefore, tho' Truth be Oppreſs'd, and ſuffer for a while, the World (I hope) will not be ſo Unjuſt, as to deny me this Oppertunity of Vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

my Integrity; which Juſt Heaven has at Laſt afforded me; as I ſhall ſhortly undeniably prove to the World: 'Tis true, I was convicted, and ſuffered for a Miſdemeanor: But it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for thoſe Gentlemen, <hi>viz.

            <p>I Was born at <hi>Milton,</hi> near <hi>Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingborne,</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> in the Year 1671. My Father's Name was <hi>Robert Fuller,</hi> and my Mothers was

               <hi>Catherine Herbert,</hi> Daughter to the Honourable <hi>Charles Herbert,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Montgomery-ſhire,</hi> in <hi>Wales:</hi> I was Educated ſome time at <hi>Maidstone</hi> and <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by my Father-in-Law; And was afterwards brought to <hi>London</hi> to School, at the Charge of one <hi>Cornelius Harflet,</hi> Gent. But I was, by the Inſtigation of one Sir <hi>John Burrows,</hi> Knight, and a Zealous Roman Catholick, perſwaded to imbrace that Faith; and to that purpoſe the Knight brought me acquainted with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prieſts, particularly one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Emanuel,</hi> belonging to his Excellency the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and Father <hi>Lewis Sabran,</hi> a Jeſuit, Chaplain to the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Powis,</hi> under whoſe Tuition I continued for the ſpace of one whole year; about the end of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106797:11"/>
which, Father <hi>Sabran</hi> had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me for making my Confeſſion, which I did; and ſoon after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Sacrament; but <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bran</hi> not thinking it ſafe to let me continue amongſt <hi>Hereticks,</hi> ſpoke to the <hi>Marchioneſs</hi> of <hi>Powis</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me into her Family, which her Ladiſhip did moſt willingly, ſhe having formerly been well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my Mother: I continued ſome time at the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Powis</hi>'s Houſe, where indeed I was entertained like a Gentleman; and from thence was Recommended to the Earl of <hi>Melfort,</hi> where I was Page to the <hi>Counteſs,</hi> and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, during my Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance there, which was till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (who is now our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106797:12"/>
King) Landed in <hi>England</hi> in the year 1688. At that time the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Melfort,</hi> and others, Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended me to the Late Queen, and was one of thoſe which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her late Majeſty to <hi>Callais;</hi> where I continued two days with her, and from thence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her to <hi>Bullion;</hi> where her Majeſty ſtay'd Eleven days, waiting for the <hi>French</hi> King's Coaches and Guards, for to Conduct her to St. <hi>Germains:</hi> at which time I was Diſpatcht with Letters for the late King; and being young, paſſed freely, without any Interruption; and coming to <hi>England,</hi> found the late King at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> where I delivered my Letters to him, and in a day or two, Returned
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106797:12"/>

And at my Arrival at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> I ſheltered my ſelf by Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing privately, and in diſguiſe, where no notice was taken of me by the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and during my Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I ſeldom failed to wait daily on the Lords, and others in the <hi>Tower;</hi> and particularly on the Earl of <hi>P.</hi>—the Earl of <hi>S.</hi>—the Earl of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlemaine,</hi> the Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> the Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> and the Lord <hi>F.</hi> Sir <hi>John F.</hi>—Sir <hi>Robert H.</hi>—and others; from each of which I often received Letters and Papers, which I carried to Father <hi>Emanuel,</hi> then in the <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſador's</hi> Family; which ſaid Letters the <hi>zealous</hi> Father ſent to <hi>France,</hi> for the late King and Queen, as directed, and I very

often carried Letters to the ſaid Lords, and others, which came from <hi>France;</hi> for being young, the Warders which tended me on the Lords, never queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me ſo much as once, when I went to the late Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <hi>Jefferies,</hi> and to Sir <hi>Edward Hales,</hi> who where kept more ſtrictly; and I often carried Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from theſe Lords to others abroad of the <hi>Cabal,</hi> as is very well known, to the Earl of <hi>F.</hi> the Earl of <hi>L.</hi> the Earl of <hi>A.</hi> the late Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And the <hi>May</hi> following I was diſpatcht for <hi>France</hi> with their Letters, and an account of what they had been doing, in order to prepare Men and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to meet <hi>Dundee</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> as alſo to give the late King a full

Account of what Men they were aſſured of for that purpoſe; with theſe Accounts I took my Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age from <hi>Deal</hi> in an open Boat, with which I was furniſhed by one <hi>Bowles,</hi> Son to <hi>Bowles</hi> a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> of that place; and the ſaid young <hi>Bowles,</hi> with the Maſter of the Boat, whoſe Name was Mr. <hi>Man,</hi> Conveyed me to <hi>Callais;</hi> from whence I went Poſt to Saint <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi> where the late Queen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, by whom I was kindly received; and upon my Arrival the late Queen ſent an Expreſs immediately for <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the late Kings Letters; ſo I continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, and at <hi>Paris,</hi> until the Queen received the late Kings Anſwer to the Letters, which I brought from <hi>England:</hi> And du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my Continuance there, I had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106797:14"/>
the Honour to attend the <hi>French</hi> King, with the Lord <hi>W</hi>—to give him an account of ſome particular Paſſages in <hi>England,</hi> for which I receiv'd a Bountiful Reward: No ſooner was the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs above mentioned come from <hi>Ireland,</hi> but I was ordered to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> again with above thirty of the late King and Queens Letters; with which, by the help of a <hi>French</hi> Privateer, I arrived ſafely near <hi>Foulſton</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and ſo came for <hi>London,</hi> and immediately went to the Lords and Gentlemen in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and elſe where to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my Letters and Meſſages. And afterwards continued about the Town, to ſerve them as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I had done: But it having pleaſed the Almighty God to diſappoint that Party and to

make void their wicked Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and bloody Deſigns, by the Death of the Viſcount <hi>Dundee,</hi> they immediately reſolved on one <hi>Monſ.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106797:15"/>
did ſolemnly affirm to the <hi>French</hi> King, that they had provided ſome Perſons to Aſſaſſinate their preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, and to deſtroy ſuch Noble Men and others of their Majeſties King <hi>William,</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Friends, as they thought would moſt oppoſe the late King, and the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt; In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Accompliſhing this their bloody deſign, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Contributed large ſumms of Money, and more Men were continually privately Raiſed and Liſted for King
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106797:16"/>
               <hi>James;</hi> and Horſes were bought, and Arms provided, with all things neceſſary, and a pretended Declaration of the late Kings was Printed and ſpread abroad, to try how the People ſtood affected: it was compoſed at <hi>Tatnam,</hi> and ſpread abroad by Mr. <hi>Adam Blare,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gray,</hi> and others; but the <hi>Summer</hi> being ſpent, and no Forces from <hi>France</hi> were Landed, either in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> the Lords and Gentlemen began to be uneaſy; ſo that I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht to <hi>France</hi> again, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

the reſt, to carry more Letters for the late King and Queen.</p>
            <p>I arrived at Saint <hi>Germains</hi> again, and delivered my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as formerly; but the Gentlemen in <hi>England</hi> being zealous for a <hi>French</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, furniſhed the late Queen, and the <hi>French</hi> King every day, for a Month to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with Letters by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes from <hi>England;</hi> by which means I was ſent back to <hi>England</hi> again with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the <hi>French</hi> King's Final Reſolution of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to do all that in him
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106797:17"/>
lay to anſwer their requeſts the next <hi>Summer</hi> following; and at that time the Jeſuits, and Prieſts of other Orders, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted great <hi>Sums of mony,</hi> for K <hi>James</hi>'s uſe; and for their ſo doing, he gave them aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances under his Hand and Broad Seal, dated in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for ſeveral great Eſtates in <hi>England,</hi> which were formerly belonging to their ſeveral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; which ſaid Eſtates the Prieſts were to Poſſeſs at the late King's being Eſtabliſhed on his Throne again. Thus was much Mony raiſed, and the <hi>French</hi> King at that time

cauſed five thouſand Piſtols to be paid to Collonel <hi>Parker,</hi> who undertook to provide perſons to aſſiſt him in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinating his moſt Sacred Majeſty K. <hi>William,</hi> before he went for <hi>Ireland;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King having given great Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances to K. <hi>James</hi>'s friends in <hi>England,</hi> both the Papiſts and pretended Proteſtants of that party, reſolved to mix their Hands equally in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of their Country Mens Blood; and they made ſolemn Covenants amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to loſe their Lives, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, Laws aud Liberties, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

than continue under the Preſent Government; the Prieſts and others in <hi>England</hi> provided for this purpoſe, did daily by their Inſtigations, draw men of deſperate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to their party; and for want of Prieſts, and other Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to ingage more Fools to them, they were forced to make uſe of the Common Whores of this <hi>Town,</hi> who added daily alſo to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: And it was affirmed to the late King and Queen, that they were his beſt Agents in <hi>London.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:106797:18"/>But, to return: I being unwilling thus to ſee my Country ruin'd with the Effuſion of ſo much <hi>Engliſh Blood,</hi> as was moſt treacherouſly and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to be ſpilt, I reſolv'd to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate their Deſigns to the uttermoſt of my Power; and to this end I had long been perſwaded by ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of note, by whom I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Syd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;</hi> by whom I was kindly received, after they had ſeen my Letters and Papers, which I had from the Chief of the late King's Party. In a word, I gave the <hi>King,</hi> by thoſe <hi>worthy Lords</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mention'd, a full and very plain Account of all the Deſigns of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and ſoon after, I yet continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Correſpondence with the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites</hi> as formerly, was deſir'd by them to go for <hi>France</hi> again with their Letters; of which I acquainted the King, and was encourag'd by His
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106797:19"/>
Majeſty to go; and accordingly had a Paſs from the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> privately; and then, in order to my Journey, I receiv'd Letters from the Earl of <hi>S</hi>—, the Earl of <hi>P</hi>—, the Earl of <hi>L</hi>—, the Earl of <hi>H</hi>—, the Earl of <hi>F</hi>—, the Earl of <hi>C</hi>—, the Lord <hi>D</hi>—, the Lord <hi>M</hi>—, the Earl of <hi>A</hi>—, the Earl of <hi>D</hi>—, the Lord <hi>P</hi>—, the Lord <hi>G</hi>—, and from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Lords and Gentlemen, for the late King and Queen, with a Liſt of the Men that were liſted in <hi>England</hi> for their Service: All which I ſhew'd to the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Sydney,</hi> before I went for <hi>France;</hi> and then I ſet forth for St. <hi>Germain</hi>'s, to the late Queen: I was as kindly received as formerly, and continued there near four Months; during which, I gave the Lord <hi>Sydney</hi> an account Weekly of what was doing in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And this I did by directing my Letters to a Gentleman in <hi>London,</hi> who
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106797:19"/>
lived under the notion of a great and zealous Friend of the late King's, to whom I directed my Letters, by the late Queen's Permiſſion.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> Mr. <hi>Crone</hi> arrived at that place, and being a Stranger at that Court, was conducted to the Queen by myſelf; and <hi>Crone</hi> being then come from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> came to <hi>France</hi> through <hi>England,</hi> from whence he brought many Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from Perſons of Note, to whom he carried Letters from King <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> but the matter then in diſpute was to be decided by the French King; which was the chief occaſion of <hi>Crone</hi>'s coming to that Court. The late Queen order'd me to aſſiſt him in getting him good Lodging, and I lodged him within my own Lodgings, by which means we grew intimately acquainted; and at this time I was more intruſted by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106797:20"/>
the late Queen than ever, and was often with her two or three hours together in private about Buſineſs; and I often waited on the French King, and Monſieur <hi>Louie,</hi> from the late Queen; which, by reaſon of my Youth, rais'd a great Admiration amongſt moſt about the Queen, that ſo young a Head ſhould be truſted in matters of ſo high a concern. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd many and large Gratifications from both the French-King, and the late Queen; and at the end of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> 169 0 / 1, upon a <hi>Sunday,</hi> the Queen order'd me to attend her, after her Supper, and Mr. <hi>Crone</hi> was to do the ſame; which we did, and as ſoon as the Company was gone from Court, I was ſent for into her Majeſties Cloſet, where ſhe told me, I muſt go with <hi>Crone</hi> the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for <hi>England;</hi> and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, the Queen gave me many Letters for her <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:106797:20"/>
and other Papers made up in the Pipe of <hi>Keys;</hi> and many others writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by ſtrange Deviſes: The Queen gave me Commiſſions to bring with me Collonels of Horſe, and Foot Regiments, which were all ready, and to be privately raiſed in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. Crone</hi> was ſent for into her Majeſties Cloſet, and received many Papers and Letters to bring alſo; and the Queen gave him a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion under King <hi>James</hi>'s Broad Seal, which was to impower ſome Lords in <hi>England</hi> to act in all caſes for him, as if he were here preſent. We continued with the Queen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Four a Clock in the Morning, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her Majeſties Directions how to order our Affairs, and how to encourage the late King's Friends in <hi>England,</hi> by giving them a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Account of what Ships the French King would have at Sea the Summer following, and at what time
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106797:21"/>
he intended to land his Forces in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> as alſo the number of them.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Day appear'd, we began our Journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> from whence we took Poſt, and came to <hi>Calais,</hi> where the Governour furniſh'd us with a Privateer, which landed us in <hi>Romney-Marſh,</hi> near <hi>Lid</hi> in <hi>Kent;</hi> from which place we began our Journey to <hi>London. Crone</hi> came by <hi>Tenterden,</hi> and I by <hi>Canterbury,</hi> we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a place of meeting, which was at Madam <hi>Clifford</hi>'s, a zealous <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholick,</hi> in <hi>Golden Square.</hi> I made haſte to <hi>London;</hi> and, at my arrival, went to wait on the Lord <hi>Sydney,</hi> and was conducted to the King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd all the late King and Queen's Letters and Papers to His Majeſty, with a full Account of all his Enemies Deſigns; which happen'd according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for, at the time I then inform'd King <hi>William</hi> of the French Fleet's coming on the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106797:21"/>
they did come; and the number of their Ships was according to my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and all the reſt of their Deſigns; which, as is known, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted His Majeſty firſt of, five months before theſe bloody Deſigns were to be accompliſh'd.</p>
            <p>But, to return: As ſoon as I had given the King the afore-mention'd Letters, Papers, and Informations, Reſolutions were taken for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending <hi>Crone,</hi> which I manag'd and accompliſh'd thus: I went to meet <hi>Crone</hi> at his Lodging, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in Bed, we moſt lovingly ſaluted one-another; I deſiring <hi>Crone</hi> to meet me that Night, with ſome Gentlemen, he conſented, and the Place appointed for our meeting was the <hi>Bull-head Tavern</hi> in <hi>Wood-ſtreet,</hi> at Six a Clock; at which time I, with Major <hi>Kitchill,</hi> and Mr. <hi>C. Harflet,</hi> went to the ſaid Tavern, where <hi>Crone</hi> came to us. I had provided a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106797:22"/>
in the Houſe, with a Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and had the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi>'s Warrant againſt <hi>Crone;</hi> but the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger was not to execute his Office until <hi>Crone</hi> had diſcover'd his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs fully to Major <hi>Kitchill</hi> and Mr. <hi>Harflet;</hi> which he did, I having told him, <hi>That they were great Friends of King</hi> James's, <hi>and would disburſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for his Service.</hi> However, <hi>Crone</hi> thought himſelf not ſafe enough in that Houſe; therefore we concluded to go to the <hi>Ship Tavern</hi> in <hi>Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church-ſtreet,</hi> whither we went in a Coach, I taking an Opportunity to ſpeak to the Meſſenger to follow us thither; which was perform'd; and coming to the <hi>Ship-Tavern,</hi> I and <hi>Crone,</hi> with the other two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, went up two pair of Stairs, into a large Room, where <hi>Crone</hi> thought himſelf ſafe, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſcourſe freely, and to drink King <hi>James</hi>'s, and the late Queen's,

But, during the time that he lay in <hi>Newgate</hi> under the Sentence of Death, I, by the

King's Command, went for <hi>Ireland,</hi> preſently after the Fight of the <hi>Boyn,</hi> and waited firſt on the King there at <hi>Chapel Lizard,</hi> near <hi>Dublin;</hi> and from thence I waited on His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to the Siege of <hi>Limerick</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Waterford,</hi> where His Majeſty imbarked for <hi>England;</hi> after which I waited on the Lord <hi>Sydney</hi> to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
