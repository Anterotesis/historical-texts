         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All ceremonies being finished, she was ledde betw√©ene two, not

rudely lay with her, and spoild her of a maiden head in spite of her

diuination true, she was a wife, yet continued a maide: he was a
husband and a widdower, yet neuer knew his wife: she was his

(if at least coblers can be honest, that liue altogether amongest
wicked soales) had a wife, who in the time of health treading her
shooe often away, determined in the agony of a sicknesse (which
this yeare had a saying to her) to fall to mending aswell as her

<hi>Chorus</hi> to the tragedy ensuing) stepping out first, wringing
her handes (which gaue the better action) sh√©e told the pittifull
<hi>Actaeon</hi> her husband, that she had often done him wrong: hee
onely shooke his head at this, and cried humh! Which humh, she
taking as the watch-word of his true patience, vnraueld the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome

these blots in his tables, yet the bearing of one man false (whom
she had not yet discouered) stucke more in her stomacke than all
the rest, O valiant Cobler, cries out one of the Auditors, how
art thou set vpon? how are thou tempted? happy arte thou, that

and so do all thy neighbours here (thy wifes ghostly fathers) s√©e
that a small matter would now cause th√©e turne turk, &amp; to meddle
with no more patches: but to liue within the compasse of thy wit:
lift not vp thy collar: be not horne mad: thanke heauen that the
murther is reueald: study thou <hi>Baltazars</hi> Part in <hi>Ieronimo,</hi> for

            <p>Well, I s√©e thou art worthy to haue patient <hi>Griseld</hi> to thy
wife, for thou bearest more than she: thou shewst thy selfe to be a
right cobler, and no sowter, that canst thus cleanely clowt vp the
seam-rent sides of thy affection. With this learned Oration the
Cobler was tutord: layd his singer on his mouth, and cried <hi>pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos

but that he shall liue to giue more Coblers heads the Bastinado.
And told, that on such a night when he supt there (for a Lord may

            <p>This was the creame of her confusion, which being skimd

Oh lamentable! neuer did the olde buskind tragedy beginne till

But the matter was tooke vp in a Tauerne; the case was altered,
and brought to a new reckoning (mary the blood of the <hi>Burdeaux</hi>
grape was first shead about it) but in the end, all anger on euery
side was powred into a pottle pot, &amp; there burnt to death. Now
whether this Recantation was true, or whether the st√©eme of
infection, fuming vp (like wine) into her braines, made her talke
thus idlely, I leaue it to the Iury.</p>
            <p>And whilst they are canuasing her case, let vs s√©e what dooings

too honest to break into such cellers. Besides those that were left

came r√©eling out of an ale-house, in the shape of a drunkard, who
no sooner smelt the winde, but he thought the ground vnder him
danced the Canaries: houses s√©emed to turne on the toe, and all
things went round: insomuch, that his legges drew a paire or
Indentures, betw√©ene his body and the earth, the principal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
being, that he for his part would stand to nothing what
euer he saw: euery tr√©e that came in his way, did he iustle, and
yet chalenge it the next day to fight with him. If he had clipt but
a quarter so much of the Kings siluer, as he did of the kings eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
his carkas had long ere this bene carrion for Crowes. But,
he liued by gaming, and had excellent casting, yet seldome won,
for he drew reasonable good hands, but had very bad feete, that
were not able to carry it away. This setter vp of Malt-men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
troubled with the staggers, fell into the selfe-same graue, that
stood gaping wide open for a breakfast next morning, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

and that all his bedfellowes (as they were ind√©ede) were in their
dead sl√©epe, he, (neuer complaining of colde, nor calling for more
sh√©ete) soundly takes a nap til he snores again: In the morning
the Sexton comes plodding along, and casting vpon his fingers
ends what he hopes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead pay of that day will come too, by that

that which he receiued the day before, (for Sextons now had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

contemplation, shrugging his shoulders together, he steppes
ere he be aware on the brimmes of that pit, into which this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper

bones, and a scull or two, that laie scattered here and there; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

flinges them in: one of the sculls battered the sconce of the sl√©eper,
whilst the bones plaide with his nose; whose blowes waking
his mustie worship, the first word that he cast vp, was an oath,
and thinking the Cannes had flyen about, cryed zoundes, what
do you meane to cracke my mazer? the Sexton smelling a voice,
(feare being stronger than his heart) bel√©eued verily some of the
coarses spake to him, vpon which, f√©eling himselfe in a cold sweat,

            <p>This excellent egregious Tinker calls for his draught (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his nose, the lamentable tale of the Londoner was tolde, the
Chamber-doore (where h√©e lay) being thrust open with a long
pole, because none durst touch it with their hands) and the
Tinker bidden (if he had the heart) to goe in and s√©e if h√©e knew
him. The Tinker being not to learne what vertue the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine

temptation to a Tinker; many a hole might he stop, before h√©e
could picke a crowne of it, yet being a subtill Tinker (&amp; to make
all Sextons pray for him, because h√©e would raise their f√©es) an
Angell he wanted to be his guide, and vnder ten shillings (by his
ten bones) he would not put his finger into the fire. The whole
parish had warning of this presently, thirtie shillings was saued
by the bargaine, and the Towne like to be saued too, therefore
ten shillings was leuyed out of hand, put into a rag, which was

one hand receiued the money, and with the other struck the boord,
crying hey, a fresh double pot. Which armor of proofe being fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his body, vp he hoists the Londoner on his backe (like a
Shoole-boy) a Shouell and Pick-axe standing ready for him:
And thus furnished, into a field some good distance from the
Towne he beares his deadly loade, and there throwes it downe,
falling roundly to his tooles, vpon which the strong b√©ere hauing
set an egde, they quickely cut out a lodging in the earth for the
Citizen. But the Tinker knowing that wormes n√©eded no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
sauing onely sh√©etes, stript him starke naked, but first
diu'de nimbly into his pocket, to see what liuings they had, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
himselfe, that a Londoner would not wander so farre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
siluer: his hopes were of the right stampe, for from out of his
pockets he drew a leatherne bagge with seuen pounds in it: this
musicke made the Tinkers heart dance, he quickely tumbled his
man into the graue, hid him ouer head and eares in dust, bound
vp his cloathes in a bundle, &amp; carying that at the end of his staffe
on his shoulder, with the purse of seuen pounds in his hand,
backe againe comes he through the towne, crying aloud, Haue y√©e
any more Londoners to bury, hey downe a downe dery, haue ye
any more Londoners to bury: the Hobbinolls running away
from him, as if he had b√©ene the dead Citizens ghost, &amp; he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

in his mouth.</p>
            <p>You see therefore how dreadfull a fellow Death is, making

fooles euen of wisemen, and cowards of the most valiant; yea, in

after this life, and that (like beasts) their soules shall perish with
their bodyes. How many vpon sight onely of a Letter (sent from
<hi>London)</hi> haue started backe, and durst haue layd their saluation
vpon it, that the plague might be folded in that empty paper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing
verily, that the arme of Omnipotence could neuer reach

            <p>More ventrous than these block-heads was a certaine Iustice

Iustice himselfe, who at last appeard in his likenesse aboue at a
window, inquiring why they summond a parl√©e. It was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
why: the case was opened to his examining wisedome, and
that the euill doers were onely Londoners: at the name of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners,
the Iustice clapping his hand on his brest (as who should
say, Lord haue mercie vpon vs) started backe, and being wise
enough to saue one, held his nose hard betw√©ene his fore-finger

the very name of Londoners being worse then ten whetstones to
sharpen the sword of Iustice against them.</p>

I could fill a large volume, and call it the second part of the

the Iustice, but <hi>Dij meliora,</hi> I haue better matters to set my wits
about: neither shall you wring out of my pen (though you lay it
on the rack) the villanies of that damnd K√©eper, who kild all she

Iayle, and the holes of both Counters, for a number lye there,
that wish to be rid out of this motley world, sh√©e would haue
tickled them, and turned them ouer the thumbs. I will likewise
let the Church-warden in Thames str√©ete sl√©epe (for h√©es now
