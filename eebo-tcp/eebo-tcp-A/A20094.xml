         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

more state into a Church, where they no sooner appeared, but
the Priest fell to his busines, the holy knot was a tying, but
he that should fasten it, comming to this, <hi>In sickenesse and in
health,</hi> there he stopt, for sodainly the bride tooke holde of, <hi>in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
for <hi>in health</hi> all that stoode by were in feare shee should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be kept. The maiden-blush into which her chéekes were
lately died, now beganne to loose colour: h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r voyce (like a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward)
would haue shrunke away, but that her Louer reaching
her a hand, which he brought thither to giue her, (for hée was
not yet made a full husband) did with that touch somewhat
reuiue her: on went they againe so farre, till they mette with
<hi>For better, for worse,</hi> there was she worse than before, and had
not the holy Officer made haste, the ground on which shée stood
to be marryed might easily haue béene broken vp for her buryall.
All ceremonies being finished, she was ledde betwéene two, not
like a Bride, but rather like a Coarse, to her bed: <hi>That;</hi> must now
be the table, on which the wedding dinner is to be serued vppe
(being at this time, nothing but teares, and sighes, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation)
and Death is chiefe waiter, yet at lenght her weake
heart wrastling with the pangs, gaue them a fall, so that vp shée
stoode againe, and in the fatall funerall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Coach that carried her
forth, was she brought back (as vpon a béere) to the Citie: but
sée the malice of her enemy that had her in chase, vpon the wens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
following being ouertaken, was her life ouercome, Death
rudely lay with her, and spoild her of a maiden head in spite of her
husband. Oh the sorrow that did round beset him! now was his
diuination true, she was a wife, yet continued a maide: he was a
husband and a widdower, yet neuer knew his wife: she was his
owne, yet he had her not: she had him, yet neuer enioyed him:
héere is a strange alteration, for the rosemary that was washt in
swéete water to set out the Bridall, is now wet in teares to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
her buriall: the musike that was heard to sound forth dances,
can not now he heard for the ringing of belles: all the comfort
<pb facs="tcp:5559:19"/>
that happened to either side being this, that he lost her, before she
had time to be an ill wife, and she left him, ere he was able to be
a bad husband.</p>
            <p>Better fortune had this Bride, to fall into the handes of the
Plague, then one other of that fraile female sex, (whose picture
is next to be drawne) had so scape out of them. An honest cobler
(if at least coblers can be honest, that liue altogether amongest
wicked soales) had a wife, who in the time of health treading her
shooe often away, determined in the agony of a sicknesse (which
this yeare had a saying to her) to fall to mending aswell as her
husband did. The bed that she lay vpon (being as she thought
or rather feared) the last bed that euer should beare her, (for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other beds had bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

of sinne tickling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her conscience, vp she calls her very innocent
and simple husband out of his vertuous shoppe, where like Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
he sat distributing amongst the poore, to some, halfe-penny
peeces, penny péeces to some, and two-penny peeces to others,
so long as they would last, his prouident care being alway, that
euery man and woman should goe vpright. To the beds side of
his plaguy wire approacheth Monsieur Cobler, to vnderstand
what deadly newes she had to tell him, and the rest of his kinde
neighbours that there were assembled: such thicke teares stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in both the gutters of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, to sée his beloued lie in such a
pickle, that in their salt water, all his vtterance was drownd:
which she perceiuing, wept as fast as he: But by the warme
counsell that sat about the bed, the shower ceast, she wiping her
chéekes with the corner of one of the shéetes: and he, his sullie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

face, with his leatherne apron. At last, two or thrée sighes (like a
<hi>Chorus</hi> to the tragedy ensuing) stepping out first, wringing
her handes (which gaue the better action) shée told the pittifull
<hi>Actaeon</hi> her husband, that she had often done him wrong: hee
onely shooke his head at this, and cried humh! Which humh, she
taking as the watch-word of his true patience, vnraueld the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of her frailetie at length, and concluded, that with such a
man (and named him, but I hope you would not haue me follow
her steppes and name him too) she practised the vniuersall &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Art of grafting, and that vpon her good mans head, they
<pb facs="tcp:5559:20"/>
two had planted a monstrous paire of inuisible hornes: At the
sound of the hornes, my cobler started vppe like a march Hare,
and began to looke wilde: his awle neuer ranne through the sides
of a boote, as that word did through his heart: but being a polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
cobler, and remembring what péece of worke he was to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-lay,
stroking his beard, like some graue headborough of the
Parish, and giuing a nodde, as who should say, goe on, bade her
goe on indéed, clapping to her sore soule, this generall salue, that
<hi>All are sinnes, and we must forgiue, &amp;c.</hi> For hée hoped by such
wholesome Phisicke, (as Shooemakers waxe being laide to a
byle) to draw out all the corruption of her secret villanies. She
good heart being tickled vnder gilles, with the finger of these
kind spéeches, turnes vp the white of her eye, and fetches out an
other. An other, O thou that art trained vp in nothing but to
handle péeces:) Another hath discharged his Artillery against

with the iuice of patience, which (by vertue of the blackish
sweate that stoode reaking on his browes, and had made them
supple) entred very easily into his now-parlous-vnderstanding
scull: so that he left wenching, and sate quiet as a Lamb, falling
to his old vomite of councell, which he had cast vp before, and
swearing (because he was in strong hope, this shoo should wring
him no more) to seale her a generall acquittance, prick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with this gentle spur, her tongue mends his pace, so that in her

night on the Coblers laast, bestowing vppon him the poe sie of
their names, the time, and place, to thin tent it might be put in
to his next wifes wedding ring. And although shée had made all
these blots in his tables, yet the bearing of one man false (whom
she had not yet discouered) stucke more in her stomacke than all
the rest, O valiant Cobler, cries out one of the Auditors, how
art thou set vpon? how are thou tempted? happy arte thou, that
thou art not in thy shop, for in stead of cutting out péeces of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
thou wouldst doubtlesse now pare away thy hart: for I sée,
<pb facs="tcp:5559:20"/>
and so do all thy neighbours here (thy wifes ghostly fathers) sée
that a small matter would now cause thée turne turk, &amp; to meddle
with no more patches: but to liue within the compasse of thy wit:
lift not vp thy collar: be not horne mad: thanke heauen that the
murther is reueald: study thou <hi>Baltazars</hi> Part in <hi>Ieronimo,</hi> for
thou hast more cause (though lesse reason) than he, to be glad and
sad.</p>
            <p>Well, I sée thou art worthy to haue patient <hi>Griseld</hi> to thy
wife, for thou bearest more than she: thou shewst thy selfe to be a
right cobler, and no sowter, that canst thus cleanely clowt vp the
seam-rent sides of thy affection. With this learned Oration the
Cobler was tutord: layd his singer on his mouth, and cried <hi>pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos
palabros:</hi> he had sealed her pardon, and therefore bid her not
feare: héervpon he named the malefactor, I could name him too,
but that he shall liue to giue more Coblers heads the Bastinado.
And told, that on such a night when he supt there (for a Lord may
sup with a clobler, that hath a pretty wench to his wife) when
the cloth, O treachero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had for a parting blow, giuen the other his fist: downe she lights

of the wicket, but conu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of old shooes and leather) from whence the vnicorne cobler (that

snorting giuing the signe that he was cock-sure, softly out-steales
sir <hi>Paris,</hi> and to <hi>Helenaes</hi> téeth prooued himselfe a true Troian.</p>
            <p>This was the creame of her confusion, which being skimd
off from the stomach of her conscience, we looked euery minute
to goe thither, where we should be farre enough out of the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers

               </gap>d,
Oh lamentable! neuer did the olde buskind tragedy beginne till
now: for the wiues of those husbands, with whom she had playd
at fast and loose, came with nayles sharpened for the nonce, like
cattes, and tongues forkedly cut like the stings of adders, fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st to

worry her to dath with scolding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5559:21"/>
But the matter was tooke vp in a Tauerne; the case was altered,
and brought to a new reckoning (mary the blood of the <hi>Burdeaux</hi>
grape was first shead about it) but in the end, all anger on euery
side was powred into a pottle pot, &amp; there burnt to death. Now
whether this Recantation was true, or whether the stéeme of
infection, fuming vp (like wine) into her braines, made her talke
thus idlely, I leaue it to the Iury.</p>
            <p>And whilst they are canuasing her case, let vs sée what dooings
the Sexton of <hi>Stepney</hi> hath: whose ware-houses being all full of
dead commodities, sauing one: that one hée left open a whole
night (yet was it halfe full too) knowing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> théeues this yeare were
too honest to break into such cellers. Besides those that were left
there, had such plaguy pates, that none durst meddle with them
for their liues. About twelue of the clock at midnight, when spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
walke, and not a mowse dare stirre, because cattes goe a
catter-walling: Sinne, that all day durst not shew his head,
came réeling out of an ale-house, in the shape of a drunkard, who
no sooner smelt the winde, but he thought the ground vnder him
danced the Canaries: houses séemed to turne on the toe, and all
things went round: insomuch, that his legges drew a paire or
Indentures, betwéene his body and the earth, the principal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
being, that he for his part would stand to nothing what
euer he saw: euery trée that came in his way, did he iustle, and
yet chalenge it the next day to fight with him. If he had clipt but
a quarter so much of the Kings siluer, as he did of the kings eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
his carkas had long ere this bene carrion for Crowes. But,
he liued by gaming, and had excellent casting, yet seldome won,
for he drew reasonable good hands, but had very bad feete, that
were not able to carry it away. This setter vp of Malt-men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
troubled with the staggers, fell into the selfe-same graue, that
stood gaping wide open for a breakfast next morning, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
(when he was in) that he had stumbled into his owne house,
and that all his bedfellowes (as they were indéede) were in their
dead sléepe, he, (neuer complaining of colde, nor calling for more
shéete) soundly takes a nap til he snores again: In the morning
the Sexton comes plodding along, and casting vpon his fingers
ends what he hopes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead pay of that day will come too, by that
<pb facs="tcp:5559:21"/>
that which he receiued the day before, (for Sextons now had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doings than either Tauernes or bawdy-houses) In that sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
contemplation, shrugging his shoulders together, he steppes
ere he be aware on the brimmes of that pit, into which this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper
of <hi>Bacchus</hi> was falne, where finding some dead mens
bones, and a scull or two, that laie scattered here and there; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he lookt into this Coffer of wormes, those he takes vp, and
flinges them in: one of the sculls battered the sconce of the sléeper,
whilst the bones plaide with his nose; whose blowes waking
his mustie worship, the first word that he cast vp, was an oath,
and thinking the Cannes had flyen about, cryed zoundes, what
do you meane to cracke my mazer? the Sexton smelling a voice,
(feare being stronger than his heart) beléeued verily some of the
coarses spake to him, vpon which, féeling himselfe in a cold sweat,
tooke his héeles, whilst the Goblin scram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him: But it appeares the Sexton had the lighter foote, for he ran
so fast, that hee ranne out of his wittes, which being left behinde
him, he had like to haue dyed presently after.</p>
            <p>A meryer bargaine than the poore Sextons did a Tincker
méete withall in a Countrey Towne; through which a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen

(without any resistance of the Barbarians, that all this yeare v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

in. The Host had bene a mad Greeke, (mary he could now speake
nothing but English,) a goodly fat Burger he was, with a belly
Arching out like a Béere-barrell, which made his legges (that
were thicke &amp; short, like two piles driuen vnder <hi>London</hi>-bridge)
to stradle halfe as wide as the toppe of Powles, which vpon my
knowledge hath bene burnt twice or thrice. A leatherne pouch
hung at his side, that opened and shut with a Snap-hance, and
was indéed a flaske for gun-powder when King <hi>Henry</hi> went to

which glistered so oriently, that the Hamburgers offered I

he was an Host to be ledde before an Emperour, and though

the chiefe Leader dropt at his féete, and imagining at first hée
was but wounded a little in the head, held vp his gowty golles
and blest himselfe, that a Londoner (who had wont to be the most

My gorbelly Host, that in many a yeare could not without grun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
crawle ouer a threshold but two foote broad, leapt halfe a
yarde from the coarse (It was measured by a Carpenters rule)
as nimbly as if his guts had béene taken out by the hangman:
out of the house he wallowed presently, being followed with
two or thrée dozen of napkins to drie vp the larde, that ranne
so fast downe his héeles, that all the way he went, was more
greazie than a kitchin-stuffe-wifes basket: you would haue

to set fire on his house, before the Plague scape out of it, least

Tinker bidden (if he had the heart) to goe in and sée if hée knew

all Sextons pray for him, because hée would raise their fées) an
Angell he wanted to be his guide, and vnder ten shillings (by his
ten bones) he would not put his finger into the fire. The whole
parish had warning of this presently, thirtie shillings was saued
by the bargaine, and the Towne like to be saued too, therefore
ten shillings was leuyed out of hand, put into a rag, which was

crying hey, a fresh double pot. Which armor of proofe being fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his body, vp he hoists the Londoner on his backe (like a
Shoole-boy) a Shouell and Pick-axe standing ready for him:
And thus furnished, into a field some good distance from the
Towne he beares his deadly loade, and there throwes it downe,
falling roundly to his tooles, vpon which the strong béere hauing
set an egde, they quickely cut out a lodging in the earth for the
Citizen. But the Tinker knowing that wormes néeded no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,

diu'de nimbly into his pocket, to see what liuings they had, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
himselfe, that a Londoner would not wander so farre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
siluer: his hopes were of the right stampe, for from out of his
pockets he drew a leatherne bagge with seuen pounds in it: this
musicke made the Tinkers heart dance, he quickely tumbled his
man into the graue, hid him ouer head and eares in dust, bound
vp his cloathes in a bundle, &amp; carying that at the end of his staffe
on his shoulder, with the purse of seuen pounds in his hand,
backe againe comes he through the towne, crying aloud, Haue yée
any more Londoners to bury, hey downe a downe dery, haue ye
any more Londoners to bury: the Hobbinolls running away

why: the case was opened to his examining wisedome, and
that the euill doers were onely Londoners: at the name of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners,
the Iustice clapping his hand on his brest (as who should

enough to saue one, held his nose hard betwéene his fore-finger
