            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A Military Employment, when it is undertaken with a good intention, begun and carried on for honeſt ends and purpoſes, hath been generally thought not only lawful and barely inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, but highly uſeful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable likewiſe. And ſince the common Safety of <hi>Europe,</hi> as well as the neceſſary Defence and Preſervation of that Church and Nation to which you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42943:4"/>
is the Cauſe for which you are now engaged; you will not ſo much want a Caſuiſt to ſtate the Lawfulneſs of your Profeſſion, as you ſeem to ſtand in need of ſome Chriſtian Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to put you in mind how you ought to behave your ſelves in it.</p>
            <p>The Calling of a Soldier is doubtleſs very well conſiſtent with that of a Chriſtian; and altho the Armour which the Goſpel recommends, is of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual nature, and ſuch as we are all required to put on and employ in our Defence againſt our Spiritual Enemies; yet we no where find, that either our Bleſſed Saviour, or any of his Apoſtles, did ever condemn the uſe of Secular Arms and Carnal Weapons as abſolutely unlawful. Nor indeed can it be reaſonably
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42943:4"/>
imagined, but that Chriſtians as well as other men may be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently allowed to provide the beſt they can both for their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal and for the Publick Safety.</p>
            <p>The truth is, that which hath brought ſo ill an opinion upon a Military Profeſſion, is the looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Manners, and Unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Converſation of too many of thoſe who are employ'd in it: And 'tis the ſcandalous Example of ſome amongſt you, which hath brought ſo ill a report up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Character of a Soldier in the general. For the undiſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of mankind (which is generally the greateſt part of it) is too apt to judge of a Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the Lives and Converſations of its Profeſſors. And becauſe they obſerve ſo much Impiety and Injuſtice, ſo much Prophaneneſs and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42943:5"/>
in the Behaviour of ſome Soldiers, they are from thence unhappily prejudiced with an ill opinion of All.</p>
            <p>Now the beſt and only way to vindicate the Credit and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Military Life, from all Prejudices of this kind, is to remove that unhappy occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from whence they proceed; and if inſtead of diſtinguiſhing your ſelves from the reſt of mankind by your Vices, you would be more careful to behave your ſelves as becometh Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; if inſtead of Blaſpheming God with ſo many horrid Oaths and Curſes, you would learn to Reverence and Adore him, and <hi>aſcribe him the honour due unto his Name;</hi> if inſtead of that Riot and Intemperance, that Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Uncharitableneſs which ſo much abounds amongſt you,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42943:5"/>
you would be more mindful of thoſe preſſing Obligations which your Religion teacheth you, of <hi>denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and of living ſoberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and godly in this preſent world;</hi> your Profeſſion would then be entertained with much more Reſpect in the world: The Character of a Soldier would then appear in its true Luſtre, and be as highly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt men, as it is indeed moſt deſervedly Honourable in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Character which St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives of <hi>Cornelius, (Acts</hi> 10.) is a Pattern very worthy your imitation upon this account; and this out of a ſincere intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Good of your Souls, for the Honour of your Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and for the happy Succeſs of your Arms, I heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42943:6"/>
to be tranſcribed by you.</p>
            <p>He was a <hi>Roman</hi> Soldier; and altho by Birth and Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Heathen</hi> Idolater, yet being happily poſted amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> he there attained to the knowledge of the True God, and afterwards became a moſt eminent Convert to the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Faith: From whence 'tis ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to imagine how profitably he employed his vacant hours, and what great advantage he made of the Place and the Perſons amongſt whom he convers'd: for although we have no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account given us of his behaviour, till the time of his Converſion; yet 'tis highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that he never ſpent his time idly and unprofitably, or (what is much worſe), pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely and irreligiouſly; but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42943:6"/>
that he was always meditating upon, and conſidering his latter end; and carefully projecting with himſelf, how he might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an Intereſt in the Favour and Protection of that God, in whom are the Iſſues of Life and Death, and before whoſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tribunal he was to give a ſolemn and ſevere Account. He wiſely conſider'd how hazardous and uncertain the Life of a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is, above all other men; and this Conſideration natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led his thoughts to a nearer Proſpect of a Future State. He well knew, That it was <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all men once to dye;</hi> and that to dare to dye with a more than ordinary Courage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, was what became the Bravery of a Good Soldier; but becauſe after this life ended, there was a Judgment to come, <hi>when
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42943:7"/>
every one that hath done good, ſhall go into life everlaſting, and every one that hath done evil, into everlaſting Fire;</hi> he thought the conſideration hereof a matter of the higheſt importance to him imaginable; and was eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd how much he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not only in point of Duty, but in point of Wiſdom and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt likewiſe, to make the beſt proviſion he could for a happy Portion in this his Immortal and Eternal State.</p>
            <p>How diſcreetly he behaved himſelf, and what prudent care he took of his life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in order hereunto, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the account which the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> gives of him, who ſays, that he was <hi>a devout man, one that feared God, and prayed unto him continually.</hi> He did not, it ſeems, ſuppoſe, that his Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42943:7"/>
Employment for the ſervice of his Prince, could give him any the leaſt diſpenſation from his Duty to his God. He did not think, that to Curſe, and Swear, and Blaſpheme, and blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter out his prophane and daring Impieties againſt the Supreme Judge of Heaven and Earth, was one neceſſary Qualification of his Profeſſion: No; 'tis plain that he believed the Character of a Religious and Devout man, was very well reconcilable with that of a Good Soldier: And he hath left theſe as <hi>Maxims</hi> of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Truth, to be tranſcribed from his Example, That the beſt Courage doth always proceed from the beſt Conſcience: And that no man is ſo well qualified to appear Fearleſs and Undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the face of an Enemy, as he who walketh in the Fear of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42943:8"/>
the Lord, and repoſeth his ſtrength and confidence in the God of his Salvation.</p>
            <p>Fear indeed at firſt hearing, may ſeem a very odd ingredient in the Character of a good Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; but ſuch a Fear as this of <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s was, is ſo far from carrying in it any the leaſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Cowardice, or Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit, that it is very well conſiſtent with the Principles of true Courage; nay, and the moſt powerful Incitement that can be, to all Gallant and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourous Actions. For to live in the Fear of God, to fear him ſo as to tremble at the thoughts of offending him, and to pay a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential Regard to the Majeſty of his Power, and the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Laws, is the ſure and certain means of engaging him on your ſide: And when you
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42943:8"/>
are once happily ſecure of that, you need <hi>not fear what man can do unto you:</hi> Nor need you be then <hi>afraid though never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of your Enemies ſet themſelves againſt you round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gentlemen, Your known Bravery and Reſolution in the day of Battel hath eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the late Actions in which you have been engaged. And your very Enemies have confeſs'd to your glory, that they felt to their own ſhame, that you have been far enough from <hi>fearing thoſe who can kill the body only.</hi> But God forbid, that you ſhould eſteem as any part of your glory, not to <hi>fear him, who can deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell.</hi> No, ſuch a Religious Fear as this is one of the principal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments of the true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42943:9"/>
Hero.</hi> And if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Experience of one of the greateſt Generals <hi>France</hi> ever bred, he will inform you, That no man can be truly brave with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>The next thing propoſed to your imitation from the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> is the Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Piety and Devotion. For 'tis ſaid of him, That he was <hi>a devout man, and one that prayed to God continually.</hi> And to convince you of the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and wiſdom of this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, I need only ſuggeſt to you thoſe particular and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Obligations, which men of your Profeſſion ſeem to lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of imploring the aſſiſtance of the Divine Protection: For you are much more converſant in Dangers and Neceſſities, and oftner expoſed to Hardſhips, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42943:9"/>
Diſtreſſes, than any other ſort of men: And ſo perilous are the Circumſtances, ſo great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold are the Difficulties where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you are ſometimes encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, that in many Caſes you ſeem to ſtand in need of a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle on purpoſe for your preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and have no other means left for you to eſcape, but the immediate interpoſition of that God, whoſe Will no Human Policy can controul, and whoſe Almighty Power no Creature is able to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>Now what can be thought more reaſonable, than for men in ſuch hazardous Circumſtances and apparent Dangers as theſe, to be continually addreſſing their Supplications to him, who is both willing and <hi>able to ſave them to the uttermoſt?</hi> and ſo to engage the favour of his Divine Aid
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42943:10"/>
and Aſſiſtance by Prayer and Devotion, that He may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to ſave and defend them, and be <hi>their preſent help in the needful time of trouble?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was lookt upon as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſary preparation againſt the dangerous Accidents and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of War amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> and this the Chriſtian Emperor <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> thought ſo requiſite in order to the happy ſucceſs of his Arms and Armies; that, beſides his own private Devotions in his Tent, he taught every particular Soldier in his Army an excellent Form of Prayer, and required them to ſay it for themſelves: Which Pious Precedent the Religious <hi>Theodoſius</hi> is ſaid to have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with ſo good ſucceſs, that his <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> ſaith, he obtained a great Victory over his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

by the prevailing efficacy of his Devotion, rather than by the ſtrength of his Army, or the Power of his Sword.</p>
            <p>'Tis not indeed expected that ſo much time can be ſpent in Devotion in a Camp, as in a Cell, or a Cloyſter; nor will there be ſo much exacted in this Caſe of a <hi>Soldier,</hi> as of a <hi>Monk.</hi> But yet it muſt be ſtill remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that God Almighty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the Worſhip and Service of both according to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Talents and Abilities. And although thoſe external Avocations which do neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily attend the buſineſs of your Profeſſion, will not perhaps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you to be ſo often upon your knees, as thoſe who have more leiſure, and more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient retreats for the exerciſe of their Devotion; it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42943:11"/>
behove you to be as fervent and frequent in Prayer as you can; and as often as your Circumſtances will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
            <p>Whilſt you are in your reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Quarters, you will have greater Advantages of this kind than moſt other men. And if you do not gladly comply with thoſe happy Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are then afforded you, of praying daily to God, both privately, and in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Congregations where you are, it cannot be then ſaid in your excuſe of this neglect, that you were otherwiſe enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and that you were not at liberty to do it: No, the World will be then apt to conclude, that it is becauſe you do not think the Duties of Religion any part of your buſineſs: And
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42943:11"/>
that with thoſe wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Wretches in the <hi>Pſalmiſt, You care not for God, neither is God in all your thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I hope, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> this ſevere reproach will not lye upon the Character of many of you: And I cannot but obſerve it to the great Honour and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome amongſt you, and thoſe not a few, that you have conſtantly frequented our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſemblies, where you came, and expreſſed therein a very decent and orderly Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now although ſuch happy opportunities as theſe cannot be ſo well and ſo often enjoyed, whilſt you are in the Field, and actually engaged in Military Service; yet even then your
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42943:12"/>
Minds and Meditations may be devoutly diſpoſed: And the greateſt Hurry and Confuſion of a Camp can never hinder, but that you may be ſtill calling upon God in ſhort Ejaculations, and pious Motions of the Soul. A <hi>Lord have mercy upon me;</hi> a <hi>God help me;</hi> or a <hi>Lord ſave and defend me;</hi> may be eaſily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with any of your moſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy Engagements: And yet ſome ſuch ſhort Ejaculatory Forms of Devotion as theſe, when they are addreſs'd unto God ſervently and affectionately, may in ſome caſes be as uſeful as they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and natural. 'Tis certain, they will ſpend no more breath, nor require any more words to expreſs them, than a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Oath or a Curſe: And how much more it becometh a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Soldier to habituate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42943:12"/>
to the one rather than to the other, I leave to the ſerious conſideration of every one of you, who hath a Soul, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it to be Immortal; and whoever believes ſo, muſt needs conclude, That a Sword or a Bullet in a man's Heart, and a <hi>God dammee</hi> in his Mouth at the ſame time, is the moſt deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deſperate ſtate of a dying man that can be imagin'd: For he who defies God with his laſt breath, as he leaves himſelf no ſpace for Repentance, ſo neither does he leave to others, how charitable ſoever they may be, the leaſt room to hope for any Mercy from God for him.</p>
            <p>This, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you in the world: And a little of your own reflection
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42943:13"/>
upon it will, without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any other Arguments, eaſily convince you, how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it imports you to be <hi>wiſe to conſider your latter end;</hi> and in order hereunto, to follow the Example of that Religious and Devout Soldier <hi>Cornelius,</hi> which is here propoſed to your imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>And if you could but be once happily perſuaded to this, what glorious Atchievements might not be then expected from you? <hi>How might one then chaſe a thouſand, and two put ten thouſand to flight?</hi> And how would all the boaſted Force and Policy of your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies be confounded and brought to nought, were you but as mindful of your Duty to God, as you are couragiouſly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42943:13"/>
ſtout and reſolute in the ſervice of your King and Country? or were you but as careful of the Intereſt of your Souls, as you are well known to be bravely prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal of your Lives, and wholly unconcern'd at the approach of any bodily danger?</p>
            <p>This would infallibly engage the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> himſelf to be <hi>on your ſide, even the Lord ſtrong and mighty in Battle.</hi> And that being once happily ſecured, you may be then always confident of the Succeſs of your Arms; and need not fear, but that your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and <hi>thoſe that imagine miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief againſt you, ſhould be turn'd backward, and flee before you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas on the contrary, let your Cauſe be never ſo juſt, and your own perſonal Bravery never ſo great; yet ſo long as your <hi>Iniquities</hi> continue to <hi>ſeparate
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42943:14"/>
between you and your God,</hi> and <hi>your ſins hide his face from you;</hi> you cannot then <hi>trust in the Arm of Fleſh; nor is it your Sword that can then help you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſhua</hi> was a great General, had a very juſt Cauſe, and a good Army to ſupport it. And yet 'tis very remarkable in his Story, That he was ſmitten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Canaanites</hi> for a Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Soldiers. And this I mention to put you in mind of the fatal Conſequence of your ſins; which whilſt you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in without Repentance, you harbour a Foe within your own Tents, that will do you and your Cauſe more miſchief than all the Arts and Aſſaults of your Enemies could be otherwiſe able to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:42943:14"/>
If therefore you have any ſerious regard for your own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Advantage, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Life that now is, or that which is to come; if the glorious Succeſs of that Cauſe in which you are engaged, if the Honour and Safety of your King, the Good of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Defence and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your moſt Holy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Common Welfare and Proſperity of that whole Church and Nation to which you belong, can make any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Impreſſion upon you; you muſt then think your ſelves obliged upon the account of all theſe moſt powerful and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Motives to make it your great Care to live and dye as it becometh Chriſtians; to fear God, and to pray unto him continually; and ſo to order
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42943:15"/>
your Converſation aright, <hi>that Iniquity may not be your Raine,</hi> neither in this World, nor in that which is to come.</p>
            <p>This, Gentlemen, is the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deſire of him who daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members you in his Prayers to God for you; and who earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreats and exhorts you to pray daily for your ſelves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, That God would proſper your Cauſe you have in hand; that He would <hi>plead your Cauſe with them that ſtrive with you, and fight againſt them that fight againſt you;</hi> That by his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Wiſdom and Power from above he would Direct the Councils, and Influence the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and Defend the Perſon of your <hi>Royal General;</hi> and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue both Him and You under the merciful Care and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Good Providence, that

you may be ſtill <hi>ſafe from the power of your Enemies;</hi> and <hi>that the ungodly and thoſe that hate you, may not be able to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over you:</hi> But that you may <hi>do valiantly,</hi> and conquer gloriouſly, and rejoyce greatly in the God of your Salvation, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God, our Saviour and mighty Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, who hath done great things for us:</hi> and <hi>praiſed be the Lord</hi> for evermore, <hi>who hath pleaſure in the Proſperity of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi>

                  <p>NOW ſeeing that all they are accurſed (as the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> beareth witneſs) who do err and go aſtray from the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, let us (remembring the dreadful Judgment hanging o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our heads, and always ready to fall upon us) return unto our Lord God with all contrition and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, bewailing and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting our ſinful life, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging and confeſſing our Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſeeking to bring forth worthy Fruits of Penance. For now is the Ax put unto the Root of the Trees, ſo that every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewen down, and caſt into the fire. It is a fearful thing to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42943:21"/>
the hands of the living God: He ſhall pour down rain upon the ſinners, ſnares, fire and brimſtone, ſtorm and tempeſt; this ſhall be their portion to drink. Forlo, the Lord is come out of his place to viſit the wickedneſs of ſuch as dwell upon the Earth. But who may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the day of his coming? who who ſhall be able to endure when he appeareth: His Pan is in his Hand, and he will purge his floor, and gather his Wheat into the Barn, but he will burn the Chaff with unquenchable fire. The Day of the Lord cometh as a Thief in the Night: and when Men ſhall ſay Peace, and all things are ſafe, then ſhall ſudden deſtruction come upon them, as ſorrow cometh upon a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man travelling with Child, and they ſhall not eſcape. Then ſhall appear the Wrath of God in the Day of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, which obſtinate ſinners, through the ſtubborneſs of their heart, have heaped unto themſelves, which deſpiſed the goodneſs, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and long-ſufferance of God,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42943:22"/>
when he called them continually to Repentance. Then ſhall they call upon me (ſaith the Lord) but I will not hear, they ſhall ſeek me early but they ſhall not find me; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hated knowledge, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the fear of the Lord, but abhorred my counſel, and deſpiſed my correction. Then ſhall it be too late to knock when the door ſhall be ſhut; and too late to cry for Mercy when it is the time of Juſtice. O terrible voice of moſt juſt Judgment which ſhall be pronounced upon them, when it ſhall be ſaid unto them, Go ye curſed into the fire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, which is prepared for the Devil and his Angels. Therefore Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, take we heed betime, while the day of ſalvation laſteth; for the night cometh when none can work: but let us, while we have the light, believe in the light, and walk as Children of the light, that we be not caſt into utter darkneſs, where is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. Let us not abuſe the goodneſs of God, who calleth us mercifully to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42943:22"/>
and of his endleſs pity promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us forgiveneſs of that which is paſt, if with a perfect and true heart we return unto him. For though our ſins be as red as ſcarlet, they ſhall be made white as ſnow: and though they be like purple, yet they ſhall be made white as wooll. Turn ye (ſaith the Lord) from all your wickedneſs, and your ſin ſhall not be your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Caſt away from you all your ungodlineſs that ye have done, make you new hearts, and a new ſpirit: Wherefore will ye die, O houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſeeing that I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of him that dieth, ſaith the Lord God? Turn ye then, and ye ſhall live. Although we have ſinned, yet have we an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins. For he was wounded for our offences, and ſmitten for our wickedneſs. Let us therefore return unto him, who is the merciful recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of all true penitent ſinners; aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our ſelves that he is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, and moſt willing to pardon

us, if we come unto him by faithful repentance; if we will ſubmit our ſelves unto him, and from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth walk in his ways; if we will take his eaſie yoke, and light bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon us, to follow him in low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, patience, and charity, and be ordered by the governance of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit: ſeeking always his glory, and ſerving him duly in our vocation with thankſgiving. This if we do, Chriſt will deliver us from the curſe of the Law, and from the extream malediction which ſhall light upon them that ſhall be ſet on the left hand; and he will ſet us on his right hand, and give us the gracious bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of his Father, commanding us to take poſſeſſion of his glorious Kingdom: unto which he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to bring us all, for his infinite mercy. <hi>Amen.</hi>
