            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>with all our ſoules, and with all our might.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of which loue, we muſt both loath and treade vnder foote all thinges that ſéemeth good in all the worlde. Yea, this loue ouercommeth all miſchiefes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo euer which otherwiſe ſéeme inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> proclaimeth this with a zealous and vehement motion. <hi>Who ſhall ſeperate vs from the loue of God? Shall tribulation, or anguiſh, or perſecution, or hunger, or nakednes, or perill, or ſword?</hi> as it is written: <hi>for thy ſake are wee killed all day long, and are counted as ſheepe to the ſlaughter: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe in all theſe thinges we ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come through him that loued vs. For I am ſure that neither death, nor life, nor Angell, nor rule, nor power, nor thinges
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1700:62"/>
preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall bee able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſu our Lorde.</hi> Hitherto the Apoſtle. The nature of a faithfull friende is not to offende, but to reuerence him whom he loueth: he is the better when his eye is vpon him, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is to talke with him, his heart is to doe for him, his great pleaſure to be preſent with him, he willingly will not ſée him iniuried, nor patiently heare him ſlandered, no croſſe nor calamity ſhall vnloſe the long contracted knotte of friendſhip. Indéede we all ſay we loue God, but fewe of vs feare to offend him: we can ſay we like well of his word, but we doe not reuerence it as we ought. We will talke of him: but how, in ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſtaring, curſing and banning, but to talke of him, or with him, as though we loued him, that is to giue him thanks, praiſe him, or pray vnto him, or meditate vpon his worde, we vſe it but a little. And I doubt wee haue many Chriſtians which ſcarce once in foure and twenty houres make mention of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1700:63"/>
him after this manner. The deſire we haue to ſée our friende, is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we loue him dearly: the ſlender deſire we haue to ſée God, that is, out of his worde to learne his will, ſheweth that we loue him ſo greatly that wée care not if we neuer ſée him. One friend will grieue to heare an other ill ſpoken off, but fewe there are which if they heare the name of God moſt villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly blaſphemed, all his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes broken one vpon the necke of an other, that will rebuke the ſinner, as if he loued God, and loathed to ſée him mangled and torne from toppe to toe of wicked Miſcreaunts, which make no conſcience of kéeping his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. To intend treachery againſt an earthly Prince, is an offence not pardonable: neither is there any good Subiect, but will both reprooue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale the ſame, but to committe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt him, which is the onely Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch and Ruler of Heauen and Earth: that is, malapertly, negligently, and careleſly to ſinne, and tranſgreſſe his commaundementes: I ſay, to drinke
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1700:63"/>
ſinne as beaſtes drinke water, ſome of vs make no bones: we winke at one anothers wickedneſſe, and part ſtake in diueliſhneſſe, not conſidering that there is one in the Heauens which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, whiſper we neuer ſo ſoftly: and ſéeth, cloake wée it neuer ſo ſecretely: according to that of the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> God ſhall raigne ſnares of fire vpon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, fire and brimſtone with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtious windes, ſhall be the portion of their cuppe: they ſhall be turned into hell: their téeth ſhall be daſhed in their mouthes: their armes ſhall be cruſhed and broken: they ſhall fall away from the face of the earth.

ſoone as they ſée the fooliſh Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be tricked with the delight of ſome new deuiſed Lucyferlike tricks, then begin they to ſet ſuch dainties abroch as may make fat fooles, &amp; leane pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Oh this is braue, ſaith one, this will tricke it, ſayeth another, I will haue a newe deuiſe, ſaith the third.
