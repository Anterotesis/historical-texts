            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LOOKING-GLASS FOR The Lord Chancellor; OR, A Brief Summary of ſome of his Notorious Crimes.</head>
            <l>WHat horrid guilt ſurpriz'd the Man,</l>
            <l>That in each cauſe ſtill won the day;</l>
            <l>Who always us'd to lead the Van,</l>
            <l>And knew no Juſtice to Obey.</l>
            <l>That he ſhould leave the glorious Court,</l>
            <l>The Splendid Place of his Reſort,</l>
            <l>Where he had all things at Command,</l>
            <l>To fly into another Land?</l>
            <l>It was becauſe a Monarch Great,</l>
            <l>A Mighty Prince, a Proteſtant,</l>
            <l>Was come to Rectify the State</l>
            <l>Of <hi>England,</hi> by a Parliament.</l>
            <l>Which Settlement he did abhor,</l>
            <l>Who was a Traytor to the Crown;</l>
            <l>Advis'd the King the Laws to mar,</l>
            <l>To pull the Rights and Charters down.</l>
            <l>He always ſided with the Times,</l>
            <l>Being guilty of Notorious Crimes;</l>
            <l>Gave Counſel to himſelf and fled,</l>
            <l>For fear the Law ſhould reach his Head.</l>
            <l>Tho Vengeance ſuffer'd not to fly,</l>
            <l>But fill'd his Conſcience full of guilt,</l>
            <l>And loudly after him did Cry,</l>
            <l>For all the Blood that he had Spilt:</l>
            <l>Being Apprehended, back was brought,</l>
            <l>For all the Evil he had wrought;</l>
            <l>Committed Pris'ner, on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>His Dream in order to fulfill:</l>
            <l>Which Dream Preſag'd his fatal Woe,</l>
            <l>That firſt Advanc'd he ſhould be high,</l>
            <l>Ev'n next unto the Crown but two,</l>
            <l>At laſt be Hang'd in ſhame to dye.</l>
            <l>The two firſt hath already been,</l>
            <l>As <hi>Oats</hi> did at the Bar declare,</l>
            <l>When wrongfully he Sentenc'd him,</l>
            <l>Who bid him of the Third beware.</l>
            <l>The King may cry, Alas, Alas,</l>
            <l>By's Evil Counſel I'm undone,</l>
            <l>Which I too often did Embrace,</l>
            <l>A Fatal Shaking to my Throne:</l>
            <l>The Citizens may Curſe the Day</l>
            <l>That ever Nature gave him Breath,</l>
            <l>And loudly Cry, Away, away</l>
            <l>With ſuch a fellow from the Earth;</l>
            <l>Who doomed was unto Diſgrace,</l>
            <l>Before the Parliament, was brought</l>
            <l>Upon his knees, when in his place</l>
            <l>Great Miſdemeanours he had wrought:</l>
            <l>Who ſmother'd the whole Popiſh Plot,</l>
            <l>That <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Death might be forgot:</l>
            <l>VVho did Invade our Charters Right,</l>
            <l>And in our Ruine did delight:</l>
            <l>VVho abhorred all Petitioning</l>
            <l>VVhen we His Majeſty did Intreat,</l>
            <l>Inſinuating to the King</l>
            <l>To pull us down, we were too great.</l>
            <l>He alſo (as ſays the Records)</l>
            <l>VVhen on the Bench gave his Conſent,</l>
            <l>To Bail out all the Popiſh Lords,</l>
            <l>Altho Impeach'd by Parliament.</l>
            <l>VVho did againſt Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> plead,</l>
            <l>And Sentenc'd him to Death ſevere;</l>
            <l>A Valiant Proteſtant indeed,</l>
            <l>Againſt whom nothing was found clear.</l>
            <l>He VVorthy <hi>Corniſh</hi> doom'd to dye,</l>
            <l>Tho he'd commited no Offence,</l>
            <l>And like a Villain, Treacherouſly</l>
            <l>His Jury 'gainſt him did incenſe.</l>

            <l>Proof 'gainſt Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> made to be,</l>

            <l>He Murther'd Innocents in th' VVeſt,</l>
            <l>And did the bood of Thouſands ſpill,</l>
