            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, the Kings Majeſtie, in a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Robe, was conducted from his Bed-chamber, by the Conſtable on his right hand, and the Mariſhall on his left hand, to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Preſence; and there, was placed in a Chaire, under a cloath of State, by the Lord of Angus, Chamberlaine appointed by the King, for that day, and there, after a little repoſe, the Noble-men, with the Commiſſioners of Barons, and Burroughes, entered the Hall, and preſented themſelves before his Majeſtie.</p>
            <p>There-after, the Lord Chancellour ſpoke to the King, to this purpoſe; <hi>Sir, Your good Subjects deſyre You may bee crowned, as the righteous, and lawfull Heire of the Crowne of this Kingdome; that You would maintain Religion, as it is preſently profeſſed, and eſtabliſhed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the Nationall Covenant, League &amp; Covenant, and according to Your Declaration at Dumfermling, in Auguſt laſt; Alſo that You would bee Graciouſlie pleaſed to receave them vnder Your Highneſſe Protection, to governe them by the lawes of the Kingdome, and to defend them in their Rights &amp; Liberties, by Your Royall Power, offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in moſt humble manner to Your Majeſtie, with their Vowes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow Land, Lyfe, and what elſe is in their power, for the maintenance of Religion, for the ſafetie of Your Majeſties Sacred Perſon, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Your Crowne, which they intreate Your Majeſtie to accept, and pray ALMIGHTIE GOD, that for many years You may happilie enjoy the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King made this anſwer; <hi>I doe eſteeme the affections of my good People, more then the Crownes of manie Kingdomes, and ſhall bee readies, by, GODS Aſſiſtance, to beſtow my Lyfe in their Defence; Wiſhing

            <p>There-after, the Commiſſioners of Burroughes, and of Barones, and the Noble-men accompanied his Majeſtie to the Kirk of Scoone, in order &amp; rank according to their qualitie, two and two.</p>

            <p>Then the Scepter by the Earle of Craufurd and Lindeſay.</p>
            <p>And the Crown by the Marques of Argyle, immediately before the King.</p>

            <p>Thus the Kings Majeſtie entereth the Kirk.</p>
            <p>The Kirk being fitted, and prepared with a Table, Whereupon the Honours were layed, and a Chaire ſet in a fitting place for his Majeſties hearing of Sermon, over againſt the Miniſter, &amp; another Chaire on the other ſyde where hee ſat when hee receaved the Crown, before which there was a Bench decently covered, as alſo Seats about for Noble-men, Barons, and Burgeſſes.</p>

Good Interpreters doe conjecture, though <hi>Joaſh</hi> bee called the ſonne of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> that hee was not his ſonne by nature, but by ſucceſſion to the Crowne. They ſay, that the race of <hi>Solomon</hi> ceaſſed here, and the Kingdome came to the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Nathan</hi> the ſonne of <hi>David.</hi> Becauſe 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 9. It is ſayd, <hi>The houſe of Ahaziah had no power to keep the Kingdome,</hi> which they conceave to bee for the want of children in that houſe; And becauſe of the abſurditie and unnaturallneſſe of the fact. That <hi>Athaliah</hi> the Grand-mother ſhould have cut off her ſonnes children. I ſhall not ſtand upon the matter, Onlie I may ſay, if they were <hi>Ahaziah</hi> his own children it was a moſt unnaturall and cruell fact for <hi>Athaliah</hi> to cut off her owne poſteritie.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the uſurpation, there might have been two motives. 1. It ſeemeth that when <hi>Ahaziah</hi> went to battell, <hi>Athaliah</hi> was left  to governe the Kingdome, and her ſonne <hi>Ahaziah</hi> being ſlaine before his returne, ſhee thought the governement ſweet, and could not part with it; And becauſe the Royall ſeed ſtood in her way, ſhee cruellie deſtroyed them, that ſhee might reigne with the greater freedome. 2. Shee was earneſt to ſet up a falſe worſhip, even the worſhip of <hi>Baal;</hi> which ſhee thought  could not bee ſo well done, as by cutting off the Royall race, and getting the ſole power in her hand, that ſhee might doe what ſhee pleaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The buſineſſe you are about this day, is not unlyke. You are to inveſt a young King in the Throne, in a verie troubleſome tyme; and wicked men have riſen up, and uſurped the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp; put to death the late king moſt unnaturallie. The lyke motives ſeeme to have prevayled with them. 1. Theſe men by falſehood and diſſimulation have gotten power in their hands, which to them is ſo ſweet, that they are unwilling to parte with it; And becauſe the King and his ſeed ſtood in their way, they have made away the King, and diſinherited his children, that the ſole power might bee in their hand. 2. They have a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of damnable errours, and a falſe worſhip to ſet up, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to take away the Ordinances of CHRIST, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governement

of His Kirk. All this cannot bee done, unleſſe they have the ſole power in their hand, and this they cannot have, till the King and his poſteritie bee cut off. But I leave this, and come to the preſent ſolemnitie. There is a Prince to bee inthroned, good <hi>Jehojada</hi> will have the Crowne put upon his head.</p>
            <p>It may bee queſtioned, Why they went about this Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a tyme of ſo great hazard, when <hi>Athaliah</hi> had reigned ſix yeares? Had it not been better to have defate <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and then to have crowned the King? Two reaſons may bee ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered why they delay not the Coronation. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. To crowne the King, was a duetie they were bound to. Hazard ſhould not  make men leave their duetie. They did their duetie, and left the ſucceſſe to GOD. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. They crowned the young King, to  endeare the peoples affections to their own native Prince, and to alienate their heartes from her that had uſurped the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. If they had delayed, the king being knowne to bee preſerved, it might have brought on, not onlie compliance with her, but alſo ſubjection to her governement, by reſting in it, and being content to lay aſyde the righteous heire of the Crowne.</p>
            <p>The ſame is obſerved in our caſe, and manie wonder that you ſhould crowne the king in a dangerous tyme, when the uſurpers have ſuch power in the Land. The ſame reaſons may ſerve to anſwer for your doing. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. It is our neceſſarie duetie to crowne the king upon all hazards, and to leave the ſucceſſe  to GOD. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. It appeareth now, it hath been too long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed. Delay is dangerous, becauſe of the compliance of  ſome, and treacherie of others. If it ſhall bee delayed lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it is to bee feared that the moſt part ſhall ſit downe under the ſhadow of the <hi>Bramble,</hi> the deſtroying uſurpers.</p>

Beware of putting on theſe ſinnes with the Crowne; For if you put them on, all the well-wiſhers to a king in the three kingdomes, will not bee able to hold on the Crown, and keepe it from tottering, yea, from falling.

I read of a great man, who conſidering the trouble and care that accompanied a Crowne, ſayd, Hee would not take it up at his foote, though hee might have it for taking. Now if a Crowne at the beſt bee ſo full of troubles, what ſhall one thinke of a Crowne at the worſt, when there are ſo great commotions, wherein the Crowne is directlie aimed at? Surelie it muſt bee a tottering Crown at the leaſt, eſpeciallie when former ſinnes have brought on theſe Troubles.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The third thing in this Solemnitie is the anoynting of the king. The anoynting of kings was not abſolutelie neceſſarie under the Old Teſtament; for wee reade not that all the kinges of IUDAH and ISRAEL were anoynted. The HEBREWES obſerve that anoynting of kinges was uſed in three caſes: 1. When the firſt of a Familie was made king, as SAUL, DAVID. 2. When there was a queſtion for the Crowne, as in the caſe of SOLOMON and ADONI<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>AH. 3. When there was an interruption of the lawfull ſucceſſion by uſurpation, as in the caſe of IOASH there is an interruption by the uſurpation of ATHALIAH; therefore hee is anoynted. If this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion holde, as it is probable, then it was not abſolutelie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41643:9"/>
under the OLD TESTAMENT; and therefore farre leſſe under the NEW.</p>
            <p>Becauſe it may bee ſayd, That in our caſe there is an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption by uſurpation, Let it bee conſidered; That the Anoynting under the OLD TESTAMENT was typicall. Although all kinges were not types of CHRIST, yet the Anoynting of kinges, Prieſts and Prophets, was typicall of CHRIST, and His Offices: But CHRIST being now come, all theſe Ceremonies ceaſſe. And therefore the Anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of kinges, ought not to bee uſed in the NEW TE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STAMENT.</p>
            <p>If it bee ſayd, Anoynting of kinges hath been in uſe amongſt Chriſtians, not onlie Papiſtes, but PROTESTANTS, as in the kingdome of ENGLAND, and our late king was anoynted withoyle. It may bee replyed, They who uſed it under the NEW TESTAMENT tooke it from the <hi>Jewes,</hi> without warrand. It was moſt in uſe with the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who to keepe Kinges and Emperoures ſubject to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, did ſweare them to the <hi>Pope,</hi> when they were anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (and yet the <hi>Jewiſh prieſts</hi> did never ſweare kinges to themſelves) As for ENGLAND, although the <hi>Pope</hi> was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten off, yet the ſubjection of kings to Biſhops was ſtill retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for they anoynted the king and ſware him to the mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their <hi>praelaticall dignitie.</hi> They are here who were witneſſes at the CORONATION of the late king. The Biſhops behoved to performe that rite, and the king beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bee ſworne to them. But now by the Bleſſing of GOD <hi>Poperie</hi> and <hi>Praelacie</hi> are removed. The <hi>Biſhops</hi> as limmes of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> are put to the doore: Let the Anoynting of kinges with oyle goe to the doore with <hi>them,</hi> and let <hi>them</hi> never come in agayne.</p>
            <p>The anoynting with materiall oyle, maketh not a king the Anoynted of the LORD, for hee is ſo without it. Hee is the ANOYNTED of the LORD, who by Divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and appoyntment is a King. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 45. 1. GOD calleth CYRUS His anoynted, yet wee reade not that hee was

            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. A perſonall Reformation. A king ſhould reforme his owne lyfe, that hee may bee a Patterne of Godlineſſe to others; and to this hee is tyed by the COVENANTS. The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Reformers of IUDAH, were pious and religious men.

A King ſhould not follow <hi>Machiavell</hi> his counſell, who requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not that a Prince ſhould bee truelie religious, but ſayeth, that a ſhadow of it, and externall ſimulation, are ſufficient. A diveliſh counſell; and it is juſt with GOD, to bring a king to the ſhadow of a kingdome, who hath but the ſhadow of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Wee know, that diſſembling kinges have been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of GOD; And let our King know, that no king, but a religious king, can pleaſe GOD. DAVID is highlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for Godlyneſſe, HEZEKIAH a man eminent for Pietie; IOSIAH, a young king, commended for the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his heart, when hee heard the Law of the LORD read; Hee was much troubled before the LORD, when hee heard the judgementes threatened agaynſt his fathers houſe, and his people. It is earneſtlie wiſhed, that our Kinges heart may bee tender, and bee truelie humbled before the LORD, for the ſinnes of his fathers houſe, and of the land; and for the manie evills that are upon that familie, and upon the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. A Familie Reformation. The king ſhould reforme his Familie, after the example of Godlie kinges. AS A when hee entered in <hi>COVENANT,</hi> ſpared not his mothers <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</hi> The houſe of our king hath been much defyled by <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</hi> The king is now in COVENANT, and to renew the COVENANT; Let the Royall Familie bee reformed; And that it may bee a Religious Familie, wherein GOD will have pleaſure, Let it bee purged; not onlie of <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> but of prophanitie and looſneſſe, which hath abounded in it. Much hath been ſpoken of this matter; but little hath been done in it. Let the king and others, who have charge in that Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, thinke it lyeth upon them, as a duetie, to purge it. And if yee would have a Familie well purged, and conſtitute, take DAVID for a Patterne, in the purgation and conſtitution of his, PSAL. 101. <hi>The froward heart, wicked perſons, and ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> hee will have <hi>farre from him: But his eyes are vpon the faythfull of the land, that they may dwell with him.</hi> If there be a man better then another in the land, hee ſhould be for the king, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41643:12"/>
his Familie: Yee may extend this Reformation to the Court; A prophane Court, is dangerous for a king, It hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as a provoking ſinne in ENGLAND, which hath drawnedowne judgement upon King and Court, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this day. It is to bee wiſhed, that ſuch were in the Court, as DAVID ſpeaketh of in that PSALME. Let the King ſee to it, and reſolve with DAVID, PSAL. 101. 7. That <hi>Hee who worketh deceat, ſhall not dwell within his houſe; and hee who telleth lies, ſhall not tarrie in his ſight.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Reformation in Iudicatories. It would bee carefullié ſeene to, that Iudicatories bee reformed; and that men fearing GOD, and hating <hi>Covetouſneſſe,</hi> may bee placed in them. A King in COVENANT ſhould doe, as IEHOSHAPHAT did, 2. CHRON. 19. 5. 6. 7. <hi>Hee ſet Judges in the land, and ſayd, Take heed what yee doe; yee judge not for men, but for the LORD, who is with you in judgement: wherefore now let the feare of the LOR'D bee before you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. The Reformation of the whole Land. The Kings eye ſhould bee upon it, 2. CHRON. 19. 4. <hi>Jehoſhaphat went out thorow the people, from Beerſheba, to mount Ephraim; and brought them backe to the LORD GOD of their fathers.</hi> Our Land hath great need of Reformation; For there is a part of it, that hath ſcarce ever yet found the benefite of Reformation, they are lying without the GOSPELL. It will bee a good work for a COVENANTED KING, to have a care that the GOSPEL may bee preached thorow the whole Land. Care alſo would bee taken that they who have the GOSPEL, may live ſuteably thereto.</p>
            <p>If a King would bee a through Reformer, hee muſt bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himſelfe; otherwayes hee will never lay Reformation to heart. To make a king a good Reformer, I wiſh him theſe qualifications according to the Trueth, and in ſincerity, where-with they report TRAJAN the Emperour, to have been endued, Hee was 1. Devote at home, 2. Cowragious in warre, 3. Iuſtin his Iudicatures, 4. Prudent in all his effaires. True PIETIE, FORTITUDE, IUSTICE, and PRU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENCIE,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41643:12"/>
are notable qualifications in a Prince, who would reforme a kingdome, and reforme well.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> I come now to the fyfth and laſt particular, and that is the Covenant made betweene the king and the people. When a king is crowned, and receaved by the people, there is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or mutuall Contract, betweene him and them, contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning conditions, mutuallie to bee obſerved. Tyme will not ſuffer to inſiſt upon manie particulars, I ſhall onlie lay before You three: 1. It is cleare from this Covenant, That a king hath not abſolute power to doe what hee pleaſeth, hee is tyed to conditions, by vertue of a Covenant. 2. It is cleare from this Covenant, That a people are bound to obey their king in the LORD. 3. I ſhall preſent the king with ſome dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for the right governement of the people, who are bound to obey.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. It is cleare, That the kinges power is not abſolute, as Kinges and flattering Courtiours apprehend; a kinges power is a limited power, by this Covenant. And there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde limitation of the kinges power.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. In regard of ſubordination. There is power above his, even GODS power, whom hee is obliedged to obey; and  to whom hee muſt give an accompt of his adminiſtration. Yee heard yeſterday, that text, <hi>By mee kinges reigne,</hi> PROV. 8. 15. Kinges have not onlie their Crownes from GOD; but they muſt reigne according to his will, which is cleare from ROM. 13. 4. Hee is called THE MINISTER OF GOD. Hee is but GODS Servant. I need not ſtay upon this. Kinges, and all others, will acknowledge this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. In regard of Lawes. A King is ſworne at his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to rule according to the ſtanding, receaved Lawes of the kingdome. The Lawes hee is ſworne to, limite him that hee can not doe agaynſt them, without a ſinfull breach of this Covenant, between the king, and the people.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. In regard of Governement. The totall Governement, is not upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a king. He hath Counſellours, a Parliament, or Eſtates, 
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41643:13"/>
in the Land, who ſhare in the burthen of Government. No king ſhould have the fole Government. It was never the mynde of theſe, who receaved a king to rule them, to lay all Government upon him, to doe what hee pleaſeth, without controlement. There is no man able alone to governe all. The kingdome ſhould not lay that upon one man, who may eaſilie miſcarrie. The Eſtates of the Land, are bound in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, to beare a burthen with him.</p>
            <p>Theſe men who have flattered kinges, to take unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an abſolute power, to doe what they pleaſe, have wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged kinges, and kingdomes. It had been good that kinges of late, had carried themſelves ſo, as this queſtion of kings power, might never have come in debate; For they have been great looſers thereby. Kings are verie deſyrous to have thinges ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and written, to holde up their Arbitrarie and unlimited power; but that way doeth exceedinglie wrong them. There is one, a learned man, I confeſſe, who hath written a booke, for the mayntenance of the abſolute power of kinges, called DEFENSIO REGIA, whereby hee hath wronged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his reputation, and the king in his government. As for the fact in taking away the lyfe of the late King (what ever was GODS juſtice in it) I doe agree with him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it, as a moſt injuſt and horrid fact, upon their part who did it: But when hee commeth to ſpeake of the power of kinges in giving unto them an abſolute and illimited power, urging the damnable <hi>Maxime</hi> QUOD LIBET LICET, hee will have a king to doe what he pleaſeth <hi>impunè,</hi> and without controlement. In this I can not but diſlent from him.</p>
            <p>In regard of Subordination, ſome ſay; That a king is comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to none but GOD. Doe what hee will, let GOD take order with it; this leadeth kinges to <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> let them doe what they pleaſe, and take GOD in their owne hand: In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Lawes, they teach nothing to kinges, but <hi>Tyrannie:</hi> And in regard of governement, they teach a king to take an <hi>Arbitrarie</hi> power to himſelfe, to doe what hee pleaſeth without controlement. How dangerous this hath been to kinges, is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41643:13"/>
cleare by ſad experience. Abuſe of <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrarie Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement,</hi> hath been one of GODS Great Controverſies, with our Kinges Praedeceſſoures, GOD in His juſtice, becauſe <hi>Power</hi> hath been abuſed, hath throwne it out of their handes: And I may confidentlie ſay, That GODS Controverſie with the kinges of the earth, is for their <hi>Arbitrarie</hi> and <hi>Tyrannicall Governement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is good for our King to learne to bee wyſe in tyme; and know that hee receaveth this day a power to governe; but a power limited by contract; and theſe conditions hee is bound by Oath, to ſtand to. Kinges are deceaved, who thinke, that the people are ordayned for the king; and not the king for the people. The SCRIPTURE ſhoweth the contrarie, ROM. 13. 4. The King is the MINISTER OF GOD, FOR THE PEOPLES good. GOD will not have a king in an arbitrarie way, to encroach upon the poſſeſſions of Subjects, EZEH. 45. 7. 8. <hi>A portion is appoynted for the Prince.</hi> And it is ſayd, <hi>My Princes ſhall no more oppreſſe my people; and the rest of the Land, ſhall hee give vnto the houſe of Iſraell, according to their Tribes.</hi> The king hath his diſtinct Poſſeſſiions and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes from the people; hee muſt not oppreſſe, and doe what hee pleaſeth, there muſt bee no <hi>Tyrannie</hi> upon the Throne.</p>
            <p>I deſyre not to ſpeake much of this ſubject. Men have been verie tender in medling with the power of kinges; yet ſeeing theſe dayes have brought forth debates concerning the power of kinges, it will bee neceſſarie to bee cleare in the matter. Extremities would bee ſhunned. A King ſhould keepe within the boundes of the Covenant made with the people, in the exercyſe of his power; And Subjectes would keepe within the bounds of this Covenant, in regulating that power. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the laſt, I ſhall propound theſe three, to your conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. A King abuſing his power, to the over-throw of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Lawes and Liberties, which are the verie Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls of this Contract and Covenant, may bee controled and oppoſed; And if hee ſet himſelfe to over-throw all theſe by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41643:14"/>
Armes, then they who have power, as the Eſtates of a Land, may and ought to reſiſt by Armes: Becauſe hee doeth, by that oppoſition, breake the verie bondes, and over-throweth all the eſſentialls of this Contract and Covenant. This may ſerve to juſtifie the proceedinges of this kingdome agaynſt the late King; who in an Hoſtile way ſet himſelfe, to over-throw Religion, Parliaments, Lawes, and Liberties.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Everie breach of Covenant, wherein a king falleth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee hath entered in Covenant, doeth not diſſolve the bond of the Covenant. Neither ſhould Subjectes lay aſyde a king, for everie breach, except the breaches bee ſuch as over-throw the fundamentalls of the Covenant with the people. Manie exemples of this may bee brought from Scripture. I ſhall give but one. King ASA entered ſolemnelie in Covenant with GOD, and the people, 2. CHRON. 15. After that, hee falleth in groſſe tranſgreſſions and breaches, 2. CHRON. 16. Hee aſſociate himſelfe and entered in League with <hi>Benhadad,</hi> king of <hi>Syria,</hi> an <hi>Idolater;</hi> Hee impriſoned HANANI, the LORDS Prophet, who reproved him, &amp; threatened judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agaynſt that aſſociation; And, at that ſame tyme, hee oppreſſed ſome of the people: And yet, for all this, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay him aſyde, nor compt him an hypocrite.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Private perſons, ſhould bee verie circumſpect, about that which they doe in relation to the authoritie of kinges. It is very dangerous, for private men, to meddle with the power of kinges, and the ſuſpending of them from the exercyſe thereof. I doe ingenuouſlie confeſſe, that I fynd no exemple of it. The Prophets taught not ſuch doctrine to their people, Nor the Apoſtles, Nor the Reformed Kirkes. Have ever pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, Paſtoures or Profeſſoures, given in to the Eſtates of a Land as their judgement, unto which they reſolve to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here, That a king ſhould bee ſuſpended from the exerciſe of his power. And if wee looke upon thoſe godlie Paſtoures, who lived in KING IAMES his tyme, of whom one may truelie ſay, more faythfull Men lived not in theſe laſt tymes; For they ſpared not to tell the king his Faultes, to his face:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41643:14"/>
Yea, ſome of them ſuffered perſecution for their honeſtie and feeedome: Yet wee never read, nor have heard, that anie of theſe godlie Paſtoures joyned with other private men, did ever remonſtrate to Parliament, or Eſtate, as their judgement, That the king ſhould bee ſuſpended from the exercyſe of his Royall power.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. It is cleare from this COVENANT, That people ſhould obey their King in the LORD: For as the King is bound by the COVENANT, to make uſe of his power, to their good; So they are bound to obey him in the LORD, in the exercyſe of that power. About the peoples duetie to the king, take theſe foure Obſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. That the obedience of the people, is in ſubordination to GOD; For the COVENANT is firſt with GOD, and then with the King. If a King command anie thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the will of GOD, in this caſe PETER ſayeth, <hi>It is better to obey GOD, then man.</hi> There is a lyne drawne from GOD to the people, they are loweſt the lyne; and have Magiſtrates inferiour, and ſupreme above them, and GOD above all. When the king commandeth the people that which is lawfull, and commanded by GOD, then hee ſhould bee obeyed; Becauſe hee ſtandeth in the right lyne under GOD, who hath put him in his place. But if hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that which is unlawfull, and forbidden of GOD, in that hee ſhould not bee obeyed to doe it; becauſe hee is out of his lyne. That a king is to bee obeyed with this ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is evident from Scripture; take one place for all, ROM. 13. At the beginning, yee have both obedience urged to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour powers, at the Ordinance of GOD, and damnation threatened agaynſt theſe who reſiſt the lawfull powers.</p>
            <p>It is ſayd by ſome, that manie Miniſters in Scotland, will not have King IESUS, but king CHARLES to regine. Faythfull men are wronged by ſuch ſpeaches. I doe not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe men; For if they thinke that a King &amp; IESUS are inconſiſtent; then they will haue no King: But I ſhall bee farre from entertayning ſuch thoughts of them. If they think
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41643:15"/>
the doing a neceſſarie duetie for KING CHARLES, is to praeferre his Intereſt to CHRISTS, this alſo is an errour. Honeſt Miniſters can verie well diſcerne betweene the Intereſt of CHRIST, &amp; of the king. I know no Miniſter that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up king CHARLES, with prejudice to CHRISTS intereſt.</p>
            <p>There are three ſorts of perſons, who are not to bee allowed in relation to the Kinges intereſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Such as have not been content to oppoſe a King, in an evill courſe, (as they might lawfullie doe) But contrarie to covenant, vowes, manie decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, have caſt off Kinges, and kinglie Governement. Theſe are the <hi>Sectaries.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. They who are ſo taken up with a King, as they praeferre a Kinges intereſt, to CHRISTS Intereſt; which was the ſinne of our <hi>Engagers.</hi>

            <p>I ſhall deſyre that men bee reall, when they make mention of CHRISTS Intereſt; For theſe three mentioned, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and praetend the Intereſt of CHRIST. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The <hi>Sectaries</hi> cover their deſtroying of Kinges, with CHRISTS Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; where-unto <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>I ſhall not take the Quaeſtion in its full Latitude, taking in what a people are bound to, in perſuing of a kings Right, in another Nation, which is not our praeſent Quaeſtion. Our Quaeſtion is, What a people ſhould doe, when a kingdome is injuſtlie invaded, by <hi>a forraigne enemie,</hi> which ſeeketh the over-throw of Religion, King, and Kingdome? Surelie, if men bee tyed to anie duetie to a king, and kingdome, they are tyed in this caſe. I have two ſorts of men to meet with here, who are deficient in doing this Covenanted duetie: 1.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The firſt I meet with, are they who act not, but lye by, to beholde what will become of all. Three ſorts of men act not for the defence of an invaded kingdom. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Theſe who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves from publick counſells, as from Parliament or Committee of Eſtates. This with-drawing, is not to act. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Theſe act not, who upon an apprehenſion of the deſperate ſtate of thinges, doe thinke that all is in ſuch a condition, by the praevayling of the <hi>Enemie,</hi> that there is no remedie: And thereof or that it is beſt, to ſit ſtill, and ſee how thinges goe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. They who doe not act, upon ſcruple of conſcience. I ſhall ever reſpect tenderneſſe of Conſcience; and I wiſh there bee no more but tenderneſſe.

            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41643:16"/>
They may be ſuppoſed to ſcruple upon one of theſe grounds: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. To act in ſuch a cauſe, for the kinges intereſt; Sure I am this was not a doubt before, but all ſeemed to agree to act for the kinges intereſt in ſubordination to CHRISTS, and this day there is no more ſought. Wee owne the kinges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, onlie in a ſubordination to CHRISTS: Or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. To joyne with ſuch inſtrumentes as are <hi>Enemies</hi> to the Worke of GOD. Our anſwer to the Eſtates Quaere Reſolves, that ſuch ſhould not bee intruſted: But wee doe not count theſe <hi>Enemies,</hi> who profeſſe repentance, and declare themſelves ſolemnelie to bee for the Cauſe, and the Covenant; and doe evidence it by their willingneſſe to fight for them. If it bee ſayd, Their repentance is but counterfet. Wee are bound to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in charitie, till the contrarie bee ſeene. No man can judge of the realitie of heartes; for wee have now found by experience, that men, who have been accounted above all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, have betrayed their truſt. If anie who have not yet repented of their former courſe, ſhall bee intruſted, wee ſhall bee ſorie for it; and playnlie ſay, That it ought not to bee.</p>
            <p>But I thinke there muſt bee more in this, that men ſay they cannot act. For my ſelfe, I love not that word in our caſe. It is to frequent, <hi>Hee can not act,</hi> and <hi>Hee can not act.</hi> I feare there bee three ſort of perſons lurking under this cover. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Such as are <hi>Puſillanimous,</hi> who have no cowrage to act agaynſt the <hi>Enemie.</hi> The word is true of them, <hi>They can not act,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they darre not act.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Such as are ſelfiſh men, ſerving their <hi>Idole credit.</hi> Hee hath been a man of Honour, and now hee feareth there will be no credit to fight agaynſt this prevailing <hi>Enemie:</hi> Therefore hee can not act, and ſave his Credit. Bee who thou will that hath this before thee, GOD ſhall blaſt thy reputation. Thou ſhalt neither have honour nor credit, to doe a right turne in GODS Cauſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Such as are <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliars,</hi> who can not act, becauſe they have a purpoſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye. There are, that can not act in an <hi>Armie;</hi> but they can betray an <hi>Armie,</hi> by not acting. There are, that can not act for ſafetie of a Kingdome; but they doe betray it, by not acting.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41643:17"/>
In a word, There are, who can not joyne to act with theſe whom they accompt <hi>Malignantes</hi> (I ſpeake not of <hi>declared and knowne Malignants;</hi> but of ſuch as have bene, and are fighting, for the Cauſe; Yet by them eſteemed <hi>Malignants)</hi> But they can joyne with <hi>Sectaries, open &amp; declared enemies,</hi> to Kirk and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

Theſe may ſeeme ſtrong motives; But SAUL is not mooved with anie of theſe. The preſent danger, is the <hi>Philistines</hi> invading the Land; and this danger is to bee oppoſed, come of the danger from DAVID what will. As if SAUL had ſayd, I will let DAVID alone, I will meet with him at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other tyme, and reckon with him; now there is no tyme for it, the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> are in the Land; let us make haſte agaynſt them.

Bee carefull of both; Let neither KIRK nor STATE ſuffer hurt; Let them goe together. The beſt way for ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a Kingdome, is a well conſtitute KIRK. They deceave kinges, who make them believe, that the governemnt of the KIRK; I meane Presbyteriall governement, can not ſute with MONARCHIE. They ſute well, it being the Ordinance of CHRIST, rendering to GOD, what is GODS; and to Caeſar, what is Caeſars.</p>
            <p>SIR, Kinges who have a tender care of the Kirk, Is. 41. 3. are called Nurſing Fathers.

A KING in COVENANT with the People of GOD, ſhould make much of theſe who are in COVENANT with him; having in high eſtimation the Faythfull Servants of CHRIST, and the Godlie People of the Land. It is rare to fynd kings lovers of Faythfull Miniſters, &amp; Pious People. It hath been the fault of our own kings to perſecute the godly.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Let the king love the Servants of CHRIST, who ſpeak the Trueth. Evill kinges are branded with this that they contemned the PROPHETS, 2. CHRON. 25. When <hi>Amaziah</hi> had taken the gods of <hi>Seir,</hi> and ſet them up for his gods, a Prophet came to him, and reproved him; unto whom the king ſayd, <hi>Who made thee of the Kinges Counſell, forbeare, leſt thou bee ſmitten.</hi> This contempt of the Prophets war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is a fore-runner of following deſtruction. Bee a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hearer of GODS WORD; take with reproofe; eſteeme of it, as DAVID did, PSAL. 141. 5. <hi>An excellent oyle, which ſhall not breake the head.</hi> To make much of the faithfull Servants of CHRIST, will be an evidence of reality.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Let the king eſteem well of Godly PROFESSOURS. Let Pietie bee in accompt. It is a fault verie common, that Pious Men, becauſe of their conſcientious and ſtrict walking, are hated by the <hi>Prophane,</hi> who love to live looſelie. It is uſuall with <hi>prophane men,</hi> to labour to bring kinges unto a diſtaſte of the Godlie; eſpeciallie when men who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Pietie become ſcandalous; whereupon they are readie to judge all Pious Men to bee lyke them; and take occaſion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41643:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to ſpeake evill of Pietie. I feare at this tyme, when men who have been commended for Pietie, have fallen foulelie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed their truſt; that men will take advantage, to ſpeake agaynſt the Godlie of the Land. Beware of this, for it is <hi>Sathans</hi> policie, to put Pietie out of requeſt. Let not this move anie. Fall who will, Pietie is ſtill the ſame, and Pious Men will make conſcience both of their wayes and truſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, they are precious in GODS Eyes, who will not ſuffer men to deſpyſe them, without their reward. SIR, Let not your heart be from the godly in the Land, whatever hath fallen out at this time. I dare affirm there are very many really godly men, who by their prayers are ſupporting your Throne.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. A King ſhould bee carefull whom hee putteth in Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Truſt, as a maine thing, for the good of the kingdome. It is a <hi>Maxime,</hi> That Truſt ſhould not bee put in their handes, who haue oppreſſed the people, or have betrayed their Truſt. There is a paſſage in Storie, meet for this purpoſe. One SEPTIMIUS ARABINUS, a man famous, or rather infamous for Oppreſſion, was put out of the SENATE, but re-admitted. About this tyme ALEXANDER SEVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RUS, being choſen to the Empyre, the SENATOURS did entertain him with publick ſalutations &amp; congratulations. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> eſpying <hi>Arabinus,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Senators,</hi> cryed out, <hi>O Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina! Arabinus non ſolum vivit, ſed in Senatum venit. Ah! Arabinus</hi> not only liveth, but hee is in the <hi>Senate.</hi> Out of juſt indignation, he could not endure to ſee him. As all are not meet for places of truſt in judicatories, So all are not meet for places of truſt in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold be choſen who are godly, &amp; able for the charge.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome who are not meet for truſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. They who are godly, out have no Skill nor ability for the place, A man may be a truely godly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who is not fit for ſuch place, &amp; no wrong, is done to him, nor to godlynes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the placae is denyed to him. I wonder how a godly man can take upon him a place, whereof hee hath no Skill. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. They who have neither Skill nor cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, are verie unmeet; for if it bee a place of never ſo great  moment, faint-heartedneſſe will make them qayte it. 3. They who are both Skilfull and ſtout; yet are not honeſt, but perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and treacherous, ſhould have no truſt at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:41643:21"/>
Of all theſe we have ſad experience, which ſhould not move You to make choiſe of prophane and godleſſe men, by whom a bleſſing is not to bee expected; but it ſhould move You to bee warie in Your choiſe. I am confident ſuch may bee had, who will bee faythfull for Religion, King, and kingdome.</p>

There hath been much debate about the exerciſe of the kings power, yet He is put in the exerciſe of his power, and this day put in a better capacity to exerciſe it by his <hi>Coronation.</hi> Many are affrayed that the exerciſe of his power, ſhall prove dangerous to the Cauſe; &amp; indeed I confeſſe there is ground of fear, when we conſider, how this power hath been abuſed by former kings. Therefore, Sir, make good uſe of this power; &amp; ſee that You rather keep within bounds, then exceed in the exerciſe of it. I may very well give ſuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, as an old Counſellour gave to a king of <hi>France.</hi> He having ſpent many years at Court, deſired to retire into the countrey, for enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing privacie fit for his age; &amp; having obtained leave, The king his maſter required him, to ſit down, and write ſome adviſe of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to leave behind him, which he out of modeſty declyned. The king would not be denyed, but left with him pen &amp; ink, and a ſheet of paper. He being alone after ſome thoughts, wrote with faire and legible Characters in the head of the ſheet <hi>Modus,</hi> in the middle of the ſheet <hi>Modus,</hi> &amp; in the foot of the ſheet <hi>Modus;</hi> &amp; wrote no more in all the paper; which he wrapped up, and delivered to the king, Meaning that the beſt Counſell he could give him, was, That he ſhould keep temper in all things. Nothing more fit for a young king, then to keep temper in all things. Take this Counſell, Sir, and be moderate in the uſe of your power. The beſt way to keep power, is moderation in the uſe of it.</p>

In ſpeaking of the kings behaviour to enemies, One thing I can not paſſe. There is much ſpoken of a treatie with this enemie. I am not of the judgement of ſome, who diſtinguiſh a treatie before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, &amp; after invaſion, and ſay, Treating is very lawfull before invaſion; becauſe it is ſuppoſed that there is little wrong done; but after invaſion, when a kingdom is wronged, &amp; put to infinit loſſes, then they ſay a treaty is to be ſhunned: But in my judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, a treaty may be lawful after invaſion, &amp; wrongs ſuſtained. The end of war is peace, neither ſhould deſire of revenge obſtruct it, providing it be ſuch a treatie &amp; peace, as is not prejudiciall to Religion, nor to the ſafety of the kingdom, nor to the undoubted right of the king, not to the League &amp; Covenant, wherunto we are ſo ſolemnly engaged.</p>
            <p>But I muſt break off this treaty, with a ſtory related in <hi>Plutarch.</hi> The <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> was in a great ſtrait, wherin they knew not what to doe. <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> in this ſtrait ſaid, he had ſomething, wherein to give his opinion, for the behoofe of the <hi>State;</hi> but he thought it not fit to deliver himſelfe publickly. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> a man of great truſt, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to hear him privatly, &amp; to make an accompt as he thought meet. When <hi>Ariſtides</hi> came to make his report to the <hi>Senate;</hi> He told them, that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his advice was indeed profitable, but not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. Whereupon the people would not ſo much as hear it. There is much whiſpering of a treaty, they are not willing to ſpeak publikly of it. Hear them in private; &amp; it may be the beſt advice ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; but not honeſt. If a treatie ſhould be, let it be both profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and honeſt, and no lover of peace will be agaynſt it.</p>

Seing the king is now upon the renewing of the Covenants, It would be remembered, that we enter into Covenant, according to our profeſſion therein; with reality, ſincerity, &amp; conſtancy, which are the qualifications of good Covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters. Many doubt of your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in the Covenant: Let Your ſinceritie and realitie be evidenced by Your ſteadfaſtneſſe and conſtancie; For manie have begun well, but have not been conſtant.</p>
            <p>In the ſacred hiſtory of <hi>Kings,</hi> we find a note put upon kings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their carriages.

Some kings have this writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on them, <hi>He did evil in the ſight of the LORD.</hi> They neither begin wel nor end wel.

2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 25. 2.

            <p>Before I cloſe, I ſhal ſeek leave, to lay before our young king, two exemples, to beware of, &amp; One to follow. The two warning exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, One of them is in the <hi>Text,</hi> another in our own <hi>Hiſtorie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt exemple is of <hi>Ioaſh.</hi> He began wel, &amp; went on in a godly reformation all the dayes of <hi>Iehojada;</hi> but it is obſerved 2. <hi>Chro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 24. 17. that after the dayes of <hi>Iehojada,</hi> the princes of <hi>Iudah</hi> came, &amp; did obeyſance to the king; &amp; he hearkened unto them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, they had been lying at waite, till the death of <hi>Iehojada;</hi> &amp; took that opportunity to deſtroy the true worſhip of GOD, &amp; ſet up falſe worſhip, flattering the king for that effect: For it is ſaid, <hi>They left the houſe of the LORD, &amp; ſerved groves &amp; Idoles;</hi> &amp; were ſo far from being reclaimed, by the Prophet of the LORD, that was ſent unto them, that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpired againſt <hi>Zechariah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Iehojada,</hi> who repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them mildly for their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and ſtoned him with ſtones, and ſlew him at the kings commandement. And <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. it is ſayd, <hi>Ioaſh remembered not the kindneſſe that Iehojada his father had done to him, but ſlew his ſonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SIR, Take this exemple for a warning. You are obliedged by the COVENANT, to goe on in the Work of Reformation, It may be, ſome great ones are wayting their tyme, not having op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie to work for the preſent, till afterward they may make obeyſance, and perſwade You to deſtroy all, that hath been done in the Work of GOD theſe diverſe years. Beware of it; Let no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement or perſwaſion prevayle with You, to fall from that, which this day You bynd Your ſelfe to mayntayn.</p>
            <p>Another exemple I give You, yet in recent memorie, of Your grand-father king IAMES. He fell to be very young, in a time, full of difficulties; yet there was a godly party in the land, who did put the Crown upon his head: And when he came to ſome years, He &amp; his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41643:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people entered in a Covenant with GOD, He was much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended by godly &amp; faithfull men, comparing him to young <hi>Ioſiah</hi> ſtanding at the Altar, renewing a Covenant with GOD; And he himſelfe did thank GOD, that he was born in a Reformed Kirk, better reformed then <hi>England;</hi> for they retained many <hi>popiſh ceremonies:</hi> yea, better reformed then <hi>Geneva,</hi> for they kept ſome <hi>holy dayes;</hi> Charging his people to be conſtant, &amp; promiſing himſelfe to continue in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, &amp; to maintain the ſame. Notwithſtanding of all this, he made a foule defection: He remembered not the kindneſſe of them who had held the crown upon his head; yea, he perſecuted faithfull Miniſters, for oppoſing that courſe of defection. He never reſted till hee had undone Presbyteriall Governement, and Kirk Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, ſetting up <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and bringing in <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> agaynſt which formerly hee had given large teſtimonie. In a word, hee layd the foundation, whereupon his ſonne our late king, did build much miſchiefe to Religion, all the dayes of his lyfe.</p>
            <p>SIR, I lay this exemple before You the rather, becauſe it is ſo near You, that the guiltines of the tranſgreſſion lyeth upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Throne &amp; Family, &amp; it is one of the ſinnes, for which You have profeſſed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation very lately. Let it be laid to heart, take warning, requite not faithfull mens kindnes with perſecution; yea, requite not the LORD ſo, who hath preſerved You to this tyme, and is ſetting a Crown upon Your head. Requite not the LORD with <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> and <hi>Defection</hi> from a ſworn Covenant: But bee ſteadfaſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, as You would give Teſtimonie of Your True Humiliation for the Defection of theſe that went before You.</p>
            <p>I have ſet vp theſe two exemples before You as beacons to warne You to keep off ſuch da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous courſes, &amp; ſhal add one for imitation, which, if followed, may happily bring with it the bleſſing of that godly mans adhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to God. The exemple is of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who did that <hi>which was right in the ſight of the Lord, 2. king.</hi> 18. 5. 6. It is ſaid of him, <hi>He truſtea in the Lord God of Iſrael, and he clave vnto the Lord, and departed not from following him, but kept his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements.</hi> And <hi>verſ. 7. The LORD was with him, and he proſpered whither ſoever he went forth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, follow this exemple, cleave unto the LORD, and depart not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> following him, &amp; the LORD will be with You, &amp; proſper You whitherſoever You go.

            <p>In which action, the Kinges Majeſtie ſtood up, ſhowing himſelfe to the people, in each corner; And the people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their willingneſſe, by chearfull acclamations, in theſe wordes, GOD SAVE THE KING, CHARLES THE SECOND.</p>
            <p>Thereafter the Kinges Majeſtie ſupported by the Conſtable, and Mariſhall, commeth downe from the Stage, and ſitteth downe in the Chaire, where hee heard the SERMON.</p>
            <p>The Miniſter, accompanied with the Miniſters before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, cometh from the Pulpit toward the King; &amp; requyreth, If hee was willing to take the Oath, appoynted to bee taken at the Coronation.</p>
            <p>The King anſwered, hee was moſt willing.</p>
            <p>Then the Oath of Coronation, as it is contayned in the eight Act of the firſt Parliament of King IAMES, being read by the Lyon, The Tenour whereof followeth:</p>

And ſhall aboliſh and gaynſt and all falſe religions, contrary to the ſame.

The Rights and Rents, with all juſt Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Crowne of Scotland, to preſerve and keepe inviolated; Neither ſhall they tranſfer, nor alienate the ſame.

            </p>
            <p>The Miniſter tendered the Oath unto the King, who knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and holding up his right hand, ſware in theſe wordes, <hi>By the Eternall and Almightie GOD, Who liveth and reigneth for ever, I ſhall obſerve and keepe all that is contayned in this Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This done, the Kinges Majeſtie ſitteth downe in his Chaire, and repoſeth himſelfe a little.</p>
            <p>Then the King aryſeth from his Chaire, and is diſrobed, by the Lord Great Chamberlaine, of the Princelie Robe, Where-with hee entered the Kirk, and is inveſted by the ſayd Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine in his Royall Robes.</p>
            <p>There-after, the King being brought to the Chaire on the

North ſyde of the Kirk, ſupported as formerlie, the Sword was brought by Sir William Cockburne of Langtown, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Uſher, from the Table, and delyvered to Lyon king of Armes; Who giveth it to the Lord Great Conſtable, who putteth the ſame in the Kinges hand, ſaying, SIR, <hi>Receave this kinglie Sword, for the Defence of the Fayth of CHRIST, and protection of His Kirk, and of the True Religion, as it is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie profeſſed within this kingdome, and according to the Nationall Covenant, and League and Covenant, and for executing Equitie, and Justice, and for puniſhment of all iniquitie and injuſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This done, the Great Conſtable receaveth the Sword from the King, and girdeth the ſame about his ſyde.</p>
            <p>There-after, the King ſitteth downe in his Chaire; and then the Spurres were put on him, by the Earle Matiſhall.</p>
            <p>There-after, Archibald Marquis of Argyle, having taken the Crown in his handes, the Miniſter prayed to this purpoſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the LORD would purge the Crowne from the ſinnes and tranſgreſſions of them that did reigne before Him; That it might bee a pure Crowne, That GOD would ſettle the Crowne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Kinges head: And ſince men that ſet it on, were not able to ſettle it, That the LORD would put it on, and preſerve it.</hi> And then the ſayd Marquis put the Crown on the Kings head.</p>
            <p>Which done, the Lyon king of Armes, The Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable ſtanding by him, cauſeth an Herauld, to call the whole Noble men, one by one, according to their rankes; who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming before the King, kneeling, and with their hand touching the Crowne on the Kinges head, ſware theſe wordes, <hi>By the Eternall, and Almightie GOD, who liveth and reigneth for ever; I ſhall ſupport thee to my vttermost.</hi> And when they had done, then all the Nobilitie held up their handes, and <hi>ſware to bee loyall and true ſubjects, and faythfull to the Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earle Mariſhall, with the Lyon, going to the four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Stage, The Lyon proclaymeth the Obligatorie Oath of the People; And the People holding up their handes all the tyme, did ſweare <hi>By the Eternall and Almightie GOD, who liveth and reigneth for ever, wee become your liedge men, and

            </p>
            <p>Then did the Earls and Vicounts put on their crowns; and the Lyon lykewayes put on his.</p>
            <p>Then did the Lord Chamberlayne looſe the Sword where-with the King was girded; and draw it, and delyver it drawne into the Kinges handes; and the King put it in the hands of the Great Conſtable, to carrie it naked before him.</p>
            <p>Then Iohn Earle of Craufurd &amp; Lindſay, took the Scepter, and put it in the Kinges right hand, ſaying, SIR, <hi>Receave this Scepter the ſign of Royall Power of the Kingdom, that you may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern your ſelfe right, and defend all the Christian People committed by GOD to your Charge, puniſhing the wicked, &amp; protecting the juſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did the King aſcend the Stage, attended by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Crown, and Nobilitie, &amp; was inſtalled in the Royall Throne by Archibald Marquis of Argyle, ſaying; <hi>Stand, &amp; hold faſt from henceforth, the place whereof you are the lawfull &amp; righteous Heir, by a long and lineall ſucceſsion, of your fathers; which is now delyvered vnto you, by authoritie of Almightie GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the King was ſet down upon the Throne, the Miniſter ſpoke to him a word of Exhortation, as followeth:</p>
            <p>SIR, <hi>You are ſet down vpon the Throne, in a verie difficill tyme; I ſhall therefore put you in mind of a Scripturall expreſsion of a Throne, 1.

SIR, <hi>Deſtroyers are prepared for the injustee of the Throne, I intreat you, execute Righteous Judgement; if you doe it not, your houſe will bee a Deſolation: But if you doe that which is right, GOD ſhall remove the Deſtroyers; And you ſhall bee establiſhed on your Throne; And there ſhall yet bee Dignitie in your Houſe, for your ſervants, and for your people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastlie; If Your</hi> Throne bee the Throne of the LORD, <hi>Take a word of encouragment agaynst</hi> Throne Adverſaries, <hi>Your enemies, are the enemies of the</hi> LORDS Throne: <hi>Make your peace with GOD in CHRIST, and the LORD ſhall ſcatter your enemies from the Throne; And Hee ſhall magnifie you yet in the ſight of theſe Nations, and make the miſled people ſubmit themſelves willinglie to Your Governement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SIR; <hi>If You vſe well the</hi> LORDS Throne, <hi>on which you are ſet, then the two words in the place cited, 1. Chron. 29. 23. ſpoken of Solomon ſitting on</hi> the Throne of the LORD, Hee proſpered, and all Iſrael obeyed him, <hi>ſhall belong vnto you,</hi> Your people ſhall obey you, in the LORD; and you ſhall proſper in the ſight of the Nations round about.</p>
            <p>Then the Lord Chancellour went to the four corners of the Stage, The Lyon king of Armes going before him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed his Majeſties Free Pardon, to all Breakers of Penall Statutes, and made offer thereof: Whereupon the people cryed, <hi>GOD SAVE THE KING.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the King ſupported by the Great Conſtable, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhall, and accompanied with the Chancellour, aroſe from the Throne, &amp; went out, at a door prepared for the purpoſe, to a Stage; and ſhowed himſelfe to the people without, who clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with their handes, and cryed with a lowd voyce, a long tyme, <hi>GOD SAVE THE KING.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the King returning, &amp; ſitting down upon the Throne, delyvered the Scepter, to the Earle of Craufurd and Lindſay, to bee carried before him: Thereafter the Lyon king of Arms, rehearſed the Royall Lyne of the Kings upward, to FERGUS the firſt.</p>
            <p>Then the Lyon called the Lords one by one, who kneeling
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41643:27"/>
and holding their hands betwixt the Kings hands, did ſweare theſe words, <hi>By the Eternall and Almightie GOD, who liveth and reigneth for ever, I doe become your Liedge man, and Trueth and Fayth ſhall beare vnto you, and live and die with you, agaynst all manner of Folkes whatſoever, in your ſervice, according to the Nationall Covenant, and Solemn League and Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And everie one of them kiſſed the Kings left cheek.</p>
            <p>When theſe Solemnities were ended, The Miniſter ſtanding before the King on his Throne, pronounced this Bleſſing:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The LORD bleſſe thee, and ſave thee; The LORD heare thee in the day of Trouble; The Name of the GOD of Jacob defend thee; The LORD ſend thee helpe from the Sanctuarie, and ſtrengthen thee out of Sion. Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Bleſſing pronounced, the Miniſter went to the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, and had the following Exhortation, The King ſitting ſtill upon the Throne. Yee have this day a King crowned, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into COVENANT with GOD, and his people, Look, both King and People, that yee keep this COVENANT; and beware of the breach of it: That yee may bee the more carefull to keep it, I will lay a few things before you.</p>
            <p>I remember when the Solemn League &amp; Covenant was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by both Nations, The Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmiſſionars from ENGLAND being preſent in the Eaſt Kirk of Edinburgh, a paſſage was ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. 13. Which I ſhall now agayn cite, <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> requyreth an Oath of the Nobles and people, to reſtore the morgaged lands, which they promiſed to doe; After the Oath was tendered, in the 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> hee did ſhake his lap, and ſayd, <hi>So GOD ſhake out every man from his houſe, &amp; from his labour, that performeth not his promiſe, even thus bee hee ſhaken out and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied; And all the Congregation ſayd: Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since that tyme, manie of theſe who were in Covenant, are ſhaken out of it; yea, they have ſhaken of the Covenant, and layd it aſyde. It is true, they are proſpering this day, and think that they proſper, by laying aſide the Covenant; But they wil be deceaved, That word ſpoken then, ſhall not fall to the ground, GOD ſhall ſhake them out of their poſſeſſion and emptie them for their perfidious breach of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:41643:27"/>
The ſame I ſay to King and Nobles, and all that are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; If you break that Covenant, being ſo ſolemnly ſworn, All theſe who have touched your Crown, &amp; ſworn to ſupport it, ſhall not be able to hold it on; but GOD will ſhake it off, &amp; turn you from the Throne: And ye Noble-men, who are aſſiſtant to the putting on of the Crown, &amp; ſetting the King upon the Throne, if yee ſhall either aſſiſt, or advyſe the King to break the Covenant, &amp; over-turne the Work of GOD, hee ſhall ſhake you out of your poſſeſſions, and emptie you of all your glorie.</p>
            <p>Another paſſage I offer to your ſerious conſideration, <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. 8. After that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> had promiſed to proclaime libertie to all the LORDS People, who were ſervants, &amp; entered in a Covenant hee &amp; his Princes to let them goe free, and according to the Oath had let them goe; Afterwards they cauſed the ſervants to returne, and brought them into ſubjection, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. What followeth upon this breach? <hi>verſ. 15. 16. Ye were now turned, &amp; had done right in my ſight in proclaiming libertie; but yee turned, &amp; made them ſervants again.</hi> And therefore, <hi>verſ. 18. 19. 20. 21. I will give the men who have tranſgreſſed My Covenant, who have not performed the wordes of the Covenant, which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in twain, and paſſed between the parts thereof, I will even give them into the hands of their enemies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hand of them that ſeek their lyfe, even Zedekiah and his Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the breach of a Covenant made for the Libertie of Servants was ſo puniſhed, what ſhall bee the puniſhment of the breach of a COVENANT for Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the liberty of the people of GOD? There is nothing more terrible to King and Princes, then to be given into the hand of enemies, that ſeek their lyfe. If yee would eſcape this judgement, Let King and Princes keep their Covenant made with GOD: Your enemies who ſeeke your lyfe, are in the Land, if yee breake the COVENANT, it may bee feared, GOD give you over unto them as a prey: But if yee keepe COVENANT, it may bee expected, GOD will keepe you out of their hands.</p>
            <p>Let not the place ye heard opened, bee forgotten, for in it yee have an exemple of Divine Iuſtice agaynſt <hi>Joaſh</hi> and the Princes, for breaking that COVENANT, 2. CHRON. 24. 23. The Princes who intiſed to that Breach, are deſtroyed; and in the 24. <hi>verſ.</hi> it is ſayd, <hi>The armie of the Syrians came with a ſmall companie of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41643:28"/>
men, and the LORD delyvered a verie great hoſte in their hand; becauſe they had forſaken the LORD GOD of their fathers: So they execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted judgement agaynſt Joaſh.</hi> And <hi>verſ. 25. His owne ſervantes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired agaynſt him, and ſlew him on his bed, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſpiracie of Servants or Subjects, againſt their king, is a wicked courſe: But GOD in His Righteous Iudgement ſuffereth Subjects to conſpire and rebell agaynſt their Princes; becauſe they rebell againſt GOD: And Hee ſuffereth Subjects to break the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with a king; becauſe hee breaketh the Covenant made with GOD. I may ſay freely, that a chief cauſe of the judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the kings houſe, hath been the Grand-fathers breach of Covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with GOD, &amp; the fathers following his ſteps in oppoſing the work of GOD, &amp; his Kirk within theſe kingdoms; They broke Covenant with GOD, and men have broken Covenant with them: Yea, moſt cruellie and perfidiouſlie have invaded the Royall Familie, and trodden upon all Princelie Dignitie.</p>
            <p>Bee wyſe by their exemple; You are now ſitting upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Throne of the kingdom, &amp; your Nobles about you, there is one above you, even <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> the King of <hi>Sion;</hi> and I, as His ſervant, dare not but be free with you; I charge you, Sir, in His Name, That you keep this Covenant in all points; If you ſhall break this Covenant, and come agaynſt His Cauſe; I aſſure you, the Contraverſie is not ended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween GOD and your familie: But will be carried on to the further weakening, if not the over-throw of it: But if you ſhall keep this Covenant, and befriend the KINGDOM of CHRIST, It may bee from this day, GOD ſhall begin to doe you good, Although your eſtate bee verie weake, GOD is able to rayſe you, and make you reigne, maugre the oppoſition of all your enemies: And how-ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall pleaſe the LORD to diſpoſe, you ſhall have peace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward GOD, through CHRIST the MEDIATOR.</p>
            <p>As for you who are Nobles and Peeres of the Land, your ſhare is great in this day of Coronation, yee have come and touched the Crowne, and ſworne to ſupport it, yee have handled the Sword and the Scepter, and have ſet down the King upon his Throne.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. I charge you to keepe your Covenant with GOD; and ſee that yee never bee moved your ſelves to come agaynſt it in anie head, or article thereof; and that yee give no counſell to the king
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41643:28"/>
to come againſt the Doctrine, Worſhip, Government &amp; Diſcipline of the Kirk, eſtabliſhed in this Land, as ye would eſchew the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Covenant breakers. If the King &amp; ye who are engaged to ſupport the Crowne, conſpire together againſt the Kingdome of CHRIST, both yee that doe ſupport, &amp; hee that is ſupported, will fall together. I preſſe this the more, becauſe it is a rare thing to ſee a king &amp; great men for CHRIST; In the long Catalogue of kings, which yee have heard recited this day, they will bee found few who have beene for CHRIST.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I charge you alſo, becauſe of your many Oathes to the king; That you keep them inviolablie. Bee faythfull to him, according to your Covenant, The Oathes of GOD are upon you, if directlie, or indirectlie, yee doe anie thing agaynſt his Standing, GOD, by whom yee have ſworne, will bee avenged upon you, for the breach of His Oath.</p>
            <p>And now I will ſhut up all with one word more to You, SIR, You are the only Covenanted king with GOD, &amp; His People, in the world; many have obſtructed Your entrie in it: Now ſeing the LORD hath brought You in over all theſe Obſtructions, Only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to doe what is contayned therein; and it ſhall prove an happie tyme for You, and Your Houſe. And becauſe You are entered in tymes of great Difficultie, wherin ſmal ſtrength ſeemeth to remain with You, in the eyes of the world, for recovering Your juſt power and greatneſſe; Therefore take the Counſell which <hi>David</hi> when he was a-dying, gave to his ſonne <hi>Solomon, 1. King. 2. 2. 3. Bee ſtrong, and ſhow thy ſelfe a man, and keep the Charge of the LORD thy GOD: to walke in His Wayes, and keepe His Commandements; that thou mayeſt prosper in all that thou doeſt, and whether-ſo-ever thou turneſt thy ſelfe.</hi>

            <p>Then did the Kinges Majeſtie deſcend from the Stage, with the Crown upon his head; and receaving agayn the Scepter in his hand, returned with his whole Trayn, in ſolemn manner, to his Palace, the Sword being carried before him.</p>
