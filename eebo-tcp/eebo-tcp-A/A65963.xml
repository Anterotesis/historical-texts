            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <byline>By a <hi>Student</hi> in the ſaid ART.</byline>
            <lg>
               <l>LOVE is a thing that's not on Reaſon laid,</l>
               <l>But upon Nature and her Dictates made:</l>
               <l>Fancy I mean; for that preſcribes the way,</l>
               <l>For Love at laſt, to make her Holly-Day.</l>
               <l>Our thoughts like Winds, that vary every Hour,</l>
               <l>When blowing on a Thatcht-houſe, or a Tower:</l>
               <l>Which is the Caſe, of this our Lady, then</l>
               <l>Sometimes ſhe's high, and then ſhe's ſtill agen;</l>
               <l>At laſt, Love is taken by its own Hook,</l>
               <l>Like a Sea-nimph, near, to a purling Brook:</l>
               <l>Changing its Waters, and its Element, Gay;</l>
               <l>Love, it diſcovers all, to go to Play.</l>
               <l>And then, Circkling about his belov'd Arms,</l>
               <l>And that for ever, on Loves Immortal Charms:</l>
               <l>And goes into the Chamber, of th' Marriage Bed,</l>
               <l>There to take Pleaſure, and lay down its Head.</l>
               <l>Love like a Souldier, coming to the Field,</l>
               <l>At length is Conquerr'd, and is forc'd to yield;</l>
               <l>Since every thing, does unto a Center tend</l>
               <l>The reſult of Nature, and of Friendſhips end.</l>
               <l>Love is a God! and does what it pleaſes,</l>
               <l>It Cures Wounds, and when it will, us eaſes:</l>
               <l>The Maſter Spring, of each humane deſire,</l>
               <l>Love is an Angel, of the Angelick Quire.</l>
               <l>But, now it ſeemeth: and that at the laſt,</l>
               <l>Love, like a Sea-man, does his Anchor caſt:</l>
               <l>Reſolving in Port, for to Waſh and Tallow,</l>
               <l>Let the Seas be Green, Dark, Blew or Yellow.</l>

                  </gap>or ſhe it ſeems; if any means be left,</l>
               <l>Turns Pirate, and ſo commits a Theft.</l>
               <l>Love him ſhe will, or elſe this Life depart:</l>
               <l>Love, is a thing beyond the Power of Art.</l>
               <l>It is as ſtrong as Death, we all do know,</l>
               <l>It is a thing, that ſtill doth cure our woe.</l>
               <l>Were't not for this, 'twould be no joy to Live;</l>
               <l>And in the World: and that for to ſurvive;</l>
               <l>The Powers above! on us this gift does throw,</l>
               <l>That ſo, all Pleaſures, we may fully know:</l>
               <l>Having taſted, that we Epicures, may turn,</l>
               <l>And ſo for ever, in Loves fire to burn.</l>
               <l>For, of all Annimals, Lovers are moſt bleſt,</l>
               <l>Since that's the Life, of humane happineſs;</l>
               <l>Without that, each Perſon's like to a Rat,</l>
               <l>And has no Pleaſure, except that of the Cat.</l>
               <l>For Love's a thing, diſtinguiſhes us from Beaſts,</l>
               <l>It raiſes Honour, and our Vitals Feaſts:</l>
               <l>Plants us in the form, of Virtuoſoes great,</l>
               <l>And ſo doth Crown, our frail and fickle State.</l>
               <l>Therefore at laſt, Love now has fixt its Eye,</l>
               <l>Upon a Gentleman, of much Gallantry;</l>
               <l>Like to the Eagle, reſolving for a Prey,</l>
               <l>Takes up the Kite, and marches quite away:</l>
               <l>And when that all her wild meaſures has ſown,</l>
               <l>Love is reſolv'd, to make the Town her own.</l>
               <l>Have him ſhe will, and Marry him; at laſt,</l>
               <l>Love ſhuts the Door, and then beſure all's faſt.</l>
               <l>To ſumm up all, our Gentleman doth ſay</l>
               <l>He Loves not Bog-wiggs: and that on any Lay;</l>
               <l>That his Miſtris, moſt fine, ſuch things ſhould wear,</l>
               <l>As the Tree does Fruit, in Summer of the Year.</l>
               <l>He is a Man, for Nature: only ſo,</l>
               <l>And in her Paths, with her would run and go:</l>
               <l>Would not have her, each thing from Art <hi>exchane,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For all things, but Nature, are to him moſt ſtrange.</l>
               <l>So, if Love will have it, a Marriage to be,</l>
               <l>We'l all come ſee the <hi>Ivy</hi> and <hi>Oak</hi> Tree:</l>
               <l>Twineing together, by Natures Commands,</l>
               <l>The thing is done, and the World claps Hands.</l>
