            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Publisher TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THIS excellent and elaborate <hi>Treatise</hi> of the <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> which I here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thee withall, the learned <hi>Authour</hi> of it upon his Death-bed gave me particular permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to publish; with this modest Character of it, that <hi>he hoped it was indifferent perfect, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as he intended it, if God had granted him longer life.</hi> He designed indeed to have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed it again, and to have fill'd up those many <hi>spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> which were purposely left in it for the farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and illustration of several things by more Testimonies and Instances, which probably he had in his thoughts: And it would certainly have added much to the beauty and perfection of this Work, had it pleased God that he had lived to finish it to his mind, and to have given it his last hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54099:4"/>However, as it is, it is not onely a just but an admirable Discourse upon this Subject; which many others have handled before, but he hath exhausted it: insomuch that no Argument of moment, nay hardly any Consideration properly belonging to it, hath escaped his large and comprehensive Mind. He hath said enough to silence the Controversie for ever, and to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er all wise men, of both Sides, from medling any farther with it.</p>
            <p>And I dare say that whoever shall carefully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use this <hi>Treatise</hi> will find, that this Point of the <hi>Pope's Supremacy</hi> (upon which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath the confidence to say, <hi>the whole of Christianity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends</hi>) is not onely an inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ensible, but an impudent Cause, as ever was undertaken by learned Pens. And nothing could have kept it so long from beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ridiculous in the judgment of mankind, but its being so strongly supported by a worldly interest. For there is not one tolerable Argument for it, and there are a thousand invincible Reasons against it. There is neither from Scripture, nor Reason, nor Antiquity, any evidence of it; The past and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state of <hi>Christendom,</hi> the Histories and Records of all Ages, are a perpetual Demonstration against it: And there is no other ground in the whole world for it, but that now of a long time it hath been by the Pope's <hi>Janizaries</hi> boldly asserted, and stiffly contended for without reason. So that any one might with as much colour and evidence of truth maintain, that the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> is of right, and for many Ages hath been acknowledg'd <hi>Sovereign</hi> of the whole World, as that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> is of right, and in all Ages from the beginning of Christianity hath been own'd
<pb facs="tcp:54099:4"/>
to be the <hi>Universal Monarch</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>The Pope's Supremacy</hi> I have, for the affinity of the Argument, added by way of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix</hi> another <hi>Discourse</hi> of the same <hi>Authour</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>The Unity of the Church;</hi> which he so explains as quite to take away the necessity of a <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Head</hi> over the whole Church for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its <hi>Unity,</hi> which is the onely specious, but yet a very remote pretence for the <hi>Pope's Supremacy:</hi> For if a <hi>Visible Monarch</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted necessary, many things more must be supposed, (which neither yet are, nor ever can be proved) to make the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> the Man.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Testimonies</hi> relating to both <hi>Parts,</hi> were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few of them translated by the <hi>Authour;</hi> which he certainly intended, having left spaces for it, and is since done with great care by two of his Worthy and Learned Friends of his own College.</p>
            <p>This is all the Advertisement I thought necessary.</p>

                  <head type="sub">INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p n="1">§ I. THE <hi>Roman</hi> Party doth much glory in Unity and Certainty of Doctrine, as things peculiar to them, and which no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men have any means to attain: Yet about divers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of notable consideration, in what they agree, or of what they are certain, it is hard to descry.</p>
                  <p>They pretend it very needfull that Controversies should be decided, and that they have a special knack of doing it: Yet do many Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of great weight and consequence stick on their hands unresolved, many Points<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rest in great doubt and debate among them.</p>
                  <p>The <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sect (concerning Doctrine, Practice, Laws and Customs of Discipline, Rites and Ceremonies) are of divers sorts, or built on divers grounds. 1. Some established by (pretended) general Synods. 2. Some founded on Decrees of Popes. 3. Some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained as upon Tradition, Custom, common Agreement. 4. Some which their eminent Divines or Schoolmen do commonly embrace. 5. Some prevailing by the favour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, and its zealous Dependents.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is very difficult to know wherein their Religion consisteth: for those Grounds divers times seem to clash, and accordingly their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines (some building on these, some on others) disagree.</p>
                  <p>This being so in many Points of importance, is so particularly in this.</p>
                  <p>For instance, The Head of their Church (as they call it) is, one would think, a Subject about which they should thoroughly consent, and which they by this time should have cleared from all disputes; so that (so far as their decisive faculty goeth) we might be assured where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Authority consisteth, and how far it doth extend; seeing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54099:6"/>
of that Point so nearly toucheth the heart of Religion,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Agitur de summa rei Christianae.</hi> Bell. <hi>Praef. de Rom. Pont.</hi> Vpon this one Point the very sum and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christianity depends.</note> the Faith and Practice of all Christians, the good of the Church, and peace of the world; seeing that no one Question (perhaps not all Questions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) hath created so many tragical Disturbances in Christendom, as that concerning the bounds of Papal Authority.</p>
                  <p>This disagreement of the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctours about the nature and extent of Papal Authority is a shrewd prejudice against it. If a man should sue for a piece of Land, and his Advocates (the notablest could be had, and well payed) could not find where it lieth, how it is butted and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, from whom it was conveyed to him—one would be very apt to suspect his Title. If God had instituted such an Office, it is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, we might satisfactorily know what the Nature and Use of it were: the Patents and Charters for it would declare it.</p>
                  <p>Yet for resolution in this great Case we are left to seek; they not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving either the will, or the courage, or the power to determine it. This insuperable Problem hath baffled all their infallible methods of deciding Controversies; their Traditions blundering, their Synods clashing, their Divines wrangling endlesly about what kind of thing the Pope is, and what Power he rightly may claim.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is</hi> (saith a great Divine among them) <hi>so much controversie about the plenitude of Ecclesiastical Power,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tanta est inter Doctores controversia de plenitudine Ecclesiasticae potestatis, &amp; ad quae se extendat, ut pauca sint in ea materia secura</hi>—Almain. <hi>de Auct. Eccl. cap.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>and to what things it may extend it self, that few things in that matter are secure</hi>—</p>
                  <p>This is a plain argument of the impotency of the Pope's power in judging and deciding Controversies, or of his Cause in this matter; that he cannot define a Point so nearly concerning him, and which he so much desireth an Agreement in; that he cannot settle his own Claim out of doubt; that all his Authority cannot secure it self from contest.</p>
                  <p>So indeed it is, that no Spells can allay some Spirits; and where In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests are irreconcilable, Opinions will be so.</p>
                  <p>Some Points are so tough and so touchy, that no-body dare meddle with them, fearing that their resolution will fail of success, and submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Hence even the anathematizing Definers of <hi>Trent</hi> (the boldest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers to decide Controversies that ever were) did wave this Point; the Legates of the Pope being injoined, <hi>to advertise, That they should not for any cause whatever come to dispute about the Pope's Authority.</hi>

                  <p>It was indeed wisely done of them to decline this Question, their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority not being strong enough to bear the weight of a Decision in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Roman</hi> See, (against which they could doe nothing,) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its Pretences; as appeareth by one clear instance.

                  <p>It was therefore advisedly done not to meddle with so ticklish a point. But in the mean time their Policy seemeth greater than their Charity;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54099:6"/>
which might have inclined them not to leave the world in darkness and doubt, and unresolved in a Point of so main importance; (as indeed they did in others of no small consequence, disputed among their Divines with obstinate Heat; <hi>viz.</hi> The Divine Right of Bishops, the Necessity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence, the immaculate Conception, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>The Opinions therefore among them concerning the Pope's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as they have been, so they are, and in likelihood may continue, very different.</p>
                  <p n="2">§ II. There are among them those who ascribe to the Pope an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, absolute and boundless Empire over all Persons indifferently, and in all Matters; conferred and settled on him by Divine immutable sanction: so that all men of whatever degree are obliged in conscience to believe whatever he doth authoritatively dictate, and to obey whatever he doth prescribe. So that if Princes themselves do refuse obedience to his will, he may excommunicate them, cashier them, depose them, extirpate them. If he chargeth us to hold no Communion with our Prince, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce our Allegeance to him, to abandon, oppose and persecute him even to death, we may without scruple, we must in duty obey. If he doth interdict whole Nations from the exercise of God's Worship and Service, they must comply therein. So that, according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, he is in effect Sovereign Lord of all the World; and superiour, even in Temporal or Civil matters, unto all Kings and Princes.</p>
                  <p>It is notorious, that many Canonists (if not most) and many Divines of that Party do maintain this Doctrine; affirming that all the Power of <hi>Christ (the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,</hi>

                     <hi>Go to therefore, most Holy Princes of the Apostles, and what I said, by interposing your Authority, confirm; that all men may now at length un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, if ye can bind and loose in Heaven, that ye also can upon Earth take away and give Empires, Kingdoms, and whatsoever mortals can have: for if ye can judge things belonging unto God, what is to be deemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these inferiour and profane things? And if it is your part to judge Angels, who govern proud Princes, what becometh it you to doe toward their servants? Let Kings now and all Secular Princes learn by this man's example, what ye can doe in Heaven, and in what esteem ye are with God; and let them henceforth fear to slight the commands of Holy Church: but put forth suddenly this judgment, that all men may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that not casually, but by your means this Son of iniquity doth fall from his Kingdom.</hi>

                  <p>Indeed (upon this occasion to digress a little farther) it doth not seem to have been the opinion of the ancient Popes, that they might excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their Sovereign Princes: for if they might, why did they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to exercise that power, when there was greatest reason, and great temptation for it?</p>
                  <p>Why did not Pope <hi>Julius</hi> or Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> excommunicate <hi>Constantius</hi> the great Favourer of the <hi>Arians,</hi> against whom <hi>Athanasius,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> and <hi>Lucifer Calar.</hi> do so earnestly inveigh, calling him Heretick, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and what not?

Why did that Pope not rather compell that Emperour to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by censures, than supplicate him by tears? How did so many Popes connive at <hi>Theodorick,</hi> and other Princes prosessing <hi>Arianism</hi> at their door?

                  <p>In fine, a noble Bishop above 500 years agoe did say, <hi>I reade and reade again the Records of the Roman Kings and Emperours,</hi>

                  <p>Why hath no Synod, of the many which have been held in all parts of Christendom, clearly disclaimed this Opinion; but all have let it slip, or have seemed by silence to approve it?</p>

                  <p>No man apprehending it false, seemeth capable with good conscience to hold Communion with those who profess it: for, upon supposition of its falshood, the Pope and his chief adherents are the teachers and abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the highest violation of Divine Commands, and most enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous sins, of Usurpation, Tyranny, Imposture, Perjury, Rebellion, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Rapine, and all the villanies complicated in the practical influence of this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>It seemeth clear as the Sun, that if this Doctrine be an Errour, it is one of the most pernicious Heresies that ever was vented; involving the highest Impiety, and producing the greatest Mischief.

                  <p>On the other hand, the <hi>French</hi> will not permit the Supremacy of their King in Temporals, or the Privileges of their Church in Spirituals, to be contested in their Kingdom. Nor, we may suppose, would any Prince admit a Decision prejudicial to his Authority and welfare, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting and enslaving him to the will of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court. Nor (we may hope) would any Church patiently comport with the irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable oppression of all its rights and liberties by a peremptory establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Papal Omnipotency.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor is it easie for their Dissentions to be reconciled upon Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical grounds, and authorities to which they pretend deference. For, not onely their Schools and Masters of their Doctrine do in the case disagree, but their Synods do notoriously clash.</p>
                  <p n="10">§ X. Yea even Popes themselves have shifted their pretences, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in style, according to the different circumstances of time, and their variety of humours, designs, interests.</p>
                  <p>In time of prosperity and upon advantage, when they might safely doe it, any Pope almost would talk high, and assume much to himself: but when they were low, or stood in fear of powerfull contradiction, even the boldest Popes would speak submissly or moderately. As for instance, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> I. after the second <hi>Ephesine</hi> Synod, when he had to doe with <hi>Theodosius</hi> II. did humbly supplicate, and whine pitifully; but after the Synod of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> having got the Emperour favourable, and most of the Bishops complacent to him, he ranted bravely. And we may observe, that even Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. who did swagger so boiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously against the Emperour <hi>Henry,</hi> was yet calm and mild in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests with our <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour; who had a spirit good enough for him, and was far out of his reach.</p>
                  <p>And Popes of high spirit and bold face, (such as <hi>Leo</hi> I. <hi>Gelasius</hi> I. <hi>Nic.</hi> I. <hi>Gregory</hi> II. <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. <hi>Innocent</hi> III. <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. <hi>Julius</hi> II. <hi>Paul</hi> IV. <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. <hi>Paulus</hi> V. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) as they did ever aspire to scrue Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal authority to the highest peg; so would they strain their language in commendation of their See as high as their times would bear. But other Popes of meeker and modester disposition, (such as <hi>Julius</hi> I. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastasius</hi> II. <hi>Gregory</hi> I. <hi>Leo</hi> II. <hi>Adrian</hi> VI. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) were content to let things stand as they found them, and to speak in the ordinary style of their times; yet so, that few have let their Authority to goe backward or decline.</p>
                  <p>We may observe, that the pretences and language of Popes have va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried according to several periods, usually growing higher as their State grew looser from danger of opposition or controll.</p>
                  <p>In the first times, while the Emperours were Pagans, their pretences were suted to their condition, and could not soar high; they were not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54099:14"/>
then so mad as to pretend to any Temporal Power, and a pittance of Spiritual eminency did content them.</p>
                  <p>When the Empire was divided,<note place="margin">P. Nich. <hi>ad Imp.</hi> Mich. <hi>p.</hi> 511, <hi>&amp;</hi> 513.</note> they could sometimes be more haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and peremptory; as being in the West, shrowded under the wing of the Emperours there, (who commonly did affect to improve their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in competition to that of other Bishops) and at distance from the reach of the Eastern Emperour.</p>
                  <p>The cause of <hi>Athanasius</hi> having produced the <hi>Sardican</hi> Canons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Revision of some causes by the Popes, by colour of them they did hugely enlarge their Authority, and raise their style; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the West, where they had great advantages of augmenting their Power.</p>
                  <p>When the Western Empire was fallen, their influence upon that part of the Empire which came under protection of the Eastern Emperours rendring them able to doe service or disservice to those Emperours, they, according to the state of Times and the need of them, did talk more big, or more tamely.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> III. having by compliance with the Usurper <hi>Phocas</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a declaration from him concerning the Headship of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, did make a considerable step forward toward the height of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Greatness.</p>
                  <p>After that Pope <hi>Greg.</hi> II. had withdrawn <hi>Italy</hi> from the Oriental Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and <hi>Rome</hi> had grown in a manner loose and independent from other secular powers; in the confusions of the West, the Pope interposing to arbitrate between Princes, trucking and bartering with them, as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on served, for mutual aid and countenance, did grow in Power, and answerably did advance his pretences.</p>
                  <p>The spurious Decretal Epistles of the ancient Popes (which asserted to the Pope high degrees of Authority) being foisted into mens hands, and insensibly creeping into repute, did inspire the Pope with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to invade all the ancient Constitutions, Privileges and Liberties of Churches; and having got such interest every-where, he might say what he pleased, no Clergy-man daring to check or cross him. Having drawn to himself the final decision of all Causes, having got a finger in disposal of all Preferments, having by Dispensations, Exemptions and Grants of privileges tyed to him so many Dependents, what might not he say or doe?</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. being a man of untameable Spirit, and taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the distractions and corruptions of his Times, did venture to pull a feather with the Emperour; and with success having mated him, did set up a peremptory claim to Sovereignty over all Persons in all Causes.</p>
                  <p>In his footsteps his Successours have trodden, being ever ready upon occasion to plead such a title, and to practise according to it. No Pope would foregoe any Power which had been claimed by his Predecessours. And Popes would ever be sure to have dancers after their pipe, number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less abetters of their pretences.</p>
                  <p>No wonder then that persons deferring much regard to the Authority of Popes, and accommodating their conceits to the Dictates of them, (or of persons depending on them,) should in their opinions vary about the nature and extent of Papal Authority; it having never been fixed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in certain bounds, or having in several Ages continued the same thing.</p>

Wherefore intending by God's help to discuss the pretended Authority of the Pope, and to shew that He by no Divine institution, and by no immutable right, hath any such Power as he doth claim; by reason of this perplexed variety of Opinions I do find it difficult to state the Question, or to know at what distinct mark I should level my Discourse.</p>
                  <p n="12">§ XII. But seeing his pretence to any Authority in Temporals, or to the Civil Sword, is so palpably vain, that it hardly will bear a serious dispute, having nothing but impudence and sophistry to countenance it; seeing so many in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion do reject it, and have substantially confuted it; seeing now most are ashamed of it, and very few, (even among those Sects which have been its chief Patrons) will own it;<note place="margin">

                  <p n="13">§ XIII.

                  <p>There are those who maintain, that the Pope cannot subvert or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Rights and Liberties of particular Churches, settled in them agreeably to the ancient Canons of the Church Universal.</p>

                  <p>For those Divines by the Pope and his intimate confidents are looked upon as a mongrel brood, or mutinous faction;<note place="margin">

                  <p>Nor indeed do those men seem to adhere to the <hi>Roman</hi> Party out of entire judgment or cordial affection; but in compliance with their Princes, or upon account of their Interest, or at best with regard to peace and quiet. They cannot conveniently break with the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Interest is twisted with their own, so as not easily to be disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled.</p>
                  <p>For how can they heartily stick to the Pope, whenas their Opinion doth plainly imply him to be an Usurper and a Tyrant, (claiming to himself, and exercising authority over the Church, which doth not rightfully belong to him;) to be a Rebel and Traitour against the Church, (invading and possessing the Sovereignty due to it; for such questionless the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> would be, should he challenge and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to himself such a Power over his Commonwealth, as the Pope hath
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54099:18"/>

                  <p>How can they honestly condemn those who (upon such grounds) do shake off such yokes, refusing to comply with the Pope, till he correct his Errours, till he desist from those Usurpations and Impostures, till he restore to the Church its Rights and Liberties?</p>
                  <p>How are the Doctrines of those men consistent or congruous to their practice? For they call the Pope Monarch of the Church, and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Pastour of Christians, by God's appointment, indefectibly; yet will they not admit all his Laws, and reject Doctrines which he teacheth, particularly those which most nearly touch him, concerning his own Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Authority. They profess themselves his loyal Subjects, yet pretend Liberties which they will maintain against him.<note place="margin">

                        <p>It is a manifest argument of Schism, when any man withdraws himself from Communion with the Apostolick See.</p>
                     </note> They hold that all are bound to entertain Communion with him, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that he may be heretical, and seduce into Errour. They give him the name and shadow of a Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but so that they can void the substance and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof.</p>
                  <p>In fine, where should we seek for the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but at <hi>Rome,</hi> or from <hi>Rome</hi> it self? where these Doctrines are Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxies.</p>

                     <p>Upon such grounds it may be reasonable to allow Saint <hi>Peter</hi> a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of order; such an one as the Ring-leader hath in a Dance, as the primipilar Centurion had in the Legion, or the Prince of the Senate had there, in the <hi>Roman</hi> State; at least, as among Earls, Baronets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and others co-ordinate in degree, yet one hath a precedence of the rest.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. For such a Power (being of so great importance) it was needfull that a Commission from God, its Founder, should be granted in down-right and perspicuous terms; that no man concerned in duty grounded thereon, might have any doubt of it, or excuse for boggling at it; <note n="*" place="margin">It was a reasonable demand, which was made to our Saviour, <hi>Tell us by what authority thou doest these things, or who is he that gave thee this authority? (Luke</hi> 20.2.) and the reasonableness, of it our Lord did often avow, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that if by his doctrine and works he had not vouched the divinity of his authority, it had been no sin to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or reject him, (<hi>John</hi> 5.31, 36.10.25, 37.15.22, 24.)</note> it was necessary not onely for the Apostles to bind and warrant their Obedience, but also for us, because it is made the sole foundation of a like duty incumbent on us; which we cannot hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily discharge without being assured of our obligation thereto, by clear revelation, or promulgation of God's will in the Holy Scripture; for it was of old a current and ever will be a true Rule, which St. <hi>Austin</hi> in one case thus expresseth,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Credo etiam hinc divinorum eloquiorum clarissima authoritas esset, si homo sine dispendio promissae salutis ignorare non pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set.</hi> Aug. <hi>de pecc. mer. &amp; rem.</hi> 2.36.</note> 
                        <hi>I do believe that also on this side there would be most clear authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Divine Oracles, if a man could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it, without damage of his salvation</hi>; and <hi>Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantius</hi> thus, <hi>Those things can have no foundation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nullum fundamentum, aut firmitatem possunt habere, quae nullis divinarum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum fulciuntur oraculis.</hi> Lact. 7.2.</note> 
                        <hi>or firmness, which are not sustained by any Oracle of God's word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But apparently no such Commission is extant in Scripture; the allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for it being, as we shall hereafter shew, no-wise clear, nor proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expressive of any such Authority granted by God; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary divers clearer testimonies are producible derogating from it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If so illustrious an Office was instituted by our Saviour, it is strange that no-where in the Evangelical or Apostolical History (wherein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers acts and passages of smaller moment are recorded) there should be any express mention of that Institution; there being not onely much reason for such a report, but many pat occasions for it: The time when Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was vested with that Authority; the manner and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Installment therein; the nature, rules and limits of such an Office had surely well deserved to have been noted, among other occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences relating to our Faith and Discipline, by the Holy Evangelists;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54099:23"/>
no one of them, in all probability, could have forborn punctually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a matter of so great consequence, as the settlement of a Monarch in God's Church, and a Sovereign of the Apostolical College; (from whom so eminent Authority was to be derived to all posterity, for compliance wherewith the whole Church for ever must be accountable;) particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly it is not credible that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> should quite slip over so notable a passage,<note place="margin">Luke 1.1.—</note> who <hi>had</hi> (as he telleth us) <hi>attained a perfect understanding of all things, and had undertaken to write in order the things that were sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed among Christians</hi> in his time; of which things this if any, was one of the most considerable.</p>
                     <p>The time of his receiving Institution to such Authority can hardly be assigned. For was it when he was constituted by our Lord an Apostle? Then indeed probably he began to obtain all the primacy and preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence he ever had;<note place="margin">Matth. 10.1.</note> but no such power doth appear then conferred on him, or at any time in our Saviour's life; at least, if it was, it was so covertly and indiscernibly, that both he himself, and all the Apostles must be ignorant thereof, who a little before our Lord's Passion did more than once earnestly contest about Superiority. And it is observable, that whereas our Lord before his Passion did carefully teach and press on the Apostles the chief duties, which they were to observe in their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour toward each other,<note place="margin">Mark 9.50. John 13.34.15.12.17.21. John 13.14.</note> The maintenance of peace, of charity, of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of humility toward one another; yet of paying due respect and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to this Superiour he said nothing to them.</p>
                     <p>The collation of that Power could not well be at any time before the celebration of our Lord's Supper, because before that time Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was scarce an Ecclesiastical Person; at least he was no Priest, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of <hi>Trent</hi> under a curse doth require us to believe;<note place="margin">

                        <hi>who should be the greatest</hi>; and for satisfaction presumed to enquire of our Lord about it; whenas they surely were very ignorant of Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s being their head, so there was a fair occasion as could be of our Lord's instructing them in that point, and injoyning their duty towards him; but he did not so, but rather taught him together with the rest not to pretend to any such thing, as preferment above the rest; <hi>He sitting down called the twelve and said unto them, If any one desire to be first,</hi>

                     <p>This interpretation, however strained and earnestly impugned by Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> I will not discuss; but onely shall observe, that it being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted doth rather strengthen than weaken our discourse: for, if Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> were Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Governour, it maketh Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to an act in all appearance indecent, irregular and scandalous; and how can we imagine, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> would have complotted to the imparing his own just Authority in the eye of a great Church? doth not such a condescension imply in him a disavowing of Superiority over Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> or a conspiracy with him to overthrow good Order?</p>

                     <p>In fine, the drift of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in reporting those passages concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himself, was not to disparage the other Apostles, nor merely to commend himself, but to fence the truth of his Doctrine, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the liberty of his Disciples against any prejudice that might arise from any authority, that might be pretended in any considerable respects superiour to his, and alledged against them; to which purpose he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by arguments and matters of fact, that his Authority was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apostolical, and equal to the greatest; even to that of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the prime Apostle, of Saint <hi>John</hi> the beloved Disciple, of Saint <hi>James</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; the judgment or practice of whom, was no law to him, nor should be to them farther than it did consist with that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which he by an independent Authority,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.12.</note> and by special <hi>revelation from Christ</hi> did preach unto them: He might (as St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> noteth) have pretended <hi>to some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over them,</hi>

Saint <hi>Peter</hi> dyed long before Saint <hi>John</hi> (as all agree) and perhaps before divers others of the Apostles. Now, after his departure, did the Church want a Head? (then it might before, and after have none; and our Adversaries lose the main ground of their pretence) did one of the Apostles become Head? (which of them was it; upon what ground did he assume the Headship, or who conferred it on him; who ever did acknowledge any such thing, or where is there any report about it?) was any other person made Head? (suppose the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who onely pretendeth thereto;) then did Saint <hi>John,</hi> and other Apostles become subject to one in degree inferiour to them; then what becometh of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>first Apostles,</hi>

                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p n="4">4. This interpretation also doth not well consist with our Lord's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the contests, inquiries and petitions of his Disciples concerning the point of Superiority; for doth he not (if the <hi>Roman</hi> expositions be good) seem upon those occasions not onely to dissemble his own word and promise, but to disavow them or thwart them? can we conceive, that he would in such a case of doubt forbear to resolve them, clearly to instruct them, and admonish them of their duty?</p>

Taking the Rock as they would have it to be the Person of Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and that on him the Church should be built, yet do not the words being a Rock probably denote government; for what resemblance is there between being a Rock and a Governour; at least what assurance can there be that this <hi>metaphor</hi> precisely doth import that sense; seeing in other respects, upon as fair similitudes, he might be called so?</p>

                     <p>Whence according to a prudent estimation of things in such a case, the silence or sparingness of the first sort is of more consideration on the one hand, than the speech, how free soever, of the latter is on the other hand: and we may rather suppose those titles do not belong to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> because the first do not give them, than that they do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the other are so liberal in doing it.</p>
                     <p>Indeed if we consult the Testimonies of this kind alledged by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists,</hi> who with their utmost diligence have raked all ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings for them, it is strange that they cannot find any very ancient ones; that they can find so few plausible ones; that they are fain (to make up the number) to produce so many, which evidently have no force or pertinency; being onely commendations of his Apostolical Office, or of his Personal Merits, without relation to others.</p>

                     <p>AGainst which <hi>Supposition</hi> I do assert, that admitting a Primacy of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> of what kind or to what purpose soever, we yet have reason to deem it merely personal, and (not according to its grounds and its design) communicable to any Successours, nor indeed in effect conveyed to any such.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. His Primacy was grounded upon personal acts (such as his chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full following of <hi>Christ,</hi> his faithfull confessing of <hi>Christ,</hi> his resolute adherence to <hi>Christ,</hi> his embracing special Revelations from God) or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on personal graces (his great Faith, his special love to our Lord, his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular zeal for <hi>Christ</hi>'s Service) or upon personal gifts and endowments (his courage, resolution, activity, forwardness in apprehension, and in speech) the which advantages are not transient, and consequently a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminency built on them is not in its nature such.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p>That the case was peculiar, and there doth appear a special reason, why one of the Apostles should be designed to make a constant residence at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and consequently to preside there like a Bishop. For <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> was the <hi>Metropolis,</hi> the Fountain, the Centre of the Christian Religion, where it had birth, where was greatest matter and occasion of propagating the Gospel, most people disposed to embrace it resorting thither; where the Church was very numerous, consisting, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> (or Saint <hi>James</hi> in him) doth intimate,<note place="margin">Act. 21.20.</note>

                     <p>But there was no need of fixing an Apostle at other places; nor doth it appear that any was so fixed; especially Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was uncapable of such an employment, requiring settlement and constant attendance, who beside his general Apostleship, had a peculiar Apostleship of the dispersed <hi>Jews</hi> committed to him; who therefore was much engaged in travel for propagation of the Faith, and edifying his Converts every where.</p>

                     <p>THIS Assertion to be very uncertain, yea to be most false, I shall by divers considerations evince.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If any of the former <hi>Suppositions</hi> be uncertain, or false, this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, standing on those legs, must partake of those defects, and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably be dubious, or false. If either <hi>Peter</hi> was not Monarch of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, or if his privileges were not successive, or if he were not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> at his decease, then farewell the <hi>Romish</hi> claim; if any of those things be dubious, it doth totter; if any of them prove false, then down it falleth.</p>
                     <p>But that each of them is false, hath I conceive been sufficiently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; that all of them are uncertain, hath at least been made evident.</p>
                     <p>The Structure therefore cannot be firm, which relieth on such props.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Even admitting all those <hi>Suppositions,</hi> the inference from them is not assuredly valid. For Saint <hi>Peter</hi> might have an Universal Jurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he might derive it by Succession, he might be Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; yet no such Authority might hence accrue to the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop, his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour in that See.</p>
                     <p>For that Universal Jurisdiction might be derived into another Chanel; and the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> might in other respects be Successour to him, without being so in this.</p>
                     <p>As for instance in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, before any Rule of Succession was established therein, the Emperour was Sovereign Governour, and he might dye <hi>Consul</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> having assumed that place to himself; yet when he dyed, the Supreme Authority did not lapse into the hands of the Consul, who succeeded him, but into the hands of the Senate, and People: his Consular Authority onely going to his Successour in that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. So might Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s Universal Power be transferred unto the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical

                     <p>As the whole body of Pastours was highly concerned in that Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so it was reasonable that all of them should concur in designation of a Person thereto; it is not reasonable, to suppose, that either God would institute, or Saint <hi>Peter</hi> by will should devise a course of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in such a case, so unequal and unsatisfactory.</p>

                     <p>For instance, <hi>Adam</hi> was by God constituted Universal Sovereign of mankind; and into that Power his eldest Son of right did succeed; and so it of right should have been continually propagated.</p>

                           <p>Neither is it likely that our Lord Christ would not have revealed to his Apostles a thing so necessary for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the Unity of the Church.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. To enforce this Argument, we may consider, that the Evangelists do speak about the propagation, settlement, and continuance of our Lord's Kingdom; that the Apostles do often treat about the state of the Church, and its edification, order, peace, unity; about the distinction of its Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Members, about the qualifications, duties, graces, privileges of Spiritual Governours and Guides; about prevention and remedy of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, Schisms, Disorders; upon any of which occasions how is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that the mention of such a Spiritual Monarch (who was to have a main influence on each of those particulars) should wholly escape them, if they had known such an one instituted by God?</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Whereas also the Scripture doth inculcate duties of all sorts, and doth not forget frequently to press duties of respect and obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward particular Governours of the Church; is it not strange that it never should bestow one precept, whereby we might be instructed and admonished to pay our duty to the Universal Pastour? especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, that God who directed the Pens of the Apostles, and who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that their Writings should continue for the perpetual instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christians, did foresee, how requisite such a precept would be to secure that duty; for if but one such precept did appear, it would doe the business, and void all contestation about it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

Whereas this Doctrine is pretended to be a Point of Faith, of vast consequence to the subsistence of the Church and to the Salvation of men, it is somewhat strange, that it should not be inserted into any one ancient Summary of things to be believed (of which Summaries divers remain, some composed by publick consent, others by persons of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency in the Church) nor by fair and forcible consequence should be deducible from any Article in them;<note place="margin">

                     <p n="11">11. It is more wonderfull, that this Point should never be defined, in downright and full terms, by any ancient Synod; it being so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously in those old times opposed by divers, who dissented in opinion, and discorded in practice from the Pope; it being also a Point of that consequence, that such a solemn declaration of it would have much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the ruine of all particular Errours and Schisms, which were maintained then in opposition to the Church.</p>

Indeed had this Point been allowed by the main Body of Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Bishops, the Pope could not have been so drowsie or stupid, as not to have solicited for such a definition thereof; nor would the Bishops have been backward in compliance thereto; it being, in our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries conceit, so compendious and effectual a way of suppressing all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, Schisms and Disorders; (although indeed later Experience hath shewed it no less available to stifle Truth, Justice and Piety:) The Popes after <hi>Luther</hi> were better advised, and so were the Bishops adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to his Opinions.</p>

Whereas also it is most apparent, that many persons disclaimed this Authority, not regarding either the Doctrines or Decrees of the Popes; it is wonderfull, that such men should not be reckoned in the large Catalogues of Hereticks; wherein Errours of less obvious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and of far less importance did place men; If <hi>Epiphanius, Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, Leontius,</hi> &amp;c. were so negligent or unconcerned, yet St. <hi>Austin, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastrius,</hi>—Western men, should not have overlooked this sort of desperate Hereticks; <hi>Aerius</hi> for questioning the dignity of Bishops is set among the Hereticks, but who got that name for disavowing the Pope's Supremacy,

Whereas no Point avowed by Christians could be so apt to raise offence and jealousie in Pagans against our Religion as this, which setteth up a Power of so vast extent, and huge influence; whereas no novelty could be more surprizing or startling, than the Erection of an Universal Empire over the Consciences and religious Practices of men; whereas also this Doctrine could not but be very conspicuous and glaring in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary practice; it is prodigious, that all Pagans should not loudly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim against it.</p>

                     <p>It is admirable, that the Emperours themselves, enslamed with emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and suspicion of such an Authority (the which hath been so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble even to Christian Princes) should not in their Edicts expresly decry and impugn it; that indeed every one of them should not with extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest violence implacably strive to extirpate it.</p>
                     <p>In consequence of these things it may also seem strange, that none of the Advocates of our Faith (<hi>Justin, Origen, Tertullian, Arnobius, Cyril, Austin</hi>) should be put to defend it, or so much as forced to mention it, in their elaborate Apologies for the Doctrines and Practices, which were reprehended by any sort of Adversaries thereto.</p>

                     <p>If it be objected, that these discourses are negative, and therefore of small force; I answer, that therefore they are most proper to assert such a negative proposition; for how can we otherwise better shew a thing not to be, than by shewing it to have no footstep there, where it is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to stand? how can we more clearly argue a matter of right to want proof, than by declaring it not to be extant in the Laws grounding such right; not taught by the Masters, who profess to instruct in such things; not testifyed in records concerning the exercise of it? such arguments indeed in such cases are not merely negative, but rather privative; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving things not to be, because not affirmed there, where in reason they ought to be affirmed; standing therefore upon positive Suppositions, that Holy Scripture, that general tradition are not imperfect and lame toward their design; that ancient Writers were competently intelligent, faithfull, diligent; that all of them could not conspire in perpetual si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence about things, of which they had often fair occasion, and great reason to speak: In fine, such considerations, however they may be deluded by Sophistical Wits, will yet bear great sway, and often will amount near to the force of demonstration, with men of honest pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

                        <hi>With us the Bishops do hold the places of the Apostles; with them, a Bishop is in the third place; for they have for the first rank the Patriarchs of Pepusa in Phrygia; for the second those whom they call Cenones; so are Bishops thrust down into the third, that is almost the last place; as if thence Religion became more stately, if that which is first with us, be the last with them:</hi> Now doth not St. <hi>Hierome</hi> here affirm that every Bishop hath the place of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and the first rank in the Church? doth not he tax the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Order above this? may not the Popish Hierarchy most patly be compared to that of the <hi>Montanists,</hi> and is it not equally liable to the censure of St. <hi>Hierome?</hi> doth it not place the <hi>Roman</hi> Pope in the first place, and the <hi>Cardinals</hi> in the second, detruding the Bishops into a third place?

                     <p>In fine, it cannot well be conceived, that the Ancients constantly would have spoken in this manner, if they had allowed the Papal Office to be such, as now it doth bear it self; the which indeed is an Order no less distant from Episcopacy, than the rank of a King differeth from that of the meanest Baron in his Kingdom.</p>

                     <p>What doth all that pomp of Religion serve for, but for ostentation of the dignity of those who administer it: It may be pretended for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Religion, but it really conduceth to the glory of the Priesthood; who shine in those pageantries.</p>
                     <p>Why is Monkery (although so very different from that which was in the ancient times) so cryed up as a superlative state of perfection; but that it filleth all places with swarms of lusty People, who are vowed ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to him, and have little else to doe but to advance that Authority, by which they subsist in that dronish way of life?</p>

                     <p>Whereas indeed our Lord had never any such design, to set up a sort of men in such distance above their brethren; to perk over them, and suck them of their goods by tricks; it onely did charge People to allow their Pastours a competent maintenance for a sober life, with a moderate respect, as was needfull for the common benefit of God's People; whom they were, with humility and meekness, to instruct and guide in the plain and simple way of Piety.</p>
                     <p>This is a grievous inconvenience; there being nothing wherein the Church is more concerned than in the preservation of its Doctrine pure and incorrupt from the leaven of hurtfull errours, influential on practice.</p>

                     <p>While particular Churches do retain their liberty, and Pastours their original co-ordination in any measure, if any Church or Bishop shall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to broach any novel Doctrine or Practice of bad import, the others may endeavour to stop the settlement or progress of them; each Church at least may keep it self sound from contagion.</p>
                     <p>But when all Churches and Bishops are reduced into subjection to one Head, supported by the guards of his Authority, who will dare to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, or be able to withstand, what he shall say or doe? It will then be deemed high presumption, contumacy, rebellion, to dissent from his determinations how false soever, or tax the practices countenanced by him however irregular and culpable.</p>

                     <p>No errour can be so palpable, which that Authority will not protect and shroud from confutation; no practice so enormous, which it will not palliate, and guard from reproof.</p>

                     <p>It is fit, that every Prince, should in all things govern all his Subjects; and none should be exempted from subordination to his Authority: As Philosophers, and Physicians of the Body; so Priests, and Physicians of the Soul; not in exercising their Function, but in taking care that they do exercise it duly for the honour of God, and in consistence with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good: otherwise many grievous inconveniences must ensue.</p>
                     <p>It is of perillous consequence, that foreigners should have authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive influence upon the Subjects of any Prince; or have a power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle in affairs.</p>
                     <p>Princes have a natural Right to determine with whom their Subjects shall have intercourse; which is inconsistent with a Right of foreigners to govern or judge them in any case, without their leave.</p>
                     <p>Every Prince is obliged to employ the power entrusted to him, to the furtherance of God's Service, and encouragement of all good works; as a Supreme power, without being liable to obstruction from any other power.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Common practice is a good Interpreter of common sentiments in any case; and it therefore sheweth that in the primitive Church the Pope was not deemed to have a right of Universal Sovereignty; for if such a thing had been instituted by God, or established by the Apostles, the Pope certainly with evident clearness would have appeared to have pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed it; and would have sometimes (I might say frequently, yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually) have exercised it in the first Ages; which that he did not at all, we shall make, I hope, very manifest by reflecting on the chief pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages occurring then; whereof indeed there is scarce any one, which duly weighed doth not serve to overthrow the <hi>Roman</hi> pretence; but that matter I reserve to another place; and shall propound other conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, declaring the sense of the Fathers; onely I shall add, that indeed</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The state of the most primitive Church did not well admit such an universal Sovereignty. For that did consist of small bodies incoherently situated and scattered about in very distant places, and consequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be modelled into one political Society, or to be governed by one Head. Especially considering their condition under Persecution and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. What convenient resort for Direction or Justice could a few di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed Christians in <hi>Egypt, Ethiopia, Parthia, India, Mesopotamia, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Armenia, Cappadocia,</hi> and other Parts have to <hi>Rome?</hi> what trouble, what burthen had it been to seek Instruction, Succour, Decision of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses thence? Had they been obliged or required to doe so, what offences, what clamours would it have raised? seeing that afterward, when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom was connected, and compacted together; when the state of Christians was flourishing and prosperous, when passages were open,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54099:81"/>
and the best of opportunities of correspondence were afforded, yet the setting out of these pretences did cause great oppositions and stirs; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exercise of this Authority, when it had obtained most vigour, did produce so many grievances, so many complaints, so many courses to check and curb it, in Countries feeling the inconveniences and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs springing from it?</p>
                     <p>The want of the like in the first Ages is a good Argument, that the cause of them had not yet sprung up; Christendom could not have been so still, if there had been then so meddlesome a body in it, as the Pope now is.</p>

                     <p>Wherefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself doth confess, that in those times, before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod <hi>the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Pope was not a little hindred, so that because of continual persecutions he could not freely exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Church therefore could so long subsist without the use of such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by the vigilance of Governours over their Flocks, and the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correspondence of neighbour Churches: And if he would let it alone, it might do so still.</p>
                     <p>That could be no Divine Institution, which had no vigour in the first and best times; but an Innovation raised by Ambition.</p>

                     <p>Thus I conceive the <hi>Metropolitical</hi> governance was introduced, by humane prudence following considerations of publick necessity or uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: There are indeed some, who think it was instituted by the Apostles; but their Arguments do not seem convincing, and such a constitution doth not (as I take it) well sute to the state of their times, and the course they took in founding Churches.</p>

                           <p>But there is difference between a General Synod, and an Italian Synod: and what had an Italian Synod to prescribe to all the Provinces of the Roman Empire, or rather of the West? <hi>P.</hi> Greg. <hi>I. Ep.</hi> 7, 8.</p>

It indeed turned to a great advantage of the Pope, in carrying on his Encroachments, and enlarging his worldly Interests, that the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Churches did not, as the Eastern, conform themselves to the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical frame in embracing <hi>Diocesan</hi> Primacies; which would have enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and enabled them better to protect the Liberties of their Churches from Papal Invasions.<note place="margin">

For hence for want of a better, the Pope did claim to himself a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal authority over the Western Churches; pretending a right of calling to Synods, of meddling in Ordinations, of determining Causes by appeal to him; of dictating Laws and Rules to them, against the old rights of Metropolitans, and the later Constitutions for Primacies.</p>
                     <p>Of this we have an Instance in St. <hi>Gregory</hi>; where he alledging an Imperial Constitution importing that in case a Clergy-man should appeal from his Metropolitan, <hi>the cause should be referred to the Archbishop and Patriarch of that Diocese, who judging according to the Canons and Laws should give an end thereto</hi>; doth consequentially assume an appeal from a Bishop to himself,<note place="margin">

                     <p n="10">10. Having got such advantage, and as to extent stretched his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity beyond the bounds of <hi>his sub-urbicarian precincts,</hi>

                     <p>The ancient Order did allow a Patriarch or Primate to call a Synod of the Bishops in his Diocese, and with them to determine Ecclesiastical Affairs by majority of suffrages; but he doth not doe so, but setting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self down in his Chair with a few of his Courtiers about him, doth make Decrees and Dictates, to which he pretendeth all must submit.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Order did allow a Patriarch to ordain Metropolitans duly elected in their Dioceses; leaving Bishops to be ordained by the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans in their Provincial Synods; but he will meddle in the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every Bishop, suffering none to be constituted without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, for which he must soundly pay.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Order did allow a Patriarch, with the advice and consent of his Synod to make Canons for the well ordering his Diocese; but he sendeth about his Decretal Letters, composed by an infallible Secretary, which he pretendeth must have the force of Laws, equal to the highest Decrees of the whole Church.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Order did suppose Bishops by their Ordination sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to render unto their Patriarch due observance, according to the Canons, he being liable to be judged in a Synod for the transgression of his duty; but he forceth all Bishops to take the most slavish oaths of obedience to him that can be imagined.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Order did appoint that Bishops accused for offences should be judged in their Provinces; or upon appeal from them in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal Synods: but he receiveth appeals at the first hand, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54099:90"/>
them in his Court, without calling such a Synod in an age for any such purpose.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Patriarchs did order all things, as became good Subjects, with leave and under submission to the Emperour, who as he pleased did interpose his confirmation of their Sanctions: but this man preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to decree what he pleaseth without the leave, and against the will of Princes.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore he is not a Patriarch of the Western Churches, (for that he acteth according to no Patriarchal Rule) but a certain kind of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord, or a tyrannical Oppressour of them.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. In all the transactions for modelling the Church there never was allowed to the Pope any dominion over his Fellow-patriarchs,<note place="margin">Isid. <hi>in dist.</hi> 21. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</note> or of those great Primates who had assumed that name to themselves; among whom indeed, for the dignity of his City, he had obtained a priority of honour or place; but never had any power over them setled by a title of Law, or by clear and uncontested practice.</p>
                     <p>Insomuch, that if any of them had erred in Faith, or offended in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, it was requisite to call a General Synod to judge them; as in the cases of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> of <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> of <hi>Theophilus</hi> and St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> of <hi>Nestorius</hi> and of <hi>Dioscorus</hi>— is evident.</p>

                     <p>They without his leave or notice did call and celebrate Synods (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all the first great Synods are instances) their Ordinations were not confirmed or touched by him; Appeals were not (with publick regard or allowance) thence made to him in causes great or little, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided them among themselves: they quashed Heresies springing up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, as the Second General Synod the <hi>Macedonians, Theophilus</hi> the <hi>Origenists,</hi> &amp;c. Little in any case had his Worship to doe with them or they with him, beyond what was needfull to maintain general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and correspondence with him; which they commonly, as piety obliged, were willing to doe.</p>
                     <p>And sometimes, when a pert Pope, upon some incidental advantage of differences risen among them, would be more busie than they deemed convenient in tampering with their affairs, they did rap his fingers: so <hi>Victor,</hi> so <hi>Stephanus,</hi> so <hi>Julius</hi> and <hi>Liberius</hi> of old did feel to their smart; so afterward <hi>Damasus</hi> and other Popes in the case of <hi>Flavianus; Innocent</hi> in the case of St. <hi>Chrysostome; Felix</hi> and his Successours in the case of <hi>Acacius</hi> did find little regard had to their interposals.</p>
                     <p>So things proceeded, till at length a final rupture was made between them, and they would not suffer him at all to meddle with their affairs.</p>
                     <p>Before I proceed any farther I shall briefly draw some Corollaries from this Historical account which I have given of the original and growth of <hi>Metropolitical, Primatical</hi> and <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Jurisdiction.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Patriarchs are an humane Institution.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:54099:91"/>2. As they were erected by the power and prudence of men, so they may be dissolved by the same.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They were erected by the leave and confirmation of Princes; and by the same they may be dejected, if great reason do appear.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Patriarchate of the Pope beyond his own Province or Diocese doth not subsist upon any Canon of a General Synod.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He can therefore claim no such power otherwise than upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion or assumption.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Primates and Metropolitans of the Western Church cannot be supposed otherwise than by force or out of fear to have submitted to such an authority as he doth usurp.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. It is not really a Patriarchal Power (like to that which was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Canons, and Princes) but another sort of power which the Pope doth exercise.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The most rightfull Patriarch, holding false Doctrine, or imposing unjust Laws, or tyrannically abusing his power may and ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected from communion.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Such a Patriarch is to be judged by a free Synod, if it may be had.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If such a Synod cannot be had by consent of Princes, each Church may free it self from the mischiefs induced by his perverse doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine or practice.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. No Ecclesiastical Power can interpose in the management of any affairs within the Territory of any Prince without his concession.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. By the Laws of God and according to ancient Practice Princes may model the bounds of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, erect Bishopricks, enlarge, diminish, or transfer them as they please.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Wherefore each Prince (having Supreme Power in his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and equal to what the Emperour had in his) may exclude any foreign Prelate from Jurisdiction in his Territories.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. It is expedient for peace and publick good that he should doe thus.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Such Prelate, according to the rules of Christianity, ought to be content with his doing so.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Any Prelate, exercising power in the Dominion of any Prince, is <hi>eatenus,</hi> his Subject: as the Popes and all Bishops were to the Roman Emperours.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Those joints of Ecclesiastical Discipline, established in the Roman Empire by the confirmation of Emperours, were (as to necessary conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance) dissolved by the dissolution of the Roman Empire.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. The power of the Pope in the Territories of any Prince did sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist by his authority and favour.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. By the same reason as Princes have curbed the exorbitancy of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power in some cases (of entertaining Legats, making Appeals, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of Benefices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) by the same they might exclude it.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. The practice of Christianity doth not depend upon the subsistence of such a form instituted by man.</p>
                     <p>Having shewed at large that this Universal Sovereignty and Jurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> over the Christian Church hath no real Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation either in Scripture or elsewhere, it will be requisite to shew by what ways and means so groundless a claim and pretence should gain belief and submission to it,<note place="margin">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54099:91"/>
one can well imagin) this bulk of exorbitant power did grow, the vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est that ever man on earth did attain, or did ever aim at, will be the less wonderfull, if we do consider the many causes which did concur and contribute thereto; some whereof are proposed in the following Observations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Eminency of any kind (in wealth, in honour, in reputation, in might, in place, or mere order of dignity,) doth easily pass into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of real power and command over those who are inferiour in those respects, and have any dealings or common transactions with such Superiours.</p>
                     <p>For to persons endowed with such eminency by voluntary deference the conduct of affairs is wont to be allowed; none presuming to stand in competition with them, every one rather yielding place to them than to their equals.</p>
                     <p>The same conduct of things, upon the same accounts, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their possession, doth continue fast in their hands, so long as they do retain such advantages.</p>
                     <p>Then from a custom of managing things doth spring up an opinion or a pretence of right thereto; they are apt to assume a title, and others ready to allow it.</p>
                     <p>Men naturally do admire such things, and so are apt to defer extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary respect to the possessours of them.</p>
                     <p>Advantages of wealth and might are not onely instruments to attain, but incentives spurring men to affect the getting authority over their poorer and weaker neighbours: for men will not be content with bare eminency, but will desire real power and sway, so as to obtain their wills over others, and not to be crossed by any. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> had no reason to wonder,<note place="margin">

Men are apt to think their honour is precarious, and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on an uncertain foundation, if it be not supported with real power; and therefore they will not be satisfied to let their advantages lie dead, which are so easily improveable to power, by inveigling some, and sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or constraining others to bear their yoke: and they are able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and gratifie some, and thereby render them willing to submit, those afterwards become serviceable to bring others under, who are disaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or refractory.</p>
                     <p>So the Bishops of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> at first had onely privileges of honour; but afterward they soon hooked in power.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops from the beginning were eminent above all other Bishops in all kinds of advantages.</p>

                     <p>No wonder then, that after some time the Pope did arrive to some pitch of authority over poor Christians, especially those who lay nearest

                     <p>None can resist or obstruct its growth without danger and manifold disadvantages; for as its adherents are deemed loyal and faithfull, so its opposers are branded with the imputations of rebellion, contumacy, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty; and not succeeding in their resistence they will be undone.</p>
                     <p>None ever doth enterprise more than to stop its careir; so that it sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom loseth by opposition; and it ever gaineth by composition.

If it is sometimes overthrown in a Battel, it is seldom conquered in the War.</p>
                     <p>It is always on its march forward, and gaineth ground; for one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment doth countenance the next, and is alledged for a precedent to authorize or justifie it. It seldom moveth backward; for every Successour thinketh he may justly enjoy what his Predecessour did gain, or which is transmitted into his possession; so that there hardly can ever be any restitution of ill-gotten power.</p>
                     <p>Thus have many absolute Kingdoms grown; the first Chief was a Leader of Volunteers; from thence he grew to be a Prince with stated Privileges; after he became a Monarch invested with high Prerogatives; in fine he creepeth forward to be a <hi>Grand Seigniour</hi> usurping absolute do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion: so did <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> first onely assume the style of Prince of the Senate, demeaning himself modestly as such; but he soon drew to himself the administration of all things; and upon that foundation his Successours very suddenly did erect a boundless power. If you trace the foot-steps of most Empires to the beginning you may perceive the like.</p>

                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:54099:92"/>So the Pope when he had got a little power, continually did swell it. The puny pretence of the succeeding Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and the name of the <hi>Apostolical See</hi>; the precedence by reason of the Imperial City; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary Privileges allowed him by Councils; the Authority deferred to him by one Synod of revising the Causes of Bishops; the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance given to him in repressing some Heresies, he did improve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute himself Sovereign Lord of the Church.</p>

Spiritual power especially is of a growing nature, and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that which deriveth from Divine Institution; for it hath a great awe upon the hearts and consciences of men; which engageth them to a firm and constant adherence. It useth the most subtile arms, which it hath always ready, which needeth no time or cost to furnish, which cannot be extorted from its hand; so that it can never be disarmed. And its weapons make strong impression, because it proposeth the most effectual encouragements to its abettours, and discouragements to its adversaries; alluring the one with promises of God's favour and eternal happiness, terrifying the other with menaces of vengeance from heaven and endless misery; the which do ever quell religious, superstitious, weak people; and often daunt men of knowledge and courage.</p>
                     <p>It is presumed unchangeable and unextinguishable by any humane power; and thence is not (as all other power) subject to revolutions.

Each faction usually doth make it self a Head, the chief in strength and reputation which it can find inclinable to favour it; and that Head it will strive to magnifie, that he may be the abler to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote its cause; and if the cause doth prosper he is rewarded with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Privileges and Authority: Especially those who were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and find relief by his means, do become zealously active for his aggrandisement.</p>
                     <p>Thus usually in civil broils the Captain of the prevalent Party grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Prince, or is crowned with great Privileges (as <hi>Caesar, Octavian, Cromwell,</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
                     <p>So upon occasion of the <hi>Arian</hi> faction, and the oppression of <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Marcellus, Paulus</hi> and other Bishops, the <hi>Pope</hi> who by their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to him had occasion to head the Catholick Party did grow in power; for thereupon the <hi>Sardican</hi> Synod did decree to him that Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, which he infinitely enhanced, and which became the main en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of rearing himself so high.</p>
                     <p>And by his interposal in the dissensions raised by the <hi>Nestorians,</hi> the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> the <hi>Acatians,</hi> the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> the <hi>Image-worshippers,</hi> and <hi>Image-breakers,</hi> &amp;c. his authority was advanced; for

he adhering in those causes to the prevailing Party, was by them extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, obtaining both reputation and sway.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. All power is attended by dependencies of persons sheltred under it, and by it enjoying subordinate advantages; the which proportionably do grow by its encrease.</p>
                     <p>Such persons therefore will ever be inciting their Chief and Patron to amplifie his power; and in aiding him to compass it, they will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry industriously, resolutely and steadily active; their own interest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them thereto.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore their mouths will ever be open in crying him up, their heads will be busie in contriving ways to further his interests, their care and pains will be employed in accomplishing his designs; they with their utmost strength will contend in his defence against all oppositions.</p>
                     <p>Thus the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy first, then the Bishops of <hi>Italy,</hi> then all the Clergy of the <hi>West</hi> became engaged to support, to fortifie, to enlarge the <hi>Papal</hi> authority; they all sharing with him in domination over the Laity; and enjoying wealth, credit, support, privileges and immunities thereby. Some of them especially were ever putting him on higher pretences, and furthering him by all means in his acquist and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Hence if a Potentate himself should have no ambition, nor much ability to improve his power; yet it would of it self grow, he need onely be passive therein; the interest of his partisans would effect it; so that often power doth no less thrive under sluggish and weak Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, especially if they are void of goodness, than under the most active and able: Let the Ministers alone to drive on their interest.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Even persons otherwise just and good do seldom scruple to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their power by undue encroachment, or at least to uphold the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpations of their foregoers; for even such are apt to favour their own pretences, and afraid of incurring censure and blame, if they should part with any thing left them by their Predecessours. They apprehend themselves to owe a dearness to their place, engaging them to tender its own weal and prosperity, in promoting which they suppose themselves not to act for their own private interest; and that it is not out of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or avarice, but out of a regard to the grandeur of their Office that they stickle and bustle; and that in so doing they imitate Saint <hi>Paul</hi> who did <hi>magnifie his office.</hi> They are encouraged hereto by the applause of men, especially of those who are allied with them in interest, and who converse with them; who take it for a Maxime, <hi>Boni Principis est am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliare imperium:</hi> The extenders of Empire are admired and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded however they doe it, although with cruel Wars, or by any unjust means.</p>
                     <p>Hence usually the worthiest men in the world's eye are greatest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largers of power; and such men bringing appearances of vertue, ability, reputation to aid their endeavours, do most easily compass designs of this nature, finding less obstruction to their attempts; for men are not so apt to suspect their integrity, or to charge them with ambition and avarice; and the few, who discern their aims and consequences of things, are overborn by the number of those, who are favourably conceited and inclined toward them.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Julius</hi> I. <hi>Damasus</hi> I. <hi>Innocent</hi> I. <hi>Gregory</hi> I. and the like Popes, whom History representeth as laudable persons, did yet confer to the

Good men commonly (out of charitable simplicity, meekness, modesty and humility, love of peace, and aversness from contention) are apt to yield to the encroachments of those who any-wise do excell them; and when such men do yield, others are ready to follow their example. Bad men have little interest to resist, and no heart to stand for publick good; but rather strike in presently, taking advantage by their compliance to drive a good market for themselves. Hence so many of all sorts in all times did comply with Popes, or did not obstruct them; suffering them without great obstacle to raise their power.</p>

They seldom have the courage with sufficient zeal to bustle against encroachments; fearing to be overborn by its stream, to lose their labour, and vainly to suffer by it. If they offer at resistence, it is usually faint and moderate: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as power doth act vigorously, and push it self forward with mighty vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence; so that it is not onely difficult to check it, but dangerous to oppose it.</p>

Princes who favoured them with such concessions and abetted their undertakings, did not foresee what such encrease of power in time would arise to; or suspect the prejudice thence done to Imperial Authority. They little thought that in virtue thereof Popes would check, and mate Princes; or would claim superiority over them; for the Popes at that time did behave and express themselves with modesty and respect to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours.</p>

                     <p>The declination and infirmity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire gave him oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to strengthen his interests, either by closing with it, so as to gain somewhat by its concession; or by opposing it, so as to head a Faction against it. As he often had opportunity to promote the designs of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Princes, so those did return to him encrease of Authority; so they trucked and bartered together. For when Princes were in straits, or did need assistence (from his reputation at home) to the furtherance of their designs, or support of their interest in <hi>Italy,</hi> they were content to honour him, and grant what he desired: as in the case of <hi>Acacius,</hi> which had caused so long a breach, the Emperour to engage Pope <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misdas,</hi> did consent to his will.

                     <p>But it is manifest, that the Pope cannot pretend to this power by virtue of any old Ecclesiastical Canon; none such being extant or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by him: Nor can he alledge any ancient custome; there having been no General Synod before <hi>Constantine:</hi> and as to the practice from that time, it is very clear, that for some Ages the Popes did not assume or exercise such a power, and that it was not taken for their due. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more evident, and it were extreme impudence to deny that the Emperours at their pleasure, and by their authority did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate all the first General Synods; for so the oldest Historians in most express terms do report, so those Princes in their Edicts did aver, so the Synods themselves did declare. The most just and pious Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, who did bear greatest love to the Clergy, and had much respect for the Pope, did call them without scruple; it was deemed their right to doe it, none did remonstrate against their practice,

                     <p>The whole business of General Synods, was an expedient for Peace, contrived by Emperours, and so to be regulated by their order. Hence even in times and places where the Pope was most reverenced, yet Princes were jealous of suffering the Pope to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise such a power over the Bishops their Subjects;<note place="margin">

                        <hi>We trust no true Christian is now ignorant that no See is above all the rest more oblig'd to observe the Constitution of each Council which the consent of the universal Church hath approv'd, than the prime See which by its authority confirms every Synod, and by continued moderating preserves them according to its principality,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But this pretence, as it hath no ground in the Divine Law, or in any old Canon, or in primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Custom; so it doth cross the sentiments and practice of Antiquity; for that in ancient Synods divers things were ordained without the Pope's consent, divers things against his pleasure.</p>
                     <p>What particular or formal confirmation did Saint <hi>Peter</hi> yield to the Assembly at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>?</p>
                     <p>That in some of the first General Synods he was not apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have any negative voice, is by the very tenour and air of things, or by the little regard expressed toward him, sufficiently clear. There is not in the Synodical Epistles of <hi>Nice,</hi> or of <hi>Sardica</hi> any mention of his confirmation.</p>
                     <p>Interpretatively all those Decrees may be supposed to pass with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his consent, which do thwart these pretences; for if these are now good, then of old they were known and admitted for such; and being such we cannot suppose the Pope willingly to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in derogation to them.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons establishing Ecclesiastical admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations without regard to him, and in authority equalling other Metropolitans with him, may be supposed to pass without his consent.</p>

                        <hi>That he must always remember that the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial power was given him not onely to rule the world, but more especially to protect the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So by long prescription, commencing with the first General Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, did the Emperour enjoy this Prerogative; and with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, He having an unquestionable warrant and obligation to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the welfare of the Church, designed by those Conventions; He being the Guardian of Concord among his Subjects, and protectour of their Liberties, which might be nearly concerned in Conciliar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; the power of enacting Laws being an incommunicable branch of Sovereign Majesty; He alone having power committed to him, able to enforce the observance of Decrees, without which they would in effect signifie little.</p>
                     <p>Because also commonly the Decrees of Synods did in a manner
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54099:109"/>
retrench some part of the Royal Prerogative, translating or imparting to others Causes before appropriate to his Jurisdiction (as in the case of appeals, and of prohibiting addresses to Court, ordered in the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dican</hi> and other Synods; of exempting Clergymen from secular Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, from taxes and common burthens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which ought not to be done without his licence and authority.</p>

                        <hi>it being plain, that neither the Roman Bishop, whose suffrage ought first to have been received, nor Vicentius, who for so many years did hold his Episcopacy blameless, nor others agreeing to such things.</hi> To which exception I answer, that</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That which is alledged against the Synod of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> is not the defect of the Pope's confirmation subsequent, but of his consent and concurrence before it, or in it; <note n="*" place="margin">P. <hi>Liberius</hi> being absent, detained from it by violence in banishment.</note> which is very reasonable, because he had a right to be present, and to concur in all such Assemblies, especially being so eminent a Bishop.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The same exception every Bishop might alledge, all having a like right and common interest to Vote in those Assemblies.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Accordingly the dissent of other Bishops, particularly of those eminent in dignity or merit, is also alledged in exception; which had been needless, if his alone dissent had been of so very peculiar force.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Emperour, and many other Bishops did not know of any peculiar necessity of his confirmation.</p>
                     <p>Again it may be objected, that Popes have voided the Decrees of General Synods; as did Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Decrees of the Synod of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> concerning the Privileges of the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> See, in these blunt words: <hi>But the agreements of Bishops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Holy Canons made at Nice,</hi>

In fine, this opposition of his did prove ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual by the sense and practice of the Church, maintaining its ground against his pretence.</p>
                     <p>It is an unreasonable thing, that the opinion or humour of one man (no wiser or better commonly than others) should be preferred before the common agreement of his brethren, being of the same Office and Order with him; so that he should be able to overthrow and frustrate the result of their meetings and consultations, when it did not square to his conceit or interest; especially seeing there is not the least appearance of any right he hath to such a Privilege, grounded in Holy Scripture, Tradition or Custom; for seeing that Scripture hath not a syllable about General Synods, seeing that no Rule about them is extant in any of the first Fathers till after 300 years, seeing there was not one such Council celebrated till after that time, seeing in none of the First General Synods any such Canon was framed in favour of that Bishop, what ground of right could the Pope have to prescribe unto them, or thwart their proceedings? Far more reason there is, (in conformity to all former Rules and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice) that he should yield to all his Brethren, than that all his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren should submit to him: and this we see to have been the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, declared by its Practice in the cases before touched.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. It is indeed a proper endowment of an absolute Sovereignty, immediately and immutably constituted by God, with no terms or rules limiting it, that its will declared in way of Precept, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, concerning the Sanction of Laws, the Abrogation of them, the Dispensation with them, should be observed.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. Accordingly in practice, Synods without regard or recourse to the Pope, did judge Bishops upon offences charged against them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The execution of those judgments was entrusted to <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Bishops; or had effect by the peoples consent; for it being declared that any Bishop had incurred condemnation, the people did presently desert him.</p>
                     <p>Every Bishop was obliged to confer his part to the execution;<note place="margin">

                     <p n="7">7. If the Pope had such judicial power, seeing there were from the beginning so many occasions of exercising it, there would have been extant in History many clear instances of it, but few can be alledged; and those (as we shall see) impertinent, or insufficient.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Divers Synods (great and smaller) did make Sanctions contrary to this pretence of the Pope; appointing the decision of Causes to be terminated in each <hi>Diocese</hi>; and prohibiting appeals to him; which they would not have done if the Pope had originally, or according to common law and custom, a supreme judicial power.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The most favourable of ancient Synods to Papal interest, that of <hi>Sardica,</hi> did confer on the Pope a power, qualified in matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of causing Episcopal causes to be revised; which sheweth that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had no right in such cases; nor then had an absolute power.</p>

                     <p>It is true, that upon their suggestions and clamours, the Emperour was moved at first to order that <hi>Flavianus</hi> should go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and give the Western Bishops satisfaction: but after that he understood the quality of his plea, he freed him of that trouble, and without their allowance settled him in his <hi>See.</hi>

                     <p>Indeed in this Instance, we may see how fallible that <hi>See</hi> was in their judgment of things, how rash in taking parties and somenting discords;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54099:124"/>
how pertinacious in a bad cause, how peevish against the common sense of their brethren; (especially considering, that before this oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of <hi>Flavianus</hi> the Fathers of <hi>Constantinople</hi> had in their Letter to Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> and the <hi>Occidental</hi> Bishops approved, and commended him to them; highly asserting the legitimateness of his Ordination;) In fine,<note place="margin">Theod. 5.9. — <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>And before him Pope <hi>Gelasius</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>But such a power of old did not belong to him. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is not extant any ancient Canon of the Church, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent footsteps of custome allowing such a power to him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Decrees of Synods (<hi>Provincial</hi> in the former times, and <hi>Diocesan</hi> afterwards) were inconsistent with, or repugnant to such a power, for judgments concerning Episcopal Causes were deemed irrevocable, and appointed to be so by Decrees of divers Synods; and consequently no power was reserved to the Pope of thwarting them by Restitution of any Bishop condemned in them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Apostolical</hi> Canons (which at least serve to prove or illustrate ancient Custome) and divers <hi>Synodical</hi> Decrees did prohibit entertaining com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with any person condemned or rejected by canonical Judgment; without exception,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>did partake of his condemnation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Whence in elder times Popes were opposed and checked when they offered to receive Bishops rejected in particular Synods. So St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> declared the Restitution of <hi>Basilides</hi> by Pope <hi>Stephanus</hi> to be null.<note place="margin">Cypr. <hi>Ep.</hi> 68.</note> So the Fathers of the <hi>Antiochene</hi> Synod did reprehend Pope <hi>Julius</hi> for admitting <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> to communion, or avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for Bishops, after their condemnation by Synods. And the <hi>Oriental</hi> Bishops of <hi>Sardica</hi> did excommunicate the same Pope for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with the same persons. Which Instances do shew, that the Pope was not then undoubtedly, or according to common opinion endowed with such a power.</p>
                     <p>But whereas they do alledge some Instances of such a power, I shall premise some general Considerations apt to clear the business, and then apply answers to the particular Allegations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Restitution commonly doth signifie no more, than acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a person (although rejected by undue Sentence) to be <hi>de jure</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of communion, and capable of the Episcopal Office; upon which may be consequent an Obligation to communicate with him, and to allow him his due Character; according to the Precept of Saint <hi>Paul, Follow righteousness,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.22.</note> 
                        <hi>faith, charity, peace with them that call upon the Lord with a pure heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may be done, when any man notoriously is persecuted for the Truth and Righteousness. Or when the iniquity and malice of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Judges are apparent, to the oppression of Innocence. Or when the Process is extremely irregular: as in the cases of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> of St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi>— And this is not an act of Jurisdiction, but of Equity and Charity; incumbent on all Bishops; And there are promiscuous Instances of Bishops practising it. Thus <hi>Socrates</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Socr. 2.24.</note> that <hi>Maximus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store communion and dignity to Athanasius.</hi> And so <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> being reconciled and reduced to a good understanding of each other,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>did restore to each other their Sees</hi>; rescinding the Censures, which in heat they had denounced each on other. Which sheweth that Restitution is not always taken for an act of Jurisdiction; wherein one is Superiour to another; for those persons were in rank and power co-ordinate.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Restitution sometime doth import no more than a considerable influence toward the effects of restoring a person to communion or Office; no judicial act being exercised about the case— <hi>The Emperour writing that Paulus and Athanasius should be restor'd to their Sees,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. Socr. 2.20.</note> 
                        <hi>availed nothing</hi>— That was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution without effect.</p>
                     <p>Thus a Pope's avowing the Orthodoxy, or Innocence, or Worth of a person, after a due information about them, (by reason of the Pope's eminent rank in the Church, and the regard duely had to him) might sometimes much conduce to restore a person; and might obtain the name of Restitution, by an ordinary scheme of speech.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sometimes persons said to be restored by Popes are also said to be restored by Synods, with regard to such instance or testimony of Popes
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54099:126"/>
in their behalf. In which case the Judicial Restitution,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Note,</hi> It is an ordinary style of Votes in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods for the Restitution of a Bishop, <hi>I restore, Vid. Conc.</hi> Chalc. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 165. That is, I give my Vote for his Restitution.</note> giving right of Recovery and completion thereto, was the act of the Synod.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When Cases were driven to a legal debate, Popes could not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually resolve without a Synod, their single acts not being held suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently valid. So notwithstanding the Declarations of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> in favour of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> for the effectual resolution of his case the great Synod of <hi>Sardica</hi> was convened. So whatever Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> I. did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, he could not restore St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> without a General Synod.</p>
                     <p>Nor could Pope <hi>Leo</hi> restore <hi>Flavianus,</hi> deposed in the Second <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine</hi> Synod, without convocation of a General Synod, the which he did so often sue for to the Emperour <hi>Theodosius,</hi> for that purpose. Pope <hi>Simplicius</hi> affirmed, that <hi>Petrus Moggus having been by a common decree condemned as an adulterer</hi> (or Usurper of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> See) <hi>could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a common Council be freed from condemnation.</hi>

                     <p n="7">7. Commonly Restitution was not effectual without the Emperour's consent; whence <hi>Theodoret,</hi> although allowed by the great Synod, did acknowledge his Restitution especially due to the Emperour; as we shall see in reflecting on his case.</p>
                     <p>Now to the particular Instances produced for the Pope, we answer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p>Nay it was necessary to avow those Bishops, as suffering in the cause of the common Faith. Besides, the Pope's proceeding was taxed, and protested against as irregular; nor did he defend it by virtue of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power that he had judicially to rescind the acts of Synods. And lastly, the Restitution of <hi>Athanasius</hi> and the other Bishops, had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete effect, till it was confirmed by the Synod of <hi>Sardica,</hi> backed by the Imperial authority; which in effect did restore them.

                        <p n="1">1. The example is late, when the Popes had extended their power beyond the ancient and due limits: those <hi>Maxims</hi> had got in before the time of that worthy Pope; who thought he might use the power of which he found himself possessed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is impertinent, because the Bishop of <hi>Justiniana</hi> had then a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial dependence upon the <hi>Roman</hi> See; from whence an Universal Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction upon appeal cannot be inferred.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It might be an Usurpation; nor doth the opinion or practice of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> suffice to determine a question of right, for good men are liable to prejudice, and its consequences.</p>
                        <p>To these Instances produced by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> some add the Appeal of <hi>Eutyches</hi> to Pope <hi>Leo</hi>; to which it may be excepted, that if he did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, it was not to the Pope solely, but to him with the other <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi>;

                        <p>In regard to any more Instances of this kind we might generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose these following considerations.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is no wonder, that any Bishop being condemned, especially in causes relating to Faith or common Interest, should have recourse to the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop, or to any other Bishop of great authority for refuge or for relief; which they may hope to be procured by them by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their reputation, and their power among their dependents.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Bad men, being deservedly corrected, will absurdly resort any whither with mouths full of clamour and calumny; if not with hope of relief, yet with design of revenge; as did <hi>Marcion,</hi> as did <hi>Felicissimus,</hi> as did <hi>Apiarius</hi> to the Pope.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Good men being abused will express some resentment, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their wrongs, where they may presume of a fair and favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearing: so did <hi>Athanasius, Flavianus,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostome, Theodoret</hi> apply themselves to the same Bishops, flourishing in so great reputation and wealth.</p>
                        <p>So did the Monks of <hi>Egypt (Ammonius</hi> and <hi>Isidorus</hi>) from the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of <hi>Theophilus</hi> fly to the protection and succour of St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>; which gave occasion to the troubles of that incomparable Personage; the which is so illustrious an instance, that the words of the <hi>Historian</hi> relating it deserve setting down.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>This is a modern dream born out of Ambition and Flattery, which never came into the head of any ancient Divine.</p>
                        <p>It is a ridiculous thing to imagine, that <hi>Cyprian, Athanasius, Basil, Chrysostome, Austin,</hi> &amp;c. did take themselves for the Vicegerents or Ministers of the Popes; if they did, why did they not, so frequent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion being given them, in all their Volumes, ever acknowledge it? why cannot <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his Complices after all their prolling shew
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:54099:135"/>
any passage in them importing any such acknowledgment; but are fain to infer it by far-fetched Sophisms, from Allegations plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, or frivolous?</p>
                        <p>The Popes indeed in the Fourth Century began to practise a fine trick, very serviceable to the enlargement of their power; which was to confer on certain Bishops, as occasion served, or for continuance, the title of their Vicar or Lieutenant; thereby pretending to impart Authority to them; whereby they were enabled for performance of divers things, which otherwise by their own Episcopal or Metropoliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power they could not perform. By which device they did engage such Bishops to such a dependence on them, whereby they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Papal Authority in Provinces, to the oppression of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Rights and Liberties of Bishops and Synods; doing what they pleased under pretence of this vast power communicated to them; and for fear of being displaced, or out of affection to their favourer doing what might serve to advance the Papacy.</p>

                        <p>The Pope observing what authority and reverence the Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had in this Nation, whereby they might be able to check his attempts, did think good to constitute those Archbishops his <hi>Legates</hi> of course, (<hi>Legatos natos</hi>) that so they might seem to exercise their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction by authority derived from him, and owing to him that mark of favour, or honour, with inlargement of power, might pay him more devotion and serve his interests.</p>

                     <head>SUPPOSITION VII. A farther grand Assertion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Party, is this, That the Papal Supremacy is indefectible, and unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</head>
                     <p>BUT good reasons may be assigned, why even supposing that the Pope had an Universal Sovereignty in virtue of his Succession to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> conferred on him, it is not assuredly consequent, that it must always, or doth now belong to him. For it might be settled on him not absolutely but upon conditions, the which failing his authority may expire. It might be God's will that it should onely continue for a time. And there are divers ways, whereby according to common rules of justice, he might be disseised thereof.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If God had positively declared his will concerning this Point, that such a Sovereignty was by him granted irrevocably and immutably, so that in no case it might be removed or altered, then indeed it must be admitted for such; but if no such declaration doth appear, then to assert it for such is to derogate from his power and providence; by exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of this case from it. It is the ordinary course of providence so to confer power of any kind or nature on men, as to reserve to himself the liberty of transferring it, qualifying it, extending or contracting it, abolishing it, according to his pleasure, in due seasons and exigencies of things. Whence no humane power can be supposed absolutely stable or immovably fixed in one person or place.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. No power can have a higher source, or firmer ground, than that of the Civil Government hath, for <hi>all such power is from heaven,</hi> and in relation to that it is said, <hi>There is no power but from God, the powers that are, are ordained by God:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 19.11. Rom. 13.1—</note> But yet such power is liable to various altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and is like the Sea, having ebbs and flows, and ever changing its bounds either personal or local.</p>
                     <p>Any temporal Jurisdiction may be lost by those revolutions and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitudes of things, to which all humane Constitutions are subject; and which are ordered <hi>by the will and providence of the most High,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 5.21. Psal. 75.7.</note> 
                        <hi>who ruleth
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54099:141"/>
in the Kingdom of men, appointing over it whom he pleaseth; putting down one and setting up another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adam</hi> by God's appointment was Sovereign of the world; and his first-born Successours derived the same power from him: yet in course of time that order hath been interrupted, and divers independent Sovereignties do take place.</p>
                     <p>Every Prince hath his authority from God, or by virtue of Divine Ordination within his own Territory; and according to God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the lawfull Successour hath a right to the same authority; yet by accidents such authority doth often fail totally or in part, changing its extent.</p>
                     <p>Why then may not any Spiritual power be liable to the same vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes? why may not a Prelate be degraded as well as a Prince? why may not the Pope, as well as the Emperour, lose all, or part of his Kingdom?</p>
                     <p>Why may not the Successour of <hi>Peter,</hi> no less than the Heir of <hi>Adam,</hi> suffer a defaileur of Jurisdiction?</p>
                     <p>That Spiritual Corporations, Persons and Places are subject to the same contingences with others, as there is like reason to suppose, so there are Examples to prove; God removed his Sanctuary from <hi>Shiloh, Go ye now unto my place,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 7.12. Jer. 7.14. Apoc. 2.5.</note> 
                        <hi>which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at first,</hi> &amp;c. He deserted <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> He removeth the Candlesticks. He placed <hi>Eli</hi> (of the Family of <hi>Ithamar</hi>) in the High-Priesthood, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed his Race from it:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.30. 1 King. 2.27.</note> 
                        <hi>I said indeed</hi> (saith God) <hi>that thy house, and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever, but now the Lord saith Be it far from me, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 The reason and exigency of things might be sufficient ground for altering an Universal Jurisdiction; for when it should prove very inconvenient or hurtfull, God might order such an alteration to happen, and men be obliged to allow it.</p>
                     <p>As God first did institute one Universal Monarchy, but that form (upon the multiplication of mankind, and peopling of the earth) proving incommodious, providence gave way for its change, and the setting up of particular Governments; to which men are bound to submit; So God might institute a singular Presidency of the Church; but when the Church grew vastly extended, so that such a Government would not conveniently serve the whole, he might order a division, in which we should acquiesce.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It hath ever been deemed reasonable, and accordingly been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, that the Church in its exteriour form and political administrations should be suted to the state of the world, and Constitution of worldly Governments; that there might be no clashing or disturbance from each to other.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore seeing the World is now settled under so many Civil Sovereignties, it is expedient that Ecclesiastical Discipline should be so modelled, as to comply with each of them.</p>
                     <p>And it his reasonable, that any pretence of Jurisdiction should veil to the publick good of the Church and the World.</p>
                     <p>That it should be necessary for the Church to retain the same form of policy or measure of power affixed to persons or places, can no-wise be demonstrated by sufficient proof, and it is not consistent with experience; which sheweth the Church to have subsisted with variations of that kind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="273" facs="tcp:54099:141"/>There hath in all times been found much reason or necessity to make alterations as well in the places and bounds of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, as of Secular Empire.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s Monarchy, reason requiring, might be cantonized into divers spiritual Supremacies; and as other Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions have been chopp'd and chang'd, enlarged or diminished, removed and extinguished, so might that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop. The Pope cannot retain power in any State against the will of the Prince: he is not bound to suffer correspondences with Foreigners, especially such who apparently have interests contrary to his honour and the good of his people.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Especially that might be done, if the continuance of such a Jurisdiction should prove abominably corrupt, or intolerably grievous to the Church.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That power is defectible which according to the nature and course of things doth sometime fail.</p>
                     <p>But the Papal Succession hath often been interrupted by contingencies (of <hi>Sedition, Schism, Intrusion, Simoniacal Election, Deposition,</hi> &amp;c. as before shewed) and is often interrupted by Vacancies from the death of the Incumbents.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. If leaving their dubious and false suppositions, (concerning Divine Institution, Succession to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c.) we consider the truth of the case, and indeed the more grounded plea of the Pope, that Papal preeminence was obtained by the wealth and dignity of the <hi>Roman</hi> City, and by the collation or countenance of the Imperial authority; then by the defect of such advantages it may cease or be taken away: for when <hi>Rome</hi> hath ceased to be the Capital City, the Pope may cease to be Head of the Church. When the Civil powers, which have succeeded the Imperial, each in its respective Territory, are no less absolute than it, they may take it away, if they judge it fit; for whatever power was granted by humane Authority, by the same may be revoked; and what the Emperour could have done, each Sovereign power now may doe for it self.</p>
                     <p>An indefectible power cannot be settled by man; because there is no power ever extant at one time greater than there is at another; so that whatever power one may raise, the other may demolish; there being no bounds whereby the present time may bind all posterity.</p>
                     <p>However no humane Law can exempt any Constitution from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God; which at pleasure can dissolve whatever man hath fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And if the Pope were devested of all adventitious power, obtained by humane means, he would be left very bare; and hardly would take it worth his while to contend for Jurisdiction.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. However or whencesoever the Pope had his Authority, yet it may be forfeited by defects and defaults incurred by him.</p>
                     <p>If the Pope doth encroach on the rights and liberties of others, usurping a lawless domination, beyond reason and measure, they may in their own defence be forced to reject him, and shake off his yoke.</p>
                     <p>If he will not be content to govern otherwise than by infringing the Sacred Laws, and trampling down the inviolable Privileges of the Churches, either granted by Christ, or established by the Sanctions of General Synods; he thereby depriveth himself of all Authority; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot be admitted upon tolerable terms, without greater wrong
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54099:142"/>
of many others (whose right out-weigheth his) and without great mischief to the Church, the good of which is to be preferred before his private advantage.</p>
                     <p>This was the <hi>Maxime</hi> of a great Pope, a great stickler for his own dignity; for when the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was advanced by a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Synod above his ancient pitch of dignity, that Pope opposing him did say, that <hi>whoever doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect more than his due,</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>Vnity of the Church</hi> is a Point which may seem somewhat speculative and remote from Practice; but in right Judgments it is otherwise; many Duties depending upon a true notion and consideration of it; so that from ignorance or mistake about it we may incur divers offences or omissions of Duty; hence in Holy Scripture it is often proposed as a considerable Point, and usefull to Practice.</p>
                  <p>And if ever the Consideration of it were needfull, it is so now, when the Church is so rent with Dissentions; for our satisfaction and direction about the Questions and Cases debated in Christendom; for on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it, or the true Resolution wherein it doth consist, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies about <hi>Church-Government, Heresie, Schism, Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> and by consequence many others do depend; yea indeed all others are by some Parties made to depend thereon.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> exhorting the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> his disciples, to the maintenance of Charity and Peace among themselves, doth for inducement to that Practice represent the Unity and Community of those things which jointly did appertain to them as Christians: the Unity of that <hi>Body</hi> whereof they were members; of that <hi>Spirit</hi> which did animate and act them; of that <hi>Hope</hi> to which they were called; of that <hi>Lord</hi> whom they all did worship and serve; of that <hi>Faith</hi> which they did profess; of that <hi>Baptism</hi> whereby they were admitted into the same state of Duties, of Rights, of Privileges; of that one <hi>God</hi> and universal <hi>Father,</hi> to whom they had all the same relations.</p>

                     <hi>That all things may be alike ordered in every Diocese, it hath seemed good to the holy Synod, that men should put up their Prayers to God standing,</hi> (viz. between <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> and upon the <hi>Lord's-day.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>The Church is like the World; for as the World doth consist of men, all naturally subject to one King, Almighty God; all obliged to observe his Laws, declared by natural Light; all <hi>made of one bloud,</hi> and so Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; all endowed with common Reason; all bound to exercise good Offices of Justice and Humanity toward each other, to maintain Peace and Amity together; to further each other in the prosecution or attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those good things which conduce to the Welfare and Security of this present Life: even so doth the Church consist of persons spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally allied, professing the same Faith, subject to the same Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Christ</hi>'s heavenly Kingdom; bound to exercise Charity, and to maintain Peace toward each other, and to promote each others good in order to the future Happiness in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>All those kinds of Unity do plainly agree to the universal Church of <hi>Christ</hi>; but the Question is, Whether the Church is also necessarily by the design and appointment of God to be in way of external policy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one singular Government or Jurisdiction of any kind; so as a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:54099:158"/>
or Commonwealth are united under the Command of one Monarch or one Senate?</p>
                  <p>That the Church is capable of such an Union, is not the Controversie; that it is possible it should be so united, (supposing it may happen that all Christians may be reduced to one Nation, or one civil Regiment; or that several Nations spontaneously may confederate and combine themselves into one Ecclesiastical Commonwealth, administred by the same Spiritual Rulers and Judges according to the same Laws,) I do not question; that when in a manner all Christendom did consist of Subjects to the Roman Empire, the Church then did arrive near such an Unity, I do not at present contest; but that such an Union of all Christians is necessary, or that it was ever instituted by <hi>Christ,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grant; and for my refusal of that opinion, I shall assign divers Reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This being a Point of great consideration, and trenching upon Practice, which every one were concerned to know; and there being frequent occasions to declare it; yet the Holy Scripture doth no where express or intimate such a kind Unity; which is a sufficient Proof, that it hath no firm ground. We may say of it as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith of the Church it self,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> particularly, in divers Epistles,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 1 Cor. 12. Rom. 12. Gal. 3.28.</note> designedly treating about the Unity of the Church, (together with other Points of Doctrine neighbouring thereon,) and amply describing it, doth not yet imply any such Unity then extant, or designed to be.</p>
                  <p>He doth mention and urge the Unity of Spirit, of Faith, of Charity, of Peace, of Relation to our Lord, of Communion in Devotions and Offices of Piety; but concerning any Union under one singular visible Government or Polity he is silent: He saith, <hi>One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism; one God and Father of all:</hi> not one Monarch, or one Senate, or one Sanhedrin — which is a pregnant sign, that none such was then instituted; otherwise he could not have slipped over a Point so very material and pertinent to his Discourse.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the Apostolical History it may appear, that the Apostles, in the Propagation of Christianity, and founding of Christian Societies, had no meaning, did take no care, to establish any such Polity.</p>

The constitution of such an Unity doth involve the vesting some Person or some number of Persons with a Sovereign Authority (subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to our Lord) to be managed in a certain manner, either absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to pleasure, or limitedly according to certain Rules prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to it.</p>
                  <p>But that there was ever any such Authority constituted, or any Rules prescribed to it by our Lord or his Apostles doth not appear, and there are divers reasonable presumptions against it.</p>
                  <p>It is reasonable that whoever claimeth such Authority, should for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring his Title shew Patents of his Commission, manifestly expressing it; how otherwise can he justly demand Obedience, or any with satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction yield thereto?</p>
                  <p>It was just that the Institution of so great Authority should be fortified with an undoubted charter, that its Right might be apparent, and the Duty of Subjection might be certain.</p>
                  <p>If any such Authority had been granted by God, in all likelihood it would have been clearly mentioned in Scripture; it being a matter of high importance among the establishments of Christianity, conducing to great effects, and grounding much duty. Especially considering that</p>
                  <p>There is in Scripture frequent occasion of mentioning it; in way of History, touching the use of it (the acts of Sovereign Power affording chief matter to the History of any Society) in way of Direction to those Governours how to manage it; in way of Exhortation to Inferiours how to behave themselves in regard to it; in way of commending the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which attend it; it is therefore strange that its mention is so balkt.</p>
                  <p>The Apostles do often speak concerning Ecclesiastical Affairs of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, concerning the Decent administration of things, concerning pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Order and Peace, concerning the furtherance of Edification, concerning the Prevention and Removal of Heresies, Schisms, Factions, Disorders; upon any of which occasions it is marvellous that they should not touch that Constitution, which was the proper means appointed for maintenance of Truth, Order, Peace, Decency, Edification, and all such Purposes, for remedy of all contrary Mischiefs.</p>
                  <p>There are mentioned divers Schisms and Dissensions, the which the Apostles did strive by instruction and persuasion to remove; in which Cases, supposing such an Authority in being, it is a wonder that they do not mind the Parties dissenting of having recourse thereto for decision of their Causes, that they do not exhort them to a Submission thereto, that they do not reprove them for declining such a Remedy.</p>
                  <p>It is also strange, that no mention is made of any Appeal made by any of the dissenting Parties to the Judgment of such Authority.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, if such an Authority had then been avowed by the Christian Churches, it is hardly conceivable that any Schisms could subsist, there being so powerfull a Remedy against them; then notably visible and most effectual, because of its fresh Institution, before it was darkned or weakned by Age.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Apostolical Writings do inculcate our Subjection to one Lord in Heaven, it is much they should never consider his Vicegerent, or Vicegerents, upon Earth; notifying and pressing the Duties of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Reverence toward them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:54099:160"/>There are indeed Exhortations to honour the Elders, and to obey the Guides of particular Churches; but the Honour and Obedience due to those Paramount Authorities, or Universal Governours, is passed over in dead silence, as if no such thing had been thought of.</p>
                  <p>They do expresly avow the Secular Pre-eminence, and press Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Emperour as Supreme; why do they not likewise mention this no less considerable Ecclesiastical Supremacy, or enjoin Obedience thereto? why <hi>Honour the King,</hi> and be <hi>subject to Principalities</hi> so often,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1. — Tit. 3.1. 1 Pet. 2.13, 17. 1 Tim. 1.2.</note> but Honour the Spiritual Prince or Senate doth never occur?</p>
                  <p>If there had been any such Authority, there would probably have been some intimation concerning the Persons in whom it was setled, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Place of their residence, concerning the Manner of its being conveyed, (by Election, Succession, or otherwise.)</p>
                  <p>Probably the Persons would have some proper Name, Title or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to distinguish them from inferiour Governours; that to the Place some mark of Pre-eminence would have been affixed.</p>
                  <p>It is not unlikely, that somewhere some Rules or Directions would have been prescribed for the management of so high a Trust, for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Miscarriages and Abuses to which it is notoriously liable.</p>
                  <p>It would have been declared Absolute, or the Limits of it would have been determined, to prevent its enslaving God's heritage.</p>
                  <p>But of these things in the Apostolical Writings, or in any near those times, there doth not appear any footstep or pregnant intimation.</p>
                  <p>There hath never to this day been any place but one (namely <hi>Rome</hi>) which hath pretended to be the Seat of such an Authority; the Plea whereof we largely have examined.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. The primitive State of the Church did not well comport with such an Unity.</p>
                  <p>For Christian Churches were founded in distant places, as the Apostles did find opportunity, or received direction to found them; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not, without extreme inconvenience, have resort or reference to one Authority, any where fixed.</p>

                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:54099:160"/>Each Church therefore separately did order its own Affairs, without recourse to others, except for charitable Advice or Relief in cases of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary difficulty or urgent need.</p>
                  <p>Each Church was endowed with a perfect Liberty and a full Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without dependence or subordination to others, to govern its own Members, to manage its own Affairs, to decide Controversies and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses incident among themselves, without allowing Appeals, or rendring Accounts to others.</p>
                  <p>This appeareth by the Apostolical Writings of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>John</hi> to single Churches;<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. 1 Cor. 14.40. 1 Thess. 5.14. 1 Cor. 5.12.6.1.</note> wherein they are supposed able to exercise spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Power for establishing Decency, removing Disorders, correcting Offences, deciding Causes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </gap>, and Liberty of Churches, doth appear to have long continued in practice inviolate; although tempered and modelled in accommodation to the circumstances of place and time.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that if any Church did notoriously forsake the Truth, or commit Disorder in any kind, other Churches did sometime take upon them (as the Case did move) to warn, advise, reprove it, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare against its proceedings, as prejudicial not onely to the welfare of that Church, but to the common interests of Truth and Peace; but this was not in way of commanding Authority, but of fraternal Solicitude; or of that Liberty which Equity and Prudence do allow to Equals in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to common good:<note place="margin">Iren. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> So did the <hi>Roman</hi> Church interpose in reclaiming the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> from its Disorders and Seditions: So did Saint <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> and Saint <hi>Denys</hi> of <hi>Alex.</hi> meddle in the Affairs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, exhorting <hi>Novatian</hi> and his Adherents to return to the Peace of their Church.</p>
                  <p>It is also true, that the Bishops of several adjacent Churchs did use to meet upon Emergencies (concerning the maintenance of Truth, Order and Peace; concerning Settlement and Approbation of Pastours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to consult and conclude upon Expedients for attaining such Ends; this probably they did at first in a free way, without rule, according to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, as Prudence suggested; but afterwards, by confederation and consent, those Conventions were formed into method, and regulated by certain Orders established by consent, whence did arise an Ecclesiastical Unity of Government, within certain Precincts; much like that of the United States in the <hi>Netherlands</hi>; the which course was very prudential, and usefull for preserving the Truth of Religion and Unity of Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst heretical Devices springing up in that free age; for maintaining Concord and good Correspondence among Christians, together with an Harmony in Manners and Discipline; for that otherwise Christendom would have been shattered and crumbled into numberless Parties, discor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in Opinion and Practice; and consequently alienated in Affection, which inevitably among most men doth follow Difference of Opinion and Manners, so that in short time it would not have appeared what Christianity was, and consequently the Religion, being overgrown with Differences and Discords, must have perished.</p>

The Union of the whole Church in one Body, under one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Sovereign Authority, would be inconvenient and hurtfull; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the main designs of Christianity; destructive to the Welfare and Peace of Mankind in many respects.</p>
                  <p>This we have shewed particularly concerning the Pretence of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy; and those Discourses being applicable to any like Universal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, (perhaps with more advantage, Monarchy being less subject to abuse than other ways of Government) I shall forbear to say more.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Such an Union is of no need, would be of small use, or would doe little good; in balance to the great Mischiefs and Inconveniences which it would produce.</p>
                  <p>This Point also we have declared, in regard to the Papacy; and we might say the same concerning any other like Authority substituted thereto.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Such a Connexion of Churches is not any-wise needfull or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Design of Christianity; which is to reduce Mankind to the Knowledge, Love and Reverence of God;<note place="margin">Tit. 2.12.</note> to a just and loving Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation together; to the practice of Sobriety, Temperance, Purity, Meekness, and all other Vertues; all which things may be compassed without forming men into such a Policy.</p>
                  <p>It is expedient there should be particular Societies in which men may concur in worshipping God, and promoting that Design by instructing and provoking one another to good practice, in a regular, decent and orderly way.</p>
                  <p>It is convenient that the Subjects of each temporal Sovereignty should live as in a civil, so in a spiritual Uniformity, in order to the preservation of Goodwill and Peace among them (for that Neighbours differing in opinion and fashions of practice will be apt to contend each for his way, and thence to disaffect one another) for the beauty and pleasant harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Agreement in Divine things, for the more commodious succour and defence of Truth and Piety by unanimous concurrence.</p>

                  <p n="11">11. The Church in the Scripture sense hath ever continued One; and will ever continue so; notwithstanding that it hath not had this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Unity.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The most ancient Summaries of Christian Faith, extant in the first Fathers,<note place="margin">Iren. Tert. Cypr. <hi>Conc.</hi> Nic.</note> (<hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cyprian,</hi> &amp;c.) do not contain this Point.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Catholick</hi> was not originally in the <hi>Apostolical</hi> (or <hi>Roman</hi>) Creed, but was added after <hi>Ruffin</hi> and Saint <hi>Austin</hi>'s time.</p>
                  <p>This Article was inserted into the Creeds upon the rise of Heresies and Schisms to discountenance and disengage from them.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. We do avow a Catholick Church in many respects One; wherefore not the Unity of the Church, but the Kind and Manner of Unity being in question, the Creed doth not oppose what we say, nor can with reason be alledged for the special kind of Unity which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. That the Unity mentioned in the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Creed is such as our Adversaries contend for, of external Policy, is precariously assumed, and relieth onely upon their interpretation obtruded on us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 4. The genuine meaning of that Article may reasonably be deemed this; That we profess our adhering to the Body of Christians, which diffused over the World doth retain the Faith taught, the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline setled, the Practices appointed by our Lord and his Apostles; that we maintain general Charity toward all good Christians, that we are ready to entertain communion in Holy Offices with all such; that we are willing to observe the Laws and Orders established by Authority or Consent of the Churches, for maintenance of Truth, Order and Peace: that we renounce all heretical doctrines, all disorderly practices, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy with any factious combinations of people.<note place="margin">

That this is the meaning of the Article, may sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the reason and occasion of introducing it; which was to secure the Truth of Christian Doctrine, the Authority of Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and the common Peace of the Church; according to the Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Arguments of the Fathers, (<hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Austin, Vincentius Lirinensis,</hi>) the which do plainly countenance our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 6. It is not reasonable to interpret the Article so as will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with the State of the Church in the Apostolical and most primitive ages, when evidently there was no such a political Conjunction of Christians.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Consequence is very weak; for from the Antecedent it can onely be inferred, that (according to the Sentiment of the Ancients) all Christians should consent in one Faith; which Unity we avow; and who denieth?</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. By like reason all Mankind must be united in one political Body; because all men are bound to agree in what the Light of nature discovereth to be true and good; or because the Principles of natural Religion, Justice and Humanity are common to all.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. These Powers are granted to the Church, because granted to each particular Church or distinct Society of Christians; not to the whole as such or distinct from the Parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. It is evident that by virtue of such Grants particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches do exercise those Powers; and it is impossible to infer more from them than a Justification of their Practice.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 3.
