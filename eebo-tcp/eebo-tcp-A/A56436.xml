            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

dwelt in the Prophets and holy men, by which they saw the day of

of Israel, and declared against it both in Priest, People and Rulers, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the word of the Lord faithfully, whether they would hear or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34252:2"/>
Ezek. 3. Mic. 3. Isa. 56. <hi>And this word came unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
which was as a fire and hammer in their bones,</hi> Ier. 20. 9. <hi>and</hi>
23. 29. <hi>Which word in due time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> became flesh, and dwelt among the
Apostles, and they saw the glory thereof, as of the onely begotten Son
of the Father, full of grace and truth,</hi> Iohn 1. 14. <hi>whom</hi> Iohn <hi>bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of to be the Light of the World, who doth enlighten every one
that comes into the world,</hi> Iohn 1. <hi>To which Light</hi> Paul <hi>was sent to
turn the mindes of the Heathen:</hi> Acts 26. 17, 18. <hi>Which light is the
condemnation of the world, who love darkness rather then Light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their deeds are evill: and he that hates it hath it, though he will
not bring his deeds to it, by it to be proved, therefore his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it is,</hi> Iohn 3. 19, 20, 21. <hi>And there is a time, light shines in darkness,
and darkness comprehends it not,</hi> Iohn 1. 5. <hi>And this is the cause why
many stumble at it, and are offended in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is a time light shines out of darkness, and darkness flees
away, and then is witnessed the perfect day wherein the children of the
day do walk, <hi>Isa. 42. 16. Matt. 4. 16. Ephes.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. Which Light is the
true tryer of spirits, and gives the discerning of spirits, and discovers
the works of darkness, and manifests the deeds of darknesse; and by it
the secrets of the heart are seen, and hidden things searched out, and by
it all things are made manifest, and whatsoever makes manifese is light,
<hi>Heb. 4. 12. Ephes.</hi> 5. 13. all which the naturall man knows not, and
therefore cannot receive the things of God, but by this light is seen and
judged; for by this light the spiritual man is able to discern and judge
the natural man, but he himself is judged of no man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14, 15.
For this is the judge of the world, and by this the Prince of the air is
judged wheresoever he rules, <hi>John</hi> 16. 11. And therefore as it rages,
and stirres up his servants to persecute it, where it is made manifest, and
so it is a stumbling stone, and a rock of offence to the children of the
world, in whom the Prince of this world lodgeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 33. And of
this word the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> bears witness to be quick and powerfull,
and sharper then a two edged sword to the diving asunder betwixt
the marrow and the bones, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. to which word the Apostle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
the mindes of people within them, from looking without for to
finde it without, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. And from this same word the Apostles spoke
forth the Scripture, which word was their guide, and rule, and teacher
all along from the beginning, by which both the Apostles, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and the holy men was acted, moved, and carried forth in the
power of it, to declare that which by it they were taught, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.
2 <hi>Pet. 1. 21. And this is the free grace of God which bringeth salvation,
and hath appeared to all men,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12. <hi>VVhich is their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
who do despite unto it:</hi> Heb. 10. 29. But this was the Saints
teacher, by which they were taught to deny all ungodliness and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lusts, and to live godlily, righteously, and soberly in this present evil
world, and this is the anointing, which teacheth all things freely, which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34252:2"/>
is truth, and no lye, <hi>and leads into all Truth:</hi> and he that knows this
need no man to teach him, but is come the end of mans Teaching,
1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. unto which the Prophet was come, and therefore called
freely, <hi>Come buy wine and milk without money or price: why spend you your
money for that which is not bread, or your labour for that which profiteth not?</hi>
Isa. 55. 1, 2, 3. And from this the Apostles spoke freely, <hi>not coveting
any mans silver or gold, but as they freely had received, freely they gave,</hi>
Acts 20. 33. And whosoever speaks from this, speaks freely, and its
ministry leads to the end of teaching: <hi>and here let all flesh keep silence
before the Lord:</hi> Zech. 2. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And let all Hirelings, and greedy Shepherds stop their mouths, who
cry peace, peace, to them that put into their mouthes, but if not, they
even prepare warre against them; and such like the Prophet in the light
saw, and by it testified against them,</hi> Mich.<hi> 3. 5. And all this the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
bears testimony of, which was spoken from the light, but is not the
light, nor the word, nor the life, nor the judge, nor the rule, nor the
guide, nor the tryer of spirits, for all this belongs to Christ, who is the
discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, </hi>Heb. <hi>4. 1, 2. who is the
light,</hi> John <hi>8. 12. who is the word,</hi> John <hi>1. 14. who is the life,</hi> John <hi>14.
6. who blamed the Pharisees, that thought in the Scriptures to finde eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life, but would not come unto him that they might have life,</hi> John
<hi>5. 39, 40. who is the anointing, who is the guide and teacher, and the
Rule, 1</hi> John <hi>2. 27. who when we are going to the right hand or to the
left, cryes, This is the way, walk in it,</hi> Isa. <hi>30. 21. Of which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is a true Declaration, spoken from this VVord of Truth, of which
light every one hath a measure, which unto them is the free gift of God,
to profit withall; which light in the conscience reproves for sin and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and manifests the deceit of the heart, and checks the creature
when it swears, or lyes, or doth amiss, telling it that it should not do
so, and calls for repentance and amendment of life, and leads unto the
same as it is owned and followed, and as many as receives it, receives
power to become the Sons of God:</hi> John 8. 12. and 1. 12. Rom. <hi>2. 4.
But he that doth evill hates the light, and will not bring his deeds to it,
by it to be proved, and to him it is condemnation, but he that loves the
light, brings his deeds to the light, that it may manifest them whether
they be wrought in God,</hi> John <hi>3. 20, 21. But of this light you people
and Teachers of the VVorld are ignorant, and so are doting upon the
Scripture without, with your dark mindes there, with the blinde Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
seeking for life where it is not to be found, but will not come to
Christ, the light, that you might have life, but would cast him out of his
throne, and exalteth Scripture above him, calling them the judge, and
the light, and the word, and the life, and the rule, and the guide, and
thus with your dark mindes, you would take the authority from Christ,
and would give it unto the dead letter, which is but a Declaration of
these things.</hi> And thus your leaders cause you to erre, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 12. for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34252:3"/>
their own ends, because of the Scripture they make an Idoll to get
money by adding their own meanings, interpretations, and constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon them, which is all the conceivings and imaginations of their
own hearts, by which they lead you in blindness, ever learning, and
never able to come to the knowledg of the truth in your hearts, but are
looking without, doting without in the letter, acting and imitating out
of the light for life,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 6, 7.</note> and so in darkness doing your own works, which
are not required at your hands, but are for condemnation by the light,
and so in vain are you worshipping a God whom you know not,<note place="margin">Isai. 1. 13.</note> crying
up his Ordinances,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 9.</note> and crying up his Commands, and crying up the
Scripture,<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 22.</note> exalting it in the place of Christ, and thus coming neer him
with your lips, and your hearts far from him, still living in the corrupt
sinful nature, ignorant of the Free-grace of God which should lead you
to repentance and amendment of life, <hi>Ephes. 2. 5. 8.</hi> And because we
doe witness this mystery, which hath been hid from ages and generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
now made manifest in us, <hi>which is Christ within the hope of Glory,
Col. 1. 26, 27.</hi> who is the Light of the world, who doth inlighten eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that cometh into the world, who is the true Shepherd, <hi>Iohn 10.</hi>
and the true Teacher no more to be removed into a corner,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 27</note> 
               <hi>Isai. 30. 20.
who is the annoynting, who teacheth all things, and is the end of mans
teaching; </hi>therefore your ministery of the Letter, who make a trade and
a gain of the Letter by idolizing it, and setting it up in the room of
Christ, by taking the authority from Christ, and applying it to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that your <hi>mindes</hi> who are taught by <hi>them,</hi> may the more be drawn
without to look at it, and idolize it, expecting life and salvation by it,
and no hope without it, that they may the longer make merchandize of
you, and stil uphold their trade, and gain by it, do now see that this
our Doctrine of Christ to bee all in all, and that without him we can do
nothing, <hi>Ioh. 15. 5.</hi> but that by him we can do all things without the
help of Scripture, or any thing else without, <hi>Phil. 4. 13.</hi> and that there
is no other name under heaven by which we can be saved, but that he
is able to save to the utmost all that shal come unto God by him, <hi>Heb.
7. 25.</hi> And that he is the word, and the Scripture is not, and that he
is the light, and the Scripture is not, and that he is the rule and guide,
and Teacher and Judg, &amp; the Scripture is not, but a declaration of him
to be so, and that the Scripture all along witnesseth with our Doctrine
to be one with it, and theirs to be another Doctrine, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will not maintain, but the Scripture is against, and is onely
brought in for lucres sake to satisfie their own carnal ends, that they
may bear rule by their means, as the false Prophets did before them,
<hi>Ier. 5. 30, 31.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this light all along makes them manifest in all their colours, &amp;
false covers, so that they cannot hide themselves from being Deceivers;
and also this they do know, that if every one come to know and finde
a Teacher within them, which doth reach them the will of GOD,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34252:3"/>
and doth enable them for to obey it, so that they need no man to teach
them, then indeed they will no longer spend their monies upon them
for that which is not bread, nor their labour for that which profiteth
not, and will be a prey unto them no longer; so not onely their craft
and trade, and idol will fail them, but also their great gain and riches
will be taken from them, and all their honour, and fame, and dignity
will come to nought; therefore they in their hot rage and fierceness,
and enmity of their spirits, do set themselves to oppose this light,
wheresoever it is made manifest, and persecuting the publishers of this
Doctrine, railing against them as deceivers, and seducers, and bringers
in of false lights, and such as deny the Scripture, and would rob it of its
Authority, and give it to a light within them (which the Prrests call a
naturall light, and insufficient to lead to salvation without the help of
Scripture and other outward helps, and so would set the Scripture
above the light of CHRIST, saying among themselves, If we let go
the Authority of Scripture then all is gone; (that is to say) take away
our Idoll, then take away our maintenance, then down with our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry:
So here is clear the foundation they stand upon: and this is the
cause why they call the Scripture their foundation; and so all this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which they put upon the Scripture, they take from Christ, who
alone is the foundation of the faithfull, of whom the Scripture is a
declaration, and so we do own it by the same which gave it forth, which
unto us doth open it and reveal it, and manifests them to be out of the
life of it, and so by the life thereof are judged and condemned, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is proved. And though they call it the word, yet in the same it
doth witness against them, and witness Christ to be the word before
the Scripture was written, John 1. And though they call the Scripture
the Light, yet in the same it doth witness against them, and witnesseth
Christ to be the Light before the Scripture was written, and is able to
save to the uttermost all that shall come unto God by him, and they
that climb up any other way, the same are thieves and robbers, John
10. 1. And therefore is not a natural insufficient Light, as they that
know him not do report of him, and therefore shew themselves to be

<hi>Ioseph,</hi> yet wondred at his power, and the works that were done by
him, as these do now wonder at the prosperity of this ministration of
Light, and to see how it prevails upon the hearts of the people, so that
they know not what to think of it, they are not able to encounter with
it, but that they see it strikes so much at their Diana, and lyes so hard
at their foundation, so that it makes their building totter, therefore
the Rulers, Priests and Pharisees takes counsel together, saying one to
another, If we let this people alone, all men will go after them, and
they will draw away whole nations: therefore they take the same course
as ever the false prophets did, joyning together with the earthly powers
to make war with the Lamb, persecuting, stocking, whipping, imprison-
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34252:4"/>
and shamefully intreating his messengers, whom the Lamb sends forth
to bear testimony of this Light in peoples consciences (where we have
a witness both in them that believe, and in them that perish) and also
striving all the wayes they can, by their evill incensing, lying, raylings,
and false accusings and reporting to defame this light, and leaven your
mindes against it (that if it were possible) to put it out, that stil they
might uphold their fathers kingdom of Darkness, and bear rule by
their means over the blinde, carrying captive the mindes of people, but
who is able to make war with the Lamb, or who shall withstand the day
of his coming? <hi>Saul, Saul, it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks:</hi> and
though they call the Scripture their rule and guide, yet in this it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth
against them to be in <hi>Cains</hi> way, and <hi>Balaams</hi> way, and in the
gain-saying, of <hi>Core,</hi> and so have not God, <hi>Iude 11. 2 Iohn</hi> 9. but are
found to be of the generation, who are born after the flesh, persecuting
them that are born after the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29. And though they call
the Scripture their Rule and Guide, yet they receive not power from it,
to inable them to walk according to it, but are altogether erring from
it, in any thing that crosseth self, but as many as receive the light, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
power to follow it, and come out of the corrupt sinfull nature,
which they live in who know not the Light, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. And here the
Light is above the Scripture: and though they say the Scripture is the
judge and tryer of spirits, yet in the same it witnesseth against them to
be lyars, and bears witness of Christ <hi>to be Iudge, and tryer, and sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of the heart, and discerner of the thoughts,</hi> Hebr. 4. 12. Rom. 1.
16. 1 Pet. 4. 5. <hi>And that whatsoever makes manifestation, is Light,</hi>
Eph: 5: 13: Therefore that which makes manifest false spirits, is the light
and not the letter; which light manifested and discovered false spirits,
before the Scripture was written: and also though they say the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the judge and tryer of spirits, yet by the Scripture they cannot
discern or judge of spirits, else what makes all this difference in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amongst them who profess to try spirits by the scripture, and
profess it to be their Rule, and ground their judgement upon it, yet
are so confused in the same, and never a one knows which is the truth,
when as the way is but one; so that it follows that they have nothing
but the Scripture without, are still without in darkness and confusion,
as all those appears to be who call the Scripture their rule, and guide,
and judge, and tryer of spirits, and yet knows not the truth, but are
jangling, and wrangling, and arguing, and disputing, and contending
about the Scripture, every one with a severall judgment upon it, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this distraction is not in the Scripture, for it was spoken from one,
and all agrees in one: therefore you that so profess the Scripture, see
if you can finde it out by the Scripture, and see where you are, but
they that are in the light have fellowship one with another, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1: 7:
and are of one heart and one soul, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 33: and all agree in one, and
are Epistles wrote one in anothers heart, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3: 2: and by the light
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34252:4"/>
they cry and discern false Spirits, and in it are able to judge them, and
open the Scriptures without wresting, adding, or diminishing, and by it
do know they are of God, because they love one another with the
same love with which Christ loved them, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. It is not such love
which is to day, and to morrow cross the will and it is turned into
wrath and anger; nay that love stands in the corrupt will; but this love
stands in the bond of peace, which doth indure; and here again the
light is above the Scripture, and though they say the light must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the Scripture, yet in this the Scripture doth witness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, and bears witness of Christ to be the light of the world,
<hi>and doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world;</hi> and they that could
never read letter of the Book have this light, which is sufficient to teach
them and lead them into all truth, after they come to the knowledge
of it, and from this light the Scripture was spoken, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. and
without this light none can read the Scripture with understanding, and
here the light is before the Scripture, and out of it all the children of
darkness are shut with their busie mindes and vain contending spirits;
and though they say they must receive life and salvation from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet in this the Scripture witnesseth against them, and testifies of
Christ to be the alone fountain of life and salvation, <hi>and that there
is no other name under heaven by which wee can be saved, Psal.</hi> 30. 9. &amp; 14.
100. And that the Pharisees had the Scripture, yet had not the light, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could see that he was the Christ, though the Scripture bare testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of him, or either would come unto him for life and salvation,
but trusted in the Scripture, thinking there to find eternall life, and
therein found it not, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 39. 40. As all you are now, who are seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the living among the dead; and here again the light is above the
Scripture, which light is within us the hope of glory, <hi>Coll.</hi> 1. 26, 27.
and those that cannot witness this, are in the reprobation, though they
have the Scripture without, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. and from it we receive life
and salvation, and from no other; and this alone is our guide, teacher,
Judge, and Law-giver, if we never see Letter, <hi>Luke 1. 79. Iohn 6. 45. Isa.</hi>
33. and this alone is the ground and foundation of our faith and hope,
by which we are made able to cry, <hi>Abba Father, 1 Cor. 3. 11, Rom:</hi> 8:
15: And here it is not self that judgeth or condemns, but Christ that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in us, <hi>Gal:</hi> 2: 20: and it is not self that justifies us, but Christ that
liveth in us; and here Christ is exalted into his Throne, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
owned in its place, without contempt or undervaluing: And they
found the Ministers of Antichrist, who would cast Christ out of his
Throne, and take the Scripture out of its place to exalt above him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
to it that Authority which alone belongs unto him for their own
by, secret, self-ends, so that in that they apply such authority to the
Scripture, they in the same rob Christ of it, and undervalues him, as the
Pharisees did, who thought in the Scriptures to finde eternal life, but
would not come to Christ that they might have life, in whose steps ye
and your teachers are found professing Christ in words, but in life
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34252:5"/>
denying him, and therefore must be judged and condemned by him, as
they was. And if you Priests do alledg, <hi>There is a false light as well
as a true light,</hi> I answer, <hi>That is it in you which blinds your mindes so
that you cannot conceive this Gospell, but from you it is hid,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 3.
4. And therefore you bring another Gospell, calling the four Books
<hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Gospel; in which these four Books
will witness against you, and bear witness of Christ to be the Gospel,
which is the power of God unto salvation; who is the Lamb of God
slain from the foundation of the World, who came to take away the
sins of the world; and <hi>blessed are they that are not offended in him;
Iohn</hi> 1. 26. and verse 13. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 23. And also that is a false light in you
which leads you into the form, or resemblance, or outward shew of
holiness, but denies the life and power, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. and to profess the
Scripture to be your rule, but in life and practice deny it, and to be
short, leads into a profession without possession, but that which leads
into the life and power, is no false light, for it leads into the possession
before the profession, and so the profession is from the possession, but
your profession is from onothers possession, and so boasts in anothers
line, by which you beguile both your selves and others, and therefore
in that you go about to arm your selves with the Scripture, to oppose
the light by exalting it above the light, thinking thereby to debase the
light, and so to keep peoples mindes from the light, that they may stil
remain in darkness and blindness under you. You do but in the same
bring a weapon to cut off your own heads, and raise a war to destroy
your selves, and increase more light to the people, and manifest your
selves odious, &amp; to be the blind guides of the Nation; who are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
and turned away from us; Deceivers to be held as accursed, who
bring another Doctrine in opposition to the true Doctrine which is
held forth in the Scripture;<note place="margin">2 Ioh. 9. 10</note> for the Scripture and the light agrees in
one, from both which you are shut with jangling contentious spirits, by
which you would wrest the Scripture out of its place, to clash against
its Originall; thereby to uphold your Father Antichrists Kingdom, &amp;
therein do the more manifest your selves to be the Ministers of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
who under profession of the true Christ, do oppose him and make
war with him, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13, 14, 15. but your weapons are weak, as is
daily made manifest.</p>
