            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Humble REMONSTRANCE OF Sir <hi>Frederick Hammilton,</hi> Knight and Colonell. TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE THE COMMITTEE OF BOTH KINGDOMS.</head>
            <p>I Have ſerved King JAMES and King CHARLS, neer this thirty yeer in their Court, as a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of their Privy Chamber, without Penſion or Monopoly; and for moſt of that time, I have had a Command in the Old Army in <hi>Ireland.</hi> King JAMES having in his life time conferred upon me, the Troop of Horſe, with <pb facs="tcp:32054:2"/>the Foot Company, and the Government of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickfergus,</hi> which were Commanded by the old Lord <hi>Chicheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards I levied a Regiment of Foot, and was with Honourable Recommendations, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by His Majeſtie into <hi>Germany,</hi> where I ſerved ſome yeers under the glorious and victorious Prince, the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> returning with His Royall Recommendations, and good acceptance of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, witneſſed with His Princely Tokens, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me.</p>
            <p>At my return it hath been heard of, what hard meaſure I met withall in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the power, and greatneſſe, of the late Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> whoſe deſigne was apparent, the ruine of my Honour and Fortune, if the Lord had not of his great Mercy inabled me with courage, to ſtand for my innocency, for the defence of both.</p>
            <p>Since this horrid Rebellion, how I have been ingaged with a poor handfull of men, and what wonderfull things God hath done for us, and with us, is not unknown to my greateſt Enemies, though they call me a bragger.</p>
            <p>After it pleaſed God to inable me, to bring off my Wife and Children from the great miſeries they ſuffered, without any comfort or relief, leaving my Caſtle and Garriſon in the beſt condition I could, procuring the Souldiers leave to apply my ſelf <pb facs="tcp:32054:2"/>hither, with hopes of better preferment for my ſelf, and ſpeedy relief for them.</p>
            <p>Coming to <hi>London-Derry</hi> where I had ſome For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune left me by my Wifes Father, Sir <hi>John Vaughan,</hi> who died Governour of the ſaid Citie. I found that means he left me, and all my Tenants, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached upon by the Regiments there, who had taken of me and my Tenants, to the value of three thouſand pounds; Notwithſtanding the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall reliefs they received both from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> beſides the great ſums they have got of other mens Lands, and the ſeverall great Preyes hath been got amongſt them ſince this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
            <p>Finding my ſelf ſo uſed by them, and not able to Command my own Rents and Tenants, having been as active in the Service, as any Colonell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and the means of keeping them ſo free from the incurſion of the Rebels out of <hi>Connaught,</hi> Did think in Honour and Juſtice, my own Lands and Tenants undeſtroyed, ſhould have been laid off for my own quarters and maintenance; but finding neglect, and hard-heartedneſſe amongſt them, I was forced to apply my ſelf to my Noble Friends in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who were pleaſed to take my hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and great charge, into their Honourable and Charitable Care, and Conſideration, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point me the Command of a Regiment of Horſe there, untill they could be the inſtruments of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing me from the Honourable Parliament here, <pb facs="tcp:32054:3"/>ſome greater power and preferment for the better inabling me to go on with the Service there in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I being in <hi>Scotland,</hi> news was brought to the Committee of Eſtates there, of the dangerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented condition of their Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> neer <hi>Carrickfergus;</hi> and how through want of means, they were neceſſitated to joyn themſelves in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Oath, to ſtick to one another in applying themſelves towards the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> for performance of what was promiſed them: Which miſerable extremity of theirs, the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> indeavoured to relieve and ſuppreſſe, ſo long as they could; untill at length two or three Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did forſake that Kingdom, as the reſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (to the no ſmall hazard of all the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms) had not the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> out of their judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious care, made uſe of me, and Sir <hi>Mungoe Campbell,</hi> a Colonell of that Army, whom they ſent with inſtructions, to indeavour the appeaſing of their diſcontents, and to perſwade the reſt of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not to abandon that Kingdom, and to leave it into the hands of the Rebels; who at that time were apparently in a readineſſe to have entered upon the Countrey, ſo ſoon as the <hi>Scots</hi> Army had forſaken it, being confident (as many others were) that no perſwaſions could alter their reſolutions from going: Nevertheleſſe, it pleaſed God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expectation, ſo to bleſſe our indeavours, and inſtructions, as we prevailed with them, and our <pb facs="tcp:32054:3"/>words were taken for a time, to ſtay, untill the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> were advertiſed with what we had undertaken for, in their names, ſhould be ſpeedily ſent them from <hi>Scotland,</hi> which accordingly was performed, notwithſtanding their own great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens at that time.</p>
            <p>I was afterwards the immediate inſtrument, and beſt help to the Miniſters, who were intruſted with the Solemn League and Covenant, to get it taken by the Citizens of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> the Regiments and Countrey thereabouts; who will confeſſe, that without me, it had not ſo eaſily paſt, if at all, at that time.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe pretences and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, beſides the ſeverall Recommendations of the Parliament, and Committee of Eſtates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> have I waited here neer this eight moneths, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſome courſe to be taken with me, for the recompence of my paſt Services, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to go on, and as yet have met with neither.</p>
            <p>Therefore prayeth leave to inform what danger I apprehend will follow to the Publike Service, if I ſhall be thus neglected and diſcountenanced for my faithfull Services. If Sir <hi>Charls Coote,</hi> a young Gentleman, whoſe hopefull expectation I will not except againſt, what the Parliament ſhall think fin to confer upon him, ſo as his preferment do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon the prejudice of the Publike Service, or <pb facs="tcp:32054:4"/>upon my Honour and Intereſt; wherein I conceive both will ſuffer, if the reſolution hold as is reported, to make him Lord Precedent of <hi>Connaught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what content it will be to the Rebels, when they ſhall hear my Services againſt them, hath been ſo rewarded, as not onely the Counties of <hi>Sligoe,</hi> and <hi>Leitrim;</hi> which God hath inabled me to do ſo great Service in, ſince this Rebellion, without the help of Sir <hi>Charls Coote,</hi> who muſt by this Title injoy the fruits of my Labour; as alſo be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of my own Caſtle and Garriſon, and ſuch well deſerving Souldiers in it, as hath ſerved neer this ſix yeers, without means, but out of my own Fortune hath maintained Officers and Souldiers, there being neer 6000. pounds in Arrear, due to me; And having loſt as great a Fortune in that Kingdom, in Stock, and Rent, as any here hath, What ſuch hard uſage may produce, and what diſhonour this will be to me, to have another put over my head, with the charge of thoſe two Counties, wherewith I was at the beginning of this Rebellion intruſted, by Warrant and Commiſſion, from the Lords Juſtices, and Councell of that Kingdom, to raiſe, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, what numbers of men I thought fit for the Service; and now to be turned out of this truſt, after all my long Service, great loſſe, and ſufferings, unqueſtioned for any miſdemeanours, or neglect in that Charge, I humbly ſubmit to your Honours Judicious Wiſdoms.</p>
            <p>Tendering to your further conſiderations, my <pb facs="tcp:32054:4"/>weak opinion out of my knowledge and experience of the Countrey, and out of my faithfull zeal for the advancement of the Service; what I hold fitteſt for the preſent to be done concerning <hi>Connaught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That according as I joyned in a Paper with Sir <hi>Charls Coote,</hi> mentioning the way we intended to proſecute the War there: We may be inabled with equall power to help one another, as we ſhall ſtand in need, and that I may be truſted onely with thoſe two Counties, with what proportion of the Supplies ſhall be thought fitting for me to make uſe of.</p>
            <p>That Sir <hi>Charls Coote</hi> may Command the reſt of the whole Province, conſiſting of four Counties, which he may the eaſier deal withall, I taking charge of the other two, which I have ſo long ſerved for; and it were hard meaſure, if not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, to turn me out of the Province, and out of my own houſe with diſgrace, which muſt be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if he muſt be Lord Precedent of <hi>Connaught;</hi> yet rather then I ſhould in any way appear in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Parliaments pleaſure (if it were not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them of the conveniences and dangers, which may concern their own ſervices) I ſhould chooſe to forſake all.</p>
            <p>Conſider likewiſe, that Sir <hi>Charles Cootes</hi> Houſe, and Being, is ſo far remote from <hi>Sligoe,</hi> and thoſe parts in <hi>Leitrim,</hi> wherein I live, as with no conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency can he do Service there, without neglecting <pb facs="tcp:32054:5"/>the Countrey where he lives, being neer fifty miles diſtant.</p>
            <p>If the Parliament be reſolved not to give ear or credit to my opinion or advice, let me have my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears, and contentment for my houſe, and interreſt in that Province, and diſpoſe of me elſewhere, at their pleaſure.</p>
