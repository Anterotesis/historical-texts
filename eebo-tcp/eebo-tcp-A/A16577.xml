            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7196:3"/>
that of practyſe and not of naked ſpeculation, I may ſomethynge wryte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng death (whiche is dredful out of thee &amp; in it ſelfe) to the glory of thy holy name, to myne owne comfort in thee, and to the edifying of al them, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this writing ſhall come, to be red or hearde. Amen.</p>
            <p>¶ There be .iiii. kindes of death, <note place="margin">iiij. kindes of death.</note> one whiche is naturall, an other which is ſpiritual, a third which is temporall, and a fourth which is eternal. Concerning the firſt and the laſt what they be, I nede not to declare, but the ſecond and the third, perchaunce, of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (for whoſe ſake eſpecially I <note place="margin">Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al death what it is</note> wryte) are not ſo ſoone eſpied.</p>
            <p>By a ſpirituall deathe therfore, I mean ſuch a death as the body lyuing the ſoule is dead. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="tcp:7196:3"/>
the Apoſtle maketh mencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <note place="margin">2. Tim. 5</note> ſpeaking of widdowes which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng daintely, being a liue in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, are dead in ſoule. Thus you ſee what I meane by the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all death. Nowe by a temporall <note place="margin">Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death.</note> death I mean ſuch a death, wher throught the body and affections therof are mortified, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite may lyue. Of which kynde of deathe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in <note place="margin">Cols. 3.</note> exhorting vs to kyl our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers. And thus muche of the kindes of death: wherin the iudgement of the worlde is not to it approued, for it careth leſſe for ſpiritual dea the, then for naturall deathe: it eſtemeth leſſe eternall death then temporal death, orels wold men leaue ſyn, which procureth both <note place="margin">Sinne is the cauſe of death.</note> thone and the other (I mean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual &amp; eternal death) and choſe
<pb facs="tcp:7196:4"/>
temporally to dye, that by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death they myght enter into the full fruition of eternall lyfe: whiche none can enioy nor enter into, that here wil not temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dye, that is, mortifie their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and crucifie their luſtes and concupicences: For by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at the firſt came death, as we may reade Geneſis the. 3. If Eue had not obeyed her deſire in eatinge the forbydden fruite, <note place="margin">By what meanes death came into the world.</note> wherby ſhe died ſpiritually, none of theſe kyndes of death had euer come vnto man, nor ben knowen of vs. Therfore (as I ſaid) we muſt nedes here temporally dye: that is, mortifie our affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to eſcape the ſpiritual death, and by naturall death, not onely eſcape eternal death of ſoule &amp; body, but alſo by it, as by a dore, enter into
<pb facs="tcp:7196:4"/>
eternall life, which Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour hath procured and purchaſed to and for al that be in him, tranſlatinge eternall deathe into a ſleepe or rather into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyueraunce of ſoule &amp; body, from all kinde of myſery &amp; ſynne. By reaſon wherof we may ſe that to thoſe that be in Chriſte: that is, to ſuch as do beleue (which bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers I meane, are diſcerned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, by not walking after the <note place="margin">Roma. 8.</note> fleſh, but after the ſprite) to thoſe I ſay, death is no da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage, but a vantage: no dreadfull thing, but rather deſierable, &amp; of all meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers moſt mery, whiles he is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon with the eyes of faith in the goſpell. But more of this hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I briefely ſhewed thee the kyndes of deathe, what
<pb facs="tcp:7196:5"/>
they be, whence they come, and what remedy for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But now<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for as muche as I am purpoſed hereafter to entreate onely of the firſt kynd of death, that is, of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural death, ſomthing to comfort <note place="margin">Naturall death.</note> my ſelf &amp; others againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dreade and paynes of the ſame: I wyll ſpeake of it as God ſhal inſtructe mee, and as I accuſtome with my ſelf to muſe on it now<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; then, the better to be prepared againſt the houre of temptation.</p>
            <p>I haue ſhewed howe that this naturall death came by ſpiritual death y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, by obeying our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes: but through the benefite of Chriſt, to ſuch as be in him, &amp; <note place="margin">Death what it is to chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> die temporally, that is, to ſuche beleeuers as labour to mortyfie their affections, it is no deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:7196:5"/>
but a plaine diſſolution both of ſoule and body, from all kynde of perils, daungers, &amp; miſeries, and therefore to ſuch is not to be dread, but to be deſired: as wee ſe in the Apoſtle, whiche deſired <note place="margin">Philip. 1. Luke. 2.</note> to be diſſolued: And in Simeon which deſired to be loſed, ſaying: diſmiſſe or loſe mee, O lorde, By whiche wordes, he ſemeth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to teache, that this life is a bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and nothinge to be deſired, as now I wyll ſomthing ſhewe.</p>
            <p>Firſt conſyder the pleaſures of <note place="margin">This liffe is not to be loued in reſpect of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ther of, beinge nothynge elſe but vanitie.</note> this life, what they be, how long they laſt, how painefull we come by them, what they leaue behind them: and thou ſhalt euen in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe nothing but vauitie. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ample: how long laſteth the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that man hath in the acte of generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? How painfully do me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:7196:6"/>
behaue theym ſelues before they attayne it? how doth it leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it a certaine lothſomnes and fulnes? I wyl ſpeake nothing of the ſting of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, if it be come by vnlawefully. Who wel ſeinge this, and forecaſting it aforeha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, woulde not forgoe the pleaſures willingly, as farre as neede wyl permyt &amp; ſuffer? If then in this one, wherunto nature is moſte prone, and hath moſt pleaſure in, it be thus: alas how can we but thincke ſo of other pleaſures?</p>
            <p>Put the caſe that the pleaſures of this life were permanente du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this life: yet in that this life <note place="margin">What this lyfe is, marke here, and learne.</note> it ſelfe is nothing in comparyſon, and therfore is ful wel compared to a candell light, whiche is ſone blowne out, to a flower, whiche fadeth away, to a ſmoke, to a ſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dowe,
<pb facs="tcp:7196:6"/>
to a ſleepe, to a runnynge water, to a day, to an houre, to a momente, and to vanitie it ſelfe: who wold eſteme theſe pleſures and commodities, which laſte ſo lyttle a while? Before they be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne, they are gone and paſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye. Howe muche of our tyme ſpende wee in ſlepyng, in eating, in drinking, and in talking? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie is not perceiued: youth is ſhortly ouerblowen: middle age is nothyng: olde age is not long: and therfore (as I ſaid) this lif, through the conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the pleaſures and commodities of it, ſhoulde little moue vs to loue it, but rather to lothe it. God open our eies to ſee theſe thinges, and to wey them accordingly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the miſeries of this life, that if ſo be the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb facs="tcp:7196:7"/>
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities in it ſhuld moue vs to loue it: yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> miſeries <note place="margin">This life is more to be loched for the my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeries, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loued for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ther of.

Thus deare brother, I thought good to wryte to thee in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of the Lorde, that thou fearinge death for nothing els but becauſe of thy ſinnes, mighteſt be aſſured of pardon of them, &amp; ſo embrace death as a deare friend, &amp; inſulte againſt his terrour, ſtinge, &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, ſayinge: death where is thy ſtinge? hel where is thy victory? <note place="margin">1.

So that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardo, no little eaſe, no dungeon, no biſhops priſon, no gate houſe,
<pb facs="tcp:7196:40"/>
no ſinke, no pit maye be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in any poynte, to be ſo euill a pryſon for the body, as the body is for and of the ſoule. whereby the chyldren of God haue bene occaſioned to crie, and lament their longe being in it.

The olde man is like to a mightie Giant, ſuch a one as was Goliath, for his birth is now perfecte. But the newe man is like vnto a little chylde, ſuche a one as was Dauide, for his birth is not yet perfecte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the day of his generall reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>The olde man therefore is more ſtronger, iuſty, and ſtirring, then is the new man, becauſe the birth of the newe man is but begonne
<pb facs="tcp:7196:45"/>
now, and the olde man is perfect<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly borne. And as the olde man is more ſtirringe, luſtye, &amp; ſtronger the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new man: ſo is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of him cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as being earthly &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rupt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Satans ſede, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly &amp; bleſſed with the celeſtial ſeed of god. So that one man, in as much as he is corrupt with the ſeede of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente, is an olde man: and in as muche as hee is bleſſed with the ſeede of God from aboue, he is a new ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And as, in as much as he is an old man, he is a ſinner &amp; an enemy to god: ſo in as much as he is regenerate, he is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and helpe, and a frende to God, the ſeede of God preſerui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g him from ſinne, ſo that he cannot ſinne, as the ſeede of the ſerpente,

wherwith he is corrupt euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ception, inclineth him, yea enforceth him to ſinne &amp; nothing els but to ſinne. Soo that the beſt part in man before regenera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, in Gods ſight, is not onely an enemie, but enmitie it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>One man therfore wich is rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, well may bee called al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies iuſt, and alwaies ſinfull: iuſt in reſpect of Gods ſeed, and his regeneration: ſinfull in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Satans ſeed &amp; his firſte birth. Betwixt theſe two men therfore, there is continuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicte &amp; warre moſt deadly.

               <q>

the children of God themſelues thinke that they bee nothing els but olde, and that the ſprit &amp; ſeed of God is loſt and gone away, <note place="margin">Pſal. 77</note> wher yet notwithſtandinge the the truth is otherwiſe, the ſpirit and the ſeede of god at the length appearing againe, and diſpelling away the cloudes, which couer the ſonne of gods ſeed from ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge, as the cloudes in the ayer do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corporal ſonne: ſo that ſome times a man cannot tell by anye ſenſe, that there is any ſonne, the cloudes and windes ſo hiding it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſiht: Euen ſo our cecitie or blindnes and corrupte affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">☞</note> doe ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhadow the ſight of Gods ſeed in Gods children, as though they were plaine repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, wherof it commeth, that they praying accordinge to their

ſenſe, but not accordinge to the truth, deſire of god to geue them againe his ſpirit, as though they had loſt it &amp; he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it away. Which thing God neuer doth in deede, althoughe he make vs to thinke ſo for a time: for alwayes he holdeth hys hande vnder hys childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their faules, that they lie not ſtil as other do which are not regenerate. And this is the difference betwixte Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which are regenerate, and elect before all times in Chriſt, &amp; the wicked caſt awayes, that the elect lie not ſtill continually in their ſinne as do the wicked, but at the length do returne againe by reaſon of gods ſeed, which is in them hid as a ſparkle of fier in the aſſhes:</q> as we may ſee in Peter, Dauid, Paule, Marye Magdalin</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7196:47"/>
and others.</p>
            <p>For theſe (I meane Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren) God hath made all things in Chriſt Ieſu: to whom he hath geuen this dignity, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould bee his inheritance &amp; ſpouſes.</p>
            <p>This our inheretour Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus, GOD with God, light of light, coeternal and conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall with the father and with the holy Goſt, to the end that he might become oure huſband (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the huſband and the wyfe muſt be one body and fleſh) hath taken our nature vppon hym, communicating with it and by it in his owne perſon, to vs all his children, his diuine maieſtie, as Peter ſaith, and ſo is become <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.</note> fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bones ſubſtancially: as we are become fleſh of his fleſh and
<pb facs="tcp:7196:47"/>
bone of his bones ſpiritually, all that euer we haue pertaining to him yea euen our ſins: as al that euer he hath, perteineth vnto vs, euen his whole glory. So that if Satan ſhould ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vs to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for our dettes or ſinnes, in that the wife is no ſutable perſon but the huſband, wee may well byd him enter his action againſt our huſband Chriſt, and he wyll make him a ſufficient anſwere.</p>
            <p>For this end (I meane that we might bee coupled &amp; maried thus to Chriſt, and ſo be certein of ſal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; at godly peace with god in our conſciences) god hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen his holy word, which hath two partes (as now the children of God do conſiſte of two men) one part of gods word bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old man, &amp; the other part
<pb facs="tcp:7196:48"/>
of Gods word beinge proper to the new man. The part properly perteining to the old man is the law: the part properly perteining to the new man is the goſpell.</p>
            <p>The law is a doctrine which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundeth &amp; forbiddeth, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring doing and auoiding.

The Goſpell is a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which alwaies offreth and giueth, requiring on our behalfe, not as of worthines or as a cauſe but as a cerificat vnto vs, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore vnder it is conteined al the free and ſwete promiſes of god: as I am the lord thy god &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In thoſe that be of yeres of diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it requireth faith, not as a cauſe, but as an inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by
<q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7196:48"/>
we our ſelues may be certeine of our good huſband Chriſt, and of his glorye: and therfore when the conſcience feleth it ſelfe dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted for feare of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">☞</note> agaynſt ſinne, ſhe maye in no wiſe loke vppon the doctryne perteyninge to the olde man, but to the doctrine only that pertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the newe man, in it not lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king for that which it requireth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is Faith, becauſe we neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue as we ſhould: but only on it which it offreth, which it geueth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, on gods grace &amp; eternal mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy and peace in Chriſt. So ſhall ſhe bee in quiet, when ſhe loketh for it altogether out of her ſelf in Gods mercy in Chriſte Ieſu: in whoſe lappe if ſhe laye her heade with ſaiut Iohn, then is ſhe hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>py and ſhal find quietnes in deed.</q>
               <pb facs="tcp:7196:49"/>
when ſhe feleth her ſelfe quyete, then in Gods name let her looke on the lawe &amp; vpon ſuch thinges as it requireth, therby to brydel and kepe downe the olde Adam, to ſlay that Goliath, from whom ſhe muſt nedes keepe the ſweete promiſes, being the bed wherein her ſpouſe and ſhe mete and lie to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether, as the wife will kepe her bed only for her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, although in other thinges ſhe is contented to haue fellowſhip with others, as to ſpeake, ſitte, eat, drinke, go, &amp;c. So our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, which are Chriſts wiues, muſt nedes kepe the bed, that is, Gods ſwete pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſſes, alonly for our ſelues and our huſbande, there to meete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to embrace and laugh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to be ioyful together. If ſinne, the lawe, the deuyll, or
<pb facs="tcp:7196:49"/>
any thinge would crepe into the bed and lie there, then complaine to thy huſband Chriſt, and forth wyth thou ſahlte ſee hym playe Phinees parte. Thus my dearly beloued, I haue geuen you in fewe wordes a ſumme of all the Diuinitie which a chriſtian conſcience can not want.</p>
