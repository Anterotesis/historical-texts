         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N Munday morning <hi>Sep.</hi> 18. 1648. The Lords
and the reſt of the Commiſſioners (after pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
with the Chaplaines, who pray each of them
by turnss, one, one weeke, another, another
weeke Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> prayed this weeke) they went
(but not the Chaplaines) to the place of the
Treaty, and ſent word to His Majeſty, that they were come
and ready to waite upon His Majeſty at the Treaty: (this was
about 9 a clocke in the morning.) The Commiſſioners were
appointed a roome neere unto the Chamber where the Treaty
is, which is a withdrawing roome, (in which is ſeverall other
roomes) untill his Majeſty calls for them. The King is in one
part of the Houſe, the other is reſerved for the Commiſſioners
when they come to the Treaty.</p>
            <p>Immediately after they were come, and word brought to the
King, that the Commiſſioners were ready, His Majeſty paſſeth
from Sir <hi>William Hodges</hi> to the Treaty in His Coach, with the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45455:3"/>
Lords and others that attend His Majeſty, and His Footmen,
and Coach-man, with new ſuites laid with broad plate ſilver
lace, two in a Seame. His Majeſty came into the Treaty
Chamber, where is a large table: At the upper end whereof
is a Canopy and a Chaire of State for His Majeſty, where He
ſat downe.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty being ſet, ſent out for the Commiſſioners into
the Treaty Chamber, who comming into His Majeſties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
ſtood bare to the King. His Majeſty bad them ſit down
at the table, the Commiſſioners (very modeſtly) refuſed it at
firſt, but His Majeſty preſſing them, they ſat downe at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of the Table, but all bare both the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
No body at all, comes into the roome, but the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and the Commiſſioners from the Parliament.</p>
            <p>That day they read their Commiſſion (to the King in the
morning) and other things in relation to the preparations of the
Treaty, which they fell upon in the afternoone.</p>
            <p>The King went to dinner to His Quarters, and the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
to theirs and in the afternoone fell to the Treaty againe,
and made ſome entrance, and parted againe at night to their

               <p>Wee are ready by debate to ſhew how reaſonable
our deſires are, and there will be no reaſon that wee
ſhould alter or recede from them. But if in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45455:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of this, or any other debate, your Majeſty give
ſuch reaſons as ſhall ſatisfie us for any omiſſions or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
in the papers we ſent to your Majeſty, wee
ſhall then doe therein as we are warranted by our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
which we have not power to make known,
as we have declared (in a former paper of the 18 of
this inſtant) to your Majeſty.</p>

               <p>HIS Majeſty could not diſpatch to be ready to
Anſwer what was before propounded by the
Commiſſioners, and therefore put it off untill the next
day. And His Majeſty ſent Anſwer by His Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that Hee could not meet the Commiſſioners that
night, and delivered in Reaſons why Hee could not
meet that afternoone.</p>
               <p>The Secretaries are admitted to be behind a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
where they Treate, in the time of the Treaty.</p>
               <p>There is as yet nothing denyed by the King to bee
paſſed; though nothing actually granted. But the great
rub is not get removed. His Majeſty is loath to charg
Himſelfe with the guilt of the blood ſpilt. The
Commiſſioners are very faithfull to their Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
To morrow His Majeſty puts in His Anſwer.</p>
