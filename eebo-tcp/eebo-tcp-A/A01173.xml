            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I ſpent in that countrey, I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued

them ſelues and looke better to

ſuch pernicious practiſes as might

Knight <hi>Poncet,</hi> in his diſcourſe dyd
fyrſt let them vnderſtand in howe
many Countreys, Principalities,
Kingdomes and Monarchies he
had bene, then that in anye of the
ſame he could neuer fynde anye

            <p>Secondly, he permitteth no other

who being from their chylde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

pleaſures of Kinges, whereby the
ſayd Princes and great Lordes
may rightly be termed controu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and hinderers of the Kinges
willes, and this proceedeth of the
vnitie and agreement of the ſayde
three eſtates, and therefore it is
ſayde that Kinges be chiefe Lords
and maſters in outwarde appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
but in effecte they are as it
wer ſubiect to their own ſubiects,
in that they can not accompliſhe
their owne deſires, and that theyr
own mocions and reaſons for the
moſt parte be neuer accepted, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
diuers tymes they
tende to the augmenting of theyr
liuing, and ſometimes to the ayde
of the neceſſitie of their affayres,
and therefore the ſoner to diſpatch
himſelfe of the ſayde Princes and
great Lordes, with the reſt of the
nobilitie, to the end by that means
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16508:10"/>
the ſtraightlier to ſubduce the reſt,
and ſo to diſpoſe &amp; alter all things
after his owne pleaſure and will,
it were neceſſary to vſe the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
for religion, for that they bee
the beſt inſtruments that might be
wiſhed to murder and ſlay on all
partes, and yet not to reiect ſuche
meanes as the peace might mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and which might be executed
as well by the parties greeued, as
by ſuch as be ingaged and bound
to his maieſties ſeruice, as the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
may beſt miniſter occaſion,
alſo that hereof, they ſhall fynde
choyſe of deuiſes and inuentions
inough among the aſhes of debate
and hatred, which the ſayde trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and deuiſions haue brought
forth. In the meane tyme to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
by all meanes poſſible for the
deminiſhing of the ſayde Princes,
Lordes, and nobilitie, as well in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16508:11"/>
perſons, as in goodes, and not to
graunt them any thing whereby
to obteyne greater numbers of
ſeruants and bondſlaues to them
at his maieſties charges, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that his maieſtie abſteyne
from giuing any rewardes and
recompences at the ſuites of the
ſayd Lordes, or of any other then
of ſuch as ſhall be founde truſtie,
and whom his maieſtie myndeth
to preferre vnto their dignities.
Alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if it were poſſible, it were
good that ſuch as receiue any libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie
ſhould come to hys owne
preſence, to the ende they might
perceiue vnto whom they were
principally bound, and this ought
eſpecially to be obſerued among
thoſe vnto whom his maieſtie ſhal
commit any publick offices, who
alſo after theyr diſpatches ſhould
be brought to take their leaues of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16508:11"/>
his maieſte, whereby he might let
them know, him ſelfe to haue bene
the only motioner of this honour
and commodity, alſo that he might
commaund them whatſoeuer hys
maieſty ſhould thinck good, for this
be aling would greatly binde them
vnto him and be very profitable.
Moreouer that the decayed and
ruinous caſtles and charges ſhold
be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid Princes, Lords,
and noble men which ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne,
vntill the tyme were come
that they might bee diſpatched.
Alſo that in the meane tyme none
of their eſtates, pentions, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
ſhould be geuen to any other
of them, then to ſuch as his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
ſhould ſee good, and that ſo by
all meanes poſſible, their commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
might be taken away, or at
the leaſtwiſe hindered, for that by
thoſe meanes he might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16508:12"/>
aſſured of them, &amp; keepe them
from practiſing any great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes,
but all muſt bee wrought
artificially and vnder fayre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces.
Alſo that his maieſty ſhould
not permit any aſſembly of eſtates
to be holden eyther generally or
perticulerly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that they ſerue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bridle Kinges more &amp; more,
but rather he ought ſeuerely to pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhe
all procurers of the ſame,
whereby the Kinges ſhall neuer
be without occaſion to diſpatche
ſuch as ſhould be odious vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </gap>
and thus after that his maieſty be
diſpatched of all hys Princes,
Lordes and nobilitie as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd,
he may eaſely atteyne vnto
the reſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as all the chiefe force
and principall parte of the ſayde
eſtates ſhal be voyde, and that his
maieſty hath with the tyme, made
and created others to hys owne
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16508:12"/>
mynde, for the common people of
themſelues dare not practiſe any
thynge, vnleſſe they haue ſome
great Captaines which wil either
beare them out in their doynges,
or egge them forwarde to theyr
practiſes. Lykewiſe his maieſtie
hauing made a peace, ſhould in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wyſe puniſh, and for the ſmaleſt
occaſion that might be, put to death
all ſuch gouernours and officers
of townes, as during theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
haue bene contrary to hys
ſeruice, for bicauſe at the firſt blaſt
of any contrary wynd, they will
not fayle but reuolt, to the ende to
exempt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from ſuch peyne
and puniſhment as they ſhould
feare to haue iuſtly deſerued for
their former follyes and offences.
Alſo at ſuch tyme as hys maieſtie
hath reduced his ſubiectes to thys
obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the people dare not with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16508:13"/>
ſtand the beating down of fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
&amp; vnma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teling of walled tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in the hart of his kingdom, or
in any other place where his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
ſhall thinke them hurtfull:
For aſſuredly the great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of
Caſtles and walled townes, doe

euil diſpoſed perſons, to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes
of ſuch enterpriſes, and doe
make the inhabitauntes of the

And doubtleſſe the greate
number of townes in <hi>France</hi> were
in tymes paſte, built by ſundrye
Lordes, Princes, and common
wealthes, which enioyed ſeuerall
dominions, and then ſerued for
bulwarckes &amp; defences to the one
agaynſt the others, neyther were
they gotten and incorporate vnto

inſomuch that that, belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging now

            <p>As concerning religion, at what

of, and ſo not to permit, but one
