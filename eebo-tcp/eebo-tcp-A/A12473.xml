            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Know not what <hi>Apologie</hi> to make for my selfe, that now in the copious multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of <hi>Treatises</hi> of this nature, I should yet thrust forth more, as though I could be a poore meanes to bring vnto thee any new matter, which by some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Worthy had not beene said before. And surely, this had almost discouraged me, vntill I called to mind the speech and counsell of a <hi>Right Reuerend Father of the Church,</hi> (yet aliue) which was, <hi>That if a thousand seuerall men had all written on these seuerall subiects: yet he could wish them all Printed. For (said he) though all doe agree in the maine, yet should we see a different carriage of elegancy and variety of the same spirit in the diuers distributions, amplifications, and prosecutions of the same subiect;</hi> Whereby (at least) this profit would come, that the soule might now and then be rauished in the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rarities of that <hi>Wonder-working-spirit,</hi> which so diffuseth it selfe in choyce of excellent abilities (all exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site and diuers) among such multitudes of seuerall men. This with the delight I tooke in reading, trimming and writing them out (with very much adoe) together with the desire I had to doe some poore seruice to the Church, and perpetuate the memory of the <hi>All-deseruing, most worthy, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Author</hi> (sometime my deare friend) imboldened mee to venter them vnto thy view: at the request of his som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <hi>deare Wife</hi> and Executrix. I beseech thee therefore, fauourably, to censure what is done, accepting the same in good part, from him who chused rather to present thee with a few <hi>Crummes</hi> which fell from this <hi>Holy mans Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18128:5"/>
then altogether bury in silence with him, his <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Workes.</hi> True it is, he wrote an infinite, intricate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding small abreuiated hand: out of all hope and possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be read (a fault yet incident to too many good Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, whereby they robbe Posterity of their Labours) by reason whereof, these three Treatises (mangled as they are) were, with much adoe, by a painfull Writer, and other helpes, fetcht (as it were) out of the fire, and so brought to this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect perfection. <hi>The former two</hi> by him were neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the publike view: onely that of <hi>Repentance,</hi> with his owne Epistle, he had appointed for the Presse, at our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest intreaty, but left it vnfinished to his mind. Therefore if therein thou findest any thing pleasing for thy good: and so canst measure <hi>Exvngue Leonem:</hi> iudge, if the <hi>Eccho of his voyce,</hi> the <hi>traces of his foot-steps,</hi> be such in <hi>scattered vnperfect Notes;</hi> what were those <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>Excellent Straines of Learning</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> wherewith he was most Plentifully indowed, and wherewith this Booke had beene more abundantly stored if his exact curious hand had lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it out for this vse. Much more I might say of him, but why should I? seeing it were but to extenuate the worth of such a shining and a burning <hi>Lampe,</hi> by labouring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, that which was vnexpressable, and which my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was neuer able to reach or search into.

                  <p>Secondly, that wee faint not in any trouble seeing God is most mightie that takes our part; For no man is so poore, but God by his power can make him rich; No man is so sicke, but God by his power can make him whole: No man is so weake, but God by his power can make him strong, <hi>Heb</hi> 13. 6.</p>

                     <hi>A</hi> Hee is most <hi>Wise.</hi>

                  <p>Q <hi>Wherein appeareth the Wisedome of God?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In two things principally. First, In framing the world so wisely; that men and Angels may wonder at it: If the <hi>Sunne</hi> had been set lower, it would haue burnt vs; if higher, the beames of it with such comfort would not haue reached vnto vs. If all had bin <hi>Summer,</hi> hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, In ordering the things of this world with such most excellent wisedome surpassing all admiration. For some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things wee may buy, as Meate, Drinke, and cloathes; And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things againe wee cannot buy, when wee haue meate, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not buy a good stomacke to our meate; When wee haue Corne, wee cannot buy seasonable weather to soweour corne, most wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God hath layd vp some part of euery blessing with himselfe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18128:13"/>
and retained it, as it were in his owne hand, that men might bee <hi rend="margQuotes">driuen thereby more often to resort vnto him. For if men might haue all things here below; They would neuer goe so farre as Heauen to fetch any thing thence.</hi>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What vse may wee make of this Property?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To rest contented with that portion, that God giues vs, with that weather, which God sends vs, with those losses, and troubles, that God brings vpon vs. God is wiser then the wisest of vs, and therefore knowes alwayes what is fittest for vs, And therefore to thinke, when God sends vs sicknesse, that health were better; when God takes away our children, it were better to haue them still; It is the folly of our hearts to make our selues wiser then God.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the third Propertie of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Hee is most <hi>Iust.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Wherein appeareth the Iustice of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In blessing the godly, and punishing the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How stands it then with Iustice, that the godly are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in worst state?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Very well, for though they haue but little, yet they haue more contentment, and more ioy in that little, then the wicked haue in all their plenty, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 16.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though they haue but little, yet God giues them a true, and an holy vse of it: they spend, and vse that little well, <hi>Esay</hi> 23. 18.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that little they haue is a pledge and a pawne, that God hath greater things reserued for them: As a man is put in possession of the whole field by receiuing a little Tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, that they want outwardly, they haue inwardly, <hi>Psalme</hi> 45. 13. Though they be not rich in the purse, yet they are rich in Faith, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 5. Though they haue not gold, yet they haue that which is better then gold, <hi>Iob 28. 15. 16. 1. Pet.</hi> 1. 7.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What vse may wee make of this Propertie?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That seeing all our sinnes were punished in Christ, they cannot in iustice be punished in our selues againe eternally, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18128:13"/>
therefore all they stand fully discharged before the Iudgement seate of God, who by a true &amp; a liuely faith haue receiued Christ. For as when the Surety hath answered the debt, it cannot in any right be demanded of the debtor againe: So seeing Christ hath discharged for our sinnes, we ought not in any equitie to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with them, <hi>Esay</hi> 53. 5.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why then are the godly punished when they sinne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They are punished not in Iudgement, but in Mercie to weaken the strength of sinne, and to keepe vnder the rebellion of their nature, which still dwelleth in them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 71.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What may wee further learne from this Propertie?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That God will right wrongs of his children, 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 6. 7. And that the wicked haue good cause to hang downe their heads, knowing that God in Iustice for euery sinne will be auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of them; they must pay full sweetly for euery oath they sweare, for euery lie they tell, for euery <hi>Sabboth</hi> they mispend, and therefore with trembling hearts they may looke euery houre when the fire will fall from Heauen, that shall burne them, when the great Iudge shall appeare in the cloudes, who will condemne them, <hi>Prou.</hi> 11. 21.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>What is the fourth Propertie of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Hee is most <hi>Mercifull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Wherein appeareth the mercie of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First in making vs <hi>Men,</hi> when hee might haue made vs Beasts; In making vs <hi>wise,</hi> when hee might haue made vs starke fooles; In giuing vs <hi>limbes,</hi> when he might haue made vs lame; In giuing vs <hi>sight,</hi> when he might haue made vs blinde?</p>
                  <p>Scondly, in prouiding things needfull for vs. When wee are sicke, herbes to heale vs: when wee are cold, fire to warme vs: when wee are hungry, meate to feede vs: when wee are naked, wooll to cloathe vs. And the more to commend his Mercies, hee prouides vs of all thesethings, when wee are his greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. No man will doe so much for his friend, as God doth for his foes. Wee came into the world with neuer a penny in our Purse, with neuer a sheare in our Barnes, with neuer a sheepe in our folds, with neuer a Coate on our backe, and yet the Lord hath filled our liues with great abundance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in sparing of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and that diuersly. First, in

hiding many of our sinnes from the eyes of the world: For if the world knew as much by vs as God knowes, the best man that liues would blush to shew his face.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in giuing vs a time to repent; for if God should damne euery sinner so soone as hee sinnes against him, wofull were our case, for none would be saued: it is Gods mercy, that wee liue and breathe vpon the <hi>Earth,</hi> being guiltie of so many rebellious mutinies, and treasons against our heauenly King, as <hi>Ieremtah</hi> saith, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in vsing all meanes to draw vs to repentance like one that would gladly vndoe a doore; he tries key after key, till he hath tryed euery key in his bunch. So God hath tryed by Mercy, and tryed by Iudgement; he hath tryed by pouertie, and tryed by plenty, because he would gladly by some meanes bring vs to him, <hi>Esay</hi> 5. 4. As when a great fish is caught vpon the hooke, the fish pulls and the man pulls, and the fish pulls againe. So God and the sinfull soule lie wresting together, the soule drawes <hi>to Hell,</hi> and God pulls to <hi>Heauen,</hi> so f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, that men haue good cause to loue God, seeing hee doth more for them then the deerest friend in the world will do; If we should iniure your friend but halfe so much, as we iniure God, he would sooue cast vs off, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they doe the Lord of Heauen great wrong who pray to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> or to any of the <hi>Saints,</hi> as if they were more fauourably inclined to <hi>Mercie</hi> then the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 15.</p>

God is an eye-witnesse of all we doe, or say, and therefore wee ought to walke with as great shamefacednesse, and bashful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before him, as before the greatest Prince or power in the world, <hi>Prou.</hi> 15. 11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, not to be dismayed in any trouble, because God is euer at hand to take our part; As a childe will not care for the seruants, so long as hee is in his fathers presence, <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. 4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that the diuine Nature ought rather with reuerence to be adored, then curiously to be searched, for seeing God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in all his nature; so mightie that none can conceiue how mightie he is, so wise that all the wits in the world cannot tell how wise he is; Wee are no moreable to comprehend his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Nature, then wee are to graspe the Mountaines in our armes, or to span the broadest of the Sea with our fingers, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Very needfull, for the Turkes and the Iewes confesse one God, but because they denie the distinction of the Persons, they neither acknowledge the Sonne of God their Redeemer, nor the holy Ghost their Sanctifier.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Maiestie of God is vnsearchable, and cannot be apprehended, but as it commeth forth, and reueales it selfe in the Person of the Sonne, and therefore they that know not the Sonne of God, they in very deed know not God, <hi>Iohn. 1. 18. 1. Ioh.</hi> 2. 23.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> All in the New Testament, and so many in the Old as were written by <hi>Moses,</hi> or any of the Prophets, so that all are Canonicall from <hi>Genesis</hi> to <hi>Malachy</hi> who was the last Prophet.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Why are they called Canonicall?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because they are the rule to direct our faith, and our life; for <hi>Canon</hi> in Greek signifieth <hi>a Rule,</hi> or a square, which a Mason, or a Carpenter vseth for his direction in his worke; So that as they worke all by Rule and line; so wee must square out both our Faith and our life by these holy Bookes.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What Books are Apocryphall?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> All in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> that were written after the time of the Prophets, as the first of <hi>Esdras,</hi> and the second of <hi>Tobith, Iudeth, Wisedome, Ecclesiasticus,</hi> or <hi>Iesus Sirach,</hi> certaine peeces of <hi>Esther,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> with <hi>the Prayer of Manasses,</hi> the 1. <hi>of Maccabeus, and the second.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because they were not written by <hi>Moses,</hi> or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who were the penne-men of the Holy Ghost, but by other godly men, who hauing not so great a measure of the Spirit, could not write all things so heauenly, and so purely as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. Why are they called Apocryphall?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because they come not forth with publike authoritie from God, but crept in closely, and by stelth into the Church: for <hi>Apocryphall</hi> in Greeke signifieth a thing lurking in a hole or a corner, to shew that these Bookes are not nobly borne; And therefore howsoeuer they may be profitable, yet they ought not to speake with equall authoritie in the congregation of the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 2.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Had wee not need of good warrant to strike off so many Bookes from the Canon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> So wee haue Christ himselfe, who interpreting all the Scriptures, interpreted no more but <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets. And therefore seeing these Bookes of <hi>Tobith, Iudeth</hi> and the rest, belong neither to <hi>Moses,</hi> nor the Prophets, as being written af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their time. It is manifest that our Sauiour Christ, hath shut them out from the Canon of the Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 27.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> There are three things required of him that will be saued. First, he must know and bee perswaded of his owne miserable <note place="margin">Saluation.</note> estate, by nature, and be humbled for it.</p>

                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Historicall faith, is that, whereby a man beleeues in generall, there is a God, and that there is saluation in Christ, but for his life, hee cannot apply any of these things particularly to any comfort of himselfe, this faith may be in the Reprobates and in the diuels, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 19.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Iustifying faith is that whereby a man beleeues, not onely that there is a God; but, in particular, that hee is his God.

So it is not enough to say, that Christ dyed for sinne, vnlesse thou be able to shew thy Euidence, euen speciall faith, that Christ dyed for thy sinne.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> First a man must labour to know his owne heart, to grow acquainted with his owne soule, to see the speciall ruines and breaches that be in it: For though we haue somespice, and some grudging of euery sinne: yet euery man hath some one speciall sinne or more, that hurts and pesters him aboue the rest.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Because the deuill will labour mightily to hide it from vs. Therefore some diligence must bee vsed to discouer it. First, a man must marke the course of his life, and see what sinnes he is most tempted with, which sinnes he is least able to resist, what of all other he can hardliest forgoe, and that be it one, or more are master sinnes in him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee must marke, what sinnes raigne most in the place and in the countrey where he dwells; what sinnes are the chiefe in his kindred, and in those that companie with him. For hardly can a man dwell in <hi>Sodome,</hi> but hee shall carry some smatch of the sinne of <hi>Sodome, Gen.</hi> 19. 33.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee must marke the iudgements of God, that fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, for God hath engrauen vpon euery iudgement, the name of the sinne for which hee sends it: So that a man in his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may plainely reade his sinne.

let vs thinke we haue sinned in our children, and so in our wiues in our friends, and the rest.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, lastly if these meanes will not worke; it is good to consult with some wise and some deare friend of our state, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate him in the loue of God, and our selues, that he will tell vs in truth, what sinnes hee sees vs most prone, and inclined vnto.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> If these things worke not vpon vs, wee must consider what is thereason, why they doe not worke; either wee doe not vse them so diligently, and so carefully as wee should, or else we haue vsed them but a little while: A man cannot fell a great Oake with one stroke of an Axe, it will aske him many a blowe: So our sinnes being of so great a growth, will not quickly down. It is well if after many labours, and much paines, wee may feele them begin, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. or else the heart may not yet be loosened from some darling eorruption, vntill which time all meanes are vneffectuall, <hi>Psal.</hi>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What gather wee of this?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That they who vse these meanes for a spirt, and practise them not continually and wholly, shall neuer get any sound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or profite by them.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the second thing a man must doe in the reforming of his heart?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> When a man hath weeded out his sinnes, hee must not then giue ouer, but fall to worke a fresh, and labour to plant somewhat in the garden of his soule: as one vice goes out, so he must labour to plant an other vertue in the roome, <hi>Hos.</hi> 10. 12.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What gather wee of this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. That a man must not thinke his conuersion to bee true, vnlesse he bee carried with as great loue to godlinesse, as euer hee was to wickednesse, and be as carefull for good things, as euer he was for euill. And therefore they that are come from Poperie, and stick there, hauing got no iudgement, nor knowledge in the Gospell, doe but deceiue themselues: As they also, who will not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18128:25"/>
openly breake the Sabboth, and yet are not carefull to sanctifie it in the holy duties thereof, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 27.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>What are the things wee must first plant in the heart?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> A loue of God, to delight in him, as in the greatest por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we haue in this world, to rest in him with ioy and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">Loue of God.</note> as in our chiefest good: to set more price on him, then we doe on all the world besides. And therefore hauing such a Iewel, and such a wonderfull treasure of the Lord, wee account all our wants to be nothing, so long as wee want not him: All our los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses nothing, so long as we lose not him: All displeasures light, so long as God is not displeased with vs, <hi>Math.</hi> 21. 38.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why must we begin at the loue of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because the loue of God is the fountaine of all true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and it sendeth forth the carefull Christian to good workes: For louing God, hee will seeke to doe that which God may like of, and will willingly doe nothing that may displease him: Euen as if a man haue a deere friend, hee will not willingly doe any thing that may offend him: but will seeke by all duties to make his loue and his good heart knowne vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How may wee bring our hearts in loue with God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> By considering what God hath beene to vs, and what we haue beene to him: Wee, the worst of all his creatures, worse then Toades or Snakes, for they sinne not against God, but wee sinne against him: Worse then the Iewes, for they crucified Christ but once, but wee buffet him, and pierce him with our sinnes euery day, worse then any of the damned Ghosts, that lie damned in hell, for they sinned in darknesse, but wee sinne in the light, they hauing but weake meanes, wee hauing many great helpes to weaken sinne, and yet (mirrour of mercy) none so spared, as we are spared; none so blessed, as we are blessed; none so loued, as we are loued of the Lord. And therefore how can wee, but euen burne in loue towards him againe, and make more reckoning of him, then of all the world besides, <hi>Solomons song.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the second thing?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> The feare of God, to bee more affraid to displease him, <note place="margin">Feare of God.</note> then all the Princes and powers in the world. To be more aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and more ashamed, when God sees vs sinne, then if all the

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The feare of God will be as a banke, to keepe in the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging lusts of the heart, that they breake not out; Euen as the Sea banke beates backe the waues, and breakes the force of them, that they cannot ouerflow, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 40.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How may wee settle the feare of God in our hearts?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, by considering the great power, and the mighty arme of God, that he is more able to doe vs more harme, then all the powers in the world can doe. And therefore if wee feare to displease a Prince who can kill but our bodies; how much more should we feare to displease God, who can damne our soules, <hi>Isay</hi> 51. 12. 13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by perswading our selues, that wee are alwayes in Gods presence, that he euer lookes vpon vs with a bright and a shining face; So that we doe nothing but what God sees vs doe; wee speake nothing, but what he heares vs speake. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a mans presence would bash vs, how much more should the holy presence of God strike feare, and reuerence into our hearts.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> First, to consider that God loues vs dearely: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he will neuer command any thing at our hands, but it shall be for our good, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 39.</p>

                  <p>Fiftly, to consider, that the Lord will not blesse vs in his owne wayes, what vnlikelihood soeuer there be, that it shall not speed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 3.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, lastly to consider, that our obedience to God, is the placing of him in his seate of glorie, and as it were, the crowning of him to bee our King: So that to disobey him, is to disclaime, and renounce his dominion ouer vs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 17.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because a man is giuen naturally to loue himselfe, and to seeke his owne good. And therefore if wee cannot hold within compasse of dutie towards our selues, much lesse shall we be able towards others.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> To liue soberly, and temperately in this present world.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is this sobrietie which the Apostle speakes of?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> A moderate, and sparing vse of our lawfull liberties; which moderation must be kept in all the actions that concerne <note place="margin">Sobrietie.</note> our selues; in our diet, in our recreations, in our mirth, in our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and so in the rest.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How shall wee keepe this godly moderation in our Dyet?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A</hi> If two things be cared for: First, that it bee not too costly, too sumptuous: no though our purse will beare it, and our abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">In Dyet.</note> reach vnto it. The Glutton, which wee reade of in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, was able enough to maintaine his cheare, for hee dyed rich. And yet for his feasting on earth, hee was saine to fast in hell: And the Deuills made as merry with his soule, as euer hee made merry with his meat, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 19.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Is it not lawfull to feast our Neighbours?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, it is lawfull to make Feasts of loue, as the old Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians did in <hi>Iude 12. verse.</hi> But neither must this bee common, nor vsuall euery day, nor to fare more then for honest and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber delight. <hi>Not common, Isay 56. 12. Not excessiue, Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> 5. 18.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the second thing?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must looke, that we vse not those meates and drinks, which we haue (how homely, and how meane soeuer they bee) intemperately, that we doe not surfet, nor feed cormorantly, to the glutting, and whole satisfying of the flesh: washing our
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18128:27"/>
braines with drinke, and basting our bodyes with meate, more then needs, <hi>Ezek. 16. 19. Fulnesse of bread,</hi> was one of the sinnes of <hi>Sodome, Isay</hi> 5. 22.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How shall wee be sober and moderate in our Apparell?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If it be not too garish, too light, too costly, or strange, <note place="margin">In Apparell.</note> but graue, vsuall, beseeming our Calling and our Countrey, strange Attyre is condemned, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18. light and <hi>wanton Attyre 1: Tim.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Doe the Scriptures giue any certaine directions for At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There are two Rules to be kept in our Attyre. First, that wee doe not stretch forth our selues vnto all that wee may, and goe as farre as our place and abilitie will let vs, but cut short off some part of that which is lawfull, for men of our degree, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that we square our selues to the most sober of our age, degree, condition, and state of life, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. Also we haue an example in the 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 18. where the holy Ghost cleareth King <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he gaue no occasion to the euill which came vpon his daughter, because in apparell hee kept her within the rule appointed, and let her goe no otherwise, then other maydes of her age, place, and condition went.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Is nothing but apparell to be cared for?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, regard must be had of our gate, of our hayre, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer we are set out, and attyred with. In this also an honest, and godly moderation must be vsed, That our gate be not state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and proud: That our hayre be not vndecently long: That no more ornaments be hanged vpon vs, then seemelinesse, and that Christian sobrietie, which hath beene spoken of, will permit. <hi>Of the gate, Isay 3. 16. Of the rest, 1. Pet.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Is it not lawfull for men to haue long hayre?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Apostle saith 1. <hi>Corinth. 12. 14. It is a shame for a man if hee weare long haire.</hi> And therefore vnlesse it be not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for men to shame themselues, it is not lawfull for men to haue long hayre: And he giue vs such a reason, as being well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may mooue them much; <hi>Doth not nature it selfe teach you, saith hee;</hi> As if he had said, Though men haue neither religion nor honesty, nor grace, nor any conscience in them: yet nature
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18128:28"/>
it selfe may teach them, that when they glorie in their long locks, they glory in their shame.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How may wee vse our recreations moderately and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If wee be not excessiue in them, if wee spend not too much time vpon them, but vse them so sparingly, that thereby we may become the more fit, and cheerefull in our calling, <hi>Colos.</hi> 4. 5. and redeeme the time which we doe not, when our exercises doe not make vs more fit for our duties.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if we be not eagerly set vpon them, that we fall to swearing, chafing, fretting, quarrelling, or hurting our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours corne, grasse, cattell, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if we vse them at lawfull and conuenient times, not when we haue fitnesse to better things, nor vpon the Sabboth, nor in time of priuate, or publike mourning, <hi>Ecles.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why may wee not vse them, when wee are fit for better things?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must not rashly be angry with them, for loue suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">In our Assecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> long, it will put vp many iniuries, and passe by many wrongs, and therefore they that fall out, and suffer their loue to quench for euery offence, declare euidently they haue no loue, See <hi>Solomons Song</hi> 8. 7.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>May wee not be angry?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes: but therein three things must be looked vnto. First, <note place="margin">Anger.</note> that the cause be iust and earnest, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 22.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, that it hold not long, for both should seeke Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation: As the father ranne to meet his sonne and the sonne his father.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must not enuy their good: It must not grieue vs to see others wealthier, wiser, and better thought of then ourselues: Wee must be as glad of their welfare, as of our owne, and reioyce as much to heare them praised, as we would doe if our selues were commended, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 15.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must not take that which may be well meant in euill part: wee must not be too iealous, and too suspicious of our brethren, vpon euery conceite, thinking hardly of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 29.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the fourth point of Inward loue?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must not disdaine them, nor set vp our selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: For though in some one gift, they came behinde vs, yet happily in some other they goe before vs; and though they doe not, yet happily, they haue not had such helpes, such meanes, so many sweet motions to bring them on as we haue had, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 3.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must not speake bitterly, scoffingly, nor crossely to <note place="margin">In Words.</note> them: if we be wronged, yet we must deale coldly, gently, and mildely with them, <hi>not bitterly, Iames 4. 11. not scoffingly, Gen. 21. 9. 10. not crossely, Pro.</hi> 15. 1.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, but in Gods cause, rather then in our owne, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in both, till wee see gentle meanes will not worke: as a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian vseth strong Medicines, when the weaker will not helpe, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 25.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee must not speake euill of them behinde their backs, but by loue conceale those infirmities that are in them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse either Gods glorie, or their good shall require an opening of their faults, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 8. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 11.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee must not brawle, and wrangle contentiously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout questions that shall arise amongst vs, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. 16.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must not withdraw our selues from them in their <note place="margin">In our Deeds.</note> needes, but to our power and abilitie, seeke to make their liues sweet and comfortable to them; We must not be altogether our owne men, shut vp within our owne profite, and pleasures, and wholly taken vp of them: But by loue wee must goe out of our selues to the good and profite of our Brethren, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 7. to the 11.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That they who are so farre off from helping their needy brethren; that they make euen a spoyle, and a prey of them, most vnchristianly encreasing their miseries, and by vsury and hard bargaines, putting of them further into debt and danger, they haue no drop of humanitie, much lesse any sound ground of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie in them, <hi>Leu.</hi> 35. 36.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What other thing is there wherein we must shew our loue?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must not doe any violence to their person, wee must neither smite them, nor hurt them in life or limbe, as appeareth, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 24. 19. 20. For though the Ceremony of that Law be now abrogated, yet the equitie of it stands still in strength.</p>

                  <p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> No, the chiefest thing is yet behinde, loue to their soules, which is the very life of Christian loue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 1.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must mourne and be sorry for their sinnes, as Christ <note place="margin">Soules.</note> wept ouer <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> so we must weepe ouer the soules of our brethren, <hi>Ier.</hi> 13. 17.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must pray for them, that the Lord would forgiue them, and fill their hearts with the riches of his grace, <hi>Iames</hi> 15. 16.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, it condemneth those that vse false Measures and false weights, or if they be true, yet they can so cunningly conuey the matter, and helpe it with a sleight, that the Buyer is sure to come short of his due, <hi>Deut. 25. 15. to the</hi> 16.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> We must not take Interest, or Vsurie of our Neighbours, for all vsurie is biting vsurie, howsoeuer some can licke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues <note place="margin">Vsurie.</note> whole againe, yet the greatest part carry the print of the Vsurers teeth to their dying day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 25.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Vsurie is a certaine gaine exacted by Couenant aboue the Principall, onely in lieu and recompence of the lending of it: and it is cleerely condemned by the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 19.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>Doth not the Princes law allow Usurie 10. pounds in the 100. pounds?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Princes Law restraineth Vsury, but allowes it not; The Prince had rather men would lend freely to their brethren, but if they will not for the hardnesse of mens hearts he permits 8. in the 100. lest they should take 20. in the 100.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>Why is not Usury condemned in the New Testament?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because it is sufficiently condemned in the Old: For the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18128:32"/>
Morall law alwayes standeth in strength and is neuer repealed: And therefore Vsury being a branch of the morall Law, in as much as it concernes loue, and good dealing too with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, is as strictly forbidden in the New Testament, as it was in the Old, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 17.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must not filch or pilfer the least pinne or point from our Neighbour: for it is not the value, but the dishonest manner of comming by a thing that makes it theft, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 28,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Couetousnesse and greedy desire of gaine, for why doe men racke the prises of their Wares? Why doe they scant their measures? Why doe they sell they care not what? Why are they Vsurers, oppressours, pilferers, and the like? But because their hearts runne after couetousnesse, and they are mightily ouertaken with greedinesse of gaine, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>What are the causes of Couetousnesse?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There are two causes of it. First, discontentment with <note place="margin">Couetousnesse.</note> our present state, not resting in it, as in our portion with great thankfulnesse of heart to God for it. For when we are once falne into loue with a better state, and grow discontented with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent blessings of God that are vpon vs: then we fall to scraping, and fetching in we care not how, 1. <hi>Tim</hi> 6, 9.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Infidelitie and distrust in God, mistrusting the Lords care, that hee will leaue vs in the dust, and not prouide sufficiently for vs; wee thinke to make shift for our selues, and to be furnished for a rainie day, though the Lord should leaue vs. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What are the remedies of it?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The remedies are two: First to rest contented with our present estate, as in the portion which the Lord in wisedome knowes to be fitrest for vs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to haue hearts strongly perswaded, that the Lord will not leaue vs nor forsake vs in our need, but gratiously will supply vs with the riches of his power, whatsoeuer is wanting in vs, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What is the last thing wherein we must loue our brethren?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must loue them in their names, taking care for their

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Whensoeuer occasion serues, we must be willing to make report of those graces and good things that be in them, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow their iust and deserued commendations on them: We must not be giuen to smother and conceale our brethrens praise, to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and rake vp their commendations in the dust, but be forward in remembring those things, whereby credite and estimation may grow vnto them, 3. <hi>Iohn 12. verse.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must not raise vp any slander or lying tale against them. It is a foule sinne to gadde vp and downe from house to house, whispering in this bodyes eare, and that bodyes eare; this tale and that tale to the discrediting of our brethren, <hi>Leu.</hi> 19. 17.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must not open our eares to giue entertainment to them that carry tales.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, to consider, that it is our owne sinne that hath pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led these iudgements on vs, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 9. <note place="margin">Affliction.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, to consider, that it is the Lord that afflicteth vs, who hauing absolute power ouer vs, may dispose of vs either by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie or plentie, by sicknesse or health, by life or death, as best pleaseth him, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to consider, that they shall turne to their greatest comfort in the end. So that God may seeme to afflict his children, onely to sweeten and relish their prosperitie, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 12.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to consider, that though the Lord haue depriued vs of one blessing, yet he hath left vs many others to reioyce in: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as if a man hauing forfeited an hundred pounds, and the Creditour should take but 100. shillings of him: So when we by sinne haue forfeited all our blessings, and all the comforts of our life: yet the Lord straineth but some one part and portion of them, <hi>Lamen.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, to consider, that impatiencie doth but increase our crosse; like one in Irons, that strugling and striuing to wring them off, hurts himselfe more then the Irons doe, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 19.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the fourth point of godlinesse?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must be diligent in commending our whole estate <note place="margin">Fourthly Prayer.</note> by earnest prayer vnto God; For therein we doe the Lord this honour, that we acknowledge our whole welfare to depend on him, and it is he alone that blesseth all things that wee take in hand: And therefore we must neuer begin any thing without prayer: Wee must not eate vnlesse wee first pray God to blesse that we eate: Wee must not giue, vnlesse wee pray God to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18128:34"/>
blesse that wee giue, 1. <hi>Thessalonians</hi> 5. 17.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the Reason?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There is a double vse of the good things of God, <list>
                        <item>A lawfull vse, &amp;</item>
                        <item>An holy vse.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What be they?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As when a man eateth, or refresheth himselfe, or sleepeth moderately; when he vttereth his Comodities at a reasonable rate, then he doth these things lawfully: But when he sanctifieth and performeth all these things with holy prayer vnto God: Then, he vseth them not onely lawfully but holily too. So that by this meanes our thoughts are holy, and our workes holy, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations holy, yea and our sleepe is holy to the Lord, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What thinke you then of giuing thankes before meate?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is a holy vse sanctified by the example of Christ and much commended by the Scriptures; our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> looked to heauen and blessed the loaues and fishes, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 19. So did <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 27. 35. And wee reade of the people in the 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 13. That they would not eate of the Sacrifice till <hi>Samuel</hi> had blessed it. And therefore their boldnesse is great, that dare vse the creatures of God with greater boldnesse then <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Samuel,</hi> yea and the Sonne of God himselfe would vse them.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Is it not good to haue certaine sette times of Prayer in our houses?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is very needfull, the rather thereby to draw our selues into Gods presence, and to bring our selues in remembrance of this great dutie, that lyes vpon vs, as <hi>Daniel</hi> 6. 10.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the fittest times to set apart for Prayer?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Morning and the Euening. In the morning we must pray that the Lord will leade vs throughout the day: That hee will shrowd vs and shadow vs vnder the wings of his grace, and be with vs in euery thing we take in hand. And this may be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the morning Sacrifice of a Christian, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 3. At night againe we must reckon with the Lord for the sinnes of the day, that we lye not downe in Gods displeasure: but hauing reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and as it were made euen for our faults, wee may sleepe in the lappe and bosome of the loue of God. And this may be termed, The euening Sacrifice of a Christian, <hi>Psal.</hi> 141. 2.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How is this further declared?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:18128:35"/>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As <hi>Noahs</hi> Doue, hauing wandred all day abroad, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, in the Euening to the Arke: So we hauing toyled, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured all day in the world; yet at night we must bee carefull to returne, and take vp our rest (as it were) with God.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Are wee to rest our selues in this thing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must not thinke our selues discharged, when these sett times of prayer be performed: but many times in the day, we must lift vp our hearts to God in the heate of all our businesse: bethinke vs of the Lord, who alone can prosper and blesse that which we haue in hand.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the fift Point of godlinesse?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must lift vp our hearts with great thankfulnesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for all his blessings and benefites that are vpon vs. For <note place="margin">Fiftly Thankes-giuing.</note> therefore <hi>Moses</hi> declareth in the first of <hi>Genesis,</hi> how God made the Heauen and the Earth, the Sunne and the Moone, and all things here below; To shew that if we haue any comfort in any thing in this world, God the Creatour is to be blessed, and than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for it, 1. <hi>Thess</hi> 5. 18.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Is it enough to thanke God for his mercies?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Surely no; but as we are thankfull for his blessings, so we must be thankfull for his iudgements too, and therefore we must blesse God, as well for our pouerty as we doe for our plenty; as well for our weakenesse, as we doe for our strength: as well when we lose our comforts, as when we haue them, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 21.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the Reason that so few are thankefull for their troubles?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because men are not able to looke through the present euills that are vpon them, into the speciall fauour and loue of God, who by this meanes compasseth and procureth their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good. And therefore men thinke it an vnreasonable thing, that they should thanke God for the losse of their wealth, of their peace, of their libertie, and the like, because they see not into that good, which the Lord by this meanes will bring vpon them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 4.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How may we prouoke our selues to thankefulnesse?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, if we keepe a faithfull Register of the blessings of God, and engraue them (as it were) vpon the gates of the soule, that wee may behold in one sight, and in one view, all the rich
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18128:35"/>
blessings of God, that are vpon vs, <hi>Psalme</hi> 103, 1. 2. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if we consider how vnworthy we are of the least of those blessings which we inioy: For we are not worthy the earth should beare vs; the heauens should couer vs: the Sunne should shine vpon vs. And therefore it is the Lords exceeding fauour that we are blessed in any measure, and regarded of him, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if we consider our preferment in many of our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings aboue other men, and how they are thankfuller for halfe our happinesse, then we are for the whole, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if wee consider how the number of Gods blessings groweth daily towards vs. So that if wee had cause to thanke God yesterday; we haue greater cause to thanke him to day. And if we haue cause to thanke him this yeare, wee shall haue greater to thanke him the next yeare; the Lords mercy still more and more increasing on vs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 11.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the last Point of Godlinesse?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

Euen so, though a man be neuer so sicke and diseased in his soule: yet so long as he hath care to sanctifie the Sabboth, to partake in the holy Prayers, and the Ministry of the Church, there is some hope that in time these good things may worke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: But if he will not come to ioyne in these exercises of the Church: if he haue no care to heare, to pray, to meditate and the like; then his state is wofull, we haue little hope of amendment, <hi>Isay</hi> 38. 13. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. How must wee sanctifie the Sabboth?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, in setting our selues apart from our worldly businesses, that we may with greater libertie, bestow our selues in the seruice of God: And therefore it is not lawfull to iourney about our worldly matters vpon the Sabboth day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 29.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is not lawfull to keepe Fayres or Markets

on the Sabboth, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 13. 16. 17.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is not lawfull to sowe or reape, or to load our cart, or to weed in our corne on the Sabboth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 21.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is not lawfull to buy or sell bargaines vpon the Sabboth, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 10. 31.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, it condemneth those, that take vp that day for their worldly affaires, and many times cast the greatest burthen of their businesse vpon the Sabboth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it condemneth those, who though they rest from their labours outwardly; yet notwithstanding they haue their heads and their hearts so fraught with worldly matters, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they doe not performe the tenth of the Sabboth, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Are all workes forbidden on the Sabboth?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Not all, but such onely as be lets and hinderances to the Sabboth. And therefore we learne <hi>Math.</hi> 12. That three sorts of workes are lawfull on the Sabboth.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What are they?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, workes of necessitie, as if our enemies inuade vs, it is lawfull to repulse them. If our house be on fire, it is lawfull to quenchit. If a gappe be made into our corne or pasture, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to mend it, <hi>Math,</hi> 12. 3. 4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, workes of holinesse, such as lend their helpes to the Sabboth: As a man may goe forth on the Sabboth day to preach, by the example of Christ, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 9. or to heare a Sermon by the example of the Noble women in the 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 23.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Workes of mercie, as a man may dresse his meate, and pull his beast out of the pit, and minister vnto a sicke body vpon the Sabboth day, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 11. 12,</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> In practising the holy Exercises of the Sabboth; And therefore they that rest from their labours, and yet are not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to sanctifie the Sabboth in the holy duties thereof, doe not indeed truely keepe a Sabboth to the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 2. 3.</p>

If euery one of vs had but one coate, or but one sticke vpon his fire, it would cast but a little heate: but if all wee should bring our fewell together, and lay it on one hearth, it would make a mightie blaze: So while euery man catcheth but a little at a Sermon, that little doth him but a little good: but if euery man would bring his little, then we might make (as it were) one common stocke, we should be better able to set vp and goe through with Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, then we doe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Not to burthen vs, and tyre vs out with the number of them, but to make the Sabboth more easie for vs; for how te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious would it be if we should doe nothing else but pray, or nothing else but reade: But now the Lord hath appointed vs varietie and change of duties, that being weary in one, wee might recreate and refresh our selues in another.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the reason hereof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because on the Sabboth day, we are to make our prouision, and to store our selues for all the weeke, so that all the rest of the daies may feele the benefite and comfort of this one day, and therefore men must not thinke it is some few houres, a little in the morning, and a little in the afternoone, that will store vs with all that faith, loue, patence, humilitie, that is needfull for vs: The greatest part being scant able to get vp in many daies so much as will serue them for one.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What gather wee of this?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That they who thinke it enough to spend an houre in the forenoone, and an houre in the afternoone at Church, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the rest of the day, know not what it is to sanctifie a Sabboth to the benefite of their soules.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>If the whole day must be holy to the Lord? why then doe wee eate and drinke, and sleepe on the Sabboth day?</hi>

Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they lend their helpes to the sanctifying of the Sabboth: For by sleeping in the night, and eating in the day moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, men are the better enabled to goe through with the duties of the Sabbeth, not being able to hold out in them, if these

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That the night before, might be (as it were) a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Sabboth, both to put them in minde what they are to looke for the next day, and also by priuate prayer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating that they heard the weeke before, to make them the readier and the fitter for it.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> No: For the Christian Churches obserued it as well as the Iewes, and therefore <hi>St. Augustine in his 251.

                  <p>A. Besides these generall Duties, there are many particular duties required of vs. He that is a Father, must thinke that hee stands charged with the duties of a Father.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is layd down in the 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 7. in three points, first, he must dwell with his wife: That is, he must liue in a sweet, and louely communion with her: Hee must not absent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

more then needs: Nor make himselfe strange to her, when he is at home.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Whom doth this Doctrine meet withall?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It condemneth those, that vpon euery light occasion will be shifting from their wiues; For howsoeuer shee sure not with thee, yet thou must remember, that she is the companion of thy life, whom God and thy owne choice hath ioyned to thee, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 16.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it condemneth those, who not settling their hearts at home, loue to be rouing, and ranging much abroad; for the Lord would not haue the least occasion of suspition to bee left to the iealous wife, and therefore hath tyed the husband the more strictly to delight himselfe at home, <hi>Prou.</hi> 5. 18. 19.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, he must dwell with her according to knowledge, knowing that God hath made the man the head of the woman, and therefore he must not lose the honour of his place; but by wisedome, grauitie, and all good aduise, seeke to direct her in an honest course, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 25. 26. The husband is charged to loue his wife as Christ loued his Church: But Christ so loueth his Church, that he sanctifieth it, and makes it an holy Church; and therefore the husband must so loue his wife, that hee suffer her not to lye in her sinnes, but by all good meanes seeke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime her, and to bring her from them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, knowing that a woman is the weaker vessell, and therefore it is an vnreasonable thing to looke for all that faith, patience, humilitie, discreet and wise carriage, that they finde in men.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What gather wee of this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That the wife must be supported, and borne withall in her rashnesse, heate, want of discretion, and the like infirmities haunting and waiting vpon the Sexe: And therefore euery aduantage must not be taken against her, but wee must breake through many discour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>esies, and many wrongs to hold loue and friendship with her.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He must giue honour vnto her, as vnto the weaker vessell.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Hee must haue her in good reckoning and in good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, not dispising her for the infirmities of her Sexe, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting well of her for the graces whatsoeuer that are in her, esteeming her as a vessell, as one needfull and necessarie in the house.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he must prouide for her the best he can, hee must not set ouer her the whole care of his prouision; but as shee is the weaker vessell, so he must thinke in the maintainance of the Familie to be assisted more weakely by her.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the Wiues dutie to her husband?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Shee must bee subiect to her husband, humbling her selfe to the yoake of gouernment, which God hath layd vpon her. For God hath made the man the head of the woman, and therefore this must abate all pride and selfe-loue, and worke true honour in her heart towards him whom God hath made the chiefe in the house, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That the husband is Gods deputie, and Gods Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the house, as Christ is in the Church, and therefore to despise the husband is to despise God; to disobey the husband in lawfull things, is to disobey God, because they lift vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against the power, which God hath placed in his owne steed and roome, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doth the Scripture beate so much vpon this duty?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because there is a secret swelling in the heart which will hardly brooke the gouernment of the man, especially, if in any good qualities they goe beyond him.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How must this subiection be declared?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Both by reuerend speech, and all humble behauiour to her husband. Some take it to be their grace to speake rudely and bluntly to him. But it was <hi>Sarahs</hi> honour that shee obeyed <hi>Abraham</hi> and called him Lord, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> A man is bound to loue his wife, though there bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in her that deserueth loue; But because a man is not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to this loue, where there is not some cause of loue:

Therefore the Lord would haue the wife by gentle and sweet behauiour, deserue, and win loue at her husbands hands.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A</hi> Shee must be of pure conuersation; no hauocker, no waster of her husbands goods, no inticer of him to dishonest things, like <hi>Iobs</hi> wife, that was <hi>Iobs</hi> tempter, not idle, not slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish, no babler abroad of her husbands faults, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31. 10. 11.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> They must teach them religion, and the feare of God, that their seruants may continue the Lords worship when our selues are in the graue. For why is the <hi>Centurion</hi> said to feare the Lord with all his house, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 2. but to teach vs, that it is not enough to be godly our selues, or to haue one good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant like a <hi>Ioseph</hi> in the house: but it must be our care that all within our gates, and vnder our power and authoritie may feare the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How may masters be stirred vp to some care of this duty?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If they consider, That their owne good, and their owne welfare is procured thereby; for many a master is blessed for his godly seruant, as <hi>Potipher</hi> was for <hi>Ioseph;</hi> and he fares euery day in the weeke the better for him. But where bad seruants be, there falls the curse of God for the seruants sake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 5.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But what if the Master teach, and the Seruants will not learne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If the Master do his faithfull endeauour, his conscience is discharged: Man can but persuade, it is God onely that must change the heart. <hi>Noah</hi> preached to his owne familie, as well as to the old world, 120 yeares, and yet when the godly man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Arke, hee had not one godly seruant after all his paines that would enter with him. So <hi>Lot</hi> was a iust &amp; a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, and that had care of his house; yet when he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of Sodom, he had not one seruant in all his house, that would go out of Sodom with him.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> That as <hi>Dauids</hi> seruants were the better for his seruice, so we should seeke to make our seruants not the worse, but the better for our houses. For what a fearefull saying will it be at the iudgment day, <hi>In such a mans seruice I tooke my bane, I may curse the houre that euer I came into his house, there were my righteousnesse wounded, and all my graces taken from me.</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> They must not ouer-labour their seruants, laying more vpon them than their strength will beare.

                     <hi>A.</hi> They must pay them truly for their pains, for the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is worthie of his hire, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 10.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> That their sinne is great, who send away their seruants emptie after all their toyle. <hi>Laban</hi> is the patterne that such men may be painted by: they can well be content, that their seruants should labour and toyle, and spend out their hearts and strength in their seruice; but care not though they go away without one hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They must chasten them with discretion and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their faults: for the Lord would not haue the seruants life by any hard dealing of ours to be made wearisome and bitter to them. We read of furious <hi>Saul,</hi> That his spirit was mastring at any little word: and of <hi>Nabal,</hi> so fierce that a man could not speake to him. To the like reproch of those that will heare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing when they be in heat, but let euery thing flie that first comes to their hands, <hi>Leu.</hi> 25. 49. How many blessings did <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> lose, onely by entreating a good seruant ill?

                     <hi>A.</hi> If they looke that the cause be iust. Secondly, That the punishment be equall as may be to the offence, keeping vnder it

                     <hi>A.</hi> First, Wee are thereby prouoked to bee like them: As <hi>Saul</hi> a wicked man falling into the company of the Prophets, and seeing how godly they spent their time, was made ashamed of his owne life, and began to prophesie with them, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 24.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because as a man in time of a common plague taketh somewhat in the morning next his heart to keepe out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; So the world being mightily poysoned with sinne, the Christian must lay some good thing next his heart, else euery thing that he deales in will infect him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 148.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must seeke to awake with God, to haue our mindes <note place="margin">Daily Practise how?</note> running on him, as soone as we looke vp; For wee cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake so soone, but with Gods Blessing, and Gods Mercyes be vp afore vs: And therefore let God be in the beginning of our thoughts, and let him haue the first place in the day, <hi>Marke</hi> 1. 35.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That wee haue slept more sweetly vnder the Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, then if we had had Iron walls, and Brazen doores to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend vs: When we were fast asleepe and could not watch our selues; then the Lord watched ouer vs, and he set a guard of Angels to keepe vs. And therefore seeing we haue rested with such safetie vnder Gods defence, let vs thanke him for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and seeke to diue vnder the wing of the Almightie, and

to goe shadowed with the hand of his protection all the day, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 8.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What are wee to consider else?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That we rise the seruants of God, as wee went to bed; and therefore that wee must spend the day in his seruice, not in doing what we list, but in performing those duties that hee requireth. For seeing this is the cause why we were borne, and why God lets vs liue here in this world, that wee may serue him: Wee are to thinke euery morning when we rise, that God lets vs liue one day more, but to haue one dayes seruice more at our hands: and if he let vs liue another day, it is but to haue another dayes seruice at our hands. Therefore, as our seruants get vp to doe our businesse, so must we rise to doe the Lords, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 34.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What are wee to doe then?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Then we are to take a view of our worke, to cast in our heads, what are the dayes wherein we must spend the day; The consideration of our owne state and calling will soone lead vs to this; For many times we are to thinke, I am a Christian, and therefore I must spend this day like a Christian; I am a Father, and therefore I must peforme the duties of a Father: I am a Preacher or a Master or a Seruant, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 28.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What learne wee by this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That it is not possible for those simple soules to liue well, which know not what are the particular duties which their owne place and calling require at their hands. For how can they spend the day Christian-like, that know not what Christianitie meanes? And how can they liue like Fathers, that know not what belongs to the duty of a father? And therefore euery one that will liue well, must haue at his fingers ends the draft of duties mentioned before, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>And may wee then safely enter vpon the day?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No in no wise, till our spirituall furniture be on, and we haue taken vnto vs the whole armour of God, without the which wee enter into the world like a naked man into the field: And therefore when our cloathes goe on, then let vs remember to put on our vertues to, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 13.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Parts are 6.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Sinceritie,</hi> and a faithfull and a true heart to God, <note place="margin">Daily Armour.</note> that we make not shew of more then wee haue, but seeke that our inward care, zeale, loue of God, may be answerable to that which we outwardly professe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> and an vpright and honest minde to our brethren, that whatsoeuer of theirs shall come into our hands, shall passe in peace and safetie as good as it came.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Preparation for afflictions,</hi> to be readie to lay down our liues and all we haue at the feet of Christ, and to vndergoe patiently those troubles which the euill of these euill dayes shall cast vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Faith,</hi> to perswade our selues, that God is at peace with vs in Christ, and therefore that he will blesse vs, and bee with vs in all our paines.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>Knowledge of Gods will,</hi> to direct vs what wee haue to doe, and to beate backe the sundrie temptations that shall se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Sixtly, <hi>Prayer in the spirit,</hi> and feruent and earnest prayer vnto God, that he will be with vs, and leade vs throughout the day, and enable vs by his power to discharge in some measure, the duties that are layd vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Yea, but poore men will say they haue no time no pray?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They might rather say, they haue no will to pray; For they that can finde alwaies time to eate in their greatest busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, would sure finde a time to pray, if they minded God, as they minde their meate. Againe, when they haue most busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it is but rising a quarter of an houre sooner. Little doe they care for Gods blessing, that will not take so little paines to haue it.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How is the Christian to spend the day?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If the day bee a Sabboth day, wee must set our selues wholly apart for the Lord, we must not let any worldly busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <note place="margin">

                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee are to thinke with our selues whether wee are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: we are going into Gods presence; into the presence of that Maiestie that is greater then all the Kings and Princes of the world; and therefore with what feare and reuerence should we come into his sight, at whose feet all the Kings in the world must cast downe their Crownes, and the Angels stand with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered faces, as not being able to behold the excellent glorie that shineth in him, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4. 17.</p>

We must not runne out into the world, and speech of worldly matters, so soone as we be come out of the Church; but then meditate with our selues, or conferre with others of that which we haue heard, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 39.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> That they who are cleane out of heart in their troubles, be they neuer so great, or seeke to winde out of themselues by vnlawfull meanes, they care not how, doe not belieue in God. And therefore so oft as they say the Creed they lye; because they say they Trust in him; when indeed they are not inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswaded that he will helpe them.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>How many kindes of faith bee there?</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Two, <list>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What difference is there betweene these two?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The deuills beleeue that there is a God; that there is a Christ; But they doe not beleeue that they shall fare the better for him. Nay, they know that heshall one day condemne them, and therefore their faith doth not comfort them, but make them the more affraid. But the Christian beleeuing that there is a God, that there is a Christ; beleeueth also that he shall fare the better by them: that God will be his God, and Christ the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, will be a Sauiour as his Sauiour. And therefore this faith is so farre from affrighting him, that it comforts him excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doe wee say, I beleeue, not wee beleeue, as wee say, our Father?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because our prayers may be profitable vnto others. But our faith shall not saue any but our selues, <hi>Abac.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>May a man know that he hath faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Hee may; for hee that beleeueth in God hath faith: But euery man, if hee would search himselfe and his owne <note place="margin">Faith.</note> heart, can tell whether he repose trust and confidence in God or no: And therefore euery man if hee would search himselfe can tell, whether he haue faith or no, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is true; For hee that beleeueth in the Sonne of God, he shall be saued, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 36. But I know that I beleeue in God,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18128:50"/>
and therefore warranted by Gods promise, I know that I shall besaued, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 13.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Surely many doe; because they thinke they haue faith, but when it comes to scanning, it is not faith, but a vizard, and a shadow of it: like one that keepes an old Euidence by him, and thinkes his land is sure: But when it comes to tryall, his deed is naught, and will not carry it.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How may a man know that he hath true faith?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If a man feele himselfe inwardly perswaded in his heart, that God loues him in Christ, and because he loues him, will prouide him of all things needfull both for this life, and for the life to come, so that wee run not out to any wicked and vnlawfull meanes, but rest our selues on God with content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all estates. This is a sure note, that his faith is true, <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 15.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How may a man know it by the effects of Faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If a man haue an earnest loue to God, so that he be glad to doe any thing that may please him, and loath to doe the least thing that may displease him. Secondly, if he loue them that loue the Lord, so much the more they shew the more affection to him; This sealeth to his soule that his faith is true, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Why doe wee say, I beleeue in God, not I beleeue in the Catholike Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because we must beleeue in God, and in none but God, not in Saints, not in Angels, nor in any other power, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17. 5.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What gather wee of this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That as we beleeue in God, and in none but God: so we must pray to God and to none but God. For prayer and faith be linked together: So that we may not pray to any, in whom we may not beleeue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. And therefore seeing we may not beleeue in the Saints, but in God alone, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18128:51"/>
that wee may not pray to any but to God alone.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Who is this God in whom wee beleeue?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That the Turkes and Iewes, though they confesse that there is a God: yet because they doe not confesse the three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Persons, acknowledge not the true God: the true God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee, whom the Scriptures describe the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 23.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Whose Father is God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He is the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ: And then by meanes of Christ, he is our Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 17.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the meaning, when wee say, we beleeue in God the Father?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee professe thereby, that whereas God the Father was <note place="margin">God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> displeased with vs for our sinnes, now he is reconciled to vs in the blood of Christ, so that we dare boldly trust him with our whole state, and perswade our selues, that as wee call him Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so we shall finde him a Father, euen most tender, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affections in him.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Wherein are wee to perswade our selues wee shall finde him a father?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, as a Father feeds his children, and cloathes them, and prouides things needfull for them, though happily they deserue it not. So we are to perswade our selues that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing become our gratious, and good Father in Christ, will feed vs, cloathe vs, and prouide for vs, though wee deserue it not, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 31.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as a father turnes not his children out of doores for euery fault. So wee must not thinke God will cast vs off for euery sinne, if there bee any hope of amendment in vs, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8. 31.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as a father makes his sonne his heire, and leaues him his lands and his liuing: though hee keepe him short and vnder for a time. So howsoeuer our portion bee but small in this world: yet we are to beleeue, God will make vs his heires,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18128:51"/>
and one day bestow his Crowne and Kingdome on vs, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are wee to beleeue concerning God the Father?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Two things, <list>
                        <item>First, that he is <hi>Almighty.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>

                  <p>Q <hi>How is God said to be Almighty?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Two wayes: first because hee hath all might, and all <note place="margin">A mighty.</note> power in his hand, and is able to doe whatsoeuer hee will in Heauen and in Earth, no power being able to hinder his work, and to hold out against him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 114. 3.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>God cannot doe all things, for hee cannot sinne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is true, that God cannot doe any thing that is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to his Nature to doe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. hee cannot lye, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 13. hee cannot denie his word, and yet he is Almighty: Because these things imply not power, but want of power.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What meane wee when wee say: Wee beleeue in God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We beleeue not onely that God is Almighty in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but that he is Almighty for our good, and wee shall feele the benefite of that Almightie, and infinite power that is in him.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What vse may wee make of this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It serueth to strengthen our faith, not only concerning the things of this life, but also of the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>How for the things of this life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Seeing God is Almighty; that is, able to do all things: Wee know we are neuer so poore, but God is able to enrich vs, neuer so lowe, but God is able to exalt vs; neuer so heauy, but God is able to reioyce vs; neuer so entangled, but God is able to loose vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 21.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How for the things of the life to come?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Seeing God is Almighty, wee know, that though our weakenesse be great, and our corruptions many: yet God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to carrie vs comfortably through the vast and warring, Wildernesse of this world into the land of happinesse, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall rest, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 29.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because all the might and power that is in any of the creatures is from God, the least thing in the world being not able to moue it selfe, but by the strength and power which it hath from God.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What gather wee of this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That the Sparrow lights not on the ground: that a hayre falls not from the head: that a leafe dropps not from the tree, but it is ordered and disposed by the mighty hand of God, <hi>Math.</hi> 20. 29. 30.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Surely no: these are tearmes brought in to robbe God of his glorie in the gouernment of the world. For euer, that which seemes to be most casuall, is caried wholly by a secret hand of God, <hi>Prou.</hi> 16. 33.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, it will teach vs patience: For seeing all things are wrought by the hand of God; we make our account that sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, losses, miseries, they are all from God, and therefore must be borne contentedly, vnlesse in the pride of our hearts, we wil lift vp our selues against the Lord, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What is the second vse?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It will teach vs comfort; for seeing nothing is able to lift vp it selfe without the Lord, wee are to make our account, that a dogge cannot wagge his tongue, a wicked man cannot mooue his hand against vs without his leaue and licence, who is our Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 11.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the third vse?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It will teach vs thankfulnesse: For seeing it is God that worketh all in all; it is God alone, who is to bee blessed for all the comforts that we haue, because it is he that enclineth mens hearts to vs, and causeth this or that thing to doe vs good, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 32.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is God called the Creatour of Heauen and Earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because he made Heauen and Earth of nothing, all the <note place="margin">Creatour of Heauen and Earth.</note> power in this world, being not able to worke, vnlesse it haue some matter to worke vpon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 31.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee must not thinke that the Lord lay labouring and soyling at it, as wee see men doe, when they build an house, but as <hi>Psalme</hi> 35. 6. by the word of God were the Heauens made, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is meant by Heauen and Earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> By heauen is meant Heauen, and euery Creature in Heauen, and by Earth is meant the Earth, and all things in it: so that the meaning indeed is, that God created all.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That if wee haue any comfort in any thing in this world; in the earth that beares vs, in the heauens that couer vs: in the fire that warmes vs, in the water that cooles vs: in our eyes that wee see with, in our eares that wee heare with, in our legges that wee goe with; God alone is to be thanked and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for it.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is Heauen set before Earth?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Heauen is mentioned first, to teach man to seeke it first, and to begin our worke at heauen, as God begun.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The meaning is, that I beleeue, there is a life and Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Iesus Christ for all that come vnto him: And that as he is <hi>Iesus;</hi> so I shall finde him <hi>a Iesus,</hi> that is, a Sauiour to saue me from sinne, and all the punishments due to it: So that though I be a sinner; yet through the Spirit of Christ working in me, I shall sinne euery day lesse then other; and through the Lords mercy, I shall not come into condemnation for any of those sinnes, which through frailty and weakenesse I commit.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Hee is called Christ, who was annoynted, and it is the same that <hi>Messias</hi> is in Hebrew, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 25.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Because it is gouerned by the Law of Christ, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because it is defended by his power against the rage of the deuill, of sinne, and of all the enemies that oppose it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 32. 33.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, because hee hath made an attonement for it, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> vp his owne Body vpon the Altar of the Crosse.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because hee hath reuealed the royall will of God vnto his people, sometimes by his owne mouth, and sometime by the ministry of the Prophets and the Apostles, fitted and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by his Spirit thereunto, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The meaning is, I beleeue that our Sauiour Christ is the true <hi>Messias,</hi> the Lords annoynted, hee that was ordained of God to bee the <hi>King, Priest,</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi> of our Church, the King to rule it, the Priest to purge it, and the Prophet to teach it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee are called Christians of Christ, because all true Christians are members of Christ, and in some measure parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his annoynting, so that wee are Kings and Priests, and Prophets too, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 26.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How are all true Christians Kings?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They are Kings ouer their owne hearts to command them of God, and ouer their owne corrupt affections to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due them, and keepe them vnder that they raigne not in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 6.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They are Priests to offer vp their owne bodyes and soules by holy seruice vnto God. And secondly to intreate God for themselues and their brethren, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They are prophets both to stand out vnto the death for the maintainance of the truth, and also to teach that which they know to others that knew it not, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 17.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What are wee to beleeue concerning the Person of Christ?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee are to beleeue two things, <list>
                        <item>1. That hee is very God.</item>
                        <item>2. That hee is very man.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How doth the Creed shew him to be God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, because he is the Sonne of God. For as hee that is the Sonne of naturall man, must needs be a man: So he that is the naturall Sonne of God, must needs be God. And therefore he is called <hi>the mighty God, Isay 9. 6. the blessed God, Rom. 9. 6. and the true God, 1. Ioh.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why was it needfull that Christ should be God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Hee that must redeeme vs, must beare the infinite wrath of God. But no creature in Heauen or Earth, was able to beare the infinite wrath of God, and to rise vnder it. And therefore none but God was able to redeeme vs, <hi>Iob</hi> 9. 13.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What is the second Reason?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That the death of Christ might be of infinite value, and of infinite price to redeeme vs. For it was more that God was scourged: that God was nayled to the Crosse: that God was killed for vs, then if all the Angels and men in the world had suffered, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What gather wee of this, that Christ is God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That if <hi>Adam</hi> being but a man was able to condemne vs; much more Christ being God, is able to saue vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>How is Christ said to be the onely Sonne of God, seeing all the faithfull are so also?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Christ is the onely Sonne of God by Nature, and wee are the sonnes of God by Adoption and Grace: Christ is the <note place="margin">Onely Sonne.</note> Sonne of God; because he was borne of God: And we be the sonnes of God, because it pleaseth God in fauour to accept vs for his sonnes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8 15.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What is the second Title, whereby it is shewed that Christ is God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:18128:54"/>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In that hee is called our Lord. For God is our onely Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 14. and therefore seeing he must bee acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <note place="margin">Our Lord.</note> to be our Lord: he must also bee acknowledged to bee our God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 28.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is Christ called our Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because the godly ones are ruled by him, the wicked e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer labouring to shake off their yoake, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because he ruleth for our good, wee hauing the whole fruite and benefite of his gouernment in the world, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 26.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the meaning then of these words, I beleeue in Iesus Christ our Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I beleeue that he was but a bare man: but the Sonne of God, that came to redeeme the world, euen he that ruleth with all power, both in Heauen and in Earth; and therefore is most mighty to saue all those, who by true faith flie vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Why was it needfull that Christ should bee man?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because he could not suffer in his diuine Nature. First, and therefore vnlesse he had taken vpon him the weake nature of man; he could not haue suffered for vs, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because man had sinned; and therefore it was needfull that man should suffer for sonne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that he might be the more pittiful and tender to vs, hauing felt in himselfe the many weaknesses and infirmities, that our nature is subiect to, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How did Christ become man?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> That we might be acquitted at the iudgement seat of God, Christ hauing borne the whole penaltie of our sinne.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It was a most painful death, and a most infamous death.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How was it infamous?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It was infamous two wayes: first, By Gods Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. Secondly, By Mans Law, because none but base and vile persons were adiudged to the Crosse.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>Why did Christ suffer such an infamous death?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That we might see what an hatefull thing sinne is in Gods sight; which could no otherwise be expiated but by such a fearefull and infamous death of the Sonne of God. There is not the least sinne that we commit, but it cost our Sauior Christ the dearest bloud in his bodie.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What learne wee by this?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If Christ had come downe from the Crosse, the <hi>Iewes</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> would haue haled him to it againe, and so the condemnation would haue been the greater.</p>
                  <p>If Christ had come downe, he had left the worke of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption vnperfect: and therefore howsoeuer it might haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> beene much for Christs honour to haue come downe, yet ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring our good more than his owne honour, hee was content with shame and reproch to stay still vpon this Crosse.</p>
                  <p>Christ shewed then a greater miracle than that, if they would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> beleeue. For it was more to rise from death after they had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, than to come downe from the Crosse when hee was aliue.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Though hee had many sharpe conflicts before his end, yet he made a sweet close, in so much that the Centurion was more mooued with his sweet death, than with all the miracles which he had seene, <hi>Mark.</hi> 15. 39.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> But their death is not a punishment for sinne, but a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to Heauen and Eternall life. And therefore it is one of the greatest blessings that God can bestow vpon a godly man, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>When did Christ rise?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The third day, not the first day, lest the Iewes should thinke he had not beene dead indeed, but had been in a trance, Not the fourth day, lest his Disciples should haue despaired if Christ had beene longer absent from them, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 21.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Christ rose by his owne power, but wee shall rise by the power of Christ, as in a shipwracke, one swimmes to the bank, and a many hang at his heeles, and hee drawes them all out to the shore, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. 23.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee are assured hereby, that Christ hath discharged for all our sinnes: For if Christ had not payd our whole debt, if but one sinne had beene left behinde, Christ could not haue risen from death, the guiltinesse of that one sinne would haue kept him downe.

                     <hi>A.</hi> That Christ left the Earth, and went vp to Heauen, so <note place="margin">Hee ascended into Heauen.</note> that he is no longer in Earth, according to his bodily presence, either visibly or inuisibly, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 7.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is directly contrary to the Articles of our Faith, as Christ himselfe shewes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 62. For aske them of our faith, where Christs body is; They will answer it is ascended and gone into Heauen, aske the Aduersaries, they will say, it is still on Earth in this Sacrament on the Altar, &amp;c.

                     <hi>A.</hi> First, Christ ascended into Heauen, hath carryed the hearts of the Godly into Heauen with him: So that though they liue here belowe; yet they haue their mindes continually raised and lifted vp to Christ that is aboue, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee (by Christs ascending into heauen) are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready possessed of Heauen: For as one friend takes possession in an others name, and it is as good in Lawe, as if he had done it himselfe; So Christ in our name and in our right, hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into heauen, and made it as fine, as if wee our selues were already seised of it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 6.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> To speake properly, God hath neither a right hand nor a left: For God is a Spirit, and therefore hath no bodily parts, as wee haue, but the right hand of God, is the power of God, and the Maiestie of God, as the Scriptures expound it, <hi>Luke 22. 69.

                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, to shew that he is the Iudge of the world, and all causes must be brought before him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to shew that he hath finished the worke of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, as a man that sits downe when his worke is done, <hi>Heb. 10. 12. In the Sanctuary there was no stoole for the Priests to sit downe, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The sitting downe of Christ, at the right hand of God, is the installing of him in his Kingdome, and in his Throne, the aduancing and lifting of him vp to bee the head of the Church, and that person by whom God will rule all things both in Heauen and in Earth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That Christ is now exalted in his kingdome, and in his Priesthood: So that now he administreth both his kingly &amp; his

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We know that God is a iust and righteous God, and therefore hee cannot but make the state of the godly better then the state of the wicked. But in this world it is not so: For godly <hi>Lazarus</hi> lyes pyning at the doore, while the wicked <hi>Glutton</hi> sits surfetting at the Board.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee know that Christs comming, is for the further glorifying of his Church, and the punishing of the enemies of it. And therefore, howsoeuer we are here pressed and afflicted for a while, and crowned with contempt (as our Master was with thornes) yet a day will come, when all our infirmities and miseries shall haue an end, and the faces of our enemies shall be filled with shame, 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 6. 7. 8.</p>

an account to God for his whole life, for euery oath that he hath sworne; for euery lie that he hath told; for euery penny that he hath deceiued; for euery Sabboth that he hath prophaned.

                     <hi>A.</hi> That men might be alwayes vpon their watch, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for it: For the count day will come suddenly, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must euer keepe our reckonings streight, lest it come like a thiefe in the night to steale away all our peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie, and pleasures for euer, <hi>Mark.</hi> 30. 35.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the third Person in whom wee must beleeue?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Person of the Holy Ghost. <note place="margin">I beleeue inthe Holy Ghost.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are wee to beleeue concerning the Holy Ghost?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Two things; First, that he is the effentiall Power of the Father, and of the Sonne; the same God in nature, but distinct in Person: That hee proceedeth from the Father, the Scripture is plaine, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 26. That hee proceedeth from the Sonne, is as plaine, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. That he is a distinct person from them both is cleare, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 16.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that he is the Sanctifier of Gods elect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18128:60"/>
hee is called the Holy Ghost, not onely because he is holy in himselfe, but also because he makes vs holy, sanctifying both our bodyes and our soules vnto God.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What learne wee by this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That by nature wee are more barren then the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est ground in the world; hauing no sparke of grace or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in vs; And therefore, if there be any loue of vertue, any hatred of sinne, we may well know it is not of our selues; but the Spirit of God which wrought it in our hearts, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What doth the Spirit of God worke in vs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, knowledge of the will of God: For whereas by nature a man hath no more true Religion, then a very beast: The Spirit of God opening and enlightening the eyes of his minde, makes him able to conceiue the secret things of God, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the second thing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Regeneration; For by nature a man is giuen to like best of the worst things, and worst of the best things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit of God is faine to cast him new, and to change euery affection in him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5,</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the thirdthing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Communion with Christ: For by Faith the Spirit of God implanteth vs into Christ, as the Branches are knit into the stocke; so that as the Branches liue and are nourished from the stocke: So wee partake of all the rich graces that bee in Christ, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the fourth thing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Spirituall Gouernment; For by nature wee are so ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish, that wee know not when to speake, nor when to hold our peace; how to pray, nor how to vse our Christian liberties, &amp;c. And therefore the Spirit of God is giuen vs as a guide to direct vs in euery thing that we take in hand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the fift thing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Comfort in Troubles; For the Spirit of God (assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our hearts, that God loues vs in Christ) makes vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the vanities of the world, and (setting vs in hope of the life to come) makes vs set the lesse by the things of this life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 16.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Strengthening vs. For whereas naturally wee are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weary of good things (the Spirit of God so vpholding vs in grace) that euery day wee feele our selues brought into greater loue and liking of the same, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>In whom doth the Spirit of God worke these things?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In none but the Elect. A Reprobate may haue the Spirit of God, according to some effects of it, as to make him see his sinnes, to be ashamed of them; and to restraine him from the outward acts of them, to liue ciuilly in the world: But the Spirit of God inwardly killing sin, and sanctifying the Soule in all his gracious effects, is neuer giuen but to Gods Elect, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 17.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>May a man lose the Spirit of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The wicked (because they neuer had it soundly) may wholly lose it. The godly cannot lose it wholly, but onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to some graces of it, and that not finally but for a time: Because the Spirit like <hi>Sampsons</hi> hayne, will reuiue againe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 38.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>May wee therefore liue secure, because wee cannot lose the Spirit?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Nay, but wee must vse the meanes which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the nourishing of the Spirit; as hearing of the Word, Prayer, Meditation, &amp;c. otherwise the best of vs shall finde the Graces of Gods Spirit, wonderfull dead and damped in vs, 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 18.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How may a man know that hee hath the Spirit of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Hee may know that hee hath the Spirit of God by the working of the Spirit; For, as a man knowes there is life, in himselfe, as long as he breathes and moues, and doth the rest of the actions of a liuing man: So when a man liues the life of the Spirit, and doth the things which without Gods spirit hee could not doe; hee may well know that hee hath the Spirit in him.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Doe not many deceiue themselues in this point?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Many doe for want of iudgement, for there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine working like the Spirit, but it is not the Spirit. A certain

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If a man feele a sensible change in himselfe; so that hee loues that good which hee thought hee should neuer loue, and hates that euill which hee thought hee should neuer hate; and sets himselfe with diligence to the weakening and killing, not of some few, but of all his sinnes: This is a true Testimony, that hee hath Gods Spirit working in his heart, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the third Marke?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If a man feele himselfe checkt inwardly for sinne, so that hee cannot tread or looke awry, but by and by hee is close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched and rebuked for it. This is a sure token that he hath the Spirit, <hi>Isay</hi> 30. 21.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>How is it proued by the power of God?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because it is as easie for God to raise man out of the dust, as it was at first to make him of the dust: It is easier to raise man, then to make him. For as when a house falls, the stones remaine, and the timber remaines, onely it wants the forme and fashion of an house: So when a man dyes, the soule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, and the body remaines, at leastwise the bones, the spar and chiefe rafters of the house, and therefore they may the more easily be knit together and fashioned againe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because it were iniustice to punish that body for sinne, that had neuer committed sinne, and to crowne another body with Christ, and not the same that had suffered for him.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How shall it rise a glorious body?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, it shall rise immortall; hunger and thirst and cold, and sicknesse, and death shall no more preuaile against it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it shall rise in perfect state; The Power of God supplying all those members that now bee wanting: hee that lacked in eye, shall then receiue an eye; and hee that lacked an arme, shall then haue both armes restored.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it shall rise more beautifull then it was at first: For hee that is now crooked, he shall bestreightened; and hee that is now weake shall be strengthened; and hee that is too bigge shall bee lessened: And hee that is foule shall shine like the Sun in his strength.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it shall rise a spirituall body, readie and willing to doe any duty that the Spirit shall enioyne.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Shall not the wicked rise too?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In tearming himselfe our Father. For in calling God Father wee bring our selues in minde, that wee shall finde him a Father, euen fatherly affections in him, ready to heare vs and encline to our demands.</p>

                  <p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> First, we pray that God would make his Mercy, Iustice, Loue, &amp;c. so knowne vnto the world, that euery one may bee forced to admire it, and wonder at it: That the Lord would shew forth such euident, and cleere tokens of the great might and wisedome, and Iustice, and power that bee in him, that all men might be conuinced in their consciences, to confesse that the whole Soueraigntie of glorie and renowne is due vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Declare this more fully?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee pray, that the Lord would stand vp for his owne glorie: that the Lord would get himselfe glory and praise by blessing and defending the godly, and by punishing and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Doe not many herein pray against themselues?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee all pray, that if wee bee any lett or hinderance to Gods glory, so that the Lord be the worse thought of for our sakes, that hee will recouer his glory at our hands, yee though it be with the destruction of vs.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the second thing wee pray for?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That wee may acknowledge with inward feeling of our hearts the excellent, and holy things that bee in God, that wee may doe the Lord this honour to thinke that he is most Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and therefore will defend vs when the whole world is set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs: that hee is most Wise, and therefore will doe nothing but it shall be for our good: That hee is most pittifull, and therefore will pittie vs, when no eye else will looke vpon vs; that hee is most lust, and therefore will stand vp in our iust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>

Q. <hi>What is the third thing wee pray for?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That wee so liue, and so carry our selues in the whole course of our wayes, as God may haue glory by vs: That as a good seruant doth his Master credite, so the Lord may heare well for our honest life.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the fourth thing that wee pray for?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That wee may bee so wholly possessed, and taken vp with the care of the Lords praise, that wee may neuer speake or doe any thing, but with this minde, and to this intent to get some honour, and some glory to the Lord thereby.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the euills that wee pray against?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, that wee may not bee so blinde, but that wee may see the great glorie of God, that shineth in the world, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, wise gouernment, care for his people, and the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that hee brings vpon wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that wee may not doubt of any of the excellent things that bee in God; That hee hath not power enough to protect vs; Mercy enough to forgiue vs, Wisedome enough to direct vs in the safest course.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that wee may not dishonour the Lord by our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and wicked life: That wee may not bee a shame to the Gospell, men thinking the worse of it, for the loosenesse of our liues that professe it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that wee may not seeke our owne praise more then the praise of the Lord; and so greedily hunt after our owne credite, that wee care not in the meane time, though the Lords honour lye in the dust.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What doe wee pray for in the second Petition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> For the meanes of Gods glory, that his kingdome may <note place="margin">Thy kingdome come.</note> come among vs.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How doth this Petition depend vpon the former?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In the first Petition, wee prayed, that wee might glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God: and now we pray that God would rule in our hearts, that wee may glorifie him the better: For vnlesse God rule vs by his Spirit, wee are so set to pursue our owne praise, and peace and pleasure, that wee shall neuer glorifie him sincerely while wee liue.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>How by his Word?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As Princes rule their Subiects by those Lawes and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes which they make: So God rules vs by his Word, hauing there taught vs what is right, and what is wrong, or what is lawfull and vnlawfull for vs.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> No; many say, <hi>Thy kingdome come,</hi> that would not for any good, Gods kingdome should come vpon vs: Many would bee sorry in their hearts to doe no more, then God would haue them doe to part with so many sinnes, and leaue so many vanities as God would haue them leaue.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That God would rule vs by his Word, that wee may not be left to wander after our owne hearts, but that wee may haue the word of God to a continuall directing of vs in an honest course.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What is the third thing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee pray for all the good helpes, and meanes, that may further Gods kingdome, and namely for good Ministers, and good Magistrates.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What doe wee pray for good Ministers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That God would giue good Ministers to all places, faithfull and able men, full of Spirit and power, who may build vp the decaies and the ruines of the Church, and seeke vp the lost soules of their brethren, and bring them home to the Fold of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Wee pray that God would blesse and continue such as wee haue already, that they may not be discouraged in their labours, nor hindered in the Lords workes, but may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister with great grace and cheerefulnesse amongst vs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee pray that God would make their Ministry effectuall to vs for our good, that it may worke vpon our hearts to the killing of sinne, and the strengthening of Gods graces in vs.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What doe wee pray for Magistrates?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, that God would raise vp such, as may bee Fathers of the Church: such as may tender Religion, and wound with the sword of Iustice, the head of all vngodlinesse in the land.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that God would blesse and continue those that be such, especially our gratious King, that his dayes may be as the dayes of Heauen, and his Throne may be established in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie and peace, as long as the Sunne and Moone endure.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the Kingdome of Glory?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is that whereby God shall more fully raigne in vs in the world to come, when all sinne and wickednesse shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from vs.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That God would make an end of this wicked world,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18128:69"/>
and hasten to Iudgement, to the vtter confounding of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and the more full and perfect Saluation of those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Why are wee to pray for the day of Iudgement?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Chiefely for this end, that the name of God may be no more dishonoured in the world, but the kingdome of sinne and Sathan may haue an end.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Doe all wish for the day of Iudgement?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No, many had rather it would neuer come. For O! if God should come to Iudgement, what should become of a number in the world? they should cry to the hills couer vs, and to the mountaines fall vpon vs. And therefore, though they say, <hi>Thy kingdome come,</hi> yet they would be glad in their hearts that Gods kingdome might neuer come.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the second thing wee pray for?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Secondly, wee pray for the day of our owne death, for no other end, but that wee may make an end of sinning, and displeasing of God. For seeing how prone wee are to euill, and how the number of our sinnes increaseth euery day like old trees that gather mosse; This must make vs weary of the world, and so to sigh and groane in our selues, desiring to bee dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and to be with Christ.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>May a man then pray for his owne death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> A man may not pray for it of impatience as a number doe, who bee running out of the world, so soone as they feele the crosse: But onely in the desire to be disburdened of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of sinne, and to serue God in the holy heauens, with greater freedome and libertie of spirit then here they can doe.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the Euills that wee pray against?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, wee pray, that whereas wee haue kept open house for sinne and Satan these many yeares, they may no longer ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vs, and preuaile against vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee pray against all the letts and hinderances of Gods kingdome both at home and abroad, as the Turkes and the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee pray against the loue of this world, that wee may not dote vpon it, desiring to prolong our dayes in it, but
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18128:69"/>
that wee may be alwayes ready to depart in peace, and to haste hence to our heauenly home.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What doe wee pray for in the third Petition?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That wee may doe Gods will in Earth readily and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, <note place="margin">Thy will be done, &amp;c.</note> as the Angels doe in Heauen.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How doth this Petition depend vpon the other?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Before wee prayed that God would rule vs, and now wee pray that God would giue vs sort and plyable hearts that wee may yeeld our selues to be ruled by him.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the will of God?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The will of God is that which is reuealed in his Word, and may bee considered in three things.

Thirdly, it is Gods will wee should beare quietly and contentedly whatsoeuer it shall please him in his wisedome to lay vpon vs. So that wee pray, that Gods will may be done.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, wee pray that wee may be constant in this course not to serue God by moodes and fits, but at all times, and in all companies, as well in one state as in another.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Wee cannot possibly doe the will of God so perfectly as the Angels doe it.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Indeed we cannot, so long as wee dwell in these weake houses of clay: Yet wee must still aspire to a better life, desiring in a greater measure to serue God.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> A cleere difference between the godly and the wicked; For the wicked euer thinke they haue religion and good liues enough, though they haue neuer so little.

faithfully and vprightly with God.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What doe wee aske in the fourth Petition?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> All things needfull for this life.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, to the end, that being dispatched of our worldly <note place="margin">Giue vs this day our daily bread.</note> eares, and hauing things necessarie aforehand, wee might with more libertie seeke after those things which concerne the soule.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that finding the Lord easie to yeeld in these things of lesse good, wee might bee the more imboldened to sollicite him for the greater. For hee that will not trust the Lord for his meat and drinke, will not trust him for the sauing of his soule: And hee that thinkes the Lord will stand with him for a peece of bread, will easily thinke that God will stand with him for eternall life.</p>

                  <p>Qu. <hi>What gather wee of this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That they who pray for heapes of gold and siluer, for stately and gay houses, for sumptuous fare, for great liuings, and the like, sinne in praying because not Christ, but Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse taught them to pray so.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because all our paines is not able to procure vs one morsell of bread, without the Lords blessing bee vpon it, and therefore wee pray God euen to giue vs that Bread that wee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for, knowing that without his blessing wee may as soone

                  <p>Qu. <hi>What learne wee by this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That wee must as hardly begge bread of God, that is, good succession in our affaires, when wee haue the greatest meanes in the world, as when wee haue no meanes at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther money nor friend, nor counsell to compasse it.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What need they aske bread, who haue bread enough?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, though wee haue bread: yet the bread that wee haue is none of ours: For by sinne wee forfeit euery day all wee haue into the hands of God, and wee dispossesse our selues of all right, and title to it. And therefore vnlesse the Lord restore vs and giue it vs againe, wee doe but vsurpe vpon any thing that wee haue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though wee haue the substance of bread, yet wee haue not the staffe of bread, that is, the nourishing and feeding of it, but from God alone. Vnlesse God blesse it, as good take a mouthfull of grauell, as a mouth-full of meate, And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euen then, when wee haue our Tables full of bread; yet we had need pray still for our daily Bread, because our bread with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his blessing shall no more nourish vs then a stone.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doe wee say; giue vs our bread, and not giue mee my Bread?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To shew that wee must not regard our selues alone, but in a fellow feeling pray for other mens wants as well as for our owne.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Whom doth this condemne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, it condemneth the couetous man who had rather say, Giue mee my Bread, then giue vs our bread, wishing well indeed to no body but himselfe?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it condemneth those, who bee spoylers of their brethren. For it is as much as if hee should say to God; Lord doe thou giue him bread, and I will take it from him: Doe thou make him rich, and I will make him poore: Doe thou make him merry, and I will make him sad.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doe wee pray but for the Bread of one day?</hi>
                  </p>

For when they haue dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they know not where to suppe, and when they haue supt, they know not where to dyne, and yet God feedeth them from day to day; how much more safely may we rest vpon the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our God, assuring our selues, that he that feeds vs this day, wil feed vs the next day, &amp; the next, &amp; so to our liues end.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What other reason is there?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Lord would bring vs euery day in prayer to him: For seeing wee aske but the bread of one day, when that day is past, our patent and our grace is out. And therefore wee must come to the Lord the next day to renue it againe.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What else doe wee learne by this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee aske our bread euery day of God, as being not able to liue any one day without him, and therefore it must bee our chiefest care to stand fast by God, to keepe him our friend, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer bee our foe, and that hee may bee pleased whosoeuer is displeased with vs.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Why doe wee say our Bread?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee are hereby taught to aske our owne Bread, that which wee haue laboured for in some honest calling or other, for that onely is ours, which is gotten by lawfull and by honest meanes: That which is vnlawfully gotten is none of ours, it is not our bread which wee haue of God, but the diuill and sin is the purueyer and prouider of it.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What gather wee of this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, that a man cannot eate his Bread with a good conscience, that hath not done something according to his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, strength and place, to make himselfe in some sort fit and worthy of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that their sinne is great, who desire other mens bread, and are not contented with their owne. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore breake in vpon their brethren, seeking to defeate either their neighbours of their houses, or their seruants of their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18128:72"/>
or their labourers of their hyre, or the poore of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, which in right and conscience is due vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is meant by daily Bread?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That which is meete, and conuenient for the day. The Nobleman hath need of more then the meane man: hee that hath a greater charge, hath need of more, then hee that hath a lesse charge; And therefore in asking our daily bread, wee aske so much as may bee fit and conuenient for our state, <hi>Prou.</hi> 30. 8. 9.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>And how much is conuenient for vs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Lord bids vs not aske any set and certaine stint, but to leaue that to him, and to his most wise disposition, who knowes better, then wee what will serue our turnes.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What learne wee hence?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That it can bee no small comfort to vs, that the Lord is most priuie to our estate, and knowes what children, what ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, what charge wee haue, what earnings, what commings in, and what goings out, and accordingly will fit vs with that, which hee shall iudge to bee meetest for vs, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Doe wee aske these things absolutely of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No, wee aske them no further then they may stand with Gods glorie, and therefore if they may bee any meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee may glorifie God the better, wee pray that wee may haue them: if they may not, wee pray that both bread and friends, and strength, and health, and all may bee taken from vs.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What doe wee aske in the fift Petition?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee pray for the forgiuenesse of the sinnes that bee <note place="margin">Forgiue vs our sinnes.</note> past.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is this Petition knit to the former?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> For two causes: First, because without the forgiuenesse of our sinnes, all the bread in the world will not doe vs any good: For what shall it profite a man to haue a mountaine of gold, and yet to carry a fire-marke in his soule, the brand and marke of a condemned man, and to know that whensoeuer he goes hence, hee goes damned to the deuill, <hi>Math.</hi>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What learne we by this?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> That euery Christian man and woman must make it their chiefest study, and their chiefest care to finde Mercy and fauour with God in the forgiuenesse of their sinnes, rather then to inioy ten thousand worlds without it.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the second reason?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Our sinnes are so many and so grieuous against the Lord, that wee are not worthy of one morsell of meate to put into our mouthes: yea, wee deserue euen to bee starued, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished vpon the face of the earth. And therefore, because our sinnes are the barre and stop, that let and hinder Gods blessings from vs; therefore wee pray God to forgiue our sinnes, that the true hindrance of our comforts being taken away, all his blessings in most rich and plentifull sort may flowe vnto vs, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. 25.</p>
                  <p>Qu <hi>Why are our sinnes called debts?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because, as a debt bindes a man either to satisfie the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or to goe to prison: So our sinnes binde vs, either to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Gods Iustice, or to goe to hell.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What learne wee from hence?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, that wee are all in the Lords debt, and it is not some dribling somme that wee owe him; but a thousand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents at the least, more then wee and all the friends wee haue be able to discharge.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that vnlesse God be contented for them, wee are sure to goe to hell, where wee shall endure, not a moneths or a yeares imprisonment; But wee shall lye bound in the chaynes of horror and darknesse, as long as there is a God in heauen to reuenge our sinnes, and the Deuill in hell to torment vs for them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that there is no way to deale with God, but onely by intreaty and by request: Wee cannot choppe and change with him as the Pope thinkes; Lord I haue so many sinnes, and here are so many good deeds for them: But wee must begge our pardon, and become humble sutours to the Throne of grace, that God for Christs sake would shew Mercy vpon vs.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, that as wee sinne daily, so it must be our care eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day to make euen with the Lord, that wee come not with after reckonings, with sinnes of 10. 20. or 30. yeares old not repented of, but that euery day wee reconcile our selues to God, for the sinnes of that day, that whensoeuer wee shall die, wee may haue but the sinnes of one day.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No: For if wee forgiue our brethren some little fault, that is no reason why God should forgiue vs our huge and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18128:75"/>
mightie sinnes: But the Lord addes this as a sure testimonie of our soules, that if we who haue but a drop of Mercy can forgiue our Brethren, much more will the Lord, who is euen full of goodnesse forgiue vs.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the Instruction?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That wee shall neuer finde fauour at Gods hands, till such time as our brethren finde loue and mercy, and good dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at our hands. For looke what wee bee to others when they offend vs: the same wee shall finde God to vs, when wee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Whom doth this Doctrine condemne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, it condemneth those who wil vse extremity to their brethren, that will not by any meanes bate of their right, but eagerly pursue euery aduantage they can get against them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it condemneth those that will say they forgiue and forget, and yet notwithstanding the memorie of it is most quicke in their hearts, and vpon euery little occasion they breake out againe. Alas, doe wee looke for such forgiuenesse at Gods hands? how is it then that our Brethren can finde no better at our hands.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it condemneth those that can bee content to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue some small offences of their brethren: but if it touch them somewhat neere in their goods or names, oh then the matter is heynous and so preiudiciall, it toucheth vs so deeply, that it may not in any wise finde fauour at our hands? Why alas our brethren cannot commit any so grieuous offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, but wee commit farre greater against the Lord, and therefore as wee except against them: so wee may well looke, the Lord will except against vs.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What doe wee pray for in the sixt Petition?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee pray for strength and grace against sinne.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why are there two Petitions for the Soule, and but one for the Body?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Lord would teach vs thereby, that our care for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly <note place="margin">And lead vs not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> things should be twice so much as our care for earthly; and therefore, where wee are once vpon our knees for the blessings of the body, wee should bee twice vpon our knees
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18128:76"/>
for the blessings of our Soules.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>How doth this Petition depend vpon the former?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In the former Petition we prayed for the pardon of our sinnes that be past, and now wee pray for grace and strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those euills that be to come.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What learne wee by this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, that none are more subiect to Tentations then the godly; For of all men they are most layd vnto, sinne will bee euer nibling, and the diuell will labour mightily to regaine his hold.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it is not enough to haue our sinnes pardoned in Christ, vnlesse wee haue also grace to lead a better life, and to abstaine from the same, or like sinnes in time to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Doe not the Papists say well? Let vs not bee led?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No, for they would seeme to bee wiser then Christ, and therefore they haue delayed his words, as being too harsh.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>God tempts no man,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ames 1. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is one thing to tempt a man to sinne, another thing to lead a man to bee tempted of it. It was the deuill that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Christ in the desart, but it was the holy Ghost, that lead him forth as the Lords Champion into the field, <hi>Math.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How may God worke in tentation, and yet bee free from sinne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, by withdrawing his grace, and leauing vs to our selues, as if a man should send another his staffe to goe by, when his legges be lame, and thereupon hee begins to despise him and to set him light, the other takes away his staffe, and the lame man fall: So God hauing lent vs his grace to walke by, when wee begin to thinke wee stand not any way beholden to him for it, but that wee could shift as well without it, the Lord withdrawes his grace, and wee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>unne into sinne, and yet God is not the cause of our sinne, but our owne weaknesse not able to beare vp and to sustaine it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by offering occasion to trie, whether hee will sinne or no: As a man leaues a little loose money about the house to try whether his seruants, or his sonne will steale it: So God sends feare to tempt vs to see if wee will yeeld to feare,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18128:76"/>
Pride to tempt vs, &amp;c. if wee doe yeeld, it is our fault not Gods, who did but vent vs and set vs a broach, and discouer the bad liquor that was in vs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by causing the motion, but not the euill of the motion, as when the Sunne shineth vpon a dead carcasse there ariseth a stinking and a loathsome smell, and yet the Sun is not the cause of it, but the corruption of the carcasse: So in euery action God is the cause of the motion which is good: But if we sinne in moouing, that comes of the Deuill or of our selues.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, by ordering the euill of the Action to some good end. As a Father seeing his childe to bee busie about the fire, catcheth his finger and thrusts it to a coale, to make him the more affraid of it after: So God sometimes lets vs taste of sinne, that wee may the more detest it, and hate it while wee liue.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How many parts are there of this Petition?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Two: First, wee pray that wee may not bee tempted to sinne. And secondly, though that wee bee tempted; yet that wee may not be ouercome of sinne.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doe wee pray that wee may not bee tempted to sinne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee know our owne weaknesse to bee so great and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to resist temptations, that wee pray that wee may not bee tempted: So readie wee are to yeeld to sinne, that wee pray we may not bee prouoked to it. Often wee sinne, and oftner wee should sinne, if wee were oftner tempted to it; Many times we are angrie, and yet if wee had ofter occasions, wee would ofter be angrie.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What gather wee of this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That their sinne is great who fling themselues into ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that will take vp their dwellings in those Townes, and venture themselues into those companies, where they know are many and strong entisements vnto sinne. What doe they else but offer the deuill Blockes of aduantage against themselues, and hold him the stirrop, that his Tentations may the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily mount vpon them.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What are the Euills that wee pray against?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:18128:77"/>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They are of two sorts, <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Sinne without vs,</hi> as the Deuill and the world.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Sinne within vs,</hi> as the corruptions and lusts of our owne hearts.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What doe wee pray for against the Deuill?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That whereas the deuill is woont to pull a vizard vpon vpon his face, and to translate himselfe into an Angell of light, that wee may haue wisedome to discrie him, and strength from heauen to stand against him.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Doth not euery one hate the Deuill?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Indeed many will say, fie vpon the Deuill, and say they detest him with all their hearts; and yet in leading a prophane and a wicked life, they beare him about in their bodyes with them.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What doe wee pray for against the World?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, that wee may not bee poysoned, and corrupted with the bad examples that bee abroade: That wee may not catch the infection, but keepe our selues vnspotted to the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that neither our friends by flatterie, nor our foes by feare, may quench vs in good things, and drawe our hearts from God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that our worldly cares may not ouergrow our god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cares, so that wee haue more loue to the frothy things of this life, then to those that concerne the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What doe wee pray for against our owne lusts?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That God will weaken the strength and power of sinne in vs euery day, that wee may feele it either cleane killed or so mightily weakened, that as a man that hath receiued his deaths wound; though hee liues and breathes, yet languisheth and fainteth, and droopeth euery day more and more vntill he dye: So sinne may haue lesse and lesse strength, till at length it haue no strength at all.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why doe wee aske all these things of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because wee are not able of ourselues to stand; the least enemy being stronger then wee, and therefore wee pray to bee girded with the strength of God, that through his might wee

may doe that which of our selues wee should neuer doe.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What other thing doe wee pray for?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That if wee fall into sinne, that wee may not lye in it, but that the Lord will finde vs out in our falls, and seeke vp our lost soules, and bring vs vpon the shoulders of his mercy to his fold againe.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Doe the godly sinne then as well as the wicked?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yea, but the godly are euer desirous to bee deliuered from sinne, and therefore doe both pray and watch against it, whereas the wicked hugge it and keepe it warme in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes, and are well content to continue in it, vsing no meanes to get out of it.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What meanes doth God vse in deliuering vs from sinne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The chiefest meanes, is the Ministry of the word, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hand of God, whereby hee pulleth vs out of sinne, as a beast is lugg'd out of the mire: And therefore wee pray, that wee may bee obedient to it, and profite by it, that it may make vs wise vnto Saluation, and mighty through God to withstand all assaults that rise against vs.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the last part of the Prayer?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Conclusion or shutting vp of the Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the vse of the Conclusion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It containeth certaine Reasons to strengthen our faith, <note place="margin">For thine is the kingdome, &amp;c.</note> that wee shall be heard. For this is a great cause why our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers come so coldly from vs without heart or life, because wee stand not strongly perswaded in our hearts; that wee shall fare the better for our prayers, and shall neuer returne emptie han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the Reasons?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The first is taken from the kingdome or gouernment of God q. d. Lord thou art our king. And therefore as it is for the glory of a King, that his Subiects bee in good state, safe from their enemies, and abounding with all good things: So thou Lord shalt much commend thy selfe, and thy gouernment to the world, if thou prouidest well and sufficiently for vs, who bee the worshippers and seruers of thee.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Is this consideration so full of comfort?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:18128:78"/>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It must needs yeeld all the children of God great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that the kingdome is come into their Fathers hand, and hee hath taken vpon him the care and the prouision for them, who sitteth at the sterne of the world, and doth whatsoeuer he will both in heauen and earth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 97. 1.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the second Reason?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The second is taken from the power of God q. d. Lord I haue asked nothing, but thou art able to giue it: My wants bee not so many, but thou art able to supply them: My sinnes bee not so great, but thou canst for giue them: My enemies bee not so strong, but thou canst subdue them: I therefore cannot but haue great hope, seeing it is in thy power and hand to doe mee good.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the third Reason?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The third is taken from the glory of God. Indeed if wee pray not, then it is our fault if wee speed not well: But if wee pray in Faith and reuerence, and make our requests known vnto the Lord; then it shall bee for the Lords honour to be as good as his word, and hee shall get himselfe great praise in the world by hearing the poore and weake prayers that bee made vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What learne wee by this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That the Lord hath ioyned his owne glory with our good, and therefore will heare vs and blesse vs, if it bee but to hold vp his owne estimation and honour in the world, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 22.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What other sense doe these words yeeld vs (Thine is the Glorie.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Whatsoeuer gift or Grace thou shalt bestow vpon vs, wee will wholly imploy it to thy honour: wee will rather seeke thy glory, then our owne praise, or peace, or pleasure in the good vse of it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 8.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What learne wee by this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That seeing wee aske health, and peace and plenty to this end, that wee may glorifie God the better, that when wee haue these things wee bee not found to bee farre lesse carefull of it, then before we had them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 15.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That all the Reasons bee from without vs, and none from within vs, there being nothing in the best of vs, in the merit and worthinesse whereof, wee may thinke to bee hear; whatsoeuer enclines the Lord to heare vs, it is chieflly and wholly in himselfe and not in vs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 19. 18. 19.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is that other meanes of strengthening Faith?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Sacraments?</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Whence haue the Sacraments their name?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Of the Latine word <hi>Sacramentus,</hi> which signifies an <note place="margin">Sacraments.</note> oath, whereby Souldiers were woont to binde themselues to be true to their Captaines: So in the Sacraments, wee sweare and binde our selues to bee true and faithfull seruants vnto Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is a Sacrament?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is a visible signe of inuisible Grace: So that in euery Sacrament there are two things. The visible signe that we may see: And the inuisible Grace that wee cannot see. As in <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,</hi> there is a washing of the body, and there is washing of the soule: The washing of the body with water, a man may see: But the washing of the Soule with the Blood of Christ, he cannot see: So in the Lords Supper, there is a feeding of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and there is a feeding of the soule? The feeding of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with Bread and Wine, hee may see: But the soule with the Body and the Blood of Christ, hee cannot see, but by faith.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To confirme our faith by that which wee see, in the truth of that which wee doe not see.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As the Water poured on the body washeth away the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse of the flesh: So the blood of Christ being poured vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the soule, washeth away the filthinesse of sinne.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They haue Originall sinne, which is a secret naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse of nature, whereby they are wholly giuen and inclined to that which is euill, <hi>Isay</hi> 48. 8.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How is this taken away in Baptisme?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In Baptisme wee receiue the Spirit of Christ, and this Spirit workes vpon our hearts renewing them, and enclining them to better things, and euery day by little and little preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and getting strength and ground of those corruptions that are in vs, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Vndoubtedly they may; For God hath not tyed his Grace to the Sacraments, but that many times hee workes
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18128:79"/>
without them: And therefore it is not the want of Baptisme, but the contempt of Baptisme, that bringeth danger, <hi>Act. 10. 44. &amp;</hi> 47.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What proofe is there of it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Circumcision was as straightly required in the old Law, as Baptisme is in the New Testament, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>4. But chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that dyed without Circumcision might bee saued; As namely those that dyed before the 8. day, And therefore Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be saued without Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>What other proofe is there?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Children that are elected to Saluation, are holy before Baptisme, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. they are within the Couenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. the kingdome of heauen belongs vnto them, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 14. And therefore vndoubtedly they may be saued.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>How then doth our Sauiour say,</hi> Iohn 3. 5. <hi>Except a man bee borne of Water and the Spirit hee cannot enter into the kingdome of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee are to marke the person to whom hee speakes it, to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who might haue beene baptised if hee would: So that our Sauiours speech reacheth no further, but to those who may haue Baptisme and will not: For if none absolutely might bee saued without Baptisme, how could the Theefe bee saued who was conuerted vpon the Crosse, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Is it lawfull for a priuate person to Baptise?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No: For this is to corrupt the holy Seales: For none may meddle in the holy things, but they that are warranted thereunto by the Lord: But priuate persons men or women, haue no warrant from the Lord to Baptise, and therefore they may not presume to intermeddle in it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What other Reason is there?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Baptisme is a part of the publike Ministry of the Church, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. But priuate persons, and chiefly women may not intermeddle in the Churches Ministry. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may not take vpon them to Baptise, 1. <hi>Tim,</hi> 2. 11. 12.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Yea, but there is a case of necessitie in it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There is no necessitie to breake the Law of God, if we may haue the Sacraments according to the Lords institution,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18128:80"/>
we are to accept them with Thankfulnesse if wee cannot, wee must not thinke it lawfull to come by them wee care not how.</p>
                  <p>Q. Zipporah <hi>in case of necessitie did Circumcise her childe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The reason doth not hold; For the Sacraments of the New Testament are tyed to the Ministry; And therefore none but the Ministers may intermeddle in them: But the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Old Testament were not tyed to the Priesthood (as appeareth) for that Christ and his Apostles caused kill the Passeouer, who were not of the Tribe of <hi>Leui, Luk.</hi> 22. 19: Also in that <hi>Ioshua</hi> did circumcise, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the other Sacrament?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Sacrament of <hi>the Lords Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why is the Lords Supper needfull after wee be Baptised?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because by Baptisme wee doe enter into the household of God, and by the Lords Supper wee are fed, and nourished in <note place="margin">The Lords Supper.</note> the same: So that Baptisme is the Seale of our entrance into Christ: and the Lords Supper giues vs our further growth and continuance in him, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How is this further declared?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> By a similitude. For as a Master makes prouision for his Family, that they may be the more able to goe through with their worke: So the Lord hath appointed this Sacrament, for the strengthening of his people, that they may bee the better able to hold out in the holy labours and duties required at their hands.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What learne wee by this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That they who come seldome to the Sacrament must needs bee very faint, and weake in the spirit; As a man feeles his strength through long fasting to abate, so that he is not able to walke with any cheerefulnesse and comfort in his calling.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the outward signe in the Lords Supper?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Bread and Wine, and the Sacramentall Rites that bee vsed about them.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What doth the Bread signifie?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It signifies the Body of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:18128:80"/>
Q. <hi>What resemblance is there betweene the Bread and Christs Body?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, as the body cannot liue without bread no more can our soules liue without Christ. And therefore wee must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for Christ, as wee doe for bread, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 51.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as bread strengthens the body, &amp; makes it the more able and fit to worke: so that the eye sees the cleerer, the hand mooues the quicker, the foot sets the faster for it: So Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by faith strengtheneth the Soule, and makes it mighty through God, to performe the duties of obedience required of it. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What Bread did Christ vse in the Sacrament?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Ordinarie and common Bread, such as was vsually at that time eaten with their meates.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Why did Christ vse common Bread?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, left men (if the food had beene finer) should haue left the care of feeding their soules, and fallen to filling their bellies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that as <hi>Naman</hi> learned, because the Waters of <hi>Iordan</hi> were not better then the Waters of <hi>Damascus:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was not the water of <hi>Iordan,</hi> but the God of Israell, that cleansed his leprosie: So because this Bread is but ordinant and common bread; wee may therefore know, that it is not the bread, but Christ signified by the bread, that sanctifieth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why did Christ take the Bread?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Christ by taking the Bread from the Table, shewed that hee would separate it to another vse: So that where before it serued but to strengthen the body, now it should serue to the strengthening of our Faith.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How did Christ blesse the Bread?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As the Lord blessed the Seuenth day, by appointing that day to an holy vse: So Christ blessed the Bread by making <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Q. <hi>What are wee bidden to take inn this Sacrament?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Two things, Bread to the feeding of our bodies, and Christ himselfe to the feeding of our soules: For as the Bread is offered to our bodies: So Christ himselfe is offered to our faith.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> That hee which comes to this Sacrament, must bring two hands with him: An hand of the body to receiue the Bread, and an hand of Faith to receiue Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Doe not all receiue Christ that come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No: For then euery one should bee the better for it, whereas now many through their owne default are not the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the worse after, God iustly reuenging their irreuerence and contempt, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 17.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Who bee they that take no good by this Sacrament?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, they that want Faith, which is declared by their euill life: For they wanting the hand of Faith, must needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate themselues of the whole fruite of the Sacrament which is receiued by Faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, such of the godly, as doe not quicken and stirre vp their Faith, by priuate prayer and meditation when they come to receiue: For as a man that hath his arme benummed, or asleepe, is not able to reach out his hand to receiue the Bagg of gold that is offered him: So if our faith bee dead and cold, and not quickened vp, wee shall goe from the Sacrament as emptie as wee came.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>

                     </gap> liuely before the inward eyes of our Soules, as if wee saw him hanged, nayled, crowned, bleeding vpon the Crosse, So <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> by faith had as liuely a sight of Christ, as if with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily

eyes, hee had looked vpon him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 56. So the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites did eate and drinke Christ in the Desart, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 3. 4. and yet Christ was not borne till 1500. yeares after.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How are the godly said to eate Christ?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As a man is said to eate the meate that hee liues by, which hee doth apply, and appropriate to his body to the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing and feeding of the same; euen so when by speciall faith wee doe apply Christ vnto our selues, and make him ours, so that wee liue by Christ as a man liues by meate: then wee are said to eate Christ.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>How is the Bread the body of Christ?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is not verily and indeed his body: (For Christs body is in Heauen onely, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21.) but it is his body Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, that is, a certaine pledge and token of his body. For as the Rocke is called Christ, because it signifies Christ, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. So here the bread is called Christs Body, because it signifies his body.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Doe wee then receiue nothing but a Signe of his Body?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, wee receiue the very body of Christ by Faith: for the bread which wee receiue with our mouthes, is a true token that Christs body is receiued by faith: For as a man that takes a key in signe of possession takes not the bare signe, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry possession together with the signe: So they that worthily Communicate, receiue not a bare signe of the Body, but the very body it selfe spiritually and by faith.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>Why are there two signes in the Lords Supper, and but one in Baptisme?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Christ is set forth in Baptisme, as washing the soule from sinne: And therefore, because water of it selfe is enough to wash the body, therefore there needed nothing else to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the washing of the soule. But in the Sacrament of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Christ is proposed, as a nourishment feeding vs and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding vs in the life of Grace: And therefore, because bread is not sufficient to sustaine the bodily life without wine, nor wine without bread. Therefore two Signes were appointed, to shew that wee haue our whole nourishment by Christ.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What resemblance is there betweene the Wine and Christs blood?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As Wine maketh glad the heart of men, and a man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing tasted of it, forgetteth the trouble and the miferie that lies vpon him: So the blood of Christ (which speaketh better things then the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> euen peace and saluation to those that killed him) bringeth vnspeakable ioy and comfort to the heart, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as wine breeds good blood, &amp; good spirits in a man, and a man hauing tasted of it, the very colour and the strength of it will appeare in his face; yea, it will make his very breath smell the sweeter for it: So the blood of Christ breedes good thoughts, and good desires, and good affections in the heart, and a man hauing tasted of it by faith, all his actions and all his thoughts will be full of the good taste, and good relish of the same.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>When did Christ ordaine this Sacrament?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> After Supper, that is, after the eating of the Paschall lambe. When they had now sufficiently filled themselues with meate, and so needed not any further nourishment for this life; to shew that it is not the bodily life, but the spirituall, that hee seekes to feed, and to nourish in them, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 20.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That men must come to the Lords Table not to fill their bellies, but to seed their soules, to haue their faith streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, their zeale kindled, their loue increased, all their graces to bee quickened in them.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What else may bee obserued in the time?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That the Disciples hauing supped before, had so mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately vsed the matter, that they were fit to receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment afterwards, which may teach vs to vse such sobriety and moderation in our meates, that wee bee not thereby made any way vnfit for holy duties.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Whom doth this meet withall?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It meetes with those, who stuffe themselues with meate, especially vpon the Sabboth day; That thereby they become vtterly vnfit for any holy Dutie, being readier to sleepe then to heare, and to seeke ease for the body, then any comfort for the soule.</p>

                  <p>Qu. <hi>Why did Christ make such expresse mention of the Cuppe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Christ being a Prophet foresaw in his Spirit, that the Pope would denie the people the Cuppe, but not the Bread, and therefore hee hath giuen a more expresse charge for the Cuppe, to breake the necke of this heresie before it rose.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What gather wee of this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That the Papists bearing hatred to the truth, through the iust iudgement of God vpon them, are commonly cast vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these errours, which may most easily and most plainely, be conuinced by the Scriptures.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is that which wee commonly call a dead mans Will, whereby hee giues away his goods, and disposeth of his lands and liuings that belong vnto him. Such a will Christ made at his death, that hee gaue away all he had.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Therein the Lord bequeathed life and Saluation to those onely that fulfill the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the tenour of the New Testament?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Therein the Lord bequeathes heauen, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof to those that beleeue in Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because wee were all cut off of all by the former, for that gaue vs nothing, but vpon condition that wee should ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law, and therefore seeing wee could not performe the condition, wee could not recouer one penny by the Will.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That the Papists folly is exceeding great, who make our state farre worse by the second Testament then it war by the first. For by the first Testament Merits onely were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Saluation: But by the later (as they say) both our whole taske of workes is required, and besides that, Faith in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour; So that our condition is now harder then in the Old Testament, God requiring then but workes onely; but now as they say, both faith and workes, as needfull to Saluation.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes: Through the blood of Christ, wee bee not onely discharged of the sinnes that be past, but wee haue strength and power against those Tentations and euill motions that bee to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>How haue wee this?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Euen as a Corrasiue, being applied vnto the diseased part, eates out the corrupt flesh, and drawes out the poyson and the venome that is in it: euen so the blood of Christ being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by faith eates out the dead affections, and suckes out the Cankered corruptions that are in it.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why then doth Christ mention no benefite but Remission of sinnes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because this is the chiefest. For euery day wee deserue to bee cast into Hell; and wee giue the Lord iust cause to strip vs, and to take away all his blessings from vs: And therefore if Christs blood did not obtaine pardon for our sinnes, we might not looke to liue one day in any tolerable estate.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> If hee bee Gods seruant, hee must then see with what faithfulnesse hee hath walked in his seruice, how hee hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed himselfe towards God, the Master of the house, whether hee hath loued him, feared him, serued him, obeyed him, beene thankfull for his mereies; humbled by his Iudgements, and how hee hath carryed himselfe towards his fellow Seruants in the house, whether hee hath sought their comfort, strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them in good things, tendered their credite, &amp;c. 3.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> When a man sees how loosely, and how vnfaithfully he hath done his worke; how ill hee hath performed his taske. Then he must consider, whether hee be truely sorry for it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee be euen ashamed of his negligence, and of his sloach, that hee hath liued no better towards God, towards man, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himselfe; and whether he haue no remorse nor feeling of it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 8.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Then hee must consider, whether he doe not desire to rise out of his estate, and whether hee bee carefull to vse the meanes in reconciling himselfe to his brethren; in seeking to be at one with God, and so minding to come to the Sacrament and for no other end, but to renew the Couenant between God, and his soule, and to draw strength from Christ, to liue better after then before, <hi>Ier.</hi> 50. 5.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the fift Point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Lastly, whether if God shall set him vpon cleere board againe, hee haue a full purpose to watch better ouer his wayes, neuer to liue as hee hath liued, to auoyde the occasions of sinne, and to take more paines for the nourishing, and increasing of good things in his heart.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What is the vse of this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That a man finding these things in some measure in himselfe, may be bold to come with comfort: But they that haue no care to get them, may well looke for a cold welcome of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How are wee to behaue our selues in the receiuing of the Sacrament?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, wee are to come with great reuerence, as into Gods presence; with great care, that wee doe not prouoke the Lord by any light, or wanton, or vnseemely behauiour of ours, that the Lord spie no contempt, no loosenesse, no prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in vs, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 10. 3.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How is this declared?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If a man were to goe but into the presence of a Prince, how carefull would hee bee, neither to doe nor to speake any
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18128:85"/>
thing that might offend: How much more when wee come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the presence of Almighty God, must wee take great heed, that wee doe not the least things that may be displeasing in his fight.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the second Point?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Secondly, we must apply our selues to the Action that we haue in hand, bethinking our selues what wee came for: namely, to haue our sinnes weakened, our faith strengthened, our zeale kindled, our care quickened, our Graces nourished, and answerably thereunto labouring and indeauouring, the supplying of our wants, to draw life and strength from the dead body of our Sauiour Christ, that as the woman was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by touching him, <hi>Mark.</hi> 5. 29. and streight way the course of her blood was dryed vp, and she felt in her body that shee was healed of her plague: So wee touching Christ by Faith, may haue the course of sinne stopped, and the fountaine of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanenesse dryed in vs all.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the third Point?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Thirdly, wee must looke that our hearts consent with our mouthes in the prayers of the Church: That wee lye not to God, and say wee bewayle our sinnes, when indeed wee bee neuer a whit sorry for them: That we repent vs of our faults, when intruth wee haue not so much as a purpose to amend: Wee lift vp our hearts to God, when many times wee doe not so much as thinke of God. For what an heauy thing is it to sinne there, where wee come to craue pardon of our sinnes, <hi>Isay</hi> 65. 3.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the fourth Point?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Fourthly, wee are to marke what is done in the holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, not to sit in a browne study, as a number doe, but to fire our eyes vpon the Sacramentall signes, and when wee see the Bread broken and pulled in peeces; Then to thinke, euen so was the Bodie of our Lord, rent and torne vpon the Crosse for our sinnes. When wee see the Wine poured out; Then to thinke, euen so was the Blood of Christ poured out of his Bodie, that I might haue health and comfort by it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18128:86"/>
when I reach out my hand to receiue the bread: Then I must looke that my heart be ready to receiue Christ who is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to my Faith.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the fift Point?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Fiftly, the Lord hauing sealed the Couenant on his part; wee are likewise to Couenant on our parts, that seeing it hath pleased God to forgiue the sinnes that bee past, and to bring vs into fauour againe; That therefore by his Blessing, wee will neuer liue as wee haue liued; wee will neuer spend our time as wee haue spent it; wee will neuer loue sinne as wee haue loued it: But the rest of the dayes, that wee haue to liue, shall bee wholly dedicated and vowed vnto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the last Point?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Lastly, when our selues haue receiued, then wee are to looke how others receiue; that seeing wee bee all seruants of one Lord, all feed at one Table, all nourished with one meat: That therefore, there may be more mercy, more kindenesse, more Christian loue among vs: And it may bee our shame; that wee cannot liue peaceably together on Earth; who hope one day to liue ioyfully together in heauen, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are wee to doe after wee haue receiued?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Wee are to giue the Lord great thankes for the death of his Sonne, for giuing vs our part in him, and for the holy vse of the Sacraments, wherein Christ is so freely set forth, that wee may after a sort taste him with our tongues, feele him with our singers, smell him with our noses, behold him with our eyes, and euen feele him sensibly bestowed vpon vs, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 12. 13.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the second thing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Secondly, wee must haue great care to liue better after, then before: That wee fall not backe to our old sinnes, and suffer our woonted malice, and sloth and vanitie to creepe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs: and this not for a day or two, but all the dayes of our liues, euen as long as it shall please God to continue vs here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 14.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Whom doth this Doctrine meet withall?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:18128:86"/>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> First, it meeteth with those, who as soone as they haue receiued, runne immediately to prophanenesse; spending the best part of the day in gadding, and swil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that it may justly bee feared, that the Deuill makes a better market that day, then hee doth many dayes beside.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it meetes with a number, that will Saint it, and liue very deuoutly that day: But the very next day or few dayes after, they returne to their olde bent, and runne themselues, as deepe in the mire as they were before.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What is the third thing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Wee must bring our selues often into minde of the Couenants and vowes which wee haue made to God, thinking with our selues that such and such a day, wee were before the Lord, and there wee sware in his hearing, and in the hearing of his People, that wee would neuer liue as wee haue liued: Wee would lye no more, curse no more, beare no more malice: And therefore, what a Iudgement shall wee pull vpon our heads, if wee shall not bee carefull in some good measure to performe it.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What is the fourth thing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Fourthly, wee are to marke how the Sacrament workes vpon vs: Whether wee finde our selues the better for it; the stronger to resist sinne: the cheerefuller in Gods seruice, the tenderer to our Brethren: And if it doe not worke; What is the reason of it? Whether want of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, or want of reuerence, or want of care after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; that the next time wee come, wee may come to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fruite.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the last thing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Wee must not bee long away, but so soone as we feele any deadnesse, or coldnesse, or weaknesse to grow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs: wee are to make recourse hither againe for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of our strength: For as a man in a long iourney had need of many Baites: So the Christian that hath a long
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18128:87"/>
Iourney to goe from Earth to Heauen, from man to God, from Mortalitie to Immortalitie, had need to come oft to the Lords Table to bee refreshed.</p>
                  <p>Quest. <hi>What is the reason then that some come so sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi> Many of the Passengers doe not feele their need: no, though they bee ready to droppe downe into euery ditch: But such as feele the want, they are carefull to vse the Lords helpe against it.</p>

                     <hi>God, whereby we desire things needfull of him, as the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring and fountaine of all goodnesse.</hi> Whence it appeares, that there are three things remarkeable in <hi>Prayer.</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <hi>Prayer</hi> is an action or motion of the heart: It is not  a mouing of the mouth, or an action of the lips onely; but properly, an action or moouing of the heart; as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Anna</hi> prayed in her heart, but her mouth <note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 13.</note> spake not. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 20. 4. the Prophet prayes; <hi>And grant</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 20. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>thee according to thy hart, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 19. the Apostles <note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 19.</note> words are, <hi>Speaking to your selues in Psalmes &amp; Hymnes, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.</hi> So that <hi>Prayer</hi> must needs haue the working of the heart, for if it come not from thence, if that be not moued to pray, it is but lip-labour, and an idle sound; It is no prayer, because in prayer, there must be a mouing of the heart. The Lord by the Prophet, complaines of this neglect. <hi>And they haue not cryed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 7. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>me with their hearts, when they howled vpon their beds, &amp;c.</hi> and 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 39. <hi>Salomon</hi> prayeth to God, <note place="margin">1 Kings 8. 39.</note> that when any man prayeth, the Lord would giue vnto him, as hee knoweth his heart. For the Lord onely knoweth the hearts of the children of men. By which it is euident, that the Lord accounteth not of that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which comes not from the heart.</p>
                  <p>Oh that men of this world did well consider this, they thinke that if they tumble out words of prayer, though their mindes wander and are vnstedfast, though their thoughts be vpon other things, though their
<pb facs="tcp:18128:91"/>
hearts be transported with diuers wanderings, yet they pray vnto God. But the truth is, that as Prayer is an Action and Motion of the Heart, so if the Heart doe not ioyne in prayer, though a man vse words neuer so oft, hee cannot truely say that he doth pray. Nay, I would this were the fault of the world onely, that euen the good seruants of God did not faile in this: For surely, the best men haue their stragglings and wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in prayer. Let a man come to prayer, and hee shall haue much adoe to hold his heart fast vnto God. As the fowles troubled <hi>Abraham</hi> in his sacrifice: So a <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 11. Fowles.</note> number of by-thoughts are ready to trouble vs in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Wherefore euery good seruant of God must accuse himselfe for this, and pray to God for grace, &amp; strength to amend it. As <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22. 5. vsed his seruants and his Asse to helpe him in his iourney, but when hee <note place="margin">Abrahams <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</hi> Gen. 22. 5.</note> came to Mount <hi>Moriah</hi> (the place of worship) then he discharged them, and left them a farre off: So world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts are tollerable and lawfull; if we vse them as seruants, to carry vs through this our iourney from <hi>Earth</hi> to <hi>Heauen.</hi> But when we come home to prayer, to present our selues before the Maiesty of God; then we must dismisse, and discharge them. So that this is the first thing to be obserued in <hi>prayer,</hi> that <hi>Prayer is an action or motion of the heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second thing in prayer is, that <hi>Prayer is a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart, as it is lifted vp and eleuated vnto God with intentiuenesse and deuotion,</hi> according to that which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>In the morning will I direct me vnto</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 5. 3. Psal. 25. 1.</note>

A

                     <hi>Elias</hi> was transported from earth into heauen: euen so by Prayer, we are carried out of ourselues, out of this world, and all worldly things, to be present with God in the highest heauens. So that there must be speciall excitation of the Heart in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that thereby we may come neerer vnto the Lord himselfe: which is the second thing to be obserued in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>The third thing in Prayer is, <hi>that we be carefull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi>

                  <list>
                     <item>1 A sense and feeling of our owne miseries and wants.</item>
                     <item>2 An earnest desire to haue them supplyed.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Concerning the first, <hi>there must be a feeling and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer apprehension of our wants.</hi> By which meanes, a man shall the willinglier pray for a supply of the same. If we doe not find the Feauer, feele the fits, be not pressed with it, as with a heauy burden; no man will seeke to the Phisitian that is not sicke; care for a fire, that is not a cold; creepe to a fountaine, that is not a dry: So there must be a sense of want and misery, before men be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to pray: The blind men in the Gospell, cryed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Christ, Matth.</hi> 20. 10 and why? because they had a sense of their owne misery, that made them cry. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Matth. 20. 10.</note> should haue seene the saluation of God blessed the meanes of their Redemption that God had sent into the world. But oh! as men buried in darkenesse, they could see nothing: onely the sense of misery makes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18128:92"/>
men cry vnto God. So <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 4. <hi>Moses</hi> cryed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Exod. 17. 4.</note> the Lord, &amp;c. the sense of danger thus set him on. <hi>O Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>these people be ready to stone me, &amp;c.</hi> Thus we see, it must be a sense and feeling of our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and wants, which must driue vs to prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <hi>There must be an earnest desire to haue them supplyed;</hi>  for though a man see his wants, and yet doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them, nor wish or indeuour to haue them relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, this man will neuer pray to God; so that it is not enough for a man to haue a sense and feeling of his wants, and to bustle vnder them, and hang downe the head as a bulrush, but he must earnestly desire and seeke supply for them at the hands of God. So <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> sayes, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>O Lord we be not able to stand,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 20. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>but our eyes are towards thee, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>If any</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>man lacke wisedome, let him aske of God, &amp;c.</hi> So that in prayer there must be a desiring of needfull things at the hand of God. For as ground when it is dry, opens it <note place="margin">Ground.</note> selfe into clefts and cranies, and gapes towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as though it would deuoure the Cloudes. So must the true Christian be affected in prayer, earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the supply of his wants at the hands of God. Thus it appeares, a man may speake words of prayer a hundred times, and yet neuer pray truely, if his heart be not disposed and affected to God. Prayer being (as I haue said) first, a motion of the heart; secondly, not euery motion but that which is eleuated and lifted vp to the Lord; thirdly, not euery lifting vp of the heart, but whereby we desire things needfull; fourthly, there must be a sense of our wants; fiftly, and last of all, yea, chiefest of all, an earnest desire to haue them supplyed. And thus, as when many hands lift at a burthen. It is <note place="margin">Many hands.</note> the easier heaued vp; so when all these concurre toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Prayer is the more fully made, and the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2 General point in prayer.</note>
The second generall thing in this Duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi> is, </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Why we must pray?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For though the bare words of Christ might bee enough for vs, and we should answer all temptations, as the lame man answered the <hi>Jewes: Iohn 5. 11. Hee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>who healed me, said vnto mee, Take vp thy bed and walke.</hi> So we may say, Hee who healed me with a plaister of his owne blood, Hee that deliuered me by his owne death, and payed the ransome for my sinnes: <hi>ipse dixit mihi:</hi> He said to me, <hi>Pray thus, &amp;c.</hi> Yet because much subtilty and infirmity lies in the heart of man, I will a little enlarge my selfe in this point, though I say this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer might be enough for vs.</p>
                  <p>First then, there be certaine <hi>Obiections</hi> to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Why we need not pray:</hi> Secondly, we will shew the <hi>Reasons, Why we ought to pray.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Obiections</hi> that may scale the heart of a man, and put in his heart that he need not pray, are two:</p>
                  <p>The first is: <hi>Because no man can make any change or</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obiections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Prayer, answered. <hi>Malac.</hi> 3. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>alteration in the Lord, Malach. 3. 6. Ego sum Deus, &amp; non mutor, &amp;c. I am the Lord, I change not.</hi> Therefore if we cannot change God with our prayers, to what purpose is it that we should pray?</p>
                  <p>I answer, we pray not to make a change in <hi>God,</hi> for <hi>God</hi> is vnchangeable, <hi>but we pray to make a change in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Obiection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> 
                     <hi>our selues;</hi> that we may be capable of that goodnesse, kindnesse, and mercy, &amp;c. that is in God. A man that stands in the Sunne with his eyes shut, If hee desire to haue the sight of the Sunne, he must not thinke to haue <note place="margin">Sunne, eyes shut.</note> it by making any change or alteration in the Sunne, but he must make a change and alteration in himselfe; open his owne eyes, lift vp his owne eye-liddes; and then see the comfortable light of the Sunne that shines about
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18128:93"/>
him: Euen so, if a man would participate of those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and rich things that are in God; the way is not to thinke by our prayers to make any change or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Him, but to make a change in our selues, Draw <note place="margin">Dionis. cap. 3. de Diuis Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus. Sicut si quis slans, &amp;c.</note> our hearts and affections neerer vnto God. As an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Father well obserues, where he most excellently well opens the very same point, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The second Obiection is; <hi>All things are decreed of God, &amp;c. So that if God haue decreed this or that, then whether we pray, or pray not, It matters not, for nothing can alter the Decree of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer as a learned man saith; <hi>What soeuer God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Obiection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> 
                     <hi>hath decreed, he hath decreed nothing without meanes to effect the same.</hi> For God hath not onely decreed the particulars &amp;c. but God hath also ordayned, that by such and such meanes, we should be led vnto the ends. Now because prayer is a meanes, and a speciall meanes to accomplish the Decree of God. Therefore we must pray, for this doth not take away prayer, but confirmes it rather. For example, God decreed to prolong <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah's</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 King 20. 5.</note> life, &amp;c. and yet the prayer of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> was a subordinate meanes to accomplish the Decree of God, &amp; seruing to that purpose. Take another example, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 31. God had decreed to saue all in the ship, but how? by meanes of the ship, for when the Master and Souldiers would haue fled into the Boat; The Apostle <note place="margin">Act. 27. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> told them, that vnlesse these tarried also, they could not be saued. So to apply this vnto our purpose; God hath decreed to giue such and such blessings, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and graces to his Saints, and yet not to giue them but by the meanes of prayer, &amp;c. So that if we will not vse prayer, we must not looke for any thing to be either granted or obtained.</p>
                  <p>Hauing thus dispatcht these Obiections, come
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18128:94"/>
we to the Reasons, <hi>Why we must pray?</hi> First, <hi>Because it</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Reasons why we must pray. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>is the command of God;</hi> that we <hi>should pray, Psal. 50. 15. Call vpon me in the day of trouble, and I will heare thee, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Luke 22. 46. Why sleepe yee? arise and pray, least yee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 22. 46.</note> 
                     <hi>enter into tentation.</hi> And <hi>Jam. 5. 13. If any man be affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, let him pray, &amp;c.</hi> So that it is a cleare Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 13.</note> of God, that <hi>we must pray.</hi> Now as we make a conscience of any of the Commandements of God. So also we must learne to be conscionable in this. There is no man but will make some conscience of stealing and killing, and why because he knowes God so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him. Now you see it is the Commandement of God to pray, let it then be our care to performe it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; and more then this, it is such a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, as that no man can excuse himselfe, if he neglect it. And therefore (saith <hi>Augustine) Thou needest not giue almes to the needy, because thou hast not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Augustine.</note> 
                     <hi>where with all to relieue them. Thou needest not come into the Congregation because thou art diseased, thou needest not visite the sicke, because thy strength will not beare it;</hi> but there is none so poore, so lame, so needy, so weake in the body, but he must pray; so that if we doe not pray, let vs looke for nothing at the hands of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2 Reason, why we must pray.</note>Secondly, <hi>Because it is the meanes to conuey all the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of God vnto our soules;</hi> for Prayer is the very key whereby we open all the Treasuries and storehouses of Gods power and goodnesse: Christ saith. <hi>Marke</hi> 11. 24. <note place="margin">Marke 11. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>What soeuer yee aske of God in prayer, beleeue, &amp;c.</hi> So 1 <hi>Iohn 5. 14. This is the confidence that we haue in him,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Iohn 5. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>that if we aske any thing according to his will, hee heareth vs.</hi> So that Prayer is a meanes to conueigh all graces and blessings vnto our soules. The woman<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Iohn</hi> 4. 11. saith to <hi>Christ, The Well is deepe, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 4. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>thou hast nothing to draw:</hi> but God be thanked, though the Wel of Gods goodnesse be deep, yet we haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <note place="margin">Deepe well.</note> to draw with: the holy bucket of prayer will
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18128:94"/>
diue into the depthes of God, and fetch vs waters of comfort from them, yea search the very lowest bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of grace that is in God: as diuers of the Fathers <note place="margin">August. Ascendit Precatio, &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendit misericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia. Gregor. Oratio in terra: o pater in Coelo &amp;c. Chrysost. Hom. 53. ad P. idem. <hi>Feeding foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi>
                     </note> well obserue. So that these things are euident induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to euery Christian man to pray. For as, if there were a goodly fountaine, that seeds a whole towne, yet if men haue not vessels and pipes to carry water home vnto their houses, they were neuer the better. So, though there be a Fountaine of goodnesse in God, yet prayer is the meanes to conueigh it vnto vs, and bring it home vnto our soules, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3 Reason, why we should pray. <hi>Psal. 14 4. Isa.</hi> 46. 7. Temple rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Because it is the note of a wicked man not to pray, Psal. 14. 4. Dauid</hi> saith plainely, <hi>They call not vpon the Lord, &amp;c. Isaiah,</hi> 64. 7. Notes, that it was a great signe of the calamity of the Church, when the <hi>Chaldeans had taken away the riches of the Temple,</hi> and the daily sacrifice ceased. Euen so it is a sore signe of Gods displeasure, when the daily sacrifice of prayer ceaseth. It is with a Christian then, as when the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had taken the Temple. For then the Diuell doth dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously possesse the heart of a man, and carries it quite away from God, as a child is carried in ones armes, and <note place="margin">Child weake.</note> layed wheresoeuer the stronger party listeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">4 Reason, why we must pray. <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 2.</note>Fourthly, <hi>Because all our labours and endeuours are but in vaine without Prayer,</hi> as <hi>Iam. 4. 2. Yee fight and warre and get nothing, because yee aske not, &amp;c.</hi> So that all our labour is lost, if we haue not prayer to attend the same. Thus we see <hi>Abrahams</hi> seruant, when he went about a businesse of his Masters, prayed vnto the Lord, <hi>Lord send me good speed, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Isaac</hi> hauing sent his seruant about a wife, he in the euening went out into the field <note place="margin">Gen. 24. 12. and 26.</note> to pray vnto God: as knowing all his labour was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the Lord. Now these goodly examples are for vs to follow; that whensoeuer we stand in need of any blessing, we should powre out our prayers vnto
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18128:95"/>
God. A certaine man, we read, once sowed good seed, <note place="margin">Seed sowne.</note> but neuer could haue any good corne, at last a good neighbour came vnto him, and reasoned what should be the cause, he sowed so good seed, and reaped so bad Corne? why truely said he, I giue the land her due, good tillage, good seed, and all things that be fit: why then (replyed the other) it may be <hi>you doe not steepe your seede:</hi> no truely, said the other, nor neuer heard that seed should be steeped. Yes truely, said the other, but I will tell you how? <hi>It must be steeped in Prayer;</hi> when the party heard this, he thankt him for his good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, put it home to his conscience, reformed his fault, and had as good Corne as any man. Thus haue wee heard of the Commandement to pray; the first maine point in the Preface.</p>
                  <p>New come we to the second maine Branch, which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Direction how to pray.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein, there are two things to be considered.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 Why Christ giues this Direction?</item>
                     <item>2 What the Direction is.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the first, why <hi>Christ</hi> giues a direction, there bee three Reasons of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1 Reason why Christ giues a direction to pray. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1.</note>First, <hi>To helpe the weaknesse of such as cannot pray:</hi>  This reason is touched, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1. where when <hi>Christ</hi> ceased praying, one of the Disciples came vnto him, saying. <hi>Master, teach vs to pray, as</hi> Iohn <hi>also taught his disciples.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Christ</hi> deliuered this forme of prayer to them. So that as I say, It was to helpe the weakenesse of such that are not able to vtter their own thoughts and desires. Therefore <hi>Christ,</hi> as he puts good thoughts in our hearts, by his holy Spirit: so here hee
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18128:95"/>
puts good words into our mouthes; yea the words of prayer. So the Lord, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 3. Hauing exhorted <note place="margin">Hosh. 14 3.</note> the people to repent, puts the very words into their mouthes saying, <hi>Take vnto you words, and turne to the Lord, and say vnto him, Take away all iniquity, and receiue vs graciously, so will we render the calues of our lippes.</hi> In <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 12.

                     <note place="margin">2 Reason why Christ giues a direction to pray.</note>
                     <hi>The second reason why Christ giues a direction to pray,</hi>  was, <hi>To correct a number of errours, and obliquities that be in prayer.</hi> This is the reason that is giuen, both in this place, and chap. 7. where Christ saith, <hi>Be not as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, but after this manner pray yee, &amp;c.</hi> So the Lord prescribeth this forme of prayer, as a correction of the abuses and corruptions which otherwise might creepe <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> into our prayer. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom. 8. 26. For wee know not how to pray as we ought, &amp;c.</hi> For howsoeuer we can speake wisely in the eares of men, yet wee are the veriest fooles in the world when we come to speake vnto God. And so (as I haue said) to helpe the errors and defects of prayer, our Sauiour Christ hath giuen vs a direction how to pray; for as <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, <hi>Hee who hath giuen life, hath also taught vs how to pray.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines <note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> shew, that the inward intent without the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18128:96"/>
is as much as the action it selfe, for though the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be good, yet if the manner be not so also, God will not accept it. <hi>Isai.</hi> 58. 3. The people say, <hi>We haue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 58 3.</note> 
                     <hi>and punished our selues, &amp;c.</hi> but the Lord saith, <hi>Yee fast to strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp;c.</hi> So though that the action be good, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the manner of performing it was not, God did by the Prophet reprehend it. So 1 <hi>Chron. 15. 13. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Chron. 15. 13.</note> action was good, when he sought to bring vp the Arke, but because the manner was not good, because he did not seeke God deuoutly, but put Gods Arke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Cart, whereas it should haue beene carried vpon Priests shoulders, the Lord made a breach amongst them, &amp;c. So that we see in regard of gracious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the manner of the action is as much as the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it selfe. And thus we may not onely pray, but wee must pray, to acceptation, and keepe a due manner in our prayer.</p>

                     <note place="margin">3 Reason why Christ giues a direction 10 pray. 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14</note>The third Reason is, <hi>That we might haue the greater assurance that God will heare vs when we pray, &amp;c.</hi> As  1 <hi>Iohn 5. 14. This is our assurance, that if wee aske any thing according to his will, he heareth vs.</hi> Now no man can doubt, that when we follow Christs direction, wee aske according to Gods will, and so no question but God will heare vs. When the woman of <hi>Tekoah</hi> made <note place="margin">Woman of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koah.</hi>

Is not Christ a counseller in this action?</hi> we may thinke the Lord will the rather entertaine and accept of it. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, <hi>As the Lord our Master hath taught vs:</hi> and of prayer. <hi>It is a friendly, and a familiar</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> 
                     <hi>kind of prayer, to intreat God with his owne words. When a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one prayes, the Lord knowes the words of his Sonne.</hi> So
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18128:96"/>
you see the Reasons, why it pleased Christ to giue a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in prayer: First, to helpe the weaknesse of such as cannot pray: Secondly, to correct a number of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in prayer: Thirdly, that we might haue so much the greater acceptation with God.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>First, There is a Preface, for our <hi>Sauiour Christ</hi> doth not set downe the Petitions abruptly, but he first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with a solemne Preface: and why with a Preface? to shew that there must be a prouision for prayer, a disposition of our selues, and a composing of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Note.</note> before we pray. We may not bluntly rush vpon this holy Duty; but come forward with deuotion, reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting all worldly thoughts, and prepare our selues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we pray, <hi>Psal. 10. 17. Thou preparest their heart,</hi>

                     <hi>heart is prepared.</hi> So that there must be first a Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart: Now there be two Reasons, why we must be prepared in our hearts for prayer.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, In regard of God, <hi>That we may come with holy reuerence before him;</hi> for because it is not a mortall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18128:97"/>
man, or earthly power, that wee haue to deale with in prayer, but a glorious and great God, before whom we ought to tremble, before whom the very Angels stand with an awfull regard and reuerence; at the feete of whose Throne, all Kings of this world cast downe their Crownes; therefore so we must haue the more care, how and in what sort we come before him. If a man were to speake to a mortall King, in a matter of some importance, how would he labour to fit himselfe for it: <note place="margin">Speech to a King.</note> to compose his speech, his gesture, all his actions, that there might be nothing to offend. How much more when we, who be but dust and ashes, wormes meat and rottennesse, come into the presence of Almighty God, ought we to be prepared and labour so to bee compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that nothing offend this great God of ours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, In regard of our selues, <hi>Because wee cannot by and by set vp our affections, and stirre vp our hearts to prayer, as soone as we haue occasion to pray:</hi> as when the Sea is moued and rouzed with the winds, though the wind lye, yet the Sea workes still, a good while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">Seamooued.</note> before it will be calme: And as in the miracle of the Gospel, the windes were laid at the words of <hi>Christ,</hi> which were wont to worke and rage a long while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: So it must be with our thoughts, though we haue layed aside our worldly labour, earthly desires, lusts, and such like; yet some waues are working still, some thoughts, cares, and cogitations are about vs, till wee prepare our selues otherwise. So that there must be a a settling of our affections to prayer before hand. These be the reasons why it pleased our Lord to vse a Preface to this prayer, to teach vs how to prepare our selues to pray, before we set about it. For, as in a Clocke, though <note place="margin">A Clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18128:97"/>
wheele of Prayer. Thus our heart being settled and prepared to pray, it carries all the rest of the thoughts with it.</p>

                     <hi>they call on him in whom they haue not beleeued?</hi> Now by the Rules of Christian faith, we are bound to beleeue in none but in God onely, &amp; so our prayers to be directed onely vnto him. Of which there be two Reasons, why the Lord will haue prayers directed onely to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1 Reason why Prayer must be directed to God onely. </note>First, <hi>That a man might haue an immediate dependance vpon God, and not depend vpon any creature:</hi> or any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">
                        <hi>August. lib. de vera Religione. cap.</hi> 55.</note> of Angels, but vpon God onely: being carried by immediate relation vnto God, as our Sauiour teaches. So Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> shewes: <hi>There is no intermediate nature betwixt God and man:</hi> and so concludes, that we haue but one God Almighty to pray to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2 Reason why Prayer must be to God onely.</note>Secondly, GOD would haue all prayer directed  vnto him, <hi>That hee onely might bee knowne to bee the fountaine of goodnesse, and the spring of all good things.</hi> For, howsoeuer by his seruants and other meanes, other blessings and benefits are conueyed vnto vs,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18128:98"/>
vs, yet in prayer, the Lord will haue vs goe vnto him, as acknowledging him to be the Fountaine, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other meanes to issue from him. For howsoeuer the Lord affoord meanes, which must be vsed, yet must God blesse the worke, or it will turne to nothing. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. I haue planted. Apollo watered, but</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>God must giue the increase.</hi> Very Philosophers can say, <hi>Secunda causa non operatur nisi in virtute primae.</hi> Second causes worke not but by vertue of the first moouer, as wee see in a Clocke; if a man will watch the first moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">A Clocke.</note> and bring it into order, there is no doing with the Leades, or lesser wheeles, but he must goe vnto the great wheele, to deale with it to order all the rest. So, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God is the great Wheele of this world, vpon whose motion, all others doe depend, sensible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible, earthly, and heauenly; <hi>If in our first labour wee make our stay vpon God, there will quickely be a stay in any of the creatures that be out of order.</hi> And so because all efficacy and workings in all effects, is from the Lord, and all instruments and meanes can worke no further then it shall please him to worke by them: our Sauiour would haue vs likewise to goe onely vnto the Lord himselfe, who is the principall agent and workeman for our good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Use. </seg>
                     </label> Now if all prayer, by the rule of Christ, be to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected  vnto God alone. Then it is vtterly vnlawfull to pray to Saints, Angels, or any other Creature, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp;c. but to God onely. Yet here the Papists confute themselues, saying: In effect they come before God, for all the meanes as they vse (as they say) doe depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the name of all the rest, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes <note place="margin">1 Lib. de Inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Sanctorum. 1. 20.</note> to cleare this: That they doe neither pray to Angels, or Saints for any thing, as the giuers and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of any thing, but that they should pray for vs. But we see the words of Christ are directly against it, for he sayes plainly, when ye pray, pray in this manner:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18128:98"/>
                     <hi>Sic Orate, &amp;c.</hi> so pray, &amp;c. not in the Popish manner: thus Christ, not onely prescribes a rule, but also sets downe a speciall direction vnto whom we must pray, as well as in what order, and with what affection. And <note place="margin">August. lib. 114. Enchirid. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictus, &amp;c. Chrysost. Hom. 9. Quand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The second thing is, <hi>With what affection we must pray:</hi> which may be seene by the two attributes giuen to God. First, that he is here called <hi>Our Father.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he is said to be <hi>In heauen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, in that he is called <hi>(Our Father)</hi> this may teach vs two things. First, <hi>That we must pray in faith,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Affection, wee must pray in.</note> that is, with an assured trust and confidence, that wee shall be heard; for if God be our Father, we need neuer doubt, but we shall finde louing and fatherly affection in him, for there is no father so ready to heare the requests of his children, as the Lord is to heare vs in all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. So he sayes, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. vlt.</hi> I will not onely (saith <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. vlt.</note> God) take the title vpon me, and appellation of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but I will be a Father, you shall find in me all the affections of a Father, yea, and that more plentifully, then any father can haue. As the Lord will heare vs, so vpon this ground, we must pray vnto him in faith, that is, with a full assurance that we shal be heard when we pray. Thus we haue it, <hi>Iam. 1. 6. If any man aske in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 6. Marke 11. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>faith, he shall receiue.</hi> And Christ himselfe saith, <hi>Marke 11. 24. Whatsoeuer ye aske in prayer, beleeue, and yee shall obtaine it.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>voluntatem nostram, &amp;c.</hi> God doth not alwayes heare according to our will, but in that he knowes to be best and meetest for vs. As when a Chirurgion layes a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasiue. <note place="margin">A Corrasiue.</note> or a burning Iron to a soare, the Patient feeling it to smart, cryes out, and would haue it remoued, the Chirurgion heares him, but lets it tarry, and the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lye still. <hi>He heares him to his health and recouery.</hi> So saith another, <hi>Mothers rubbe their children there for their</hi>

                     <hi>health, although they rore and cry againe:</hi> yet for all that they do: not spare them: and why? it is for their health, &amp;c. So must we thinke and conceiue, that when God doth not heare or grant our requests, <hi>he heares so farre as it is for our good,</hi> though he doe not heare vs to our wils. <hi>For it is a dangerous thing to bee heard accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our desire.</hi> Because thus Christ heard the Diuell, when he suffered him to enter into the heard of swine, or we may say thus: <hi>This is not the greatest mercy to be heard according to our will, but this, to be heard for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, when God giues vs that onely which is best for vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2 Affection we must pray in.</note>Secondly, <hi>That we must pray in loue.</hi> For Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing  vs to say <hi>(Our Father)</hi> would teach vs loue and charity; that is, not onely to pray for our selues, but also in the behalfe of our brethren; for this is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requisite in our prayers, to take in the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body of Christ, that euery one may haue a part in our prayer. So holy men of God haue done before vs, <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Pray for the peace of Ierusalem,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 122. 6.</note>

some goe for one thing, and some for another, some goe to one place, and some to another; and yet all tends to the good of the Countrey. So it is in the prayers of the Saints, some pray for one thing, some for another, some for grace, some for remission of sinnes, some for peace of conscience, some for temporall blessings, and yet all in the end for the good of the Church.</p>
                  <p>I should now come to speake of the Duties of them that pray: but first I must a little enlarge my selfe in the former of Faith and Loue, which should haue beene touched before.</p>
                  <p>Faith, being a maine pillar and foundation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <note place="margin">Two grounds of Faith.</note> this building of prayer consists, yea, such a one as I may truely affirme, <hi>Sine qua non:</hi> Ere I goe further I will shew two grounds of Faith.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 A perswasion of the power of God that he can.</item>
                     <item>2 A perswasion of Gods willingnesse, that hee will helpe vs.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For if we doubt, either of his power, that he cannot, or his will that he will not helpe vs, though he be able, We can neuer pray in Faith; that is, with vndoubted assurance that God will heare vs. And because the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, of the will of God, for not many (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongst Christians) I suppose, doubt of the power of God. <hi>Christ</hi> first resolues and settles vs in that point, and shewes that God is <hi>(Our Father,)</hi> and because he is our Father, we shall be sure to find a most fatherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in him, that no father shall be so ready to heare the requests of his children, as the Lord will be to heare vs in all things we pray for. So that this is one ground of our Faith not to thinke we come vnto God as vnto a stranger that doth not respect or regard vs in our needs; but we come to him as to a Father and one
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18128:100"/>
that doth loue vs, tenders vs, and will be as ready to releeue vs, as the dearest friend we haue in this world. So <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Psal 103. 13. As a father pittieth his</hi>

I will goe to my Father, &amp;c.</hi> Howsoeuer I haue been a bad and a lewd child, yet I thanke God I haue a good Father to goe to. This now is our very case: Alas wee haue runne away from God, as farre as euer did the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall sonne from his father; we haue spent all, we haue nothing left by our bad husbandry: onely wee haue this hope and comfort remaining, that still we haue a good Father to goe to: God is our Father, who will heare vs, receiue vs, releeue vs, and this (as I said) is the ground of a Christian man, that he may pray in faith: which thing holy men, in their prayers haue much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. <hi>Isa. 63. 16. Though Abraham be ignorant of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 63. 16. <hi>and</hi> chap. 64. 8.</note>

But now, O Lord, thou art our Father, wee are clay, &amp;c. worke of thy hands.</hi> Yea, our <hi>Sauiour Christ</hi> himselfe, in this very Preface of Prayer, argues from the very dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and nature of an earthly Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 9. <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>For what man is there, if his sonne aske bread, will hee giue him a stone, &amp;c.</hi> from whence his inference is: <hi>If yee then, being euill, can giue good things to your children who aske, &amp;c. how much more will your Father which is in Heauen, giue his holy Spirit vnto those who aske it.</hi> So that this needs must be a goodly comfort vnto a poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to consider of, because it is our Father, not a stranger, our good Father, our louing and compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Father that deales with vs, so that wee shall easily find him inclined to goodnesse and mercy towards vs. Many places of Scripture doe inlarge this, and all to strengthen our faith, and make vs come the readier vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <hi>should for sake me, yet the Lord will gather me vp, &amp;c. Isa.</hi>

Alas, they that be not thus perswaded, that God hath such a heart, bosome, and bowels of loue open vnto vs, that he hath a fatherly care and compassion towards vs; he, I say, that hath not this sweet and comfortable apprehension of God, that knowes not God to be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him, must needes make faint and cold prayers vnto God. But whosoeuer shall be perswaded in his soule, that the Lord is become a Father vnto him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth of him as his son, what is it, but that such a man may hope for at the hands of God, which (as I said) is the first ground of our Faith; <hi>viz. A perswasion that God will heare vs when we pray vnto him.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2 Ground of Faith.</note>The other ground of Faith is, <hi>A perswasion of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God:</hi> for if he be willing to helpe, and yet not able, as wanting power, what are wee the better? but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine euen weake people; such as <hi>Isaiah</hi> speakes of, <hi>Chap. 3. 7. In that day he shal sweare, saying, I cannot be an</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 3. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>helper, for there is no bread in mine house:</hi> And it makes vs vncomfortable in that we goe about; but <hi>Christ</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that all power abideth in God, and all things are subiect vnto him, whether in Heauen or in Earth, or vnder the Earth; yea, he rules and gouernes all, and is able to supply whatsoeuer man stands in need of. As may be seene, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. throughout: and <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 3. <note place="margin">Psal. 50. Psal. 115. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>But our God is in heauen, he doth whatsoeuer he will:</hi> and <hi>Deut. 33. 26. There is none like God, O righteous people,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 33. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>which rideth vpon the Heauens for thy helpe, and on the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18128:101"/>
Cloudes in his glory, &amp;c.</hi> So that in truth all that he doth, is to shew forth his goodnesse and power in helping vs. Of which he hath giuen sufficient testimony in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that he both can and will supply our wants in whatsoeuer we stand in need of. Indeed earthly fathers they may be willing to helpe their children, but they are not alwayes able, as we may read, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 14. <note place="margin">2 King. 9. 14.</note> When the little child cryed out to his father, <hi>My head, my head;</hi> he could doe no more then command one to carry him vnto his mother, and so the child died: but the Prophet came, and by the power of God resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him. So in all things else the power of God, as it is manifest in things aboue our reach, so it is extended euen in this world, when it pleaseth him to fulfill all things that men can desire. And therefore wee see the <hi>leper</hi> cryed out, <hi>Matth. 8. 2. Master if thou wilt, thou</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 8. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>canst make me cleane.</hi> So <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 8. attributeth all <note place="margin">Psal. 8.</note> things to the power of God. Yea, <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth this in his prayer, when he saith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 36. <note place="margin">Matth. 14. 36.</note> Father, <hi>Omnia tibi possibilia,</hi> all things are possible to thee. So that these be the two pillars of faith, to aide and giue wings to our prayers. A perswasion both of the will and power of God to helpe vs: thus haue we done with that first affection we must pray with; <hi>in Faith,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second affection we must pray withall, is loue; for Christ teaches vs to say <hi>(Our Father)</hi> and not my Father, <hi>(Giue vs)</hi> not me; teaching thereby that wee must not pray for our selues onely, but for others also. We must take in the whole body of Saints, all that loue God: all that thinke God their Father, yea, all the world that are the children of God. So <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 122. 6. Iam. 5. 6.</note> 122. 6. saith, <hi>Pray for the peace of Ierusalem:</hi> and <hi>Jam. 5. 6, Pray one for another, &amp;c.</hi> So that Christians must not onely pray in faith, but in loue, and that for the communion of the whole body of Christ, whereof he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18128:101"/>
himselfe is a member: for as the sicke man in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <note place="margin">Sicke man. <hi>Marke</hi> 2. 3.</note> when he could not come vnto Christ <hi>(Marke</hi> 2. 3.) vpon his owne legges, though his faith was great, and that hee beleeued Christ could heale him; was borne vpon the shoulders of foure men, who let him downe at the house top, and brought him to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christ: So must we doe by our brethren, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they can pray in faith themselues, yet must wee pray in loue for them. If this course were kept amongst vs, that we did thus pray one for another; O what a comfort would this be to afflicted and distressed soules, to think that whensoeuer they went about to pray vnto GOD, there were many thousand hands and hearts lifted vp to God in their behalfe. I am perswaded it would much animate euery Christian to goe forward in this Christian duty; thus you may see, how efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous this affection of loue is, but hereby is not meant euery sudden wish for the good of some particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or priuate respect of friends, riuals, allyes, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or such like, wherein we may exercise our selues; but the generall care of the Church of God, and loue to our brethren, as hauing feeling of our fellow members.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3 Affection to pray with.</note>The third affection that we must pray with, is <hi>(feare)</hi>  and that for especiall reasons. First, <hi>Because it is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that we haue to deale with.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Because hee is in Heauen, the place vnto which all Maiestie, reuerence and glory is due.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we know that all reuerence is due to our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fathers, yea when they are sharpest vnto vs, as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 9.</note> 12. 9. <hi>We haue had the fathers of our bodies which corrected vs, and we gaue them reuerence, &amp;c.</hi> So then if our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fathers must haue reuerence, much more our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father; most highly aduanced in dignity and power aboue this world. Wherefore this is a caution for vs, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 1. To take heed what we vtter before God, <note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 1.</note> For <hi>He</hi> is in the Heauens. And in another place: <hi>Wee
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18128:102"/>
must looke to our feet when we enter into Gods house.</hi> For God is not onely a Father, but such a Father that wee haue to deale withall in Prayer: one so eminent and so high lifted vp, that he is as high as heauen, therefore we must labour as much as may be, to be abashed and fall downe before him. So <hi>Abraham, Gen. 18. 2. Bowed</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 2. Gen. 32. 10. Rudinius in Gen. 24. Rebekah.</note> 
                     <hi>himselfe to the ground.</hi> So <hi>Jacob</hi> humbled himselfe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. To this purpose, <hi>Rudinius</hi> in his History vpon <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. saith thus. If <hi>Rebekah</hi> rode vpon the Camels amongst the seruants, but when she came into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of <hi>Isaac</hi> shee lighted downe from the Camels; So must we doe, howsoeuer in the world we beare vp our heads aboue our brethren, and are bold and carelesse when we are to deale with men; yet when wee once come into the Lords presence, and are to deale with the Lord of heauen and of earth, wee must all come downe from our Camels, be as humble, lowly, and base in our owne eyes as possible we may. If a man would conueigh water from a Fountaine, if hee lay his Leades <note place="margin">Water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed.</note> too high; that is, be not deiected in spirit, stoope in humility be not low in the Lords sight, he shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated of all the blessings and comforts that he lookes for, so that it must be our care to come into the Lords presence, with all reuerence, Feare, and Humiliation.</p>
                  <p>But here the Papists doe so dazzle mens eyes with the greatnesse of God, that they run beyond the marke. On the other side, saying, that sinfull men must not bee so bold to approach and come to Gods presence, but they must send a farre off, and send in others to bee su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and mediators for them. But our Sauiour Christ shewes vs, that all this high Maiestie of God, must not driue, or chase vs from his presence, but it must onely qualifie vs in our comming vnto God, that we doe not rudely and bluntly rush in before him, but that we come humbly and submissiuely into the Lords presence, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting and casting downe our selues, as before a power
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18128:102"/>
greater then all the power of this world. It is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction that one hath of two sorts of Humility: <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militas Immediata, &amp; Humilitas Accepta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was a kind of Humility in <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> when hee refused <hi>Christs</hi> offer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 14. saying, <hi>I haue neede</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 3. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>to be baptized of thee, and commest thou to me?</hi> but <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas accepta,</hi> was in <hi>Christs</hi> acceptation, that hee would haue it so: and answered him accordingly. So it was humility in <hi>Peter, Iohn 13. 8. When he said, thou shalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 13. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>wash my feete:</hi> but <hi>Humilitas accepta,</hi> when <hi>Christ</hi> was content to doe it. So in this case it is a kinde of Humility, when we can say, O I am a sinfull man, I dare not be so bold with such a power; but <hi>Accepta Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi> tels vs, we must doe it, we must come at the Lords bidding, at his commandement. So that this glory of the Lord, must not driue vs from him, but wee must come of our selues, and to him alone, and that with feare and reuerence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">4 Affection of Prayer.</note>The fourth affection that must be vsed in prayer, is,  <hi>That we must come with eleuation of our hearts and mindes as high as Heauen.</hi> For seeing God is in Heauen, our affections must neuer stay till they come as high as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, where God is. And so oft as we pray, so oft in our thoughts, and in our minds, we must rise higher then the cloudes, aboue Sunne and Moone, and all the Stars. <hi>Elias</hi> his story shewes, that hee was carryed in a fiery <note place="margin">Elias.</note> Chariot into Heauen, euen so must we by prayer bee transported out of this world, to be present with God in the highest heauens. It was a signe betwixt <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> when he shot his Arrowes, that if any of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ionathans</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.</note> them fell short, there was no danger in it, &amp;c. So it is not with our affections, if they be short, and not eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and carried vp as high as Heauen, there is great hazzard and danger, that the Lord will not accept, nor regard them. Thus haue we seene, with what affection
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18128:103"/>
we must pray. In Faith, in Loue, with Reuerence, with Eleuation.</p>
                  <p>Yet ere we come to the <hi>Petitions,</hi> wee must consider certaine <hi>duties</hi> of them that pray.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1 Dutie of them that pray.</note>
                     <hi>First, We must labour for the grace of adoption.</hi> For how  ccn we truly call God Father, if we be not his children? Alas, what doe we otherwise, but so oft as we pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, so oft continually we doe lye in the eares of God. It is like the aggrauation of <hi>Ananias</hi> his sinne, <hi>Act. 5. 4. Thou hast not lyed vnto man, but vnto God.</hi> So if <note place="margin">Acts 5. 4.</note> we come vnto God in prayer, &amp; call him father, and yet be not his children, the very same may be said of vs, &amp;c. Then you see now, what great cause there is, that euery man should labour for this grace of Adoption in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, to repent his finnes, to lay hold vpon the promises of the Gospell, to be renued by the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> that we may truely call God Father, because now wee haue his true word, if we be his children, he is our Father: yea, we may the bolder goe vnto God, and challenge him of his promise, according to that comfort in <hi>Hosea,</hi> after so many threatnings, <hi>chap. 1. 10. Yee are the sonnes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 1. 10.</note>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2 Duty.</note>The second Duty is, <hi>That we must labour to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the fatherly care and loue of God towards vs;</hi> that we haue a Father in Heauen, one that doth respect and regard vs. And so whatsoeuer our estate is in this world; though neuer so poore and meane, yet to thanke God, that we haue our honour with the Lord, we may come as boldly into the presence of God as the greatest <hi>King, Prince,</hi> or <hi>Monarch</hi> of the world, as <hi>Malac.</hi> 2. 10. <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 10. 1 Iohn 3. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Haue we not all one Father?</hi> and 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 1. Behold what loue the Father hath shewed on vs, that we should be called the sons of God?</hi> so that as I say, it is our honor, comfort, and happinesse, that what estate soeuer we be of in this world, yet we know, that he who is the Father of <hi>Kings,</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:18128:103"/>
is our gracious and good Father, by the meanes and merits of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3 Duty.</note>The third Duty is, that seeing God is our Father,  <hi>Wee endeuour to walke worthy of such a father;</hi> that wee doe not dishonor, and disgrace him by our sins, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <note place="margin">1 Pet 1. 17.</note> 17. <hi>And if you call him Father, passe the time of your pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage in feare.</hi> Thus if we proclaime God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then our care must be to walke worthy of him; It is the blame that God layes vpon the <hi>Iewes, Ierem.</hi> 3. 5. <note place="margin">Ierem. 3. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou hast said thou art my Father, and yet thou doest euill more and more, &amp;c.</hi> So when men will call vpon God as a Father, and yet haue no care to please and obey him, to doe his will and honour him with a true heart; O how shall this one day light heauy vpon their hearts, howsoeuer we doe not feele, or regard it in this world. Thus then, if wo call God Father truely, carry in our hearts a setled purpose, neuer to offend him, howsoeuer our owne weaknesses and frailties put vs by; yet the end of our life must be that we walke worthy of such a father, that is, striue with flesh and blood, as farre as possibly we can, to liue in holinesse and righteousnesse, to come to repentance and compunction of spirit, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day to renue our Couenant, for the amendment of our sinfull liues.</p>

                     <p>First, then we pray for the glory of God in it selfe that the Lord may haue a holy Name amongst vs. The Name of God is most holy in it selfe, <hi>But we pray that it may be holy vnto vs,</hi> that we may giue the Lord glory and honour, which is his due, as God is a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <note place="margin">Meaning</note> and most high power of himselfe: so we pray that he be so taken and acknowledged, all the world ouer; that the whole world may be ready to stoope and yeeld to the excellent and eminent power that is in God. This I take briefly to be the sense and meaning of this Petition <hi>(Hallowed be thy Name,)</hi> that is, Lord that thy Name may be holy in the hearts and mouthes of all men. In the Petition, we are to consider three things.</p>

For wee see we are here taught to begin all our prayers with the desire of this, before we pray for daily bread, yea, any thing else belonging to our selues: Yea, (as one saith) <hi>Before the Kingdome of God, we pray for the glory of God:</hi> to shew that if we could redeeme the glory of <hi>God</hi> with losse, I say, not of our owne liues onely, but our owne soules, we must bee contented: <hi>I could wish my selfe to be separated from Christ for my Brethren, &amp;c.</hi> as if hee <note place="margin">Rom 9. 3.</note> should say, if <hi>God</hi> may haue any glory by it, then I could be contented to redeeme his glory with my life, nay, lose my part of eternall happinesse: as <hi>Moses</hi> wisht, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>God</hi> should be dishonoured, to be blotted out of his Booke. <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 32.</note>

sent him a rayling letter, he went and opened it before the Lord, as that which more touched him, when the Lord was dishonoured, then when his kingdome and life was threatned. So <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe that patiently heard all the rest of the Diuels temptations, yet when he came to take the honour from the Lord: then <hi>Christ</hi> begins to rouze vp himselfe, and chide him. <hi>Auoyd Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>

                        <hi>It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue;</hi> Thus euen against the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest, we must stand out for the glory of <hi>God.</hi> How la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable a thing then is it for wicked men, who can let the glory of <hi>God</hi> be troden vnder foot, and suffer him to be despised, dishonoured and blasphemed from day to day and yet let it passe as a thing of nothing: O how shall we be able to answer this another day! or giue an account for it, when <hi>God</hi> shall come to iudge vs for our sinnes? We see in the whole course of Scripture, <hi>God</hi> is alwayes more ready to stirre in our cause, when the matter concernes vs, then when it concernes himselfe. So dealt hee by <hi>Caine:</hi> The Lord let him goe for the <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 7.</note> wrong he had done to himselfe, for his bad sacrifice, for his hypocriticall worship; but when he began to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne his Brother, then said <hi>God</hi> vnto him: What hast thou done? <hi>The voyce of thy Brothers bloud cryeth vnto me from the ground.</hi> So dealt the Lord by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> hee <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 7.</note> was contented to put vp all the iniuries against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; his Idolatry, his blasphemy, and such like: But when he began to stirre once against the Church, and the Lords people, then the Lord opposed him, and when he would not desist from his cruelty at the last, he drowned him and all his hoste in the Red Sea. Now if the Lord be thus ready to shew himselfe, and stirre in our cause, then ought we to be much more ready, and rouze vp our selues to stirre in his, against all oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatsoeuer. <note place="margin">2 The discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second thing considerable in this Petition, is,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18128:107"/>
                        <hi>The discouering of our corruption in it:</hi> that is, a neglect of Gods Name, and an immoderate care of our owne: for when wee pray, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name;</hi> there is a secret opposition betweene our name, and the Name of <hi>God:</hi> we be all too carefull of our owne name, to deriue the credit and glory of things to our selues: but Lord teach vs to glorifie thy Name aboue all, and before all. <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 4. Wee reade that the people built a Tower <note place="margin">Gen. 11. 4.</note> whose top might reach to Heauen, and all to purchase to themselues a Name, but not at all to get any Name vnto the Lord, or inlarge his glory: but for the increase of their owne. This did <hi>Nabuchadnezar</hi> in his pride <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 30.</note> aspire to: <hi>Is not this great Babylon which I haue built for the house of my Kingdome, and for the honour of my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie.</hi> So that I say, this is our owne corruption that we so neglect the Name of God in his glory, being so carefull of our owne. Thus the Lord complaines of his people, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 3. That they built houses for themselues, <note place="margin">Hagg. 1. 3.</note> went into the woods, fetcht home timber, squared it and carued it, to make houses for themselues, but left the house of God vnbuilt. So it is with vs in this case, we can build vp our owne names, doe any thing to grace and honour our selues, but not one amongst thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, thinks of aduancing of the Name of God: thus doe we all leane too much to the corruption of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but oh! why doe not the thoughts of <hi>Dauid</hi> come into our mindes. <hi>See now I dwell in a house of Cedar, but</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>the Arke of God dwelleth within Curtaines.</hi> So say thou, I that am but a worme, dust and rottennesse, I that am but a bulrush, in regard of the Lord God, I haue my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the world, I am esteemed and regarded as if some body; But what care haue I of <hi>God?</hi> must <hi>God</hi> glorifie himselfe, or not haue glory? He that is so glorious, and affordeth all the blessings we inioy, shall not he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded? He that is the Fountaine and Store-house of all things, the glory and beauty of vs all, should not his euer-glorious Name be praised and glorified? Thus
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18128:107"/>
we should learne to take notice of this corruption in our selues.</p>
                     <p>The third thing to be obserued in this Petition, is, <hi>The graces that we pray for.</hi> 
                        <list>
                           <item>1 That we may glorifie the Name of God.</item>
                           <item>2 That others may doe it.</item>
                           <item>3 That though both should faile, that yet the Lord would maintaine his owne glory.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the first, we pray here that we may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie <note place="margin">1 Grace we pray for.</note> the Name of <hi>God,</hi> any way whatsoeuer, that hee may haue some glory by vs: which must bee three wayes. <list>
                           <item>1 In our hearts.</item>
                           <item>2 With our mouthes.</item>
                           <item>3 In our liues.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the former of these: see 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. saith hee, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>But sanctifie the Lord in your hearts:</hi> for the second, we haue <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 6. where the Apostle exhorts them with <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>one mind and one mouth to praise God:</hi> for the other: see 1 <hi>Cor. 6. vlt.</hi> saith hee, For yee are bought with a price, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. vlt.</note> therefore glorifie <hi>God</hi> in your body, and in your spirit which are <hi>Gods.</hi> First, <hi>Wee must inwardly acknowledge</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 In our hearts.</note> 
                        <hi>that all things come from God;</hi> That we neither haue, or can receiue any thing but at the hands of <hi>God:</hi> wee must therefore loue and feare <hi>Him,</hi> trust in <hi>Him,</hi> praise <hi>Him,</hi> and submit our wils to his will: and thus we pray that we may glorifie <hi>God</hi> in our hearts, when we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge all the power in the world to be nothing to his: all the wisedome and loue in the world to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his wisedome and loue: when we doe labour aboue all things to keepe the Lord to be our friend, not regarding whosoeuer be displeased with vs, whosoeuer be against vs, whosoeuer rageth and stormeth, when we see God accepteth of our zeale and Piety towards him;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18128:108"/>
which if we pray for truely, then are we sure to glorifie God in our hearts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>We glorifie God with our mouthes,</hi> both by <note place="margin">2 With our mouthes.</note> speaking reuerently of the Name of God, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the Lords wisedome, goodnesse and Iustice in all his workes: for although the <hi>Shepheards</hi> were abashed to find <hi>Christ</hi> in a manger, the King of Kings in so poore <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 20. Shepheards.</note> an estate, yet they returned to their Flockes and Folds, and praysed God. So must we doe, whensoeuer wee haue heard of Gods goodnesse, or tasted of his mercy, we must returne home to our houses, (as the shepheards did to the fields) acknowledging the Lords kindnesse and mercy in it. Yea, what euer chance, though it bee losse and correction, yet wee must say as <hi>Job</hi> did in the midst of his troubles: <hi>The Lord hath giuen, and the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iob 1. vlt.</note> 
                        <hi>Lord hath taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> So then this is that we pray for, that of all other things we may giue glory vnto God: according to that admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Angell, <hi>Reuel. 14. 7. Feare God, and giue glory</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Reuel. 14. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>to him; for the houre of his Iudgement is come, and worship him.</hi> And againe, <hi>Reuel. 19. 7. Let vs be glad and reioyce,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Reuel. 19. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>and giue glory to him for the marriage of the Lambe is come.</hi> So that whatsoeuer is laid vpon vs, what change of estate soeuer the Lord sends, we must giue the glory to God, and confesse with our mouthes, that he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all honour.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>We must glorifie God in our liues,</hi> that we may so liue, as the Lord may haue glory and honour by vs, <note place="margin">3 In our liues.</note> and no disgrace, for our good life is an honour to the Lord, as <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe saith, <hi>Math. 5. 16. Let your</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes and glorifie your Father which is in heauen, &amp;c.</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. the Apostle saith, <hi>And haue your conuersation ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest among the Gentiles, that they which speake euill of you, as of euill doers, may by your good workes, which they shall
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18128:108"/>
see, glorifie God.</hi> So must we pray, that we doe not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the Lord by our sinnes, but liue so as the Lord may be honoured by vs. It is for this purpose a good meditation which one of the Fathers hath: <q>
                           <hi>God</hi> (saith he) <hi>thus speaks vnto a sinner: O man, if thou hast no care of thine own credit &amp; safety, yet haue a care of mine, Thinke man that I am dishonoured by thy sinne, for if any disgrace or shame thereby rest vpon thy selfe, much more vpon me whom thou oughtest to regard: but if thou couldest so put it ouer with iollity and carelesnesse, yet is God disgraced by it, therfore O man, thogh thou neglect thy selfe, tender my glory, deface not my honour.</hi>
                        </q> Thus it is cleere, as our good life honours God: so our ill life dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours him: as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 24. saith the Apostle. <hi>For the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Name of God is blaspemed amongst the Gentiles through you.</hi> O then! let vs all take heed of this, that we tender the glory of God: let vs pray, that wee may so liue in this world, conuerse here amongst men, that the Lord may be honoured by vs, and not dishonoured by our grosse and presumptuous sinnes.</p>
                     <p>For our helpe herein, <hi>There be three things which may</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3 Things to quicken our care of Gods glory. 1 <hi>Psal. 19. 1. Reuel.</hi> 5. 13. and 14.</note> 
                        <hi>quicken vs to this duty and care.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, to consider, <hi>That all the creatures doe glorifie God in their kinde:</hi> as the Psalmist speakes. <hi>The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens declare the glory of God, &amp;c.</hi> So in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> it is written of all Creatures; <hi>That all they which are in heauen, and in earth, &amp;c. And the foure beasts said A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, when glory was giuen to the Lord.</hi> Therefore now seeing that all Creatures not onely most noble, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Spirits, but the very lowest and meanest, yea, the insensible Creatures giue glory to God in their kind: oh how great shall our sinnes be, and how much our wickednesse aggrauated, if we doe not care to bring glory vnto him. O with what gladnesse should wee perswade one another to this dutie, that seeing there is no creature, but in his kinde, doth in some measure set
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18128:109"/>
out the glory of God, how often should man much more meditate then and practise the same?</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, to consider, <hi>That if we glorifie God, he will glorifie vs:</hi> we cannot be so ready to set out the Lords  Name and praises, but he is more quicke to requite and exalt vs: as it is written, 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 30. For them</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>that honour me, I will honour, &amp;c. They who despise me shal be despised.</hi> Vnto which we may vse the words of our Sauiour, in that solemne prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17. 4, 5. where he <note place="margin">Iohn 17. 4, 5.</note> thus (amongst other arguments) prayes for glory. <hi>I haue glorified thee on earth, I haue finished the worke which thou gauest me to doe: and now glorifie thou me, O Father with thine owne selfe: with the glory that I had with thee before the world was.</hi> So that when we haue glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied God in the time of this life, then may we assuredly expect that the Lord will glorifie vs at the day of death: but if wee haue no care to glorifie him in this world: how can we be perswaded that he will glorifie vs, after our departure hence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, to consider, <hi>That God will seuerely punish the contempt of his glory:</hi> for there is nothing in this world  that he doth more tender then his glory. For which he commanded his people thus: <hi>Thou shalt not giue my glory to another.</hi> Yea see for neglect of this duty, how seuerely he punished his people, whose carkasses all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the wildernesse: because they did not ascribe and giue glory to the Lord. Yea, the hand of God fel vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> because they failed in this duty: <hi>Because</hi> (said hee) <hi>you did not sanctifie me in the eyes of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Num. 20. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>the children of Israel, you shall not bring this Congregation into the land that I haue giuen them.</hi> Thus if God will so seuerely punish the neglect of his glory in his own deare children and seruants, how shal they escape that are not so deare vnto him, and yet are much more faulty in the same kinde.</p>

                        <hi>In this Petition also we may obserue three things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, when we pray that the Kingdome of God may <note place="margin">1 Sense of the Petition.</note> come; <hi>It is in opposition to another Kingdome that is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the world:</hi> for the sinnes of men: The kingdome of darknesse, and of the Diuell, which is a great and mighty kingdome, and hath a number of proppes and pillars to vphold it: as for the Kingdome of Christ there be a very small company to vphold it: but the kingdome of darknesse hath a number of great ones to sustaine it, whole swarmes of people in euery corner, one would wonder at the multitude, and at their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. For howsoeuer men will say, I defie the diuell, and (according to the custome) spit at him, yet as long as they doe the will of the Diuell, practising workes of darkenesse, there is no hope that by their indeuours they can aduance the Kingdome of God; or labour that it should come vpon them. Doth not either ignorance or blindnesse eate vp their soules so that they bee either lyars, swearers adulterers, fornicators, couetous, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, contentious, &amp;c. wherein so long as they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, they be the very proppes and pillars to vphold and shouldor vp the kingdome of darkenesse and the Diuell. Thus it appeares the Diuell is a great Monarch, because the greatest part of the subiects in all Kingdomes serue him, be obedient to him, and disobedient vnto God: they runne, as the Apostle speakes, <hi>Ephes. 2. 2. After</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ephes, 2. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>the Prince that ruleth in the ayrel, euen the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.</hi> So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 4. It is <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> said, <hi>That the God of this world hath blinded their mindes, &amp;c.</hi> For as God spake the word and it was done, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Let there be light; and there was light:</hi> So the Diuell <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 15. Light.</note> cannot so soone speake the word, but by and by it is done, by worldly men. He can no sooner say, let there bee an oath, lye, bribe, quarrell, fashion, or wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but by and by some one or other puts it in practise.</p>

Thus he rules like a God in this world, a great pitty it is, that men should so be deceiued, for God will pull downe the Kingdome of darkenesse, and set vp the Kingdome of his deare sonne. Yea, this kingdome must first be pulled downe, ere the other be erected. For as in laying a foundation, when one would build a new house, he first puls downe the ruines of the old, so must <note place="margin">House.</note> he first pull downe this kingdome of the Diuell, ere that other of Christ be set vp. Wherefore heere wee pray against this kingdome of darkenesse that God would destroy it, for which at this day, there is great need we should so pray, because the Kingdome of the Diuell is like a Sea, which as Philosophers say, gets in <note place="margin">Sea-gaining.</note> one place, if it lose in another: So is it with it, looke how much it hath lost by a defection and reuolt from Popery, so much hath it (in a manner) got by the filthy sinne of Drunkennesse, Irreligion, Pride, Contentions, and other foule sinnes of this land, what need haue wee then to pray, that God would pull downe this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the diuell, and euery where set vp that of <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>In that we pray for the Kingdome of God to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Thing obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> 
                        <hi>come: It sheweth, that there are a number of impediments and lets to hinder this Kingdome from comming.</hi> Which are of two sorts.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 Many impediments in others.</item>
                        <item>2 Too many in our selues.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Concerning others, we see daily, how men are drawne <note place="margin">1 For others.</note> by example, by ill counsell, by diuers discouragements, whereby they are affrighted from seeking the peace of the Gospell: as <hi>Matth,</hi> 20. 31. when the blind men <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 31.</note> cryed out on <hi>Christ,</hi> the multitude rebuked them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they should hold their peace, so it is with vs in this world, how are we scoft and derided, yea, chidden againe and againe. If we serue God in sincerity, and be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18128:112"/>
zealous for the comming of this Kingdome. See it in the beginning, when the children of <hi>Israel</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> how were they hindred and stopped in their <note place="margin">Amalecke.</note> iourney. So whensoeuer we shall begin to make after Christ, we shall bee sure of a many lets and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: like vnto the Pharisees in the Gospell, who were ready to answer the Officers, and discourage the people from following after Christ, saying, <hi>Doe any of the Rulers beleeue in him, but this people who know not the Law?</hi> Thus it is with the whole swarme of wicked men, who discharge men from the wayes of God.</p>
                     <p>Againe, wee haue too many impediments in our selues. <hi>Selfe-loue, loue of the world, loue of riches, honour,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Impediments in our selues. <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 42, 43.</note>

But we must not doe so, for though we sit farre in darkenesse from letting in the light of God vnto vs, or howeuer we seeme to close vp our eyes from beholding the light, yet let vs not be so contented, but pray to the Lord that he would breake through all these hinderances and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, and let downe his graces of mercy and loue so amongst vs, by his grace, that this Kingdome may come vpon vs, yea, that we may doe as the Palsie man did, who brake through the roofe of the house to come <note place="margin">Palsie man.</note> to <hi>Christ;</hi> Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring that the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> brake through all impediments and hinderances, to come vnto vs and fill vs with his blessings, wherein we may further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue two things, that in Christs comming to vs, &amp; our comming to him, a number of lettes and hinderances do concuire: yet he hath so wrought by his Spirit, as we can say, <hi>Thy Kingdome come;</hi> and he so ouercomes all, as he will at length say vnto vs, <hi>Come yee blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>

The <hi>third thing prayed for in this Petition, is,</hi> That <note place="margin">3 Thing praid for in this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</note> we pray.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 For the Kingdome of grace.</item>
                        <item>2 For the Kingdome of glory.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Which two Kingdomes differ not in nature, but onely in measure and in degrees: for the Kingdome of grace is nothing else, but a beginning and inchoation of the Kingdome of glory, there being no way to attaine vnto the one, vnlesse they passe through the other. It is a common custome of the world, that most men aspire to the Kingdome of glory; and yet cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Kingdome of grace, how should they euer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, thinke you? we that by Gods blessing, are better taught, therefore first, pray heere for the Kingdome of grace, to be gouerned and ruled by the Lord here in this world. But more <hi>particularly</hi> let vs <note place="margin">Definition of the Kingdome of grace.</note> see <hi>what the Kingdome of grace is?</hi> namely, <hi>The speciall power of Christ whereby he rules and gouernes in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences and soules of all his seruants.</hi> This is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which we do pray for, that the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> would set vp a Throne in our hearts to rule and gouerne in vs by the rule of his Spirit, subduing and bringing vnder all our thoughts and consciences to himselfe. Now all men doe outwardly speake well of Christ, thinke sure enough to be saued by him, but yet cannot endure to be guided and directed by the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> but in effect doe what those wicked <hi>Jewes</hi> say, <hi>Luke 19. 14. Wee will</hi>

                        <hi>not haue this man to reigne ouer vs.</hi> So it is with most of the world, they can be content to heare of Christ as a Sauiour, to haue the Word preached, and to see the Gospell flourish: <hi>but they will not haue him reigne,</hi> strictly direct them in all their actions, restraine them in their passions, and guide them in their liues: doing whatsoeuer seemes good in their owne eyes. Yet ere we proceed.</p>

Here ariseth an <hi>Obiection,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 21. our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our  speakes, <hi>That the Kingdome of God is come already:</hi> how then are wee directed to pray for that which is come?</p>
                     <p>I answer in two respects; first,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Ans. </seg>1</label> It is true that the Kingdome of grace is begun already, therefore we pray  that as it is come to others, so also that it may come to vs, that we may feele the power and effects of it in our hearts and liues. Therefore as <hi>Esau, Gen.</hi> 27. 38. when <note place="margin">Esau. Gen. 27. 38.</note> he saw that his father had blessed his brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and roared out, <hi>Blesse me my father, euen me also;</hi> thus must we doe when we see the Kingdome of God to come vpon others, how God rules in them by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, orders them in their liues, directs them in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, we, I say, must pray that the same grace of God may continually attend vpon vs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, though the Kingdome of God be come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, yet <hi>we pray for an increase thereof,</hi> that euery day  we and others might feele the power of it more and more in our hearts and liues. For there is no man but feeles himselfe, in some sort and measure bound and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled to the Temptations of sinne. Holy <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe complaines of this, <hi>I delight in the Law of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 22, 23.</note> 
                        <hi>the inner man, but I see another law in my members, rebelling against the law of my mind.</hi> And surely the state of the godly, are like vnto a man that hath been deadly sicke, and now is so on the mending hand, that he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture <note place="margin">Sicke man, Godly.</note> able to creepe abroad with a staffe, yet not able to do the tenth part of the businesse that he sees he should, and at sometimes was wont to doe. Thus it is with the best of vs all, whilst we liue here, though the Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> be come amongst vs, yet had wee need to pray, that it may more and more come into our hearts, that we may feele the strength and vigour of it
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18128:113"/>
to our endlesse comfort, and full recouery of our health in <hi>Christ.</hi> Yea, great reason there is why wee should thus pray for the Kingdome of <hi>Christ,</hi> being that no Kingdome is comparable vnto his: there being as much difference betwixt the Kingdome of <hi>Christ,</hi> and other Kingdomes of the world, as there is betweene <hi>Heauen</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and that for diuers respects.</p>

but Christ giues a thousand things more then hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues, he takes away death and damnation with his left hand, and giues vs life and saluation with the right hand; so both hands are full of blessings, and store vs abundantly to the supplying of all our wants.</p>

                     <p>Yet we must further know, that we doe not onely <note place="margin">A further scope of the Petition.</note> pray for the Kingdom of grace: <hi>but also for all good means conducting and leading vnto it,</hi> for euery thing that may incite and helpe to the Kingdome of grace amongst vs. As for good Magistrates, Ministers, a pure right vse of the Sacraments: holy discipline of Christ in the Church for the good gouernment thereof, and for euery thing that may further this great worke of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs. So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1.

So in <hi>Daniel,</hi> This Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> is compared to a tree, vnder the shadow whereof, the beasts of the <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 8.</note> field might rest, and the birds of the ayre find shelter; Therefore the Apostle sayes, It is ordained of God, so <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note> that though we haue no cause to murmure or grudge at the kingdomes of this world, but to thanke GOD for them, yet we must know euery state hath his abuses, and so haue these.

yet no body can deny, but they fray away enemies, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangers, and many rauenous birds that would else deuour vp the fruits of our labours. Therefore we pray not for the Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> in any detestation to these earthly kingdomes, but onely because we preferre the Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> before them.

                        <hi>Let there be no prophane person, as Esau, amongst you, &amp;c.</hi> and so in all the rest. So long therefore as wee liue in our sinnes against conscience, and will not repent of them and amend our liues, so long as we be thus giuen ouer to wickednesse, our wills stand in subiection to the will of the Diuell: as Christ said to the Iewes, <hi>Yeeare</hi>

                        <hi>of your Father the Diuell:</hi> So he who doth the workes of the Diuell, without doubt is at his subiection; this is the first thing we pray against, that we may not doe the will of the Diuill.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is a will of the flesh, as the Apostle calls it, <hi>Ephes. 2. 3.

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> First, because our owne will is most crooked and corrupt, vntill God  renue it; for the will of man vnrenued, doth extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily resist the will of God. As the rebellious <hi>Iewes</hi> said, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 44. 16. <hi>The word that thou hast spoken vnto</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ierem. 44. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>vs in the Name of the Lord, we will not heare of it of thee.</hi> So <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 40. Christ complaines of the <hi>Iewes: But</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 40.</note> 
                        <hi>you will not come to me, that ye might haue life.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. all the Psalmes shew so much, so that the will of man is apparantly rebellious, till God alter and change it by the power of grace. Therefore we pray that our will may be ouermastred by the power of grace, so as to submit to Gods will. Secondly, because Gods will is alwayes better then our will. <hi>Adam</hi> would needs haue his owne will in eating of the forbidden fruit, but I  pray you whose will was the better?<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>
                        </label> Gods will said, <hi>Thou shalt not eate:</hi> but mans will would needs eate. Now (considering the curses which came after) any foole can tell which was the better. The Marriners, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. would needs haue their owne will, when <note place="margin">Acts 27. 12.</note> they might haue beene in a safe harbour and sure Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18128:122"/>
they would needs put forth to Sea, well they did <note place="margin">Marriners.</note> so, but what was the end thereof? they all suffered ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke and hardly escaped with their liues, though <hi>Paul</hi> told them of the danger: so is it with vs, for the most part we will haue our owne wils, though we mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in our courses: and then we are faine to tell you (as <hi>Paul</hi> did the Marriners) <hi>O my brethren, you should haue hearkned vnto the Lord, and obeyed and kept close vnto him, and so haue shunned this losse,</hi>
                     </p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, There is the will of the world, which is still  opposite to the will of God; for when the world wills vs such and such things, commonly God wils the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: therefore we must try and approue of nothing further then it agrees with the will of God: so that when any thing is determined or wished for, let vs haue a care to the warrant &amp; lawfulnesse of it. The Diuels in the Gospel, you see, are charged to speake no more of the name of Iesus, because it was not the wil of God. So <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> answered boldly to the <hi>Jewes, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 4. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>it be right in the sight of God to obey you rather then God, iudge you.</hi> So the three children commanded to fall downe before <hi>Nabushadnezars</hi> golden Image, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered likewise: <hi>Be it knowne to thee, O King! that wee will not serue thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set vp.</hi> So that I say, whatsoeuer the will of man commands, we must alwayes looke to the will of God, and hold our selues vnto it, as the onely rule of all our actions and courses: Thus when we pray, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> it is in opposition to these three wils.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 The false and wicked will of the Diuell.</item>
                        <item>2 The corrupt and crooked will of the Flesh.</item>
                        <item>3 The peruerse and abusing will of the World.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>So a true Christian in all estates ought to pray, <hi>Lord grant that I may not guide my selfe by these wills, but that I may be alwayes ready to be directed by thy will:</hi> And so I haue done with the first point, <hi>Thy will be done.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">2 Thing, what will of God must be done.</note>The second thing to be obserued in this Petition, is,  <hi>What will of God must be done?</hi> Not the secret will, but the reuealed will of God in his Word; for herein the Diuell vseth great art and cunning, contrary to Gods will to buzze in mens heads, many intricate and secret things, vnder the colour of art and deepe necessary knowledge, leauing the principall matters and maine points. But we must know, that it is the reuealed will of God, not his secret will must be the rule of our liues. As <hi>God</hi> speakes to <hi>Moses, Deut. 12. vlt. You shall doe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 12. vlt. Psal. 119. 105.</note> 
                        <hi>onely that I command you.</hi> And <hi>Psal. 119. 105. It is said by the Prophet, Thy Word is a lanthorne to my feet, and a light to my pathes.</hi> Thus whatsoeuer the secret will of GOD bee; let vs alwayes hold to that will of GOD reuealed in his Word: doing as Marriners when they <note place="margin">Marriners.</note> are at Sea, who when they haue no direction to sayle by, cast vp their eyes to heauen, and are altogether di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Pole-starre: So must wee doe in all our <note place="margin">Pole-starre.</note> actions, thinke of no other guide or direction, but the bright starre of the holy Word of God, which will safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conduct vs to the heauenly City. Wherefore, because this will and Word of God, must still be looked vpon as our Compasse, let vs labour to know it, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, that we may be fitted to be aduised by it. To this purpose Christ saith, <hi>Iohn 5. 39. Search the Scriptures for they are they which testifie of me:</hi> Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 39.</note> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> addeth, <hi>That they are able to make vs wise vnto saluation:</hi> and <hi>Iosh.</hi> 1. 8. he saith, <hi>Let not</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iosh. 1. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>this booke of the Law depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therein day and night, &amp;c.</hi> Most men, you see, will haue a booke of Statutes in their houses, and if they be to do any great matter, they will doe nothing before they <note place="margin">Statute booke.</note> looke on their booke; euen so, because the Bible is the Booke of <hi>Gods</hi> Statutes, the best men should get this booke into their houses and read it themselues, or get others to reade for them, that thereby they may first
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18128:123"/>
know the will of God, and then practise to performe it. Whereby you see what a great fault it is amongst vs, that such a Christian duty is so much neglected. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs labour to correct this corruption in our selues, and so pray that we may doe the will of God: first, labouring to know it, and afterwards putting it in practise. Now, as depending vpon this,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There are foure speciall wills which God requires in his Word.</hi>

                        <hi>It is the will of God that wee should bee penitent for our sinnes:</hi> to which end God speakes by the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel, As I liue, saith the Lord God, I desire not the death</hi>

                        <hi>and would haue no man to perish, but that all men should come vnto repentance:</hi> so you see it is the will of God that we should repent vs of our sinnes, that how soeuer we cannot doe our duty, liue as we should, yet alwayes to grieue at our hearts, be wounded in our soules, that we haue offended God, and cannot doe as we ought. They say that wounds which bleed, will the sooner <note place="margin">Bleeding wounds.</note> heale, but when a man hath a grieuous wound, and does not bleed, there does vsually great danger follow. So it is in a wounded conscience which bleeds: when we are sorrowfull, lamenting, weeping, mourning, and meditating of our sinnes, then comfort followes, but when no remorse or repentance followes for sinnes which offend God, this is very dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It is the will of God that we beleeue in Christ:</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>It is the will of God that we beare patiently and quietly, all the crosses and troubles that God sends vs:</hi>  as <hi>Peter</hi> sayes, <hi>It is better</hi> (if the will of God be so) <hi>that ye suffer for wel-doing, then for euill-doing.</hi> And so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is also a part of the will of God, compose your selues quietly and meekely to vndergoe the troubles and crosses that God sends.</p>

it, being vnwilling to repent of sinnes, and to lay hold on the promises of Christ? to which purpose it was a waighty speech of a learned man: <hi>Wee may as well spit vpon</hi> CHRIST, <hi>buffet Him, beate Him with roddes, bow before Him, with cursed mocking, say, Hayle King of the Iewes, &amp;c. as kneele in His Church, in our Pew, and say (Thy will bee done) and yet neuer haue any care to doe it;</hi> but grieue <hi>God</hi> with our sinnes adde wickednesse to wickednesse, day by day, neuer think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of reconciling our selues, and examining our hearts and consciences, toreformation and newnesse of life.</p>
                     <p>The third generall part of this Petition, is: <hi>In what</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3 General thing in the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                        <hi>manner wee must doe the will of God?</hi> You see wee pray that we may doe it in Earth, as they doe it in Heauen, that is as the Angels and blessed Spirits doe it which are in the presence of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the reason of this is, because (as we haue heard before in all duties) the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a thing (in regard of gratefull acceptation) is as much as the thing it selfe.</p>
                     <p>As if one build a man a house, yet if he doe not build <note place="margin">House.</note> it to the minde of the owner, if it bee too high or too low, too wide, flat, or such like, he thinkes all his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges lost.</p>

as the Lord had commanded. <hi>Moses</hi> was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 5.</note> to doe all things according to the patterne shewed him in the Mount, this is that we pray for in the last clause of this Petition.</p>
                     <p>In which two things are especially to be considered.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 Why the Lord fetcheth vs a Patterne from Heauen, and not rather from good men in this world?</item>
                        <item>2 How, and in what manner the Angels doe the will of God?</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Concerning the first, There are fowre speciall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of it, why the Lord fetches vs a Patterne from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, rather then from Earth.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>Because a rare example doth most moue vs.</hi> Few examples in this world be rare, and those few that be, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> are so darkned and clouded with contrary examples, that they hardly moue vs. To this effect <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>The Lord looked from Heauen, and saw, that none did good, no not one.</hi> So <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6, 7. the Prophet brings in the <note place="margin">Psal. 14. 12. Isa. 64. 6, 7.</note> people confessing, <hi>Wee haue all been as an vncleane thing, and our Righteousnesse is as filthy cloutes, &amp;c.</hi> And hee concludes, <hi>for there is none that stirreth vp himselfe to call vpon thee.</hi> Yea, also of this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> complaines, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiuely, Philip.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>For all seeke their owne, and not</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Philip. 2. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>that which is Iesus Christs:</hi> So because there is such a rarity of good examples in this world, therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ sends vs as farre as Heauen, to take our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from thence: as Marriners on the Sea, who are <note place="margin">Marriners.</note> alwayes guided by the Starres, because they want in the Sea firme markes to direct them home to their owne Countrey. So must we doe, because we want firme and sure examples in this world, to raise vp our thoughts by into heauen and mount vs beyond the clouds: we must take our patterne from those blessed Spirits and powers that continually doe serue in the presence of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:18128:125"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second is, <hi>because those fewe examples that are in the world, be not pure and perfect, but haue their defects.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (as I haue said) likeneth the examples of holy men, to the cloud that led the people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which had two parts, one bright, another darke, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to be followed, somewhat to be declined. Now because the corruption of our nature is such, that wee are more prone to imitate euill then good, to follow <hi>Dauid</hi> in his sinnes, rather then in his teares, to follow <hi>Peter</hi> in deniall of <hi>Christ,</hi> rather then in his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, therefore to helpe this, our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> directs vs to the example of holy Angels which be pure and perfect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Because these earthly examples be but of men terrestriall, like vnto our selues.</hi> But Angels be the most noble spirits of God, the glory and beauty of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: so that the direction is forcible; If Angels ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated and lifted vp to such a high degree, be alwayes ready and willing to doe the will of <hi>God,</hi> then much more we that be men much meaner and lower then they be. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels vs, that <hi>God</hi> when he bringeth his first begotten Sonne into the world, he saith, <hi>Let all</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>the Angels of God worship him:</hi> why giues hee such a charge vnto Angels? was there any doubt, but that the Angels were ready to stoupe and doe seruice to the Sonne of <hi>God?</hi> The answer must be, that it was especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to raise vp men to doe the like: that if the most noble spirits of <hi>God,</hi> fall and sinke downe at the feet of Christ, then much more, we that be but dust and ashes, wormes-meat, and wretched men, must be still ready to fall before him, and to doe him seruice. Thus our blessed Sauiour in this place, shewes how prompt and ready the holy Angels bee to doe the will of <hi>God,</hi> and therefore doth the more incite and stirre vs vp to bee like them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>That we may make our conuersation heauenly,</hi>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:18128:126"/>
                        <hi>while we be vpon earth;</hi> That though our bodies bee here vpon ground, yet that we might conuerse aboue the Starres, amongst Angels and Archangels, and all the blessed spirits continually attending to doe Gods will. According as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20 But <hi>our conuersation is in heauen, from whence also we looke for</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>a Sauiour, euen the Lord Iesus Christ, &amp;c.</hi> And of men thus eleuated, he sayes, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Now therefore wee are no more strangers and forraigners, but Citizens with the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Saints, and of the houshold of God.</hi> Thus, as I say, though we liue vpon earth, yet in affection, we must labour to be ioyned to this heauenly troope of Caelestiall and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirits, which attend to doe the will of God.</p>
                     <p>The next thing to be considered, is; <hi>How the Angels</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">How the, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels doe Gods will.</note> 
                        <hi>doe the will of God?</hi> and in what manner: for seeing <hi>Christ</hi> hath set them for our example, it is good for vs to know what altitude and height wee must aspire to, and ayme at, though we be not able to reach it. Now there be many wayes for our imitation, wherein An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels performe the will of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, <hi>They doe the will of God in purity of affection;</hi> not for any by-reasons or respects, but in sincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence  onely, because it is the will of God; as it is said by the Prophet <hi>Dauid, Psal. 103. 20. Yee Angels that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in strength, that doe his commandements in obeying the voyce of his word &amp;c.</hi> So must we performe the will of <note place="margin">Psal. 103. 20.</note> God in purity of affection, because it is the will of God; onely desiring to please him in doing thereof. Thus Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> exhortation is, <hi>Ephes. 6. 6 That we doe the will of God from the heart.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 119 56. saith the <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 56.</note> Prophet, <hi>This I had because I kept thy Precepts.</hi> So our care must be to doe that which he commands in sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart, without any worldly respects. Many times, indeed, men doe the will of God, but it is not out of any purity of affection to Gods will, but because it is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18128:126"/>
for their owne profit, and brings them worldly ease, false comfort or some other respects, as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who would let the people goe, not in any obedience vnto God, or because God had commanded it, but in hope of his own ease. The like of <hi>Abner, 2 Sam.</hi> 3. Who thought to <note place="margin">2 Sam. 3.</note> establish the Kingdome to <hi>Dauid,</hi> not in obedience to God, but to maintaine his owne greatnesse and power, and out of priuate reuenge vpon others.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Angels doe the will of God with readinesse,</hi> neuer disputing or reasoning vpon the matter, but as soone as they vnderstand it to be the pleasure of God and his will, by and by, they are ready to performe it. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9 7. As soone as the Angels had their charge, <note place="margin">Ezek. 9 7. Dan. 8. 16.</note> by and by they went forth to performe it. And <hi>Daniel</hi> 8 16. No sooner did the voyce command <hi>Gabriel</hi> to make the man vnderstand the vision, but he came and stood neere vnto him. So must we doe, neuer to dispute or debate the matter, pretending excuses, but as soone as we know his will, by and by addresse our selues to performe it. So did <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 5. 5. When hee was <note place="margin">Luke 5. 5.</note> commanded to let downe his net, and you know the successe, they were scarce able to pull in the net, for the multitude of fishes. So the Gouernours seruants, <hi>John</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 2. 7.</note> 2. 7. When Christ bid them fill the pots with water, (which he turned into wine) neuer reasoned nor dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon it, but did as they were commanded. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 44. It is foretold of that change to be wrought by Christ: <hi>As soone as they heare of me, they shall obey mee.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 18. 44.</note> Thus must we adresse our selues to doe the will of <hi>God,</hi> with all readinesse in euery thing. But if wee examine our selues, we shall finde such a strange backewardnesse and reluctation in our hearts; how vnwilling bee wee to come to this duty, what adoe hath the Lord with vs, as is wonderfull, ere we can be brought to learne this lesson: how oft doe we flye off and yeeld to sense and reason? Well, we must learne to see, dislike and pray
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18128:127"/>
against this vntowardnesse in ourselues and that <hi>GOD</hi> would giue vs more true iudgement and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, with cheerefull willingnesse to doe what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands vs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Angels doe the will of God with delectation;</hi> that is, take singular delight and comfort in doing of it,  so must we endeuour to doe it with delight and ioy; like as <hi>Christ</hi> speakes of Himselfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 34. <hi>My meat is to doe the will of him that sent mee, and finish his worke.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 4. 34.</note> And it must not be grieuous in <hi>Abrahams</hi> sight for the <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 12.</note> Childe and the Bond-woman to be turned out of dores. So we must not thinke it enough to do good duties, but also looke that wee haue speciall delight in doing of them; as <hi>Dauid</hi> professes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 16. <hi>I will delight</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>my selfe in thy statutes, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Thou hast</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 4. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>put gladnesse in my heart, more then in the time when their corne and their wine increased.</hi> But now this is our sinne, that though in many things wee are content to obey <hi>God</hi> and to doe his will, yet we doe it with so little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light or spirituall ioy, with such irkesomnesse, tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and vnwillingnesse, that wee endanger all the grace of our well-doing. In this case it fares with vs, as it did with <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who saith of himselfe: that he went in the bitternesse and heate of his spirit. So, <note place="margin">Ezek. 3. 14.</note> though we are contented to goe, that is, to doe as <hi>God</hi> wils, yet it is with that repining and backewardnesse, that it looseth the benefit of the action.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Againe, <hi>The Angels with earnestnesse and intentiuenesse doe the will of God;</hi> they doe not freeze in their businesse;  but bend all their strength about it. So <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21. <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 21.</note> sayes, <hi>The Angel came swiftly flying vnto me;</hi> so must we doe the will of <hi>God,</hi> not coldly and idlely, but with all our intention and power; yea, this should also moue vs, in that this is the commandement of the Lord. <hi>Thou shalt loue the Lord, with all thy heart, with all thy</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:18128:127"/>
                        <hi>soule, and with all thy might.</hi> Thus much also <hi>Dauid</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 4 <hi>Thou hast commanded vs to keepe thy</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>precepts diligently.</hi> Many indeed doe the will of <hi>God</hi> in shew, but coldly, loosely, lasily, with dead affections, there is no life in their obedience, nor spirit in their prayers, how then can they thinke that <hi>God</hi> will accept of them. He that strikes vpon a little Violl, and would <note place="margin">Sound Violl.</note> know whether it bee sound or not, hearkens to the sound, for if it giue but a dull sound, If the ringing bee not shrill, he knowes that there is some cracke or flaw in it: So it is with vs in our obedience, when we giue but a dead sound, be not shrill, full of spirit and life; and when good duties come but slacke and coldly from vs, certainely wee haue some dangerous cracke and flaw within vs, against which wee must pray and seeke for reformation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, <hi>They doe the will of God with constancy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance;</hi>  not at one time, and neglect it at another, but they are alwayes ready and seruiceable. So must wee bee ready to doe at all times, and in all places. As <hi>Dauid</hi> prayes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 33. <hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 33 Psal. 44. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>of thy statutes, and I shall keepe it vnto the end.</hi> So <hi>Psal.</hi> 44 18. the Church professes, <hi>Our heart is not turned backe, neither haue our steppes declined from thy way.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi>

But when it comes to any strait or narrow search, to let all goe, and submit our will to Gods will in all things; Here is that hard tryall which makes vs flye off. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> could be contented to doe one part of the will of God, to let the people goe: but to keepe backe the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children: at last he would let all the people goe, but not the Cattell: therefore <hi>Moses</hi> tels him, wee will not leaue so much as a hoofe behind. The Lord will haue all or nothing; so let vs say in our stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings against sinne, not a hoofe must be left behind, not a sinne, not a corruption, but all must be hated, forsaken, left off, in Gods seruice and for Gods sake.</p>

First, caring for those things which belong vnto the Lord, then afterwards prouiding for such as belong vnto our selues. We may seeke our daily Bread, but we must seeke it in due order, wee may not seeke it before Gods glory, Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Gods will, but first the one, and then the other. Questionlesse, the thinking of our daily Bread, is not vnlawfull, yea, euery thing belonging to this temporary

                     <p>But the world are quite contrary, they beginne with the care of themselues, their owne delights, ease, and pleasures: and then if any ouerpius remaine, or haue any spare time, they can be content to looke out a little for the glory of God. But you see our Sauiour Christ would heere rectifie our thoughts, and order our care in these things.</p>

As a man wanting water to <note place="margin">Water to a Mill.</note> driue a Mill, must not too greedily open too many Springs and Sluces, for feare of glutting and damming it vp: So must it be with our wants in this world; for an ouer-hasty desire and indeuour to satisfie them may quickely drowne vp our care for spirituall graces, not caring what becomes of the glory of God, so wee may inioy our base contentments. Wherefore our Sauiour
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18128:130"/>
shewes that the care of these earthly things, must be with subordination to Gods glory. <note place="margin">Why we pray for daily bread before remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another point to be considered, is, why we first pray for our daily Bread, and afterwards for the pardon of our sinnes? for in all reason, one should thinke that the pardoning of sinnes, being most necessary should be first, and then the other? I answer, there are two Reasons of it.</p>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> First, <hi>Christ condescended herein to our weakenesse, and would graciously, first dispatch vs of our worldly care, and feare of wants, that hauing earthly things supplyed, wee might haue the more leisure to attend and be better prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the heauenly.</hi> Because many times we are so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed and incombred about earthly things, that wee haue little care for heauenly thoughts, which in that estate be vnwelcome vnto vs, hauing but bad entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> A second Reason is, <hi>That by experience of the smaller things, we might climbe vp to the hope of greater.</hi> For at first, men be not easily perswaded of the Remission of sinnes, and high Mysteries of eternall happinesse, but must be brought to it by steppes and degrees. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Sauiour worketh vpon vs in this place with a secret wisedome, that by finding God to be good vnto

vs, in food and rayment, the things of this life, we might learne to rest and relie vpon him for a better life to come, for it is a sure thing, that he who will not trust vnto God for meat and drinke, and such like, will not trust him for the saluation of his soule, and hee that thinkes that GOD will stand with him for a piece of Bread, will neuer beleeue that God will giue him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his sinnes, and heauenly glory; Christ therefore would haue vs begin at the smaller, that finding the Lord fauourable and friendly in these lesser things, wee may be drawen to conceiue, that he will be as gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined in greater matters. As a man that would try a vessell; first, he puts water into it, and such meane <note place="margin">Vessell tryed.</note> liquor; And then if it hold water well, he is the more bold to trust it with Wine, or <hi>Rosasolis,</hi> and the like.

                     <p>First, for the <hi>Extension</hi> of the Tearme, by Bread our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Sauiour Christ doth not meane, that God should giue vs bare bread and nothing else. But by <hi>Bread,</hi> he meanes all things else, as needfull to mans life, as Bread is, so that whatsoeuer is comfortable and helpefull to the life of man is here couered vnder the name of Bread, as wee see, 2 <hi>Sam. 9. 7.

For wee know that many haue bread, yet if they haue not other good blessings of God, houses and harbour, fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, sleepe, health, and rest, they may for all that perish: therefore when we pray for bread, we pray that the Lord will giue vs whatsoeuer is needfull to sustaine our weake and fraile life in this world.</p>
                     <p>And for the <hi>Limitation,</hi> we know that bread is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and a needfull thing. It is not a friuolous thing of superfluity, that we may well want, but a most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary thing: wherein our Sauiour Christ hath heere so bounded our desires to guide them to needfull things onely, Bread, or that which is as needfull as Bread: so that if we once goe beyond the compasse and reach of bread, If wee desire a thing that is not needfull, a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous

                        <hi>Psal. 145. 15. The eyes of all waite vpon thee, and thou giuest them meat in due season:</hi> Thus all good things are to be sought for from God.

                     <p>A second relation is, <hi>To the rest of the members of Christs body;</hi> and so wee are taught to pray, not Lord giue me; but, Lord giue vs our daily Bread: So that a Christian man must not regard himselfe onely, but in a fellow-feeling of other mens miseries, hee must pray for their wants as well as his owne. The couetous man he had rather say, Lord giue mee Bread, then giue vs Bread: but the true Christian, extends his care and loue vnto the whole body of Christ, whereof he himselfe is a member. As <hi>Abraham</hi> sitting in his tent doore, in the <note place="margin">Abraham.</note> coole of the shadow, pittyed them which were trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the heate, and was ready to refresh them: so it is with euery true Christian, they are tender-hearted and haue a simpathy with others miseries.

                     <p>In the former Petition, we haue heard on what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and how we ought to beg for the good things of this life, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> as things necessary, tend especially to the bodily preseruation of health and life.

                     <p>But before I come to the Petition, two questions must be answered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Why there is but one Petition for earthly things, and two for heauenly, <hi>that is:</hi> (daily Bread) <hi>and in the other. First,</hi> Pardon for sinnes: <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> For graces against them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Why this Petition is linked to the former, by a coniunctiue practise (Giue vs this day our daily Bread) And forgiue vs our sinnes. <hi>Which close coniunction we find not amongst the rest.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the first I answer, it is for two speciall reasons. First, <hi>Because the Lord would not haue vs too carefull for worldly things, but to be holy and heauenly minded, as much as may be;</hi> that we might be discreet in our demands, and not dwell too long vpon earthly things. It is the custome of the world, (who vse to pray) not to care how long they continue their sute for daily Bread, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleased to conclude all vnder that, as <hi>Hosh.</hi> 7. 14. The Lord complaines, <hi>They assemble themselues for</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hosn. 7. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>their Corne and Wine, the things that they onely thinke on and care for, so as they could be contented continually to pray for them.</hi> Wherein our Sauiour Christ perceiuing a naturall corruption in vs, would therefore haue vs soone to haue done with this thing, and by and by to adresse our selues to better, to seeke more pertinent matters, pardon of sinne, saluation of soules; strength, and meanes to liue holily, without which, all the rest would turne to nothing, though we had as much as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18128:139"/>
Sea and Land could afford vs: so that as Birds which <note place="margin">Birds dipping.</note> dippe into the Sea to get their food, soare vp againe and quickly rise, lest they should dull their wings, and wet their feathers that they cannot flye: So in our prayers, we must take heed that we doe not diue too deepe into the world, bringing our affections so low, as we cannot mount and raise vp our heauy hearts to the contemplation of those heauenly blessings and graces as the Lord would haue vs.</p>
                     <p>Numbers of men though they seeme likely in this world, yet are like the Lead and Plummets of a Clocke, <note place="margin">Plummets of a Clocke.</note> that continually driue downe-ward, and had need still to be wound vp. So it is with vs in praying for spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall blessings: we decline and draw downe-wards, so much to the world, as we are heauy and dull in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vp our selues towards heauen. Let vs then reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our selues, and raise vp, and winde our hearts vp, and our thoughts as high as heauen, to the loue and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of heauenly things.</p>
                     <p>In a Garden, you see when men haue store of heauy <note place="margin">Mould min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled.</note> mould, they mingle it with Chalke and Sand to make it high and lighter: so when our thoughts be heauy, earthly, and lumpish, our Sauiour Christ would haue vs lift them vp with the cogitation and thinking of better things. In the Law, things that crept vpon all foure, were forbidden, yet if they had feet to leape vp withall, <note place="margin">Creeping things lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp.</note> they were iudged to be cleane. Euen so, howsoeuer some thoughts are about the things of this world, our Trades and businesse, yet if we haue legges to leape vp with, that we can raise our hearts to God, and better things; when we come to pray and prostrate our selues before God: it is not to bee condemned, they may passe for cleane well enough.</p>
                     <p>But if they alwayes creep on the ground, if neuer rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed higher then the earth, if no good thoughts of God, if no looking vpward to better things, O then no doubt they were vncleane: not legally vncleane as the beasts
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18128:140"/>
were but really vncleane in the sight of God and his holy Angels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>To shew vs, that our care must be twice so much for heauenly things as for earthly:</hi> wee must haue  twice as much care of our soules, as of our bodies: beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging oftner spirituall, then temporall things. In the Law, the waight of the Sanctuary was double, to the common waight, which was to shew that the Lord <note place="margin">Sanctuary weight.</note> must alwayes haue double waight in matters that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to the Lord, in the saluation of our soules: in all such things, double waight, double care, double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour: but how cleane contrary is it with the world, who lay all the bent of their care vpon earthly things, and their indeuour for transitory things of this life; whereas we are taught by our great Teacher, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to ouerweigh our earthly cares with more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly meditations, that thus hauing quieted our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, we may the more safely goe about our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affaires.</p>
                     <p>Againe, to the second question, I answer, this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed <note place="margin">2 Question an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. 1 Answere.</note> to the former Petition to shew vs two things.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>That pardon of sinnes in as necessary as our daily Bread:</hi> Therefore with praying for Bread, wee are taught also to pray for pardon for our sinnes and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. So that it is very necessary to haue these two ioyned together, that whensoeuer wee pray to GOD to put meat in our mouthes: wee alwayes remember that there is more excellent things to bee lookt after, then this temporary food: the pardon of sinnes, with hope of euerlasting life in Heauen.</p>
                     <p>This is the reason why our blessed Sauiour so closely ioyned these together, that the thought of this tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Bread might moue vs to desire the Bread of Life, for which cause Christ would haue these two Petitions connected together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:18128:140"/>
The <hi>Jewes</hi> (badly enough in other things) say well in this: A woman takes two children to Nurse, the <note place="margin">Childe nurse.</note> one is a very meane one, deformed, crooked, blinde, and not likely to liue long; the other as goodly a child as may be, beautifull, well-fauoured, and likely, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to out-liue the other. Now the foolish woman, who bestowes all her care, diligence, and attendance vpon the worst childe, and neuer lookes vnto the best, must needs be ignorant and very foolish in so bad a choyce, and so great a neglect.</p>
                     <p>So is it with vs, wee haue taken two children to nurse, our Body, and our Soule, they be the children, and the Soule, we know, is infinitely better then the Body, more beautifull, and of longer continuance; and yet like the foolish Nurse, wee bestow all our care, labour, and paines about the worst, wee are all for the body, care little for the soule, which yet must liue when the body shall die. But our blessed Sauiour would haue both children lookt vnto, the Body respected, the soule remembred, wherefore he strictly connects and ioynes these two Petitions together.</p>

the Law hath beene stricter, for a man that made not payment of his debt, was to be sold, his wife, his children, and all he had. Amongst the <hi>Parthians</hi> the Lawes were more cruell, for if thae debt were not payed, euery creditor was to take away so much of his flesh, as the debt came vnto, but these were courses barbarous and cruell. Now by the lawes we see, to be cast in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is the punishment inflicted for a debt.

                     <p>Another thing is, that sinne is not like a debt we owe in this world, for many a man, though not able to pay his debt, or not able to pay the interest for the time, yet may deuise some meanes to auoyde and shift it off by a tricke, pretend danger in the way, or conscience in the businesse, or if all faile he may die, and then no body can compell him to pay the debt, but no man in the world can shift off the debt of sinne.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18128:147"/>
sinnes, because euery day we renue our sins and offend God, therfore we had need euery day to renue our sutes and prayers vnto God. When <hi>Adam</hi> was fallen, the <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 8.</note> Text saith, <hi>God came to him in the coole of the day;</hi> The Lord would not let him sleepe in his sinnes, but came and awoke him, putting him in remembrance of his sinne. So in the Law; If a man were vncleane, yet when <note place="margin">Vncleane.</note> the Euening came he must wash his cloathes, and so be reconciled accordingly. Euen so, though we be vncleane by reason of our sinnes, yet if we wash our selues by the true teares of Repentance, we shall be reconciled to God, and admitted into the Campe againe. This then may teach vs that howsoeuer we haue our daily slippes and fals; yet if we doe euery day labour to make our peace with God, for the sinnes of the day, that we doe not let them runne weekely, and monthly, and yearely, we may be sure to find mercy at the hands of God.</p>
                        <p>Now there be diuers Reasons to moue vs to this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and make vs renue our prayers daily without omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>Because we are very prone to forget our sinnes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sooner.</hi> Therefore it is good to remember them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the sooner, the better. A Steward who hath large rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings, and but a short memory, he must haue the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">A Steward.</note> recknings, yea, euery dayes account cast vp: so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we be forgetfull, and a number of sinnes doe easily slip vs, we must desire euery day to make euen with the Lord.

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Because the fresher sense of sinnes is at the first,</hi>  for by referring repentance, it takes away the sense of

sinne, as the memory thereof. Wounds we know bleed <note place="margin">Wounds blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> most when they be fresh, then they doe most feelingly affect vs: let one haue a bruise or straine, commonly the greatest sense and paine is at the first: but afterwards <note place="margin">Bruise, Strain.</note> time will allay and mitigate, and so slacke the sharpnesse of sense, as we shall nothing so much feele the griefe of them. So it is with our sinnes, our greatest and quickest sense of them is at the first; so the sooner we seeke for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, the more easie will it be for vs to obtaine mercy, and we will so much the more eagerly desire it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Because, if euery day we get our sinnes dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi>

So if we doe with the great bulke and body of our sins, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide them euery day apart, &amp; make our prayers for the daily remission of them, then shall we haue the lesse to doe when we come to die. Wherfore as sins increase, so let vs euery day seeke reconciliation, that we bring no after recknings to <hi>God:</hi> for enough are those euery day by themselues.</p>

So it is with vs, whensoeuer we haue sinned against God, the soule being out of ioynt, the sooner we shall find ease. Wounds, you <note place="margin">Wounds vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed.</note> know, that are not by and by dressed, will ranckle and fester so, as the cure of them will be much more difficult and dangerous.</p>

                           <pb n="112" facs="tcp:18128:148"/>
So it is with the wounds of our sinnes, if they be long kept from searching, opening and laying them before the Lord. Let vs therefore preuent the mischiefe which may follow our delayes, making vpon all occasions a continuall and speedy attonement with God.</p>

                        <p>We pray to God <hi>to forgiue vs, as we forgiue others:</hi> yet this cannot be a cause of Gods forgiuenesse, but a condition onely: It can be no <hi>cause,</hi> for as the <hi>Schoole-men</hi> say, <hi>Finiti ad infinitum nulla est propertio:</hi> There is no proportion of the Finite, to the Infinite thing. And so no reason, because wee forgiue our Brethren some small matter, that GOD should forgiue vs the infinite debt we owe. Therefore, no cause, but a condition of it. Very reason will teach vs this, that it is in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the giuer to prescribe vpon what condition he giues his gift; as <hi>Christ</hi> saith to <hi>Peter, Iohn 13. 8. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Iohn 13. 8.</note> 
                           <hi>I wash thee, thou shalt not bee cleane:</hi> As if hee had said, I am content that thou haue part with mee in my kingdome and glory, but yet there is a condition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed: <hi>Except I wash thee,</hi> except thou obey me, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thy selfe vnto me, thou mayest not haue it. So God did giue vnto <hi>Paul</hi> the liues of all that were with him in the ship, yet it was conditionall, <hi>Except these abide in</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Acts 27. 24, 31.</note> 
                           <hi>the Ship, ye cannot be safe.</hi> And so must we be contented to rest vpon the meanes which God hath appointed: and be willing to performe such conditions as hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynes vnto vs. But the wickednesse of the world, and corruption of men: that willingly will not come to any conditions with GOD, but would haue the blessing without the condition: like the kinsman of <hi>Ruth,</hi> hee would haue had the land, but when he heard the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <note place="margin">Ruth.</note> that he must haue <hi>Ruth</hi> to wife, he refused the bargaine. So the Rich man in the Gospel would haue <note place="margin">Rich man.</note>
                           <pb n="113" facs="tcp:18128:148"/>
had eternall life, but when he heard the condition, that he must leaue all and follow <hi>Christ</hi> in a poore estate, he would not meddle with it, but went away sorrowfull. So it is with the world still, and so it is with most men, they would haue the blessing, they would haue life euerlasting, forgiuenesse of sinnes, and the like, but they will none of the condition, to forgiue the offences of others. But let vs remember, if we looke to inioy the Lords blessings, we must come to his conditions; wee may not haue them vpon what tearmes wee will, but be contented to accept of them on what manner the Lord will giue them vs.</p>
                        <p>Now the Conditions, that the Lord giues vs, are, <note place="margin">

                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> Easie.</note> First; <hi>Easie to be done:</hi> For the Lord doth not say, man must content me for his sinnes, let mee haue so many teares, so much sorrow from thee proportionable to thy offences: spend as many dayes in my seruice, as thou hast spent in the seruice of sinne. But what saith hee? <hi>Forgiue, forgiue,</hi> be ready and forgiue others, and thou shalt euer find me more ready to forgiue thee. So that it is an easie condition which the Lord prescribes. O we might thinke it abundantly wel with vs, if we were able to purchase so excellent a mercy as the forgiuenesse of sins, at any rate whatsoeuer, yea, though we bought it with a great deale of paines and transitory goods, yea, life it selfe, but the Lord lets it come at an easier rate, at such a poore price, that it is wonderfull he imposeth no more vpon vs, then to forgiue others? This shewes his goodnesse, loue, and mercy, and all to make vs confesse the greatnesse of the same. As <hi>Naamans</hi> seruant said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Master: <hi>If the Prophet had commanded thee a</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">2 Kings 5. 13. Naamans <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant.</hi>

                           <hi>greater thing, wouldest thou not haue done it for thy health?</hi> But now, <hi>onely to wash and be cleane,</hi> what a thing is this? So the Lord may say, had he prescribed vs any difficult and hard matter, for the remission of our sinnes, would wee not haue beene glad of it? but now when hee hath imposed so easie a taske vpon vs, as
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18128:149"/>
to forgiue others, what shall be said vnto vs if wee neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>A condition profitable to our selues,</hi> of no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Lord at all; what doth he gaine by our forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">2 Profitable to our selues.</note> of our brethren, but all the profit redounds vnto our selues, both because we shall be the more gentle and fitted vnto goodnesse: and many times by this meanes, we shall haue the more fauour and loue by winning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vnto vs, in loue and kindnesse: God causing vs finde from others, as they receiue from vs: so gaining some, whom neither sharpnesse, threatnings, nor sorrowes could reconcile. Looke into the Story of the <hi>Aramites, 2 Kings</hi> 6. 22. When the King of <hi>Israel</hi> (hauing them <note place="margin">2 King. 6. 22.</note> in his power) would haue killed them; No saith <hi>Elisha,</hi> set bread and water before them, that they may eate and drinke, and goe to their Master, by which occasion, the bands of the <hi>Aramites,</hi> (it is said) came no more into the land of <hi>Israel</hi> to annoy it. So great profit came by this kindnesse and goodnesse: so will it turne alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to our profit and benefit, if we can practice this duty in forgiuing of others.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is a condition which doth much further and helpe vs in the expectation and hope of blessings lookt for,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">3 Helpefull.</note> For if we who be but men, that haue but a drop of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, can forgiue our Brethren, we may well thinke, that the Lord who is the Ocean and full Sea of graces, must and will be more ready to forgiue vs. When we see the Sunne shine vpon a wall, wee easily conceiue that it <note place="margin">Sunne shining on a wall.</note> shines more brightly and gloriously within his owne Orbe. So we finding so much more mercy in our selues, to forgiue our Brethren, may easily conceiue that there is much more mercy in the Lord to forgiue vs, because he is the very Fountaine of all that mercy and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse we shew to others.</p>
                        <p>Thus as the blessing is conditionall, so must wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the condition: if we hope for Gods fauour.</p>

                           <item>1 The Duty, <hi>which is,</hi> To forgiue our debtors.</item>
                           <item>2 The Quality, we must forgiue them as God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giues vs.</item>

                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">1 The duty.</note>By Debtors, first, are meant, such as haue sinned and  offended against vs, for by debtors, our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> doth not meane such as owe vs a money debt; for a man may craue forgiuenesse of God, and yet require a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney debt of his brother. Indeed, in case of miserable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, when a man is insufficient and cast behind hand by ineuitable meanes, then a man is bound to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue a money debt: for the Prophet <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 3. amongst <note place="margin">Isa. 58. 3.</note>
                           <pb n="116" facs="tcp:18128:150"/>
other sinnes vpbraides the people with this as a maine great one: Yee will require all your labours as debts: But out of this case of extremity, with a safe conscience we may aske a money debt. For so when one of the Prophets, lost his Axe; he cryed out, it was but bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, <note place="margin">2 King, 6. 5.</note> inferring that it must be restored: and <hi>Elisha,</hi> increased the womans oyle to pay debts with. And the Apostle bids vs owe nothing to any man but loue: to which I may adde, that by <hi>Salomon</hi> it is made a note of the wicked to borrow and not to pay againe. So that it is cleere by debtors, our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> meanes such as are indebted to vs in the debt of sinne, whom wee must forgiue, as the Lord forgiues vs. As the Apostle exhorts, <hi>Coloss. chap. 3. vers. 11, 12. Put on tender mercy, kindnesse, &amp;c.</hi> forbearing one another, and forgiuing one <note place="margin">Colos. 3. 11, 12.</note> another, as GOD forgaue vs, which is the second thing.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, <hi>(God forgiues vs truely.)</hi> He doth not make a shew of forgiuenesse, and keepe our sinnes by him, to watch vs a good turne, but truely, according to his loue and mercy: forgiuing and forgetting our sinnes, so must we forgiue our brethren, and not make a shew of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse, keeping rancor and malice in our hearts, like <hi>Cain,</hi> who spake kindly to his brother, but when he had <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> him in the field, fell vpon him and killed him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Matth. 18. 33.</note> 18. 33. <hi>Except yee forgiue from your hearts, your brother;</hi> (saith our Sauiour) <hi>you shall not be forgiuen.</hi> So when we say, I will forgiue and doe not, let vs consider, would we haue the Lord to deale so with vs? consider, what a wofull case is this: for who can answer one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand? and who cannot but be terrified to thinke that God remembers all.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>God forgiues vs easily without any great adoe.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">2 2 Sam. 12. 13.</note> No sooner did <hi>Dauid</hi> say, <hi>I haue sinned,</hi> but <hi>Nathan</hi> told him: <hi>The Lord hath also put away thy sinne, thou shall not

die.</hi> No sooner was hee humbled at his Masters feet, who owed the 1000 Talents, but the King released him, and so must we forgiue our brethren, not stiffely, standing vpon our tearmes, but being gentle, and easily intreated, as we find the Lord is vnto vs. But I appeale to common experience, how hardly we are drawne to this duty? there must be such intreaty, mediation, such going betweene parties as is wonderfull, and all farre from the patterne here propounded vnto vs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, God doth forgiue vs all our sinnes, not our  smaller, reseruing the greater, but generally all, and of all sorts whatsoeuer they be. So must we do by our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, forgiue them in all wherein they haue offended vs, we must not keepe any secret faults in store, but passe by and forgiue all, lesse and more. But such is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the world, that generally they can bee content to say, I would forgiue, but the matter is so great, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes me so neere, toucheth my good name, my repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that I cannot. But if we will be assured to bee the children of our heauenly Father, who shall inherit the promises, we must breake custome with the world, and put on the spirit of meeknesse, patiently forbearing one another, as Christ himselfe hath taught vs, <hi>Luke</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Luke 17. 4.</note> 17. 4. <hi>If seuen times a day he turneth vnto thee, and say it repenteth me, thou shalt forgiue him.</hi> If this mooue not, yet let vs remember the many hainous sinnes, which God forgiues vs, and so be moued to forgiue others.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>God forgiues vs often,</hi> not once, but many  times, though we sinne from day to day, to morrow, and next day, yea, to our liues end. So must we often and vpon all occasions forgiue one another. If thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offend daily, thou art bound daily to forgiue him; not once or twice, but euen to seuenty times seuen times.</p>
                        <p>Thus if we follow the example of Christ, question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse there will be a great deale of more loue wrought

It is nothing to haue all the blessings of Sea and Land, there with to perish in sinne, and at last be damned with the diuell, therefore after prayer for our daily Bread, we are taught to seeke for pardon for our sinnes, reconciliation with God.</p>
                     <p>Now in this sixt Petition, we are taught to goe one step further, and pray to GOD for the grace of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that we may not onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This is that we pray for in this Petition, that as God hath freed vs from our sinnes, so we may be freed from sinne hereafter; In summe, <hi>That we may not be led into tentation.</hi> But whereas there may seeme a connexion of two Petitions in one, it may teach vs two things.</p>

                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:18128:152"/>
First, <hi>That vpon pardon of former sinnes, the Diuell is alwayes ready to fasten new sinnes vpon vs.</hi> Therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pardon of our sinnes, we pray that wee may be kept from more sinnes, as knowing the Diuell will be busie, not onely, not to let vs alone so, but seeks by all meanes to supplant and surprize vs, as the Apostle speakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. But I feare, lest as the Serpent beguiled <hi>Eue,</hi> through his subtilty, so your mindes might be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, &amp;c. and 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 8. Be sober</hi> (saith he) <hi>and watch, for your aduersary the Diuell as a roaring Lyon, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth about, seeking whom he may deuour.</hi> So that howeuer we may relye vpon the pardon of our former sinnes, the Diuell is ready still to thrust new sinnes vpon vs. As we know if a prisoner get out of prison, and make an <note place="margin">Prisoner escaped.</note> escape, the Iaylor will not let him goe so, but make Hue and cry after him, raise the Countrey, lay all the Towns and wayes to take him, till at last be seaze vpon him, and bring him backe to the stinking Dungeon which he came from. So doth the Diuell deale by vs, when wee haue made an escape, got out of the prison-house of our owne sinnes, he will not let vs goe so, but makes after vs, layes all baytes and ginnes possible, to see if possibly he can intrap vs, that so he may carry vs backe to our former old courses to walke in the wayes of darknesse. So we see the grieuousnesse of sins, and daily tentations, are inseparable companions in this life: for wee shall neuer haue our sinnes forgiuen, but the Diuell will bee ready to tempt vs vnto other sinnes, so to lay a new load vpon vs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>That to the grace of Iustification, we must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes labour to joyne Sanctification,</hi> that is, we must not  onely labour to haue our sinnes pardoned, but also mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and the power thereof weakened, for by sinne there be two things alwayes remaining.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The guilt of sinne.</item>
                        <item>2. The corruption of it.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The <hi>guilt of sinne,</hi> is a binding of vs to the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18128:152"/>
(as I haue said) by order of diuine Iustice, which is taken away by the Lords mercifull forgiuenesse, but when the guilt is taken away, the corruption of sinne remaineth, which is a way ward disposition of the soule, wherby it is wholly inclined vnto euil, and vnfit and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for heauenly things. Now this is that we pray for, that God would not onely take the guilt of sinne away, with the punishment and penalty due vnto it; but the corruption of it also; this is our desire: others indeed are well enough content to haue their sinnes pardoned, but to haue them mortified, restrained, weakned, and the power thereof abated and quite killed, but a few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire heartily. But we who know the danger and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse of sinne, must pray also to haue the soule Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the faculties rectified, and set in the same beauty, that the LORD in the beginning gaue it. When a man hath broken an Arme or a Legge, some fooles care <note place="margin">Arme or Leg broken.</note> no more but to be eased againe, so the Chirurgion can giue them somewhat to take away the ache, they go no further: but they who be wise doe not onely seeke to haue the paine slaked, but also to haue the bone well set againe, that by that meanes there be no blemish or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion to the rest of the body. So it is with a true Christian, he doth not onely desire to be rid of the paine of his sinne, the aches of his soule, but the very corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it also healed and mortified in him. <hi>Dauid</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynes these two together, <hi>Psal. 103. 2, 3.

So much of the connexion.</p>

                     </list>
                     <p>Now there be two kinds of Temptations obserue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which we are subiect to in the course of our liues.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 Of tryals and tentations to sinne.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>Tentation, is any present prouocation, or inclination to sinne, which is a bait laid by the Diuell, or our owne flesh against vs. When we pray therefore, not to be led into tentation, we pray that we may not haue any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation or inticement to sinne, that may ouercome or intrap vs, in leading vs from that loue, duty, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we owe vnto the Lord: so that the words in this first part of the Petition, containe two principall things.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 A Confession.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, in that we pray not to be led into tentation, <hi>Here is a close confession that our sinnes deserue it, that the Lord may iustly leaue vs vnto the will and power of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> As it is said of the <hi>Gentiles, Rom. 1. 24. Wherefore</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>also God gaue them vp to their hearts lusts, to doe things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely.</hi> So 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 11. It is said, because they went on <note place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 11.</note> in the loue of darknesse, &amp; receiued not the loue of the truth, that they might be saued; for this cause GOD should send them strong delusion, that they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue a lie. So that God in his iust iudgement giues vs vp to our sinnes, making one sinne the punishment of another. This the Lord shewes plainly in the parable of the Vineyard, <hi>Esay</hi> 5. 6. For so also a man that hath <note place="margin">Vineyard.</note> a Vineyard, as long as it beares well, hee will fence it, weed it, and hedge it, that no hurt come vnto it, but if it grow barren, and yeeld him no profit, then he causes the hedge to be throwne downe, pull away the wall, and let in Hogges, Swine, and Vermine to deuoure it. So doth God order and deale in the businesse of our soules, so long as we bring forth branches flourishing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18128:153"/>
and worthy the fruit of the Gospell, so long we are fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and tended well cared for of God. But when wee grow barren, bring forth bryers and weeds, then all our labour is lost: when although the Lord doth not let in hogges and swine, yet doth the Diuell and all the power of darknesse, come in vpon it: and blindes and hardens vs more and more; by reason that we haue abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the gifts and graces which the Lord first bestowed vpon vs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second part of this confession is, <hi>That we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding prone to yeeld vnto temptation:</hi> Wherefore wee acknowledge that the Lord in Iustice may giue vs vp to the temptations of the Diuell, for which cause we pray that we might not be tempted, because we find such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity in our selues that if we be tempted, (a thousand to one) we shall yeeld to the tentation: for the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man is like vnto dry Tinder, ready to kindle and <note place="margin">Drie Tinder.</note> take fire with euery little sparke. So ready are wee to be carryed away with euery little temptation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Sauiour Christ wills his disciples to pray, <hi>That they enter not into tentation,</hi> as knowing how feeble <note place="margin">Matth. 26. 41.</note> and weake they were to resist it. Men know not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, if they doe not know this, how ready and proue they be to lay hold on euery tentation, so that it is good for euery man to be iealous of himselfe. If one had a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">Body of Gun-powder.</note> all of Gunpowder, how carefull would he be not to come neere the fire, afraid of euery little sparke; euen so, knowing our owne procliuity to sinne, how ready euery sparke (that is, euery temptation) is to take hold vpon vs, we ought to be the more carefull, by all meanes to flie away from the occasions of it. O how ready are we to brag and vaunt of our strength, that all the Diuels in Hell shall not be able to corrupt vs: and thus many times associate our selues with Drunkards, Swearers and vncleane persons. Little do these men know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and their owne corruption, that they be so apt to take fire, and ready to yeeld to temptation. And albeit
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18128:154"/>
they scape away with life as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, yet many times they goe away halting, and carry a wound and scarre with them to their dying day. As let a man sticke a Candle to a stone wall, though the Candle do not burne <note place="margin">Candle on a wall.</note> through it, yet it will leaue a shrewd smutch behind it, soyling the wall, so as it will not easily be wyped out. Thus it is with tentations, though they doe not all the mischiefe they would and might doe, they will yet be sure to leaue an impression of filth and staines behinde them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second part of this first Branch of the Petition is, <hi>The Request,</hi> that seeing we are so prone to yeeld vnto  tentation, we pray that God would not leaue vs vnto our selues, or giue vs ouer to them, but that we may bee kept by his power and mercy, not onely from sinne, but from all the occasions of it: which shewes, if we would keepe our selues from sinne, we must shunne the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, baits and prouocations thereunto, or else not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding the occasion, we shall neuer auoyd the sinne it selfe, considering the procliuity of our nature vnto it. Can a man (saith <hi>Salomon)</hi> take fire in his bosome, and not be burnt? goe vpon coales and not singe his feet, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine many sinnes, and not be faulty? It is impossible. <hi>Peter</hi> (as we know) was as bold, and (in shew) as well setled as any man; but when he came vnto the high Priests Hall, and was thrust in amongst that wicked crew, he thought it was good policy to say as they said, doe as they did, and so most shamefully denyed his Master, but on the other side, good <hi>Joseph</hi> (as we reade) was not onely carefull to auoyde the sinne, but the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it, when he was inticed by his lewde Mistris: he hearkned not vnto her to lie with her, he durst not tarry in her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany. So that herein consists the wisdome of a Christian, to auoyd all the occasions and prouocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnto sinne. When the Lord determined to cause <note place="margin">Flood ceasing.</note> the flood of waters to cease from off the face of the earth: It is said he stopped the fountaines of the deepe,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18128:154"/>
and shut the windowes of heauen. So because there be certaine floods of sinne in vs, wee must stop the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines below, and the windowes aboue: all occasions and prouocations leading vnto it, that we may auoyde the torrent and ouer-flowing thereof. <hi>Chrysistome</hi> sayes well, <hi>It is an easier matter to auoyde the occasion, then when the occasion is offered, to auoyde the sinne. An easier thing for a bird to flie by a snare, then when shee is intanglèd with it, to escape out of the danger, and auoyd it.</hi> Thus must the wisedome of the Lord, teach vs wisedome to auoyd the occasion, as the sinne it selfe.</p>
                     <p>

For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, God gaue the <hi>Gentiles</hi> vp to their owne lusts: and by the Apostle it is said, He sent vpon others strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions: yet doth not God tempt a man to sinne, but the diuell onely, and his owne concupiscence, but God (in his Iustice) first giues way to the temptation, as is plaine by that place, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 20. Where God is brought in, <note place="margin">2 King. 22. 20.</note> asking this question: <hi>Who shall intice Ahab to goe down to battell, and fall at Ramoth Gilead?</hi> and so vpon the offer of an euill spirit, to performe this office: God sayes, <hi>Goe, thou shalt intice him, and shalt also preuaile.</hi> So that though God tempt no man to sin, yet no man is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the Lord is the chiefe orderer and guider of the temptation. As when a man sets a Dog vpon a Beare. <note place="margin">Dogge, Beare.</note> It is the Dog that flies vpon the Beare, and lugges him and puls him: but it is the man that sets the Dogge vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and guides, and ouer-rules him in all that hee doth. So is it in temptations, it is the Diuell and our owne flesh which tempts vs to sinne but it is God in his Iustice, that directs, ouer-rules, suffers the temptation

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>We pray against the euill of our owne Nature,</hi> that is, against those sinnes we are most prone, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to, for euery one hath some speciall sinne which haunts his nature aboue the rest.

And as this must be the continuall care of a Christian, so especially now when the blessings of God lie before vs, and we be ready to gather that which the good hand of GOD hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for vs, O then pray vnto God that wee bee kept from euill, from the euill of sinne that he doe not take away his blessings, or hide his countenance from vs: as <hi>Moses</hi> was desired to couer the shining brightnesse of his face. But intreat wee the Lord to come into his Vineyard, to enter vpon his blessings, and to inioy the fruit of our labours: and so to guide vs continually by the hand of his good prouidence: <hi>As we may not be led vnto tentation, but be deliuered from euill.</hi> And that for these reasons.</p>

                        <hi>Christ annexeth these, and doth propound Petitions without inforcing reasons?</hi> This was to shew with what earnestnesse, and excellent feruent intention, wee must pray to God, not slightly and coldly, but pressing him with arguments, being serious to obtaine what we pray for. But how doe many of vs pray, indeed it is with such deadnesse, and coldnesse, as if we did not greatly care whether our requests be granted or not. Now to correct &amp; mend this fault, our Sauiour shewes we must be serious and earnest in our suits. <hi>Dauid</hi> sayes, <hi>My voyce came to God when I cryed, My voyce came to God, and he heard me.</hi> Children be earnest when they craue, but <note place="margin">Children cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> when they cry, they are so importunate, that they will haue no nay.

This our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our shewes by the importunity of a friend, suing at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, (an vnseasonabletime) who beates, and knockes, and cals, and will not rest vntil he haue the three loaues that he came for.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Nay, this reason, if it be well weighed; hath a further  force in it, Namely, because <hi>the Kingdome is thine.</hi> So, O Lord! it belongs vnto thee, and is much for thy honour, to giue vs all these blessings and graces that wee pray daily for. For we all know that it belongs vnto a king to prouide for the comfortable and good estate of his owne subiects and seruants.

So it is with vs, when we doe not looke vnto

Heauen, but looke on feares and other things downe-wards, we by and by are in danger of drowning. It is a good thing therefore euer to looke vnto the power of God, considering that what is impossible to man, is possible with God, with whom all things are possible.</p>

The glory of God, is as it were the eye of God, his tenderest part, yea, such a part, as he will not haue touched: as <hi>I saiah</hi> speakes thereof. <hi>My glory will I not giue to another, (saith the Lord.)</hi> So though nothing in the world be in vs, and we haue no merit, being to fal into the dust, yet this is sure that the Lord will thinke vpon vs, as <hi>Dauid</hi> speaks, <hi>Psal. 40. 17.

It is an opinion of the Papists, that if a man haue a generall intent to pray, it is no sinne to entertaine wandring cogitations, so that a man may goe on with his beades, and finish vp the number of his dotish sayings for all his businesse.

First, <hi>It shewes him Generally what is sinne?</hi> for a man  by his owne light of his eyes and reason, is not able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his disease vnto himselfe, <hi>Rom. 3. 20. For by the Law commeth the knowledge of Sinne:</hi> and <hi>Chap. 7. 7. Nay, I knew not sinne but by the Law.</hi> So then, the law of God discouers and displayes sinne vnto vs. O, wee cannot see with the light of our owne eyes and vnderstanding, if God helpe vs not to see. Wee are not by nature inspired to know good and bad. No, vntill the law of God discouer vnto vs what sinne is, it is impossible for vs to discerne our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie. As a man that is brought into a darke roome cannot <note place="margin">A darke Roome.</note> tell how it stands, whether moated, or towards a yard or Orchard, nor how it is adorned, and made handsome and fine, or otherwise lyes sluttish and beastly, but bring a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle into the roome, or tarry till the Sunne riseth, and by and by euery thing is apparant: So let a man looke vpon the light of his owne reason or vnderstanding, and he will quickly fall into euery ditch, and runne headlong into the by-wayes of frailtie, corruption and wickednesse. But let God light vp the candle of his law, and by and by we shall see what is good, what is not good: what is lawfull, and what is vnlawfull for vs. This is the first vse of the Law in the man vnregenerate; it shewes him generally what sinne is, that it is a sinne to lye, to sweare, to make our table-talke of filthy actions, to be disobedient to superiours, and that wee must bee disrobed of our owne filthy estate. The Law of God I say, can discouer vs, whether wee offend in thoughts, words, or actions, and make it easily knowne what sinne and corruption dwelleth in vs. As the Lepers <note place="margin">Lepers, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 9.</note> said vnto themselues, 2. <hi>King. 7. 9. Wee doe not well, this day is a day of good tidings; Let vs rise, &amp;c.</hi> So the Law of God can make a man say vnto himselfe: I doe not well to lye, to sweare, to dice, to mispend the Sabboth: to riot in euill companie, to bee impatient, proud, couetous, a backbiter, &amp;c. O let me rise and get me away speedily from this miserable condition lest euill befall me.</p>

The second vse of the Law to a man vnregenerate is,  <hi>To shew him the Fearfulnesse of sinne,</hi> what a grieuous and fearfull thing sinne is: how dangerous for a simple man to offend so great a God, to incurre the indignation of so high a Maiestie. A woman hopeth she is with childe, when shee feeleth many stitches, longings, and other distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratures <note place="margin">Woman pained.</note> of her body, but when her greatnesse and swelling wombe appeares, then is shee assured, and not onely findes it so, but ere her deliuerance feeles diuers violent pangs and grieuous convulsions: So when men runne on in sin, the Law of God at length makes their wickednesse appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, not without perturbations, anguish and sorrow, till there bee a deliuerance from the same, and the hainousnesse of their transgressions; Againe, as a man hauing a foule bedurted, or bespotted face, doth neither know the same, <note place="margin">Dirtie face.</note> nor seeke to wash or make it cleane, till some friend bring him a glasse, or he himselfe looke in one of purpose, then is his ouglinesse quickly discouered, and hee is ashamed of his former deformity; so fareth it with a man in sinne, hee knoweth nothing, nor feeleth his owne wretchednesse, till the law of God acquaint him with his miserie, and shew him the ougly and bespotted face of his transgressions: yea, to bee loathsome and abominable, foule as any vile Lepers vnder the Law. Yea, the law of God pleades as it were in Gods behalfe: and saith, as in <hi>Isay 7. 13. Is it a</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Griefe and sorrow for the losse of God by reason of our sinnes:</hi> yea, the feare of this losse makes vs cry out as it is, <hi>Lament. 5. 16. The Crown of our head is fallen, woe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs that wee haue sinned;</hi> Oh how many passages are <note place="margin">Lam. 5. 16.</note> there in the Psalmes, of griefe, vexation of minde, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Conscience, yea, shedding of reares and such like, for the sinning against God, and this not onely in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Dauid,</hi> but in the behalfe of the Church of God, and to shew euery Christian, what a dangerous estate hee is in, that continueth in his wickednesse against God, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth him by his sinne.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Micah.</note> 17. 2. could not be quiet though hee had the money, and brought it; as long as hee thought his mothers curse lay heauy vpon him, but sought by all means to be reconciled, so fareth it with a man vnder sinne, after the Law hath told him what curse and vengeance hee is subiect vnto; O how can hee bee quiet or at peace, though hee bring all the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the world, if hee be not reconciled to God and his Word. If the Law of God hath once wrought vpon a man, that hee may see in what a desperate estate hee stands, then of all other things in the world, hee most desires to be reconciled to Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Law makes a man fit to receiue Christ, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knew not what it meant, for by shewing a man his sin, the greatnesse and grieuousnesse of the same, by making a man accuse himselfe, and confesse in what an estate hee is in: as farre as damnation, feare to lose God, shame to be in so desperate an estate, and a longing after the quietnesse of his soule, and purchasing the peace of conscience: consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

the Law cryes our vpon him with a loude voice, how hee hath incurred the wrath of God: then hath hee no other refuge, but to flie vnto Christ, and by his meanes to desire reconciliation with God, which must needs bee so, after the sight of his sinne: and this is the vse of the Law for the vnregenerate man.</p>

I make no question but the passing of the children of Israel through the Wildernesse into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was a type of Celestial <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for as they endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">Wildernesse passage.</note> many troubles, wants, &amp; distresses in that Wildernesse, famine, drought, heare, tedious and wearisome iourneys, not without repining and murmuring, before they came into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yea, when they were ready to enter and take possession, there was warres, feare, Giants, Iron gates, and high walls in their way, &amp;c. Euen so doe and must Gods children goe through the wildernesse of this world ere they come to heauen and life euerlasting, many afflictions, much sadnesse of heart, pouertie, scornes, despights, weaknesses, passions, repining and many mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings against God himselfe, yet at last the promises of the Gospell, and hope of eternall life, makes their ioy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and vnspeakable, and they enter into this Celestiall <hi>Canaan,</hi> maugre all the opposition of principalities and powers, and all their spirituall enemies: whilest hope beares them vp, and they beleeue they shall haue a blessed issue of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18128:175"/>
all their troubles and afflictions in the end. For as a man passing ouer a deepe and dangerous riuer into some deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <note place="margin">Deepe water.</note> meadow full of varietie of good things, endureth all the stormes, and perillous blasts of winde, or threatning of the tempest, in hope of the possession of the pleasures of the place, so fareth it with such who meane to make vse of the Gospell: the hope of eternall life and saluation, must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish all feares of our dangerous passages in this world, and ouercome all difficulties for our better comming to heauen, and this bee said of the first vse, seeing life and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation are thus proposed vnto vs by the Gospell of Iesus Christ.

                     <p>For the first of these, Faith is so excellent a thing, and so absolutely needfull to attaine the priuiledges of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as without this wee can doe nothing: and vntill this be lost or weakened, wee are safe and comfortable in all estates. For, as though a man fall into the hands of theeues, <note place="margin">Man in feare.</note> although they rob and spoile him of all hee hath, yea, leaue him starke naked in a wildernesse to winde and weather, yet if they take not away his life, there is some hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie, and a man may bee restored againe to a former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and labour to get more wealth, so fareth it with Gods children in the wildernesse of this world, although they are robd, spoyled, and bereaued of earthly blessings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied honour, riches, preferment; yea, left naked as it were in the Sunne, yet as long as faith remaines, and that they are constant in the beleeue of the promises of the Gospell, all other difficulties are ouercome by this grace, and life euerlasting which surmounteth all the rest, attained vnto at the last: how should euery one of vs then labour to pray for it, to nurse and entertaine this so excellent and profitable

                     <p>First for the Necessitie thereof, <hi>Repentance is such a necessary grace, as no man can bee saued without it,</hi> for there bee but two estates wherein euery man liuing may beesaued, the state of <hi>Innocencts,</hi> and the state of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18128:177"/>
                        <hi>Penitencie,</hi> vnto which belongs the Grace of Faith. Now no man liuing euer after the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> can be saued in the state of Innocencie, because wee bee all sinners and grieuous sinners before the Maiestie of God, so then hee that will bee saued must bee saued in the state of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitencie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There bee but two pleas that any man can make when hee shall stand before God in feare of Iudgement. Either <hi>Non peccaui Domine,</hi> Lord I haue not sinned: or <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine peccaui,</hi> Lord I haue sinned, <hi>Sed poenitet peccasse,</hi> it repents me that I haue sinned and offended. Now no man liuing can stand before God in the strength of this first plea, <hi>Non peccaui:</hi> Lord I haue not sinned: For <hi>Iam</hi> 3. 2. it is written in many things wee sinne all, and <note place="margin">Iam. 3. 2.</note> 1. <hi>Iohn 1. 8. If wee say wee haue no sinne wee deceiue our</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Iohn 1. 2. 1. King 8 46.</note> 
                        <hi>selues:</hi> And <hi>Salomon</hi> in his prayer hath it thus, 1. <hi>King. 8. 46. if they sinne against thee, for there is no man that sinneth not.</hi> So then, seeing no man liuing can lay hold on the former plea, <hi>Non Paccani,</hi> let vs all lay hold on the latter, <hi>Peccaui, sed poenitel peccasse,</hi> we haue sinned and offended, but it repents vs that wee haue so done. And thus wee see that Repentance is such a sauing grace, as no man liuing can bee saued without it, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures also agree to this thing, <hi>Act. 11. 18. Then hath God</hi>

                        <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 9.</note> 3. 9. hee sayes, <hi>Not willing that any should pperish, But that all should come to Repentance;</hi> so then if a man will not persist in his sinnes, the onely way is, to come to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance when God willeth him, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. he sayes <note place="margin">2.

But if hee care for these things, looke after the glorie of the life to come, desire the benefite of Saluation, then let him repent, if hee haue not repented already, lest it come too late, and a worse thing befall him; for it is a dangerous thing to withstand and let slip the fit seasons of Repentance, when Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie calls and mercies inuite vs thereunto: and when hee inlightens the eyes to see better things.

It must be our care to prouoke our selues vnto Repentance for our sinnes, to pray God that wee may bee healed and humbled, as wee shall heare hereafter. Euery sinne that wee commit in this world must haue a Repentance, for if wee repent not here on earth, wee shall not repent either in Heauen or hell; And therefore seeing Repentance is so necessarie, let vs now repent, if wee haue not repented already: for delayes are dangerous, and repentance is not in our power; besides that, diuers accidents may come which may hinder vs in this great worke of Grace.</p>

                        <hi>and that hee is a rewarder of those who diligently seeke him.</hi> So then wee see that there can bee no Repentance without faith: and Faith in order of nature is before Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. So it may bee a generall comfort to a man, that howsoeuer hee doe not feele Faith in himselfe, yet hee may assure himselfe that hee hath Faith, if hee haue Repentance for his sinnes, and a desire to reforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, from a sorrow and shame, that hee hath thus long offended God; because there is no Repentance without Faith. Therefore be assured whosoeuer thou art, if there bee a Repentance and Humiliation for sinne, make no doubt of thy faith, (though (as I said) thou dost not feele it) seeing Faith goes before Repentance.</p>
                     <p>Now for the better consideration of this, wee must know, <hi>The Difference betweene the workes of Faith and true Repentance.</hi> First, the Act or worke of true Faith is <note place="margin">1 Act of Faith. 2 Act of Faith.</note> generally to beleeue the promises of the Gospell, that all men who repent and beleeue shall bee saued. The second Act or worke of Faith is to beleeue that the promises bee proposed, but with a condition, If I my selfe can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and repent, I shall bee saued. Now when a man hath this worke of Faith in himselfe, this makes him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to repent his sinnes, to beleeue in Christ, and when hee hath repented and beleeued; then followes the great <note place="margin">3 Act of Faith.</note> act of Faith, whereby a man beleeues, that his sinnes are pardoned, and his soule shall bee saued: and so <hi>some acts of Faith gee before Repentance, and some follow after.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then, that Repentance shewes it selfe before Faith in the life of a Christian, is most euident and plaine. For first a man must needes bee humbled for his sinnes, hee must groane vnder the burden of them, and crie to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen against them, before hee can lay hold by Faith, that they nee pardoned and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

pardoned, or receiue comfort. <hi>I have sinned against the Lord,</hi> and then follows, <hi>The Lord also hath put away thy sinne, thou shalt not die.</hi> Many are the examples in the booke of God, where wee may see how the most part of the people of God were well and truly humbled by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance before Faith raised them.

                        </label> I answer, this difference ariseth of this; First, in some  there is apprehension of the ouglinesse of sinne so much, as nothing can fixe their conceits and imaginations ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way: in which case though comfort come, it cannot so soone make impression. Secondly, some doe so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly apprehend the Punishment due to sinne, that though Promises come, pardon be proclaimed, yet they remaine heauy and lumpish still, not being able to raise vp themselues, and set their Faith aworke to beleeue so good newes; though they haue repented of their sinnes. Where againe, in the other; First, there is a strong ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of the greater, which is the mercie of God beyond all, and a lesser sight of their owne sinne, which makes their act of Faith so much the more easie. And secondly, there is in them a large apprehension of Gods offering of redemption in Christ, and saluation in his blood, which with good affection they receiue and so are comforted: So that the case is, according as it falleth out diuersly in the Conuersion of a sinner; In whom there are two apprehensions; first, apprehension of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and guiltinesse of his sinnes; Secondly, an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the mercy of God offering of Redemption and Reconciliation in the death of Christ. Now because it falls out in the conuersion of a sinner, that somtimes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18128:180"/>
hee apprehends more strongly the one, and sometimes the other: that so accordingly is his ioy or sorrow great or small. And therefore if a man in his first conuersion, haue a more strong apprehension of his owne sinnes, and all his thoughts is carried vpon the beholding of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series and wofull estate, this makes him to lament and mourne bitterly, many a day together: but if at his first conuersion, with a sight of sinne, a man behold such an infinite sea and depth of Gods mercies, as is farre beyond all his sinnes: and the infinite merit of the death and sufferings of the Sonne of God; Euen as Flakes of fire <note place="margin">Flakes of fire.</note> falling into the Ocean sea, are quenched with the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of water: so all his sinnes falling into the maine sea and Ocean of Gods mercie in Christ, are all couered and put out: so as his heart is filled with ioy and gladnesse as it fell out with <hi>Lydia</hi> and the <hi>Eunueh, Act.</hi> 8. and others.</p>

First, wee haue heard the Necessitie of it. Secondly, the Order of it with other graces: and now in the third place, wee are to treate of <hi>The Nature of Repentance;</hi> and of this the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is a kinde of Faith and Repentance which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues vs in their Nature, for there are a number of men and women, that haue a shew of Repentance, and thinke themselues in a good estate, and well enough, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are not, and haue but a meere shadow of Grace, so that wee may not bee deceiued in a matter of such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and weight, I haue thought it good to make it knowne vnto you, what is the true Nature of Repentance.</p>

Yea, such as liue in grosse and knowne sinnes, can crie to God for mercie, and confesse their offences, and thinke they haue obtained a grace from God in so doing, seeming sorry for their sinnes, though yet they liue in knowne sinnes, as I said against their owne conscience,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18128:182"/>
and continue presumptuously in their wickednesse; Yea, how many thousands are there who neuer obtained any grace or mercy at all to bee sorry for their sinnes? O how farre short are these men from Repentance! to thinke that a little sorrow for sinne is it.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Againe, <hi>some thinke that euery godly motion is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>  so that if a man haue but a thought of God, and desire of Grace, by and by it is Repentance: But this <hi>Herod</hi> had, and did many things after <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> preaching gladly: This <hi>Agrippa</hi> had, when hee told <note place="margin">Act. 26. 28.</note>

                  <p>Thus hauing heard Repentance what it is not? let vs see Affirmatiuely what it is: <hi>It is an absolute change of</hi>

                     <hi>the whole man in purpose of heart and turning him to God and godlinesse, from his former courses and wicked life:</hi> So that it hath foure things in it; First, it is a change of a man. Secondly, it is a change of the whole man. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is such a change as turneth him in purpose of heart from all sinnes. Fourthly, such a change as turneth a man from all sinnes vnto God.</p>

                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:18128:183"/>
First, <hi>It is a change,</hi> as wee may see <hi>Rom. 12. 2. And bee not conformed to this world, but bee you transformed</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Rom. 12. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>by the renewing of your minde,</hi> And therefore where there is no change from the former naturall estate, there can be no Repentance; As bring fire into a roome, and it will <note place="margin">Fire.</note> make a change in the roome; it will make it light and warme, and sweet, &amp;c. Euen so if a man truly repent, it will make a change in his heart, in his life, in his cariage, speeches and conuersation. It will make a proud man humbled, a Couetous man to bee liberall, a Drunkard to bee sober and temperate; and an Adulterer to bee chaste; stubbornnesse it will change into gentlenesse and affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; to bee briefe, of impenitent, it will make one peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: As St. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes of himselfe to <hi>Timothie, I was a Blasphemer and a Persecuter,</hi> but Lord thou shewest <note place="margin">2.

Pet.</note> sayes, <hi>Wee were as sheepe gone astray, but now wee are turned vnto the sheepheard and Bishop of our soules.</hi> Therefore though men speake well, yet is this no true Repentance, vnlesse they be changed &amp; renewed in their mindes, and in their liues. Wee see <hi>Ierem.</hi> 3. 25. There <note place="margin">Ier. 3. 25.</note> the people spake well, for they said, <hi>Thou art my God and the guide of my youth,</hi> and yet the Lord complaines of them: <hi>Wee lye downe in our shame, and our confusion couereth vs; for wee haue sinned, wee and our fathers from our youth, euen to this day.</hi> So that Repentance is a change.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Repentance is not onely a change, but also <hi>It is a change of the whole man,</hi> not in one part, but in  all and euery part, of the iudgement, will and affections, of the inward and of the outward man wholly diffused. As when one puts wine into a glasse where water is, it <note place="margin">Wine in a glasse.</note> runnes into euery part thereof, and transformeth it selfe through all the water. So is it with the grace of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it doth not rest in one part, but it transferres it selfe into euery part of a man, it changeth the iudgement; it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18128:183"/>
changeth the will, it changeth the affections, it changeth euery facultie both outward and inward, in all the parts and powers of soule and body. Wherefore if a man be changed in one part and not in another, it is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>

                     </label> To this I answer. There is a double or twofold per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,  First, <hi>Of all the parts</hi> to haue them changed: Secondly, <hi>There is a perfection in euery part;</hi> as we see in a childe, there is all the parts of a man in it: as hands, <note place="margin">A childe.</note> armes, legges and so forth, but there is not perfection in those parts, it is not come to the full strength and growth: onely this is attained by degrees through the nourishment it takes: So it is in the worke of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, this makes a change in euery part, so that euery part is perfect in the part, though euery part be not come to perfection. <hi>Augustine</hi> makes it plaine, saith hee, when a man hath had sicknesse, and is recouered againe, there is health in all the parts, although hee be not so perfectly <note place="margin">Health.</note> recouered as to walke abroad, and haue not abilitie to doe this or that thing: and thus where there is true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, there is a change in euery part, First, There is a change of the <hi>Minde and Iudgement,</hi> that whereas it <note place="margin">The change Repentance workes. 1 In the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> did like well of sinne and approoue of it, and to say in defence thereof with <hi>Ionas,</hi> I did well to bee angry, I did well to sweare, I did well to lye, I did well to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Sabboth, I did well to backbite my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to deceiue and cozen, and such like. When Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance comes, it changeth all so, that whereas before one did like well of sinne, now one doth quite dislike and distaste it, and is ready to fling the first stone at it. See this in <hi>Dauid, 2. Sam.</hi> 24. 14. hee thought hee had done <note place="margin">2. Sam. 24. 14.</note> well in cauling to number the people. No body could haue perswaded him to the contrary: But when Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance came, it made a change in his Judgement, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18128:184"/>
made him confesse that <hi>Hee had done very foolishly.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> was of this minde, hee thought hee had done well in persecuting the Saints, and shutting them vp in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, in wasting and making a hauocke of the Church: doing of many things contrary to the Saints. But Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance wrought a change in his iudgement: <hi>Oh</hi> (saith hee) <hi>I did this ignorantly:</hi> I did not know it was a sinne to doe so. Therefore where there is not a dislike of sin, but a delight in it, there is no true repentance; because Repentance so changes the iudgement, as it makes them say with the Lepers, 2. <hi>King. Wee doe not well to stay here</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. King.</note> 
                     <hi>so long, let vs goe and remooue, &amp;c.</hi> So Repentance will make men say, wee did not well to be angry, sweare, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>So likewise <hi>True Repentance makes a change in the Will, both in regard of sinnes past, as likewise in respect of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 In the will.</note> 
                     <hi>sinnes to come:</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, for sinnes past, the will is so set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, that if they were now to bee done, they would not for a world doe them. What would <hi>Dauid</hi> haue giuen after his Repentance for his Adulterie and murder, that hee had neuer committed the same, yea any thing. What would not <hi>Peter</hi> haue giuen that hee had neuer denyed his Master? which made him shed so many teares. It is true, when sinne is once committed, all the powers in Heauen and Earth cannot vndoe it againe. Onely Repentance doth as much as may bee, to make sin no sinne in effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>It makes a Change in regard of sinnes that are to come,</hi> They would not doe any thing willingly that would offend God, or to grieue the holy Spirit: So wee see in <hi>Iob 40. 5. Once</hi> (saith hee) <hi>I haue spoken, but I will speake no more, yea twice, but I will proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iob. 40. 5.</note> and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3. saith hee, <hi>It is sufficient that we haue</hi>

                     <hi>spent the time past after the lusts of the flesh:</hi> and <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. sayes, <hi>The good that I would doe that I doe not:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom 7.</note> 
                     <hi>and the euill I would not doe, that doe I.</hi> As if he would say, I would not grieue the spirit: I would not offend
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18128:184"/>
God for a world, but my corruptions carry mee so vnto it, that I cannot choose: Therefore if there bee a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to sinne, there is no true repentance.</p>

                     <note place="margin">3 In the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>So likewise it makes a Change in the Affections. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First,  whereas formerly sinne was our ioy and delight; Now wee sorrow for it, and it is grieuous vnto vs. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly,  whereas before wee committed sinne with boldnesse, now wee are ashamed of it. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, whereas before we loued it, now wee hate it: So that it is cleere that there is a change made in the affections thereby: first to instance, whereas at first wee tooke delight and ioyed to sinne: now such doe sorrow, mourne, and lament for it: as <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</hi> 31. it is said, <hi>I haue surely heard Ephraim lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>

                     <hi>thou hast chastised mee and I was chastised.</hi> And <hi>Psal. 6.

For the next, whereas before wee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sinne with boldnesse, wee now become ashamed of it, and therefore if wee can sinne and not be ashamed of it, but beare it out with boldnesse of face, it is a signe our repentance is not true.

For true Repentance worketh vpon sinners in the same manner: The hands now take vp a Bible, and with as great delight reade the word of God, as they before followed their sports: the feete that carried the body to houses of iniquitie, are now as ready to carry them to the house of Christ: the Eares that were woont to hearken to lasciuious talke, and bee taken with amorous loue-songs, are now attentiue to Sermons and the word of God. The eyes that were rouling about to meet with temptations, are now fixed on a Preacher, and haue a couenant made with them: In a word, the heart and affection that was fraughted with sinfull and idle fancies and motions, are now full of holy meditations, and busied with diuine exercises.</p>

him, by Repentance a man turnes vnto God againe, as one willing to be gouerned and guided by him in all his courses: for vnlesse this bee, it can bee no true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The nature whereof is, as wee haue heard at large: It remaines in the next place that wee come to treate of <hi>The causes of Repentance,</hi> which are of three sorts.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Cause of Repentance </seg>1</label> For the first, <hi>The principall efficient cause is God,</hi> for it is God onely who can make vs repent, no man can  worke it, wee cannot compasse it our selues, but God must worke it by the graces of his holy Spirit: as <hi>Paul</hi> hath it, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. saith hee, <hi>Proouing if God perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture will</hi>

                     <hi>giue them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.</hi> Whereby hee prooues that God onely is the giuer of Repentance, and no good duty can bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vnlesse God stirre a man vp vnto the same: So ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the Church of the Greekes, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 18. <note place="margin">Act. 11. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted Repentance vnto life,</hi> And <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 29. it is there said, in <hi>Moses</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Yet the Lord hath not giuen you an heart to perceiue, and eyes to see, and eares to heare vnto this day.</hi> So that God is the principall cause of Repentance.</p>
                  <p>A number thinke that Repentance is a worke in a mans owne power, that it is like the Apothecaries. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick <note place="margin">Physicke.</note> which a man may set in his window and take it as his stomacke serues him: So they thinke that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance may rest vpon a mans owne will; yea, many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to say, that if they may haue but one houre to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in before the day of death, it is as good as though they had had a whole yeare to thinke vpon it. But you see that Repentance is not in our power, it is a gift, a worke of God, so that wee cannot repent when wee will, but when God will: therefore it must bee our care to take repentance when God proffers it, and wills it. Looke in the story of <hi>Esau. Heb.</hi> 12. 17. hee once refused it, and sought it afterwards with teares, but could not obtaine <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 17.</note>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:18128:187"/>
his father to reuerse the blessing: much lesse could hee sue to God for mercy. So then, take heed of despising Gods mercy, for if a man will not take repentance when God offers it, hee may seeke it; yea, seeke it with teares, and yet because he despised and neglected it, when it was offered vnto him, hee may goe without it. Therefore take notice, that the spirit is willing to worke life in thee, and breed good motions; therefore doe thou take heed to cherish these good motions of repentance, holy thoughts and resolutions, lost when thou wouldest haue it, thou be refused.</p>
                  <p>The Papists who hold the doctrine of Free-will, say, <note place="margin">P. P.</note> that if God make a motion of Repentance, it is in a mans owne power to repent, or not to repent, as if a man should shew a horse a bottle of Hay: that it is without <note place="margin">Bottle of Hay.</note> doubt that by and by hee will runne after it; so say they, let God make but the motion, by and by, man by the power of his owne Free-will, will runne to imbrace it, but the truth is, such is the estate of a sinner; that hee is in a worse estate then a beast. For to come to their owne comparison of a Horse and Hay. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, hee must haue  eyes to see the Hay, for if hee see it not, he cannot be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie to runne after it, for <hi>Coeco nulla cupide.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, he must haue an appetite and stomacke to care the Hay,  which if hee haue not, hee will not bee hastie to runne after it, or haue a desire to eate it. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, besides his  eyes and stomacke, hee must haue strength and iollitie, or else hee will neuer rise and runne after it, for although there bee eyes to see, and a desire to bee satisfied, yet if there be no strength to rise and catch it, hee is neuer the better. Now say that all these three bee in a horse, yet none of these are in a man, nor in a mans will, vntill God worke and fulfill them by his mightie power. For, first a man hath not eyes to see the good things of God, <hi>Deut.</hi>

For it is God which worketh in you both the will and the deed,</hi> (or to <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> will and to doe) of his good pleasure. Thirdly, though wee had eyes to see good things, and will to delight in them, yet haue wee no strength and power to performe them vntill God will: as <hi>Iohn 15. 5.

cause thereof, for though God giue Repentance (it being wrought by him in vs) yet hee doth it by meanes, wee must not thinke that God will open the Cloudes and come downe from heauen, and poure Repentance into our hearts, or drop it in vs, but hee hath ordained that wee shall get it by the preaching of the Word, for thereby wee are made partakers of the graces of his holy Spirit. Now consider there are two things to effect this, The Preaching of the Law, and the preaching of the Gospell, the first that a man may see his sinne, and the fearefull estate hee is in by the same: The second, that he may finde there is a remedie, and that it is not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. The Law prepares a man for Repentance, shewes him all his sinnes, and his damnable estate before; yea, it terrifies the conscience euen to the very flinging of him downe to hell: and though this be not an infallible signe of grace to be thus terrified and restrained, yet it is the occasion of it, because it helpes to prepare vs, and make vs willing to lay hold of Repentance as God workes in vs. As a man that makes choice of a tree to build with, <note place="margin">Tree.</note> first he cuts it downe with his axe, ere hee lay it flat vpon the ground, and when he hath done so, then hee applyes his line and tooles vnto lopping the boughes, and so hewes it, and squares it to make it the fitter for his worke. Euen so doth the Lord; first hee beates a man flat downe with the sentence of the Law and horrour of his sinne, and then hee lifts him vp and restores him with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Gospell: And whereas many thinke that it is a strange worke of God to deale thus with a man, and that when God doth deale thus, that man is in a wofull and lamentable estate: the truth is, that then the Law (from God) is a fitting and working a man, to bee fit for eternall life, and thus though the Law cannot bring a man to Repentance, yet it is a meanes of preparation: And then after this commeth the Gospell, as a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full instrument, and workes Faith and other Graces in vs by a diuine assistance.</p>

Efficient cause, Thirdly, there must bee a certaine oylie and liquide matter to make the Saw runne; which is <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa adiuvans:</hi> the Helping cause: which smoothes the Saw and makes it runne with case: So it is in this great worke of Repentance: the Saw or Instrument to worke, is the preaching of the Gospell, which doth sawe and worke vpon the conscience, as the Instrument of God: and God himselfe is the effectuall puller or workeman to worke Repentance in vs. So that</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The third helping or furthering Cause is, our owne</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3 Psal. 119.</note> 
                        <hi>Considerations: as Psal. 119. Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>I considered my wayes, and turned my feete to thy testimonie,:</hi> So vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till wee come to consider our owne wayes, wee can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer turne vnto God. Now this consideration must bee in foure things: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, of the strict account wee must  giue vnto God at the day of Iudgement, for all those sinnes wee doe not repent of in this world. If wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, then the Lord will forgiue vs, but if wee doe not repent, bee assured wee must answer for our sinnes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as vpon repentance, Christ will answer for vs, and wee may confidently put away the reaccount lying vpon Christ: vnto which the Apostle alludes, 2. <hi>Cor. 1. 5. For</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 5.</note>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, of the  fearefull estate wherein wee liue vntill wee haue repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: not being the friends of God but heires of hell, not hauing interest in any promise: but liable to the Curse of the Law, vpon which ensues death and torments. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Which is the third thing: those vnspeakable tortures  the soule for euer shall endure with the deuill and his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18128:191"/>
angels for euermore. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the consideration of foure  other things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, <hi>The Necessitie of Repentance,</hi> that is is such a  necessarie grace that wee cannot bee saued without it, for there is but two wayes, either to Repent or else to perish, For if a man weresicke, and a Physitian should come to <note place="margin">A sicke man.</note> him and temper for him such a Potion, which if hee did not take, hee could not choose but dye, one would thinke a man could not choose but take it, though it were against his stomacke: Euen so wee are all sicke of the disease of sinne, and the Lord hath tempered a Potion for vs to drinke, and hee telleth vs, if wee doe not take it, we shall not escape condemnation. Now this Potion, which the Lord hath tempered for vs, is Repentance, therefore wee must bee contented to take it though it bee against our stomacke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The <hi>Second</hi> consideration is, <hi>The vtilitie and profite wee haue by it,</hi> for if wee repent God will forgiue vs, but if wee repent not, God will make vs answer for it at the great day of Iudgement: here is our choice, Repent and bee forgiuen, Repent not and perish: so the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Forgiuenesse vpon Repentance, <hi>Isa. 1. 18.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The <hi>Third</hi> Consideration is: <hi>The readinesse of God to receiue vs;</hi> then hee will turne his frowning anger into  louing fauour, his cursings into blessings, his iudgements into mercies; so soone as the Prodigall sonne came home to his Father, wee see how willing and how ready hee was to receiue him: So it is with euery sinner so soone as hee returneth home to God, the Lord is presently readie to receiue him, and to forgiue all that is past.</p>
                     <p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
The <hi>Fourth</hi> is, <hi>That one day wee shall dye, and know not how soone,</hi> when, if wee die without Repentance, wee must be damned for euer. Therefore, this should make vs repent and turne vnto God. I remember the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a learned man: saith hee; The estate of a sinner <note place="margin">One in a iourney.</note> is like a man trauelling or going a iourney, and as hee went, hee fell into a pit full of snakes, toades and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Generall time of Repentance, is <hi>the Time of this life;</hi> for there is no repenting when a man is dead. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">1 In this life.</note> here are two rules in the Generall. First, that this whole life is the time of Repentance. Secondly, that after death it is a worke cannot be done. Therefore let no man presume of further mercy then he is able to call for, which is in the time of this life. All the Scripture is cleere for this: as <hi>Iohn 9. 4. I must worke the worke of him that sent</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iohn. 9. 4.</note>

                     <hi>thy hand findeth to doe, doe it with thy might, for there is no worke or deuice, nor knowledge, nor wisedome in the graue whither thou goest;</hi> and this wee see that as the time of doing good is in this life, so is the time of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18128:193"/>
and as wee can doe nothing being dead, no more can wee repent being dead. For this purpose <hi>Ieremie</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 13. 16.</note> reasoneth with the people, <hi>Giue glorie to the Lord your God, before hee cause darkenesse, and before your feet stumble vpon the darke mountaines.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Psal. 39. vlt.

                     <hi>I goe hence and bee no more:</hi> So then if wee haue any thing to doe, doe it with all thy might; if thou haue to repent, repent earnestly; if thou haue to pray, pray feruently: if thou haue to heare, heare diligently: if thou haue to giue, giue cheerefully, for when thou art in the graue, all opportunitie is gone, all time is taken away. I remember a pretty meditation of a learned man, saith he; As long as a murtherer is in the way to the Iudgement seate, hee may make friends to compasse the matter, but if the Iudge haue giuen sentence and hee bee condemned, then hee may looke for the hangman, for the sword, and for the halter, and for the darke dungeon. Euen so as <note place="margin">Murderer.</note> long as wee are in the way to the Iudgement, that is, as long as wee are in this life, wee may labour to compasse the matter, wee may make friends with God, but if once wee be dead and the sentence haue passed, wee may looke for the diuell and hell to seaze vpon vs, and therefore (saith hee) <hi>my good brethren, let not the time of your life passe without Repentance,</hi> for death will come, and the iudgement will come: therefore grieue and sorrow, mourne and lament, whilst you haue time and liue here.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, that all the wicked in Hell shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent euery veine in their hearts, when they shall see what styes and stables they haue made of their bodies, by their sinnes of Idolatrie, Adulterie, Drunkennesse, Swearing and prophanenesse, they shall mourne and lament, and waile for it: but they shall haue no benefite or profite thereby, for this bond of Repentance shall be <hi>Afflictiue</hi> and <hi>Poenall,</hi> it shall bee to their further increase of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: therefore if wee would haue comfort by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18128:194"/>
wee must repent betimes in this life, for it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to sorrow and mourne here where wee may haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, then hereafter, when we can haue none. In world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly businesse, either planting, building, or purchasing, we make haste whilst wee liue to see all things done betimes, and settled during our liues, nay, wee thinke it will not bee so well done, as when wee our selues ouersee it: And shall wee not much more regard the preparing and fitting of our selues for Heauen, which cannot bee done vnlesse wee faithfully repent in the time of this life so, as it was commanded to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to settle his house in order, for <note place="margin">Hezekiah.</note> hee should die: so are wee pressed to the duty of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, before wee die, that in our life, our soules may bee prepared for Heauen. Is it not then high time for all wicked men to prepare themselues to Repentance in this life, considering all hope is debarred them after death?</p>

                        <hi>and sure, then that which is deferred,</hi> for wee know not if God will grant vs time, or not, to repent hereafter. Wee that are in the Church to day, may be in our graues tomorrow; and though hee doe giue vs time, wee know not whether hee will giue vs the meanes or grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and if hee doe giue vs the meanes, wee doe not know whether hee will blesse the meanes vnto vs. Therefore it is good for vs to repent whilst it is to day, whilst it is offered vs. This was it which made <hi>Isaac</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue to blesse his children betimes, <hi>Genes. 27. 3.

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Because early Repentance is more fruitfull</hi>

Indeed if a man forsake sinne in the strength of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and repent, God hath the greater glorie in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, though affliction worke it. Of the storie of the Prodigall, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. what sweet passages are there for time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> repentances, and to personate a mercifull God, by a wise and mercifull Father, let the world say what it can, and men iudge as they list, hee that supposeth himselfe most righteous must repent, as it is in Christs inuectiue against the too forward Iewes, <hi>Luke 13. 5.

If a man haue made himselfe a great burden to carry, and should <note place="margin">Great Burden.</note> assay it on his backe, and so hee findes it vneasie, and to presse him very much, if he should then throw it downe and put a great deale more vnto it, and then begin to lift it againe, but vpon the second tryall finding it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier then before, if hee should fall in a great rage, till hee adde twice as much strength and labour to carry it the lighter; would wee not thinke such a one foolish, thus wilfully to increase his burden? so is it with the children of this world; because they finde Repentance somewhat vneasie at first, they cast it from them, and by that time they come againe (hauing added more sinnes, and made their burden heauier) they are compelled to their greater sorrow and greater Repentance, to wrastle with so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous a burden, at a wondrous great disaduantage.</p>

As wee see in experience, vsually one will make more account of an old seruant then of a new, hee will <note place="margin">Old seruent.</note> commit more trust to him, and bee more familiar with him. Euen so the Lord makes more reckoning of an old Disciple, then of a new, wherefore by all these reasons wee may see, that early Repentance is better then late.

Secondly, it is a speciall time of Repentance, <hi>When any iudgement of God, either publike or priuate falls vpon vs;</hi> as the Prophet shewes, <hi>Isa. 26. 16. Lord in trouble haue</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Isa 26 16.</note> 
                        <hi>they visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening was vpon them.</hi> So <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 40. saith the Church, <note place="margin">Lam 3 40.</note> 
                        <hi>Let vs search and try our wayes, and turne vnto the Lord.</hi> When God sends sicknesse, blindnesse, or lamenesse, losse in our goods friends, reputation, preferment, or such like, then is a speciall tune to repent vs of our sinnes. For it is a sure thing that the iudgements of God come by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our sinnes, and so questionlesse God will renew his iudgements, if wee renew our sinnes; which cannot be remooued but by Repentance. If a mans house be on <note place="margin">House on fire.</note> fire, he will carry out his Flaxe and Towe, Wood and Straw, with euery thing else which is fit and likely to augment the fire: and then doth hee cry for helpe and poure on water to quench it; euen so because our sinnes doe nourish the fire of Gods wrath, and will consume our soules, if wee doe not carry them out of sight by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, therefore we should set about this worke: and take away all that matter which may increase the fire of Gods vengeance vpon vs: which is to put away our sinnes by repentance; as wee see <hi>Deut. 9. 20. Moses</hi> did, for thus <note place="margin">Deut. 9. 20.</note> he records it; <hi>And the Lord was very angry with</hi> Aaron <hi>to haue destroyed him: and I prayed for</hi> Aaron <hi>the same time.</hi> Here you see how a iudgement was remooued by <hi>Aarons</hi> repentance, and <hi>Moyses</hi> prayer. Wee see if the Kings Writs be out against a man to attach him, Bayliffs and Sherifes lying in wait for him in euery corner to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest him: such a man will presently labour to compasse the matter, and bring it to agreement for feare of impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment: So when the Writs of God are out against vs, <note place="margin">Kings Writs.</note> and his Iudgements like Sergeants and Baylifes dogge vs in euery corner: what should we doe in this case? but labour to compasse the matter betimes to bee wiser for our soules and immortalitie, then they are for a little tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall punishment in this life: and to make a good vse of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18128:199"/>
Gods iudgements vpon others: the omission whereof, made the Spirit of God complaine thus, <hi>Reuel. 9. 20. And</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Reuel. 9. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>the remnant of the people which were not killed by these plagues, repented not of the workes of their hands,</hi> where the Lord complaineth of them, that they had no regard to his iudgements. So <hi>Amos 4. 6. And I also haue giuen</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Amos 4. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>you cleannesse of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places, yet haue yee not returned vnto mee, saith the Lord.</hi> The like we haue, <hi>Ier. 5. 3. Thou hast striken</hi>

                        <hi>them, but they haue not grieued, thou hast consumed them, but they haue refused to receiue correction, &amp;c.</hi> So that by these places you see, it is a speciall time for vs to call vpon God when his hand is vpon vs, and wee see ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly, that our sinnes doe pull his iudgements neerer and neerer vs.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>When God affoords vs any speciall meanes, then hee lookes for speciall actions and affections, in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning towards him:</hi> as at the comming of <hi>Iohn Baptist, Math. 3. 10. And now also the axe is layed vnto the roote</hi>

                        <hi>this ignorance God winked at, but now hee commandeth all men euery where to repent;</hi> So that when God sends spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall meanes, this is a speciall time of Repentance. Ships <note place="margin">Ships.</note> that haue lyen long in the harbour, yet as soone as the winde blowes, by and by they set forward to their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded iourney, as it is said, <hi>Act. 27. 13.

                        <hi>blew softly (supposing that they had obtained their purpose) they loosed thence.</hi> Euen so should we doe, when we haue lyen long in the harbour of sinne, done little good in Religion, or to the Church of God, yet when the winde blowes, when God offers gratious and good meanes, when we haue so faire an opportunitie, we should
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18128:199"/>
lay hold vpon the good things that be for our saluation. So that this must needs be a fearefull abuse of Gods kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and goodnesse; that when it is a speciall time of Repentance: through our corruptions wee make it a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall time of wantonnesse and vncleannesse, and wee are so farre from being the better for all our speciall meanes, that wee become worse and worse: and so bring iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon vs. Our Sauiour Christ <hi>Math.</hi> 11. doth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid <note place="margin">Math. 11.</note> those Cities wherein hee had done most of his great workes, because for all this they had not repented them of their sins, where he tells them <hi>That it shall be easier for</hi> Sodome <hi>and for</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the day of Iudgement, then for them:</hi> So if wee doe not profite by the preaching of the Word, and the good meanes which are amongst vs at this day: the estate of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gommorrah</hi> at that great day, shall be easier and better then ours. So let vs take heed it be not so with vs, for what a fearefull signe of damnation is this? when wee thus set open the gates of hell, by being no more carefull to come to Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and other sauing graces, in the midst of such abundance of meanes?</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it is a speciall Time of Repentance, <hi>when wee goe about any great worke:</hi> For many times in our honest labours, there are many crosses and troubles which doe befall vs, because we haue not repented. Therefore it must bee our wisedome, when wee goe about any great worke which wee would haue to prosper, then to repent, lest we incounter with great crosses. So <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 21. hee <note place="margin">Ezra 8. 21. Esth. 4. 16. 2. Chron. 20. 12 Iesh. 7. 11. 12.</note> practised: So <hi>Esther</hi> 4. 16. So <hi>Iehoshaphat, 2. Chron.</hi> 20. 12. The omission of this dutie you see was dangerous, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 7. 11. 12. they could not stand before their enemies, saith God vnto <hi>Ioshua, Vp,</hi> Israel <hi>hath sinned, and they haue trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed my Couenant, therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies:</hi> Euen so it is with vs, wee cannot stand before our enemies, God doth not blesse our labours, indeauours, nor any thing wee take in hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18128:200"/>
wee doe not prepare our selues vnto Repentance, therefore (as I said) when we haue a great work in hand, it is a speciall time of Repentance, and herein wee must imitate the seruants of God in their examples, when <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> had a great iourney to goe: first he fasted and prayed: so many other of the Saints forenamed: this was their practise, and so must it bee ours, chiefly when wee come to heare the Word, or receiue the Sacran <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As a man that would draw a riuer into his <note place="margin">Riuer drawne.</note> ground, he must first prepare the channell, cut downe the bankes, and stop the passages; so must men doe with their sinnes, that would haue the riuer of Gods mercie to runne through their hearts.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The Fifth speciall time of Repentance is, <hi>Eeuery mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when wee arise, and euery night when wee goe to bed:</hi>  For as wee sin daily, so must wee daily renew our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, let vs then repent euery morning before wee rise. The steward who hath but a short memorie, will be often <note place="margin">Steward.</note> casting vp his accounts and reckoning with his Master, he will neuer let them tarry too long without cleering and making euen, so because that our memorie is short, and that wee soone forget our sinnes, we should desire to haue often reckoning with the Lord euery day to make euen with him. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> we would thus often doe, wee should haue but a few sins to repent vs of when wee come to die.

Hee talkes <note place="margin">Psal. 6.</note> of a vexed soule, wearisomenesse with groaning, making his bed to swimme with teares, consuming of his eyes, and the like: so must our Repentance come with sighes, groanes, weeping and wringing of the heart (if it were possible) that so wee be the better assured, that it is vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and rightly bred; and that it is such vnto which God will haue respect.</p>

Euen as a man that hath beene at great charges for the building of a ship to carrie himselfe safely a very long <note place="margin">Ship building.</note> iourney, when hee is ready to put foorth into the sea, then hee especially lookes, that all his Masts, Sayles, Anchors, and Tacklings be ready, fit and prepared; so howsoeuer a man deale with his Faith, Repentance, and other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all his life time, yet now when at the houre of death, hee comes to lance forth into so rough a Sea, for his last iourney; he must then looke all ouer againe, and see that nothing be wanting, but that his faith, prayers, peneten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, loue, and such like, be in a readinesse for to conduct him in peace and safetie vnto the end of his last iourney. But commonly men doe by Repentance, as great men doe by Banquets, when a great Feast comes: they sit and gaze <note place="margin">Banquets.</note> and admire, but their stomacks are gone; many in this case haue no stomacks to eate: So many men looke at these excellent things of God, admire them, but will not eate: will not repent, leaue their sinnes, &amp;c.

For (as I then shewed) if a man haue a little Brook which runs through his ground, as long as hee keepes the channell cleane, pulls vp the weeds, and durt, and sand from stopping it vp, hee is sure it will not annoy him, nor ouerflowe his bankes: So as long as a man doth daily renew his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18128:202"/>
and pull vp the weedes of his sinnes from his heart, hee shall be sure that the riuer of Gods mercy will runne smoothly and currently into his soule, thus then you see Repentance is a daily duty, and onely in the time of this life to be performed: as wee commit daily sinnes, so had wee need of daily Repentance.</p>
                  <p>Now the next point we are to speake of, is of <hi>The Practise of Repentance,</hi> or manner how wee must Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for it may bee some men will bee readie to except and say, seeing Repentance is such a necessarie duty, as no man liuing can be saued without it, and seeing the time of this life is nothing else, but a time left of God to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and so I am willing to performe this great worke, but alas, I know not how, nor in what manner I should repent: so that as the Disciples said vnto Christ, <hi>Luk. 11. 1.

                  <p>Wherefore wee are to know that in the practise of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, there must be foure seuerall things, that is, in the presenting of our selues before the Throne of Gods Maiestie, and attempting or performing this our duty of Repentance; for the acquisition of our saluation, there must be,</p>

to come to the knowledge of his sinnes, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know his sins, but by examining his heart, and his owne wayes, that he may finde out his owne strayings and wandrings from the Lord, by the righteous rule of the Law of God, the word of God must be the candle to light the minde, and to direct and shew what is good and what is bad, what is sin, and what is not sin, what is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vnto God, and what is displeasing vnto him. As may be seene, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 40. saith the Church there; <hi>Let vs</hi>

                     <hi>search and trie our wayes, and turne againe vnto the Lord.</hi> Meaning that vnlesse we will seeke and search into our owne hearts to finde out the things that are amisse; and so seeke and search, as a man looking diligently for a thing lost, who lighteth a candle and searcheth euery cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <note place="margin">Thing lost.</note> till he hath found the thing, we shall neuer be able to finde out all our sinnes: So the Prophet sayes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. <note place="margin">Psal, 119. 59.</note> 59. <hi>I considered my wayes and turned my feet vnto thy testimonies.</hi> Seeing then it was the consideration of his owne wayes, which made him turne into the wayes of God, let vs practise the same. The like wee haue in the storie of the Prodigall sonne, <hi>Luk. 13. 19. And when he</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>came to himselfe, he said, I will returne to my father, &amp;c.</hi> When he had examined his owne state and condition, then it came into his minde to returne vnto his Father: so then the Point is, <hi>That in the Practise of Repentance there must bee examination of our owne wayes,</hi> which is a thing contrary to the course of the world, who are prone to looke into other mens wayes and neglect their owne. The beasts <hi>Reuel: 4. 8. were full of eyes within,</hi> but the most men haue eyes without to looke into other mens secrets, but not into their owne faults at home: such men may be likened vnto husbands, who because they haue vnquiet wiues at home, loue as much as may be <note place="margin">Ill wife.</note> to be abroad, because they can no sooner put their heads within the doores, but by and by their wiues are vpon them, euen so it is with him that hath a bad conscience, as with him that hath a bad wife, no sooner hee can come
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18128:203"/>
home into himselfe, but by and by his conscience is vpon him, ready to raile at him and rebuke him for his sinnes, so that he longs as much as may be to be abroad, and to deale with other mens sinnes, rather then his owne. But <hi>Paul</hi> tells vs 1. <hi>Cor. 11. 31. That wee must iudge our</hi>

                     <hi>selues, if wee would haue God not to iudge vs.</hi> Therefore euery Christian man should set vp a Tribunall and Iudgement seate in his owneheart, and make a solemne arraignement of himselfe, that is to say, that he so set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before God, that he first vndertake the triall of his owne wayes, and consider wherein he hath offended, and what sinnes he hath committed against him, then he must bring the bills of indictment against himselfe, make a presentment of his owne faults, where hee hath sinned, when offended, and how displeased so good a God. And thus euery man must iudge himselfe, that God doe not iudge him: for a iudgement must come. St. <hi>Austen</hi> sayes well, <hi>That so often as a man remembers his sinnes, God forgets them.</hi> If thou examine thy selfe, God will vrge no further; if thou iudge and condemne thy selfe, God will not iudge thee; if thou punish thy selfe, God will spare thee. So then this is the first Point, wee must exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our selues how wee haue offended. Now in this exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination there are two things required:</p>

To this effect St. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12.

                  <p>Now for the heads which wee must examine all our sinnes by, they be,</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>And God is the Iudge of all, that is, wee must examine our selues of all our sinnes committed against God, and against our Brethren. There is a corruption in nature in the examining of our sinnes, wee deale by our selues as a false Iudge doth by an offendor: examine him so slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">False Iudge.</note> that one may see he would willingly saue him: or that he is affraid to finde him faulty: euen so in the examining of our selues at the best, wee looke but at our outward sinnes, being loath to search into the inward secrets of our soules, to finde out the poyson and corruption of our hearts, for from the heart commeth all manner of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesses: so that the true examination must be of all our sinnes, so farre foorth as by any meanes wee can come to the knowledge of them: both of sinnes against the first and second Table, secret or open what kinde soeuer they be. Trads-men you know (especially in great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) <note place="margin">Tradsmen.</note> vse to keepe a booke of all their expences, of their layings out and commings in, and so are often casting vp their accounts to see whether they gaine or lose in matters of the world, so we should take an account of all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and keepe a register of them; euery night we should cast ouer our accounts, to see how wee haue sinned and offended God, and how often, how wee haue repented: if we finde things to be well; wee should blesse God for it, and if wee finde things to be amisse, we should be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in our soules for it: thus we must labour to view all
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18128:204"/>
our actions: as wee see God did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. when God had <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> made an end of his first dayes worke, and so of the rest, it is said; <hi>Hee beheld the same, and loe all that he had made was very good.</hi> So should we from day to day take a view of our workes, speeches, and the like, to see whether they haue beene good or bad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2 Humiliation.</note>The second thing in the Practise of Repentance is <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation:</hi>  for when a man hath seene that he is a sinner and lyes in sinne, this is not enough, but then great care must be had also to be humbled for them; that is, bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to weepe and mourne for them, euen to the shedding of many teares if it bee possible: So <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Math.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Math. 26 75.</note> 26. 75. it is said, <hi>And he went out and wept bitterly, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Mary Magdalen, Luk.</hi> 7. 38. it is said; <hi>And shee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 7. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>stood behinde him weeping, and began towash his feet with teares, and then to wipe them with the haires of her head.</hi> So <hi>Dauid Psal.</hi> 6. 6. confesses of himselfe, <hi>All the night I</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 6. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>make my bed swimme, I water my couch with my teares.</hi> So we see it is a plaine case, when once we haue seene our sinnes, the next thing to be done is, to bee humbled for them, as I haue said euen to the shedding of teares, which in Gods sight are so pretious and acceptable, that hee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and puts them vp in his bottle, as <hi>Psal. 56. 8. Thou</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psa. 56. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>tellest my wandrings, put thou my teares into thy bottle;</hi> all other teares fall to the ground, and are to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but euery teare that a man sheds for sinne, that hee hath offended God: he gathers these vp. But alas, what shall I say? I doubt me not one of a 1000. of vs let tears fall in this kinde, and for this cause you goe mourning and want comfort, because you seeke it not the right way in godly sorrow first to be humbled, and then to reioyce. It is a lamentable thing that many of you be twentie, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and forty yeares old, and yet you haue neuer shed one teare for sinne: O what a lamentable case is this? that Christ may now come and say to you as hee did vnto those women, <hi>Luk. 23. 28. O daughters of Hierusalem,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 28.</note>

                     <hi>weepe not for mee, but weepe for your selues, &amp;c.</hi> It is a good thing to weepe for Christ in regard of the paines and troubles which hee suffered, and did befall vnto him as our suretie; but it is a greater grace to weepe for sinne, and that thereby wee haue displeased so good a God. Which (I take it) made St. <hi>Augustine</hi> say, that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> brought two things to Christ, her oyntment and her teares, and yet her teares exceeded her oyntment in sweetnesse, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now this sorrow for sinne doth require fiue qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, there must be <hi>(Dolor Cordis, or Contritio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,)</hi> the sorrow of the heart or Contrition: as <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <note place="margin">Act. 2 37.</note> 37. it is said those three thousand who heard <hi>Peter; were pricked in their hearts:</hi> and <hi>Psal. 51. A contrite and a</hi>

                     <hi>broken heart, O God thou wilt not despise.</hi> So that this sorrow must not be outward onely with the sadnesse of the face, but it must be a sorrow of the heart, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. the Prophet complaines, <hi>my soule is vexed within mee, &amp;c.</hi> It is called other-where the pouring out of the heart; for this is most certaine, when the soule in good earnest sets to wrastle for heauen, then there is no time for vs to dissemble with God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it must be <hi>Dolor secundum Deum,</hi> Godly  sorrow which is a sorrow for sinne, because it displeaseth and hath offended God, as wee may reade, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>For behold this selfe-same thing that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulnesse it wrought in you, &amp;c.</hi> Many a man is sorry for his sinne, and peraduenture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents not for all this, or if he doe repent, it is not because it is sinne, but because it will bring their shame, losse, or discredite with men, or that Gods iudgements are ready to seize vpon him: as <hi>Ahab</hi> when it was told him that <note place="margin">2. King.</note> the dogges should licke his bloud in that place where hee had stoned <hi>Naboth,</hi> he wept and humbled himselfe, and went softly, but it was not because he had displeased God,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18128:205"/>
but in regard of the iudgement that should befall him. So <hi>Iudas</hi> was sorry for his sinne, not because of sinne but by <note place="margin">Math.</note> reason it was so horrible a thing to betray his Master: this was it which made so horrible and incureable a rent in his conscience: others againe sorrow for sinne in an other kinde, because they would be well accounted of, by the best men and women: they would seeme to be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: because this is a faire way to preferment and profite: when yet none of all this is godly sorrow: for this cries alwayes with holy <hi>Dauid,</hi> and laments most sins against God: <hi>Against thee, against thee onely haue I sinned and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> 
                     <hi>done euill in thy sight, that thou mayest be iust in thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it must be <hi>Dolor particularis:</hi> a man must be  sorrowfull for his sinnes in particular, whereby hee hath offended God. It is not enough for a man to be sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full generally because hee is a sinner, but hee must draw himselfe to more particulars, to an account, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with what sinnes he hath displeased God, <hi>Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, heri, hodie, hodie,</hi> yesterday, yesterday; to day to day: because as one sayes well; <hi>Dolosus versatur in generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> a deceiuer loues generalls: therefore let vs know, the duty consists in particulars, and we must come (so farre as it is possible) vnto the account of euery day, yea, euery houres sinne, and be so sorry for them. Thus the people confessed, 2. <hi>Sam. 12. 19. For wee haue added vnto all our</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 19. Iudg. 10. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>sinnes this euill, to aske for vs a King, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Iudg.</hi> 10. 10. they say, <hi>Wee haue sinned against thee, both because wee haue forsaken our God; and serued</hi> Baalim. Now as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning particular sorrow, we must doe as Physitians doe <note place="margin">Physitians.</note> with diseased bodies, when they finde a generall distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature in the body, they labour by all the art they can to draw the humour to another place, and then they break it, and bring out all the corruption that way: All which is done for the case of the patient. Euen so we must doe when we haue a generall and confused sorrow for our
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18128:206"/>
sinnes; labour as much as may be to draw them vnto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: as to say, in this, and in this, and at such and such a time, in such an occasion, and in such a place I haue sinned against my God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The Fourth thing in godly sorrow is, <hi>Dolor Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensivus,</hi> a reprehensiue sorrow, which is such a sorrow,  that though it begin but in a few particulars, yet at length <note place="margin">Traine of gunpowder.</note> it drawes in all with it: euen as a traine of gun-powder, when one corne is set on fire, it will not leaue vntill all be fired and in a blaze, so true sorrow though it begin but with one or a few sinnes: yet it drawes in all the rest ere long, for which we haue not sorrowed. So <hi>Dauid</hi> we see had no rest by reason of one sinne, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. but at last it <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> was not long ere it came into many heads, and set him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke to complaine of more; yea, euen to looke backe to his originall corruption: euen so wee must not thinke it enough to repent of one speciall or particular sinne, and so cease; but our sorrow must extend it selfe vnto all: we must gather in with our particular sinnes: which shewes the great defect which for the most part is in the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance commonly vsed in the world: If they repent of one sinne, they thinke it is enough and rest in that: So <hi>Iudas</hi> did make a shew of Repentance for one offence: <note place="margin">Math.</note> and so many other doe; yea, and with teares: who yet misse of repentance, because they neuer descend to search and trie their selues in particulars: for true sorrow so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, as it at length drawes in all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The Fift property in this sorrow is, that it be <hi>Dolor Proportionalis:</hi> that is, if our sinnes bee great, our sorrow  for sin must be so much the greater: If sins bee few and little, our sorrow may bee the lesse, and sooner attaine peace of conscience: Therefore this must needs be a great corruption and selfe-deceite in the ordinarie repentance of the world: that what kinde of sinne so euer they commit, there is but one measure of sorrow for it. Wee
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18128:206"/>
may see of <hi>Manasses,</hi> his sinne was great, and his contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was great, it is said, <hi>That Mannasseth was humbled</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Chron. 32. Math.</note> 
                     <hi>greatly;</hi> So <hi>Peter</hi> in denying his Master, it was a great sinne, and therefore his sorrow was proportionable; it is said, <hi>Then</hi> Peter <hi>went out and wept bitterly:</hi> So <hi>Hezek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <note place="margin">2. Chron.</note> committed a great sinne in shewing his treasure, and hee was brought very low for it. So if we haue sinned great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is certaine our sorrow must bee proportionable, as wee see by experience, he who falleth into the midst of <note place="margin">Riuer fallen in.</note> a riuer, must labour and take more paines to get out, then he who slippeth in but at the brinke of it; euen so if wee fall into great sinnes, it must and will cost vs more sorrow and teares, then if we fall into lesser sinnes onely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3 Maine thing.</note>The Third maine thing I shewed in the practise of  Repentance, <hi>is Deprecation:</hi> which is, a sending vp of earnest and heartie petitions and requests vnto God for the pardon of sinnes, when once he hath seene himselfe to bee a wretched and a grieuous sinner: then to begge humbly at the Throne of grace for Iesus Christs sake to haue them all pardoned and done away: In summe to haue good things giuen, and all euills they deserue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued: this is Deprecation. Holy <hi>Dauid</hi> was exceeding frequent in this duty in many Psalmes; as <hi>Psal. 51. Blot</hi>

                     <hi>out all my offences, and wash mee from my sinnes:</hi> So the <hi>Publican, Luk. 18. O Lord bee mercifull to mee a sinner:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk 18.</note> Thus in this case wee must not rest like <hi>Iudas</hi> vpon a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">Iudas.</note> sowre and heauy remembrance of our sinne onely, but become humble sutors to the Throne of Grace for mercie, according to <hi>Dauids</hi> experience. <hi>Psal. 32. 6.

                     <hi>this shall euery one that is godly, make his prayer vnto thee in an acceptable time, &amp;c.</hi> For what meanes he they should pray vnto God for? for houses or lands, or gold, or sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; no, for no other thing, especially, then the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes: So in this case a man must behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as a poore prisoner at the barre, when the Iudge <note place="margin">Prisoner.</note> stands vp ready to giue sentence vpon him, he falls down
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18128:207"/>
vpon his knees, and lifts vp his hands, lookes rufully, speakes pitifully, and begges for his life. He cannot misse to speed at Gods hand, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 20. euen so, <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 20.</note> if a sinner can pierce the heauens with his cryes, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite God earnestly, no question, he shall at length heare the voice of Christ say vnto him by his Spirit; <hi>Goe in peace, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.</hi>

Then hee must pray to God in Christ Iesus to forgiue them. Fourthly, Then he must resolue against them, that is renounce and remoue them as farre as may be.

Generall or vniuersall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as Schoolemen say) is caused two wayes: First, Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Agendo,</hi> by enforcing vp that which wee meane to mooue, as when a man flings a stone with his hand: Or <note place="margin">Stone.</note> 
                     <hi>Remouendo prohibens quod impedit,</hi> or remoouing of that which hinders the motion; as when a stone lieth vpon a shelfe, when one pulles this away, then by and by downe falls the stone of his owne accord and yet hee who pulled away the shelfe caused that motion of the stone. But how? Not <hi>Agendo,</hi> by flinging of the stone downe; but by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouendo prohibens,</hi> remoouing of that which hindered the motion of it. Now as it is in vniuersall motions, so also it is in speciall motions of the mind; for they be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, first either directly by an immediat impression made vpon the mind, as when a man is directly inuited to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or vertue. Secondly, or by remoouing the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which hinder vs from it. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, or what is the defect: Euen so must euerie man do, when he findes that the grace of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance flowes into other mens hearts, and hath no recourse or accesse into his soule, by and by sit downe and search himselfe what the cause should be, where the rub lies which detaines the grace of Repentance from him, seeing they that liue (it may be) in the same house, sit at the same table, lie in the same bed, they can be penitent for their sinnes, sorrie that they haue offended God, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine in bitternesse of soule for their sinnes: but hee that had the same meanes, the same occasions, more sinnes to be humbled for more time to repent and more motiues to draw him to the dutie, is not yet moued with the same, melted with griefe, nor come neere this dutie of contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus as I said, euery man must looke to himselfe, what that is which hinders his repentance. We see when <note place="margin">Diuel cast out. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 19.</note> Christ cast out the diuel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 19. his disciples came vnto him saying, <hi>Why could not wee cast him out?</hi> So when we see others in the course of their life, and midst of their sinnes brought vnto repentance, mourning &amp; wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for sinnes whereby they haue offended God; let vs looke into our selues, and enquire at our own hearts, why we doe not repent, why we cannot do as other good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doe.

                  <p>Euen as when a man is sicke, and will not take the good physick which would cure him, the defect is, either <note place="margin">Sicke man.</note> in his Iudgement or in his Affections. In his Iudgement, because either hee doth not feele himselfe to bee sicke, though hee be ill, hee hath no apprehension thereof, or if her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, yet hee doth not take it to be dangerous or dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: or though hee thinke it dangerous, yet he thinkes hee may renoue it without Physicke, or if he must haue phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, yet he needs not such physicke, or in such qualitie as is there prescribed. Yet there may be for all this a storme in his Affections, though the Iudgement doe come on to yeeld: for either a man may be so busie in the world that hee cannot attend it, or spare time for it, or hee is so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he cannot abide the least thing which may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, or thinke physicke to bee bitter as many doe. Yea, a number will choose to die, rather then meddle with it. Now these be the reasons partly in iudgement, and partly in the Affections, why such sicke patients will not admit of that physicke which might doe them good. As the case is in bodily sicknesse, so is it with those who are spiritually sicke with sinne. Repentance is that phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke which God hath appointed for the healing of them, and curing of their soules, which potion sinfull men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to take, the causes being as I haue shewed, partly in the Iudgement, and partly in the affections.</p>

In the <hi>Iudgement,</hi> there be foure impediments of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;  First, <hi>because men doe not know or finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to bee sicke of sinne,</hi> nor would haue others to thinke them sicke, they presume therefore that all is well with them, for they know neither disease nor infirmitie, and so because they liue as others liue, and doe as others doe, they thinke Repentance needlesse: and feeling no sick esse, they neuer thinke of Physicke. This kinde of deceite is reprooued, <hi>Iob 15. 31. Let not him that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Impediment </seg>4</label> The Fourth is, <hi>That though wee thinke Repentance is needfull, yet wee need not (say some) so strict a kinde of Repentance as the Scripture speakes of?</hi> If a man can say, <hi>Lord forgiue mee, wee are all sinners,</hi> and such like, it is sufficient, it will serue the turne well enough. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> thought Repentance was needfull, but it was a slight <note place="margin">Exod.</note> one, hee did not thinke so strict a one needfull as was prescribed. So <hi>Saul</hi> thought Repentance needfull when <hi>Samuel</hi> came and told him what hee had done, <hi>Yet saith</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>hee, Honour mee before the People,</hi> hee cared not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had any honour before God or not, so the people might honour him.

                  <p>Now as there be these impediments in the Iudgement, so there be also in the Affections diuers letts, for although a man findes himselfe to be a sinner against God and his owne conscience, and that there is no way of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come out of his sinne, but by Repentance; Yet he still findes impediments in his Affections to detaine and hold him from this so necessarie dutie.</p>

Because there are but two gates all men are to enter in at, there is a little Iron gate of repentance, which openeth to life and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to heauen and happinesse, and to Gods fauour, and the great golden gate is that of worldly pleasure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, which openeth and leadeth to death and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to hell and to torments for euer. Threfore at your choice be it (deare Brethren) which gate you will enter in at, the Iron gate of prayers and repentance in this life of Christianitie, which leades vnto the house of God, or the golden gate of worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures leading to Hell and destruction.</p>

                        </label> Vnto which I answer, that <hi>If a man haue not soundly repented him of his sinne, if hee haue failed in any one point of his repentance, in such case hee may fall easily againe into the same sinnes:</hi> As for example, a man hath beene a notorious riotour and cup-companion, hee comes <note place="margin">Riotour.</note> afterwards to looke into the hatefulnesse of his sinne, to condemne it in iudgement, to mislike it in affection, and yet because he could neuer bring his heart to resolue and fight against it, to sigh and be truly penitent; to fashion himselfe to the vse of good exercises; as Prayer, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a solemne arraignement of himselfe, and such like, he may easily fall againe, because hee hath failed in some one point of his Repentance. So a man who hath beene a Papist, and a worshipper of stocks and stones, he <note place="margin">A Papist.</note> comes to see his sinne, to dislike it, to condemne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue against it; thereupon hee turnes from Poperie, and yet because he is not truely turned into the obedience of the Gospell, to walke in holinesse before God, failing in some one or moe parts of his repentance, hee may fall to be a Papist againe. So <hi>Pharoah</hi> did in some manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent <note place="margin">Exod. 9. 27.</note> him of his sinne, yet because hee failed in the due practise and performance of the dutie, his heart being corrupted, hee remained obstinate. So the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of the people, in the Prophesies of <hi>Esay</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie 3. 3. Thou hadst a whoores forehead, thou refusedst</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ier. 3. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>to bee ashamed;</hi> So that because of vnsound repentance, a man may easily fall into the same sinnes againe. <hi>Iudas</hi> saw his sinnes and confessed them, but because he did not <note place="margin">Math.</note> pray vnto God to forgiue them, nor resolue against them, he fell away. Wee see in experience, if a man haue a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon <note place="margin">A Fellon.</note> or a soare vpon his hand, or a byle about him, if hee doe not draw out the corruption the better, but suffer it to rankle or swell againe, hauing stopt it too soone, it will breake out againe, and put him to further trouble and paine: Euen so it is in the nature of Repentance; a number there be who haue not searcht their hearts to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18128:213"/>
quicke, or suffered them to bleed out all the corruption; And so hauing dealt partially and vnsoundly in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, they finde it a matter of great difficultie to haue the heart perfectly sound: this is the first part of the Answer.</p>

                        </label> To this I answer, <hi>There is a Generall, and there is a Particular Repentance.</hi> Generall repentance is at a mans first conuersion, then he repents of all his sinnes; Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular repentance is, when a man repents of some one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular sinne, which is committed after. Now a man may repent generally for all his sinnes, and yet hee may easily also fall into particular sinnes againe, for <hi>euery thing so workes</hi> (as they say in Philosophie) <hi>according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of his owne nature,</hi> And so Generall repentance can but worke a generall dislike of sinne. Now therefore a man may mislike sinne in generall, and yet fall into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular sinnes of which he hath so generally repented.</p>

                        </label> To this I answer, that if a man doe Repent truely of  particular sinnes, such is the grace of God that hee doth not easily fall into them againe, and when he doth, it is seldome or very rare, and is much different from his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer falls.

                        <hi>That they might be affraid to

returne to Aegypt.</hi> And euen so doth he deale by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants when hee brings them out of the bondage and thraldome of sinne, hee leades them a tedious and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full way by many teares, by many sorrows; yea, the feare of Death and Hell; and all this, that they may be affraid to returne againe vnto <hi>Aegypt</hi> to their former lusts and sins againe: By which meanes a number of Gods people and seruants haue beene preserued from their sinnes and haue repented.</p>

As a man in the climbing of a ladder, though his foote slip, yet if hee <note place="margin">Ladder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>climbing.</note> hold surely by his hands, hee will not let his hold goe: so it is with the people of God, though their feet slip through frailtie and weaknesse, yet they hold fast by the hands, and will not let goe their hold of Heauen which they haue by faith in God.</p>

                        <hi>for what I would, that doe I not, but what I hate, that doe I.</hi> Wee see this also in <hi>Peter,</hi> hee denyed his Master fearefully, and very faintly, but yet presently got him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

But when the true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an sinnes, it is <hi>Cum formidine,</hi> with feare, as the foure Lepers entred the Campe of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and rob'd <note place="margin">Foure Lepers.</note> their tents, but with a kinde of feare and trembling, 2. <hi>King. 7. &amp;c.</hi> So it is with the people of God in their <note place="margin">2.

good courses, holding himselfe vnto good means: no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, but it was when hee grew loose, and left the societie of his brethren and neglected good meanes: but if wee hold our selues constantly to the meanes, wee shall not fall into grosse sinnes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second comfort is, That although it come to passe that wee doe fall, yet our falles shall turne to our good: as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. All things shall worke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the best, vnto them that loue God.</hi> And <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> to this purpose saith, That it is good that the Lord let some men fall into sinne, that they the better may see what they are by nature, and bee yet more humbled for it: As we see if a childe be busie about the fire or water; the father will of purpose put the fire to his childs fingers, <note place="margin">Childe, fire, water.</note> not with intent to hurt him, but to make him afraid: so when God sees his children too busie with sinne, he will bring them neere some punishment or iudgment to bring them vnto repentance, and at last comfort them.</p>
                     <p>This much might seeme to haue beene enough of this case of repentance: but because as in the goodly building of some faire house, the master pillars haue more worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship <note place="margin">Faire building</note> and labour then any other particulars, as we read of the two maine pillars of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple, 2. <hi>Chron,</hi> 3. 15. So because that Faith and Repentance bee the maine <note place="margin">2. Chron. 3. 15.</note> pillars in building the spiritual house of God in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, it is no maruell if they take vp more labour and time then all the rest <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith wel, That fone in digging do light vpon a mine of gold, he will diggestil, and neuer giue ouer, till that veine doth faile; so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">A mine of gold.</note> wee are lighted vpon a veine the Doctrine of Repentance, more precious than Gold; and Faith that will stand by vs in our death, when our gold will leaue vs: doe not blame me, if I digge still, labour still, as long as I may bring you aduantage.</p>

                        <hi>Whether a man that thus falls into the same sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, may bee renewed by repentance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answer two wayes: <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                        </label> First, <hi>That a man may though with difficultie;</hi> that is, if a man fall often and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly into the same sinnes, it is so much the more hard and difficult to bee cured and renewed; as wee see in the bodie, if a man fall into the Relapse of an Ague, or any <note place="margin">Relapse of an Ague.</note> dangerous disease, it may cost him his life, and his health will very hardly bee recouered: Euen so it is, after a man hath fallen into the same sinne againe. I doe not say hee may not recouer, or bee renewed by repentance, but it will the more hardly be done, and it will cost much terrour, labour and sorrow. Wee may then see that in this case recouery is possible, and that vpon three grounds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first is taken, <hi>From the generality of the Promise,</hi>  which in generall is made to pardon of all sinnes, except the sinne against the Holy Ghost: as <hi>Math. 12. Uerily</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Math. 12. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>verily I say vnto you, that all sinne and blasphemie shall be forgiuen a man, except the blasphemie against the Holy Ghost.</hi> But a man may fall into Relapses through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which is not the sinne against the Holy Ghost, and therefore may be forgiuen.</p>
                     <p>The second ground is taken <hi>A comparatis: From the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Luke 17. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>condition of the Promise, Luk.</hi> 17. 4. Where Christ hath giuen vs a commandement that wee should forgiue our brother seuentie times seuen times a day, so often as hee repenteth and is sorrowfull: and <hi>Math.</hi> 6. Christ threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <note place="margin">Math. 6. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>If you doe not forgiue your brother his trespasses, no more will your beauenly Father forgiue you your trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> So then, if a man must forgiue his trespasses that his brother trespasseth against him so often, all which is not a drop of mercie compared with Gods mercie; how
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18128:217"/>
much more wil God forgiue them that sinne against him, againe, and againe, if they doe repent, seeing hee is the Ocean of mercie and goodnesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third ground is, <hi>ab Exemplis:</hi> from sanctified examples of holy Scripture, for wee see in the booke of  <hi>Iudges,</hi> when there were any bad Iudges in Israel, the people fell away from God vnto Idolatrie, and when there came good Iudges, the Prophets came and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the people to returne againe vnto God and repent, <note place="margin">Iudges.</note> and so they did recouer againe. So in the Booke of <hi>Kings</hi> wee see that when bad Kings came, they fell away from God, and yet when good Kings came againe, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets preached and exhorted them; and they repented, and were receiued into fauour againe. Here therefore we haue to acknowledge the kindnesse and mercy of God. It is his mercie to forgiue vs, if wee doe sinne but once in our lifetime against him. But great and exceeding great is his mercie; that when wee haue sinned and sinned so exceeding oft against him, that (euen then) vpon repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hee will receiue vs. Wee reade the Lord declares this much, <hi>Ier. 3. If a man put away his wife, and she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come another mans: If shee returne againe to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ierem. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>shall not this land bee polluted: but thou hast played the harlot with many louers, yet returne againe to me saith the Lord.</hi> Thus there may bee forgiuenesse, euen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many relapses. It is the charitie of the Popish Church, if a man relapse into Heresie, though he doe repent, hee cannot bee forgiuen. The Pope and his Cardinals will not, may not forgiue him, but the kindnesse and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God is such, that though a man doe fall into the same sinne hee hath repented of, hee may bee forgiuen, and shall vpon Repentance bee forgiuen. Oh then, shall not the despisers of Gods kindenesse bee iudged of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>2</label> But yet I say, <hi>Though Repentance be possible, yet it will</hi>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:18128:217"/>
                        <hi>bee very hard and difficult;</hi> and that in two respects; First in respect of God:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>God will not bee so easily intreated to forgiue,</hi> I do not say that he will not forgiue, but that hee more hardly remits these sinnes, then others.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>In respect of our selues, we shall not finde our selues so readie, nor our hearts so apt to repent,</hi> in this Relapse, as otherwise wee might haue done.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>This then I say, that if wee prouoke the Lord too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with some sinnes, wee shall not finde him so readie to forgiue as at other times, nor so easie to bee intreated: So saith our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Iohn 5. 14. Behold thou art</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>made whole, sinne no more, left a worse thing come vnto thee.</hi> And so if we doe sinne, <hi>Deterius accidet;</hi> a worse thing may befall vs. Looke into the tenth of <hi>Iudges,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iudg. 10. 13. 14</note> and there you shall finde how the children of Israel had fallen into Apostasie concerning their Idolatrie, which they repented of, and so prayed vnto the Lord, but the Lord would not heare their prayers, but turned them off with scorne, deriding them: the words are these; <hi>Yet yee haue for saken mee and serued other gods, therefore I will deliuer you no more, goe and crie vnto the gods whom yee haue chosen, let them deliuer you in the time of your Tribulation.</hi> So then, if wee make no consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to fall into a sinne often which wee haue repented of; let vs not maruell if God doe not heare vs at the first; for if wee stand vpon tearmes with God for the hearing and helping of vs by and by, take heed hee say not vnto vs, goe away I will not helpe you, goe vnto your sinnes, and the worldly pleasures, profites, honours that you haue serued, let them helpe you. It is true indeed, that all the Scriptures declare God to be a mercifull God; to bee full of compassion, and very ready to forgiue, but when wee shall therefore imbolden our selues to sinne, and desperately come to aske Almighty God, how often
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18128:218"/>
wee may sinne: if it bee but once or twice it is too much; but say it bee once or twice, and the Lord forbeares vs with patience, then let vs beware wee doe not prouoke the Lord by falling backe vnto the same sinnes after wee haue repented, for when it comes to <hi>Quoties peccavtmus,</hi> how often haue wee offended in the same sinne, the Lord no question will bee much displeased, hardly drawne to forgiue, and not easily appeased towards such offenders; for hee complaines of such, <hi>Psal. 78. 40. How often did</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal 78. 40.</note> 
                        <hi>they prouoke him in the wildernesse and grieue him in the Desert?</hi> And <hi>Psal. 95. 8. To day if you will heare his</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 95. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>voice, harden not your hearts, as in the Prouocation of the wildernesse, when your fathers tempted mee.</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> 40. 5. hee sayes, <hi>Once haue I spoken, but I will speak no more; yea twice, but I will proceed no further?</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iob. 40. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Math. 25. How often saith God would I haue gathered</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Math. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>thee together, as a henne gathereth her chickens, but yee would not. Fortie yeares long (saith hee of his owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) was I vexed with you in the wildernesse:</hi> If it had beene but for some few yeares, hee could haue borne the matter, but it was fortie yeares together; God is indeed very readie, and mercifull to forgiue, but when it is so often committed, this makes Gods eares bee heauie and stopt to our cries; yea, and our selues to bee so much the more vnfit for the businesse. I speake not this to cut off any man from the hope of pardon: God forbid that wee should take away mercy from the Lord, but to shew that men which fall into the Relapse of the same sinnes are in greater danger then before, and it makes God the lesse readie to forgiue them, and to bee intreated of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>In regard of our selues, it workes a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie in vs, wee being so much the harder hearted, and lesse readie to repent.</hi> First, because of the nature of sinne, which is to leaue a promptnesse and readinesse in vs to the same sinne: leauing a staine and a blot behinde it; as when by often lifting vp a burden, wee finde it lighter
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18128:218"/>
and lighter, and passe away with it so much the more slightly; so by often offending wee make our selues the readier to sinne, and so come to hardnesse of heart; and backwards to repent. To this purpose is that speech of the Prophet, <hi>Ier. 13. 23. Can the Aethiopian change his skinne, or the Leopard his spots, then may you also doe good who are accustomed to doe euill?</hi> Secondly, because as <hi>Dionysius</hi> hath it, <hi>Consuetudo peccandi, tollit sensum peccandi;</hi> so that when a man falls into a sinne, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the same, hee becomes the lesse sensible and feeling of the same; which makes him the hardlier to bee drawne to repentance. For as you see it is dangerous for a man to haue a bone broken often in some one place, for <note place="margin">Bone broken.</note> it may hardly be ioyned againe, or fester, or neuer come to its full strength: So when a man falls into the same sinne, he shall finde much adoe to rise and recall himselfe; as a man that at the first goes away from the fire, it makes <note place="margin">Chill from fire.</note> him the more chill and cold after, but after that hee hath beene a time in the cold, hee can the better indure it: So it is with sinne, when wee commit it at first, our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are against it; our reasons fight against it, and our consciences are checked and vnquiet for it: But if a man continue in it and sinne often, hee is neuer touched for it, but his heart becomes past feeling, secure, and hardened, and so the worke is more difficult in regard of our selues. And thus if appeares, that there is pardon for such who fall into the same sinne againe; but it is very hard and difficult to attaine the sence and assurance of it.</p>

goodnesse, which is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> speakes of, then it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be renewed by repentance, because such can neuer repent; but if a man doe fall but from degrees of grace, hee may recouer againe, for mention is made one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of falling from all duties of Religion and grace, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Saints falling onely from degrees and some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Grace, may recouer againe and bee renewed by Repentance.</p>

Thus to doe (after a man hath receiued the knowledge of the truth) for such a one there remaines no more sacrifice for sinnes, because his hard heart shall neuer repent, whom God thus giues ouer: but for sinnes done otherwise willingly often; yea, against conscience and knowledge: there remaines alwayes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices euen after Repentance, knowledge of the truth and inlightned tasting of the heauenly gift; <hi>For the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell must no where be stricter, but much more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to miserable sinners then the Law was.</hi> Now vnder the Law there was of purpose constant reiterated sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for sinnes done euen willingly: as <hi>Leuit.</hi> 6. 2. <note place="margin">Leuit. 6, 2, 3. 4.</note> 3. 4.

                     </label> The next case wee are now to come vnto is, <hi>The case of Iteration of Repentance:</hi> which is, <hi>whether a man that hath truely Repented him of a sinne once, be bound to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18128:220"/>
Repent the same sinne ouer and ouer againe.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> I answer, <hi>The case is cleere, that a man is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent one and the same sinne often:</hi> The answer is easie, but the explication is hard; but I will lay it downe affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiuely, <hi>A man can neuer too often repent him of a sin, but the more hee repents, the more comfortable shall bee his life, and his prayers more answering:</hi> Indeed if a mans repentance were perfect at first, then a man need but once repent a sinne. But because all our Repentance is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue, and that it is found a worke of great difficultie, therefore it must be often done, to assure that it is well done. So seeing our repentance doth still want somwhat of waight, wee had need goe often and againe to renew the same. Wee see a man in rowing may lose more at a stroke, then hee can recouer at three or foure againe; so a <note place="margin">Rowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> man may lose more by one act of sinne, then hee can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer by many acts of Repentance. So, this is the state of a Christian, sinne once, and repent often, by the sinne of an houre wee gather matter of mourning and heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for many yeares after; so that the case is cleere, a man who hath repented truly of a sinne, is bound often to repent of the same sinne. A Painter when he makes a <note place="margin">Painter.</note> goodly picture, he drawes line vpon line, and colour vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on colour, till hee haue perfected his picture; so must it be in Repentance, wee must renew our sorrow and griefe for sinne, till our repentance bee perfect; for if it were weighed at the best in the Ballance of the Sanctuarie, as <hi>Balteshazar</hi> was, it would bee found light. Wee see in <note place="margin">Dan. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Dauids</hi> experience, how stood the case with him after he had committed that great sinne, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">2.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18128:220"/>
humble our soules with sorrow and teares, renewing our repentance againe and againe, neuer leauing till we haue pacified the wrath of God: for how often doth this holy man plye this sute? So <hi>Psal</hi> 25 hee prayes God not to <note place="margin">Psal. 25.</note> remember the sinnes of his youth: So you see <hi>Dauid</hi> did repent him of those sinnes hee had repented of before. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> sayes well, that <hi>Dauid</hi> still repented of sins <note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> done long before, as though they had beene done but ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday.</p>

                        <hi>Cyrill</hi> obserues it.

Now that which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> did in the beholding of the Garden, is that which wee must doe in the beholding of Heauen, hee saw from whence he was cast, throwne out of <hi>Paradise</hi> by reason of his sinne; and wee see what wee are sure to lose, euen heauen it selfe by reason of our sinne, if wee doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and humble our soules, and that timely and daily. Thus you see it is cleere that a Christian is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent one and the same sinne diuers times, and as oft as he lookes vp to heauen to sigh and groane for the losse of it, and not to bee satisfied, though he haue repented to day, and so is assured of pardon, but in the Name of God to goe to it againe to morrow, and to morrow, and neuer giue ouer.</p>

Against this doctrine two things may bee obiected,  First, <hi>If a mans sinnes vpon his Repentance be pardoned, then what need is there vpon this to repent any more? this appeares to bee labour lost.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>1</label> I answer, that though a mans sinnes bee pardoned vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on  <note place="margin"> Three causes of renewing Repentance.</note> Repentance, yet there are three causes why a mans repentance must bee renewed; <note place="margin"> 1</note>First, because, <hi>Eadem ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net obligatio:</hi> the same Bond remaineth still, for though God out of his owne goodnesse and mercie forgiue our sinnes, yet neuerthelesse haue wee the same Cause to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our selues, to dislike and bee sorry for it, because the same bond or tye remaines still, though God haue gratiously pardoned it, yet it is our duty to repent still: Nay to speake as the truth is; <hi>Crescit obligatio;</hi> our bond is the greater, for the more mercy and goodnesse God shewes vs in the pardoning of our sinnes, wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the more cause to be abased and ashamed that wee haue sinned against him. This (as wee see) made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggeration in <hi>Dauids</hi> griefe, <hi>In to solum peccaui,</hi> I haue <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> sinned against thee alone; what had <hi>Dauid</hi> sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst none but God? no question against <hi>Uriah, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba,</hi> and the people, but that went to the heart of him most of all, and did more deeply touch him, that he had giuen God cause to bee angry with him, who was so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to forgiue him, that had shewed him so great kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and mercy in the pardoning and forgiuing of all his sinnes. So Gods mercie to vs in pardoning our sinnes, should not bee a meanes to abate our repentance, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to augment and increase it, because there remaines in vs still the same seeds of ouglinesse, vilenesse, deformitie and corruption as formerly, the pardon whereof being great, should continually augment and reiterate our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance with holy <hi>Dauid, Psal. 103. Praise the Lord</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 103.</note> 
                     <hi>O my soule, praise the Lord, and forget not all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites: who forgiues thee all thy sinnes, &amp;c.</hi> Thus Gods mercie in forgiuenesse of sinnes should not abate, but
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18128:221"/>
increase our repentance; as wee see in the storie of the Prodigall sonne, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 20. hee had a purpose to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse <note place="margin">

If a woman should commit wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse <note place="margin">Adulterer.</note> and folly against her husband, who puts her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for it, and afterwards should be bent not onely to receiue her and forgiue her freely this lewd offence, but also welcome her, and bestow vpon her rich ornaments and iewels: this kindnesse of her husbands, (if any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affection be in her,) would make her the more to lament and grieue for hauing offended so kinde and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull a husband, and remember it to her dying day: so it is with Gods readinesse in pardoning our sinnes, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not choose but make vs the more ready vpon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from time to time, to repent and bee sorry that wee had offended so good and gratious a God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, though a mans sinnes bee pardoned vpon  his repentance; <hi>Yet the more a man repents, the more hee shall haue the sense and feeling of the pardon of them;</hi> for a man may haue his sinne pardoned before God, and yet haue no sense and feeling in his owne conscience of the pardon of it, for there is still retained a feare of guilt, as wee see in <hi>Dauid, 1. Sam.</hi> 12. his sinne was pardoned <note place="margin">1. Sam. 12.</note> before God, and yet there remained (as commonly in such cases) such an impression of guilt, as hee had no comfort for all this, or as if there had beene no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And so, though God forgiue our sinnes vpon our first repentance, yet the more wee repent, the more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible wee shall bee of the forgiuenesse and pardon of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18128:222"/>
them. In other cases wee can say, <hi>Abundantia cautela non nocebit,</hi> too much caution hurts not, as when a man comes to locke a chest or a doore wherein lyes his gold <note place="margin">Doore.</note> and treasure, he will turne the key againe and againe: sir (sayes his friend) the doore was fast before: yea but (sayes the other) in cases of this nature, it is good to bee sure to make fast worke; as then couetous men say thus by their money and iewells; so let vs say of our saluation, in businesses of this nature, it is good to bee sure, a man cannot bee too cautelous in making and procuring a pardon for his sinnes: so that after repentance, a man is alwayes the better and readier to repent and comfort himselfe. It was the zealous and holy care of that good man <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> 1. 5. to say, <hi>I will goe see my sonnes, for it</hi>

                     <hi>may bee that my sonnes haue sinned and cursed God in their hearts.</hi> So should euery Christian say in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; It may bee that I haue failed in my Repentance, and therefore I will to it againe to make sure worke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, because though a mans sinnes bee pardoned vpon his Repentance, yet he is still bound to repent them,  <hi>Because repentance is required not onely to take away the guilt of sinne, but also to take away the corruption of it.</hi> Wee see when Christ was dead and buried, the Iewes <note place="margin">Iewes.</note> rolled a great stone vpon the mouth of his graue, and why? to make him fast that hee should not rise; now we must doe with our sinnes as the Iewes did by Christ, not onely bury them our selues and make a graue for them, but also wee must rowle a great stone vpon them, and seale them vp by repentance, euery day casting more mold and earth vpon them, that they neuer may rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs; <hi>For often repenting of sinne abates the strength of the corruption of sinne in the roote.</hi> As a man that hath his house on fire, hee will not onely quench the fire for <note place="margin">Fire.</note> the present, but poure water also in the cinders and ashes, for feare of some liuing sparkes or dissipating heate which may lye hidden therein: so must wee doe by our

sinnes, when the diuell hath set our lusts on fire; it must bee our wisedome not onely to quench the motions for the present, but also as it were to poure water on them to quench the ashes of sinne.</p>

                     </label> I answer, <hi>That as a man is bound to renew his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, so is he bound to renew his Faith too:</hi> Yea, the more hee renewes his Repentance, the more hee is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his Faith and ioy: thus as a mans sinnes giue him cause to mourne, so the Lords mercy in Christ Iesus, will giue him grace to reioyce: So that the <hi>renewing of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though it bring a man to griefe, yet it will not leaue him in sorrow,</hi> but set him in a most full possession of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting comfort, as <hi>Dauid</hi> confesses, <hi>Psal. 126, 5.

                     <hi>who sowe in teares shall reape in ioy.</hi> So that there are some teares which will bring ioy: there is a kinde of mourning which ends in reioycing. It is obserued in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that there is some paine which brings a man ease, <note place="margin">Paine.</note> and a man can neuer haue ease, but by the meanes of this paine; As the paine of physicke, which doth not worke at first without some trouble, yet brings health at last. The paine also that a man feeles in dressing of a soare <note place="margin">Paine.</note> (for there are none but I am sure will confesse it puts a man to paine) brings a man at last to more ease and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing; so that <hi>wee may well say, the paine is the cause of the Cure;</hi> Euen so the renewing of Repentance cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a paine, no man can deny that, because it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with griefe and sadnesse, sorrow and teares, but it is <hi>Dolor &amp; Tristitia sanitatis,</hi> a healing and a healthfull paine, such a paine as will leaue many ioyes, and much

pèace behinde it. Therefore let men neuer bee affraid to renew their Repentance for their sinnes, though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented before; Let them vpon euery good occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of them still, because though this course of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance bring a man sorrow, yet it will neuer leaue him long in heauinesse, but bring into a sweet and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble peace with God and his owne conscience; when though weeping and heauinesse may bee in the euening, yet ioy and cheerefulnesse commeth in the morning; such mourning and confessing, ransaking of the heart ends in blessednesse; euer the more spirituall mourning, the more cheerefull holy reioycing: they come from one roote and fountaine, the other shew it selfe first: yet all is swallowed vp into reioycing at last.

                     </list>
                     <p>For the first, here be two extreamities to bee shun'd: whether a man bee bound to confesse his sinnes vnto men? First, the Papists they thinke that a man is bound to confesse all his sinnes vnto man; that it is not enough to confesse them vnto God, vnlesse they also confesse them vnto Priests: in this they are in one extreame; And
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18128:223"/>
in the contrary are they that thinke that a man must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse all his sinnes vnto God onely. Now both these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames are erronious, both the Papists who thinke wee are bound to confesse our sinnes vnto men, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carnall professors, who thinke that wee must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse our sinnes vnto God onely; for the truth lyes in the middle way betwixt both: For a man is not bound to confesse all his sinnes vnto any man, and yet some sinnes there are which must be confessed to men, as well as some other that it is enough if wee confesse vnto God onely.</p>
                     <p>Now for the cleering of this point, we must remember that in the high Court of conscience sins be of two sorts:</p>

                        <item>1. Knowne sinnes.</item>

                     <p>As <hi>Psal. 19. 12. Who can vnderstand his errors; cleanse</hi>

                        <hi>thou mee from my secret sinnes:</hi> Now to apply this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the point: if they bee secret sinnes against God, then it is enough to confesse them vnto God onely, for God onely is offended, and so it is sufficient to confesse them vnto God: For it is a rule of Iustice, <hi>Poena non excedet culpam;</hi> the punishment shall not exceed the fault, or goe no further then the trespasse. So then, if our sinnes bee against God onely, it is enough to confesse them vnto God: and though the Papists say; No hope of pardon vnlesse wee confesse our secret sinnes vnto Priests: yet the Scriptures of God are cleere against them, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. <note place="margin">Psal 35. 2.</note>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:18128:224"/>
5. <hi>I acknowledge my sinnes vnto thee, and mine iniquitie haue I not hid: I said I will confesse my transgressions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and thou forgauest the iniquitie of my sin.</hi> And so the poore Publican, that went into the Temple and knockt his brest, hee confessed his sinnes vnto God, and <note place="margin">Iuke 18. 13. 14</note> said, <hi>God be mercifull vnto me a sinner;</hi> I tell you (saith Christ) this man departed to his house iustified: and so wee see it by experience in the holy Scripture, That wee should confesse our sinnes vnto God onely. It is the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a learned man, That wee should confesse our sinnes <note place="margin">Chrysost. on. Psal. 50.</note> vnto God, who onely can best wipe away our sins; for a man is many times ashamed to discouer his secrets to his best friends, much more to a stranger Priest: And so then (against the Papists) wee see that we are not to confesse all our sinne, vnto any, but vnto God onely: As in the storie of <hi>Manasses,</hi> wee see in his distresse it is written, 1. <hi>Chron. 33. 12. And when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord his God, and humbled himselfe greatly, before the</hi>

                        <hi>God of his Fathers.</hi> So then if they be secret sinnes, it is enough to confesse them vnto God onely. Whereby you may see that the Papists opinion is false; which inioynes a man vpon paine of damnation to confesse them vnto a Priest, all the Scripture being contrarie vnto them if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderstood.</p>
                     <p>But yet, <hi>In one case wee are bound to confesse them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

                        <hi>men,</hi> that is in case of distresse, when wee are so burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them, as that we cannot rise vp vnder so great a load, nor can finde ease or comfort any other way. In this case there is a necessitie, and wee should and ought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse them vnto men, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> hath it; <hi>Acknowledge your sinnes to one another, and pray for one another:</hi> but <note place="margin">

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, This confession Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speakes  of, is onely in case of necessitie and distresse, without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and freely, and that in such a sinne onely, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be healed by our selues. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, The healing that  <hi>Saint</hi> Iames <hi>speakes of, is by Prayer:</hi> but <hi>the healing of the Priest is by substantiall Absolution,</hi> and so the Popish

confession cannot bee meant here in this place. So that this Argument stands good against them that our secret sinnes against God are not of necessitie to bee confessed, but vnto God onely.</p>
                     <p>But if they bee knowne sinnes against God, then it is not enough to repent of them before God, but wee are bound to repent of them before men also. So wee see the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> after his fall, hee did not onely repent of his sinne before God, but also he made, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall Psalme as the Fathers haue it, to bee a monument and Testimoniall to the whole Church. So likewise St. <hi>Paul, 1. Cor.</hi> 15. hee saith, <hi>I am not worthy to bee called an Apostle, because I did persecute the Church of God.</hi> So <note place="margin">1. Cor 15.</note> as his sin was made manifest in persecuting the Church of God, in like manner his repentance was made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest and knowne vnto all. So then, this case is cleere, that knowne and open sins are to be confessed not onely vnto God, but also vnto men; that as they haue knowledge of our sins, so also they may haue of our repentance, and that we are changed into newnesse of life, and that for two reasons; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because as men doe know of our sins, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so  may they of our repentance: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second is, that as we haue done hurt to our brethren by our bad example in sinning against God, and drawing others by the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to doe so also; so farre we should by our outward example of outward confession and repentance draw men vnto God. Which was the reason why <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 20 8.</note> 20. 8. did tell his seruants that which God had in a dream reuealed vnto him, that as many as knew of his sinne in taking away <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife, might know of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, because as he had done hurt by his bad example of sinning, so he might againe salue that sore by his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: he might haue carried the matter closely and secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that none might haue knowne it, but wee see hee doth reueale it to the end it might be knowne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Second sort of sinnes.</note>
                        <hi>The second sort of sinnes are against our brethren,</hi> and  they are of two sorts.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:18128:225"/>
1. <hi>There are some sinnes which one may commit against a man which doe not hurt him, or indammage him:</hi> as to thinke an euill thought against him, these sinnes wee are to confesse vnto God onely, because hee onely knowes them and is offended for them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Some sinnes againe there are that doe hurt them, and they doe receiue damage by them of which there bee two sorts:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, some are such as we know not to be sins, and such as we haue forgotten, and cannot call to our mindes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them; For which sinnes, a generall repentance or confession will serue the turne, but we must take heed that we doe not wilfully or willingly forget them: in such sinnes wherein a man either in body, word or goods, does hurt his neighbour, hauing no ill intent towards him, nor afterward knowing it, in this case generalitie will serue.</p>
                     <p>But secondly some are such sins as we doe know of, and such as in which we well vnderstand, and remember that wee haue wronged our neighbour. Now if they bee such sins as we doe not know of, as I said before, or be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or we doe not know to be sinnes; then men are not bound to confesse them; for else who could be saued, for a number of sins were committed against our brethren which we forget, and a number of sinnes there are, which we doe not know to be sins against them; as 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 3 <note place="margin">2. Sam. 21. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Dauid</hi> knew not how hee had offended the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi> But if they be such sinnes as one doth know, these wee are bound to confesse not onely vnto God, but vnto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons wronged also. As Christs counsell is, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 3. <note place="margin">Luk. 17. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Take heed to your selues, if thy brother trespasse against thee, rebuke him; If he repent forgiue him.</hi>

                        <hi>The second question is: whether a man is bound vpon his repentance to make restitution of that which is taken away by vniustice?</hi>

                        </label> To this I answer, there are in this case two parties offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,  proportionable to which must be our practise of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.

                        </list>
And it being a rule in Iustice that the penalty must stretch as far as the fault; therefore it will follow because both God and man is offended in this case, that we should not only repent to God, but also to men, and make satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the hurt which we haue done to them. For, <hi>It is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Nature of Repentance.</note> 
                        <hi>the Nature of Repentance to bring all things as neere as may be vnto their former estate againe.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Note.</note>Now wee know that by the sin of iniustice God is offended, &amp; our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is hurt; wherefore, by our Repentance, we reconcile our selues to God; and by our restitution vnto men, wee  make satisfaction for the hurt wee haue done them; so that there must be restitution and satisfaction, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we haue indamaged our brother: there may be additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto his owne. For if our brother haue ought against vs, God will not heare vs, vntill we be reconciled to our <note place="margin">See <hi>Zacheus</hi> his Practise.</note> brother, by restitution and satisfaction; as Christs coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell is, <hi>Math. 7. 23.

                        <hi>and there remember that thy brother hath ought against thee: leaue there thine offering before the Altar, goe thy way and first bee reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy offering.</hi> Whereby we may see that God will not accept of any duty which we shall doe, vntill wee bee reconciled to our brother. Thus <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 5.

                     <p>And thus wee see the sin of iniustice to bee a grieuous sin, wherein a man is bound to restitution, satisfaction and confession; If a man haue spoken ill of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he must be sorry fo it, and speake well of him again. If seruants steale or purloyne any thing of their Masters, they must make it good; confesse their fault, and restore it vnto them again, if euer God bring them home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: So if a man shall get away his neighbours goods by iniustice, or by deceit or fraud, or cousening of him: God will not accept of such a man, vntill hee haue made satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: the like may be said in forgerie, oppression, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornation, false witnesses and the rest, there must follow repentance and satisfaction, or no forgiuenesse of sinnes. See then what a great sinne this of Iniustice is, and what a grieuous burden a man pulls vpon himselfe, when he hath gathered together a great deale of ill gotten goods: For when hee comes to die, he is in hazard to be either a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned sinner, or a starke begger. And therefore it is a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full case, when Parents put and aduenture their children vpon any bad courses, not caring how, so they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich them. There are a number of Vsurers, which say they cannot liue otherwise, and therefore they put their stocke to vse to raise some profite to themselues. But let them know that these sins be sins of iniustice, and therfore they must not onely repent for them, but also they must make restitution and satisfaction. If a man doe sin against God, if hee confesse and repent, God will forgiue him; But if he doe sinne against men, hee must not onely confesse to God, but also vnto men, and make satisfaction for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: here also such are to bee reprooued, who at their death make Wills, committing their soules to God, and their ill-gotten goods to their friends and children, the high way to bring a curse vpon them; let Parents beware of this error. And so much for this third case.</p>

so exhorting vnto the same; sutable vnto which is the Saints practise now and in all ages: I haue therefore in the next place chosen to handle, <hi>The Case of teares</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The state of the question.</note> 
                     <hi>in Repentance;</hi> that is, <hi>whether euery man or woman who truely repents them of their sinnes, must and doe necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shed teares for them?</hi> The answer whereof (by your patience) I will lay downe in fiue conclusions. The first <hi>Conclusion</hi> shall be this;</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Conclusion </seg>1</label>
                     <hi>A man may weepe for sinne, shed teares for it, and yet  not truely repent; teares be not alwayes a true signe of true Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reason whereof is, because the very naturall man wisheth well vnto himselfe, desires his owne peace and hearts ease as much as may bee. Therefore when hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the fearfull iudgements of God due vnto him for his sinne, euen the hatefulnesse of vile actions which hee hath committed, the very conscience and horror of these things will make him many times weepe, so that a naturall man may shed teares for sinne, and yet not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent him of it: as wee see in <hi>Esau, Gen.</hi> 27. 34. He wept <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 34.</note> for the losse of his Fathers blessing and his birth-right, and yet so farre from repenting of his sinne, that at that same instant, after his Fathers death hee resolued to kill his brother. So the Holy storie affirmes of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17. that when <hi>Dauid</hi> had cut off the lap of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">1. Sam 24. 17.</note> when hee might haue killed him, and when he had made his innocencie knowne to him; <hi>Saul</hi> hee lift vp his voyce and wept, and made confession of his sinnes before God, and yet for all this <hi>chap.</hi> 26. wee see hee persecuted him againe, euen against his owne conscience; so we see hee wept for his sinne and yet neuer repented. Hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed hee had done ill, and that <hi>Dauid</hi> was more righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then hee. So <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 13. The people of <hi>Israel</hi> is <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 13.</note> said to haue couered the Altar of God with their teares, with weeping and mourning, and yet for all that liued
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18128:228"/>
in their sinnes without Repentance, and said; <hi>wherein shall wee returne?</hi> So it is cleere, that teares are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a true signe of true Repentance. For the most part all the Religion of the world is this, that if a man can bring himselfe so farre, not onely to be touched for sinne, but also to weepe for it, to shed a few teares, by and by they thinke themselues to bee safe; yea, though they liue loosely and prophanely after, but this is to build vp their comfort vpon a safe ground, because as wee haue heard, a man may shed teares for sinne, and yet not repent it: so that teares bee not alwayes the true companions of true Repentance.</p>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18128:229"/>
because hee hath offended so good a God; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased so gratious, and so mercifull a Father, done that which is prophane and vnseemly in his sight, then wee may haue ioy and comfort in our teares. So wee see in the example of the <hi>Prodigall sonne, Luke</hi> 15 21. he more <note place="margin">Luk. 15. 21.</note> lamented that he had offended so good and louing a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then for the losse of his money; then for all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie which was vpon him, and hardnesse hee had sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; yea, I say, all this did not so much grieue him, as that hee had offended his good Father.

                     <hi>I sinned:</hi> did hee sinne onely against God? hee had also sinned against <hi>Vriah, Barsheba,</hi> against the people, and against the peace of his owne soule. Yet aboue all, his greatest griefe was for offending his God; a God that had dealt so bountifully with him in his aduancement, and mercifully in his preseruation, and so by the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the cause, wee may receiue comfort in our teares, when wee consider from what motiues they proceed, and principally moouing Causes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, a man that would haue comfort in his tears, <hi>must looke vnto the Effect and fruit of them,</hi> for if a man  doe so weepe for his sinnes, as that by and by hee be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall into, and commit the same sinnes againe, and that as greedily and carelesly as hee did before; then it is to bee feared, that the watrie teares shed here, is but a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that euerlasting weeping and mourning in hell. But if a man doe so weepe for sinne, as that thereby hee is made more watchfull ouer sinne, more to hate it, carefull to resist it, more willing to weaken the sudden power thereof in himselfe, then a man may haue comfort in his teares; as it is 2. <hi>Cor. 7. 10. 11.

Teares of prophane men, for they haue their Teares too; but there is small comfort in them, a man is neuer the better for such teares, they are seldome put home to the conscience, nor is the life reformed by them, they leaue no steps of goodnesse, nor prints of Grace behinde them. Secondly, the teares of the godly bee indeed sorrowfull teares, but they are mightie and quickning (like <hi>Aqua fortis)</hi> which make strong and lasting impressions of vertue and of grace, which leaue a seed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>it behinde to worke vpon their soules and conscience. Thus much of the first Conclusion: the second is this:</p>
                  <p>Conclusion 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euery one that commits sinne hath iust cause aboue all <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>This is proued; first <hi>By Reason;</hi> Secondly, <hi>By Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:</hi> for there are three things which will make a man to shed teares:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. For the losse of some great good.</item>
                     <item>2. The feare of some great euill.</item>
                     <item>3. The sence and feeling of some grieuous paine.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Now in all these cases, a man hath cause to shed teares  for sinne; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, <hi>In regard of the great losse that comes by sinne:</hi> worldly men as wee know will weepe for the losse of children, goods, lands, and such like; but all the losses of the world are not comparable vnto the losse which comes by sin; for it is neither of children, goods, or lands, but by sinne we lose the fauour of God; all our parts of that wee haue in Christ, heauen and happinesse; yea, wee faile of Gods blessed presence for euer, and so of all losses the greatest comes by sinne: So that wee haue more cause to mourne for it, then for any worldly cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie or miserie whatsoeuer, looke in the storie of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah, Iudg. 18. 24. Yee haue taken away my Gods which I</hi>

                     <hi>made, and the Priest, and yee are gone away, and what haue I more? and what is this that yee say vnto mee, what ailest thou?</hi> Here you see that when the souldiers had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away <hi>Micahs</hi> Gods, hee ranne after them crying and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Micahs</hi> gods.</note> weeping, and was angry that they should aske, what ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest thou? Euen so must wee, if such as hee can so weepe for a false God, much more haue wee cause to weepe and mourne, when wee shall consider that our owne sins haue taken away our true God from vs, yea all the ioy, comfort, and peace that we had in God, and therefore aboue all things wee haue cause to shed teares and weepe for our sinnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, a man hath cause to weepe and mourne and shed teares aboue all things for sinne, <hi>In regard of the great and intolerable euill which comes by sinne.</hi> Whereof the finall euill is Hell and damnation, which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, most insupportable and mischieuous euill of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; because all other euills are temporarie, this eternall: Wee see a man is sorry when he hath brought himselfe to lamenesse, blindenesse, and mutilation of any member, and how much more then when hee hath brought this vpon himselfe, and therewith the curse of God, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting <note place="margin">Euills procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> damnation; paines endlesse and restlesse for euer: O how much cause therefore hath a man to mourne and lament for his sinnes? which bring not temporarie (but as I said) euerlasting punishments; The fire that came vpon <hi>Sodom</hi> lasted but for a day: The floud that came <note place="margin">Fire of <hi>Sodom.</hi> Floud of <hi>Noah. Gen.</hi> 41. 49.</note> vpon the old world lasted but for a short time; the great famine of Aegypt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 49. lasted but for seuen yeares, and the captiuitie of Babylon lasted but 70. yeares, but damnation in Hell shall be for euer and euer, no time shall end it, no meanes shall finish it, no policie shall escape it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, all the euills that doe befall vs here are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular euills, either paine in the head, teeth, back, or belly,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18128:230"/>
or stomache, arme, legge, &amp;c. but the paines of Hell are vniuersall in euery part, in all parts at once, which must much multiply paine, sorrow, and destruction in vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Againe, all other paines and euills haue their mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons  and limitations; If a man hath the goute, hee hath also a soft bed to lye in; if hee be feeble hee hath one to leade him; if hee be lame, hee hath somebody to moue him from place to place, but if a man bee in Hell there is no mitigation, no ease, no helpe left, not so much as a drop of cold water to coole the heate of the mouth, but all horror, griefe, torment, sorrow and vexation; so that if euer a man may haue cause to shed teares, and feare mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe that may happen, he hath reason to doe so for feare of hell and those gastly terrors of damnation to come, to last for euer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, a man hath reason and cause to shed teares for  sinne, <hi>in regard of the paines accompanying the same:</hi> which are deadly, dangerous: For if one should wound a man in the legge, hee might recouer, but pricke him if it were but with a pinne at the heart, and the wound proues <note place="margin">Wounds.</note> deadly: So it is in wounding of the soule, euery sinne proues deadly, and as a stabbe to the heart; for though woe doe not presently feele it, though our deadnesse and numnesse make vs insensible and carelesse. Yet in the day of Gods visitation, when Gods wrath shall fall vpon vs and open our wounds which sinne hath made, then shall wee roare and crie, and indure torment enough: thus if wee haue cause to weepe for any thing, wee haue cause to weepe for our sinnes that strike so deepe to our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and soules. <note place="margin">Note.</note>Thus we haue againe to bewaile the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our hearts, that in bodily cures can away with  the cutting of a limbe, breaking of an arme or legge, and yet cannot away with the searching and lancing of our consciences.</p>
                  <p>Thus as it is by Reason, so the necessitie of mourning
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18128:231"/>
for sinne is proued by Example, for there was none of the holy men of God but they haue wept for sinne, and wee haue certainely as much and more cause to weepe then they had; and yet how farre short doe wee come of this dutie? shall I name <hi>Dauid, Daniel, Peter,</hi> and other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God? how feruent was holy <hi>Luther</hi> in mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and weeping for his sinnes? had <hi>Dauid</hi> cause to weepe abundantly and water his couch with teares, and haue not wee cause much more? Had <hi>Peter</hi> cause to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his fall bitterly? and haue not wee more falls then hee had? Had <hi>Daniel</hi> cause to bewaile his many trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and are not we guiltie of many more iniquities? shall <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> weepe, and weepe for sinne in a manner a riuer of teares, and haue wee no cause or necessitie to weepe for our many transgressions? O if wee could search our sinfull and corrupt liues, and see how we haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our God, wee could not choose but weepe for our sinnes: what not shed teares for sinne, when wee see our Sauiour shed blood in the Garden for our sins, and not for any of his; hee being without sinne, but we are hard-hearted and neuer thinke vpon our Redemption: Nor shed a teare for that which wrought blood out of Christs body. O wonderfull and lamentable, what a pitious thing is this, that wee cannot let fall a drop of water for sinne, when hee poured out abundance of his blood for the same; yea, he did sweate it out for griefe and anguish; a signe of small or no sorrow in vs; when wee cannot wring out a few teares, much lesse poure out water before the Lord, as his people sometime did for their sinnes, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 6.<note place="margin">1. Sam 7. 6.</note> Thus much of the second Conclusion; The  third is this:</p>
                  <p>Conclusion 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is neuer a man liuing that is able to shed teares for euery sinne hee doth commit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Euery sinne it is certaine deserues teares, yea, and bitter
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18128:231"/>
teares too; for euery sinne is committed against God a holy Father; yea, Holinesse it selfe and an infinite Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie; now we know it is no small matter to offend God, nor no great enforcement to shed teares for our sinnes, and yet wee are hardly brought to weepe for one sinne of ten thousand: It is so in the generall, though it bee true that there be some of more feeling and tender consciences then others: as it is said of St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> that hee wept for sinne, and was so tenderly affected, as if hee had killed a man; but ô that it were so with vs; that wee could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to this tendernesse of heart: The hinderances and impediments I take to bee two:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Blindnesse in Iudgement.</item>
                     <item>2. Hardnesse of heart.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For many are so blinde, that they know not sinne to  bee sinne in their iudgements: As <hi>Mal.</hi> 1 when they were reproued of their sinnes, yet they say, wherein haue wee sinned? or if men know sinne to bee sinne, yet they mistake; they thinke great sinnes are but pettie ones; and small ones, they esteeme to bee nothing at all, not worth the grieuing at, because for the present they paine not: as a man hauing a bleeding wound hee sees not; passes it <note place="margin">Bleeding wound.</note> ouer vntill hee faints: it proouing deadly if not stopt and cured.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, another cause is, <hi>Hardnesse of heart,</hi> which  (for all the Regenerate are in part sanctified) we are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto, therefore though some in Repentance bring forth teares; yet a number for their liues cannot shed any one teare for sinne, vntill God by an especiall worke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert and turne the Heart vnto him, by an especiall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his blessed Spirit and power of Grace. The want of this tendernesse wee see made the Prophet in the name of the Church crie out, <hi>Isa. 63. 17. O Lord why hast thou made vs to erre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:18128:232"/>
                     <hi>our hearts from thy feare?</hi> Yet I must needs say, there is great difference betwixt that hardnes of heart in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in the wicked: for that of the former is sensible, full of paine, griefe, sorrow, mourning yea there is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular sorrow for that hardnesse felt, besides that of other sinnes: but that which is in the wicked is insensible, they are neuer thorowly touched or affected with a feeling of their sinnes, and so neuer weepe or sorrow for them. The fourth Conclusion is,</p>
                  <p>Conclus. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a man may truly repent him of his sinnes, though he cannot weepe or shed a teare for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which I prooue thus, <hi>They that can mourne for their sinnes, and in compunction of soule make vse of the death and passion of Christ, may truly repent:</hi> but a man may mourne for his sinne and do thus, and yet neuer shed a teare; therefore a man may truly repent without shedding of teares, for teares are not alwayes a signe of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. As we see <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. where it is sayd those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts <note place="margin">Act 2. 37.</note> were pricked in their hearts, not pricked in their eyes; for a mans heart may be pricked and ouerwhelmed with griefe, and yet not weepe or shed any teares. So wee see the Publican, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. Hee could not weepe, but hee was humbled and cast downe in the sense and feeling of his sinnes; <hi>Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>be mercifull to me a sinner.</hi> So in like manner, we doe not read that the Theefe vpon the Crosse did weepe or shed any teares, yet hee confessed his sinnes, and was inwardly grieued for them. So we see a man may truly repent who sheddeth no teares. For as a Wine vessell without vent is readie to burst; so the lesse <note place="margin">Vine-vessell.</note> weeping, many times the greater is the sorrow, and the heart so much the more ouerburthened. Teares are as a vent, which when they are not, and the heart this way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed and eased, the inward griefe is so much the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18128:232"/>
and great. The fifth Conclusion is:</p>
                  <p>Conclus. 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That there is hardly any man liuing, that hath truly felt the worke of Grace in himselfe, but at one time or other, if God let him liue any time, hath or shall in some measure shed teares for his sinnes. Euer excepting those men whom their naturall hard and drie temper of their eyes disableth perpetually from all teares: <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Conclusion I will first open, and then in time confirme it: yet assure your selues of this, That euery one cannot weepe in their repentance and first Calling, vntil it please God to infuse more grace, and smite the heart. Yet though at first they doe not, wait a while, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time, or when God sends some great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or judgement vpon them, you shall see them come to teares, and weepe for their sinnes. As a man that is stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">One stricken with a sword.</note> with a sword, the bloud doth not alwayes by and by follow; So it is with the smitten conscience of a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded sinner; there is feare, astonishment, and amazement many times, before weeping; and yet afterwards teares may come abundantly, as bloud after a wound.</p>
                  <p>But to my promise now, which was, first, To open the Conclusion: secondly, To explaine it. First then I say, <hi>That hardly is there any man liuing, but he hath or shall shed teares for sinne, if God haue a purpose to saue him:</hi> Therefore howsoeuer one may goe away at the first rejoycing, like <hi>Lydia</hi> at her first conuersion; and like the <note place="margin">Lydia. Eunucb.</note> Eunuch in the <hi>Acts:</hi> yet at one time or other they shall weepe and mourne for their sins: though I would haue you remember, that I do not exclude any from the hope of Heauen, and state of true penitencie, that shed no tears for sinne; for so I haue shewed the case may be, though seldome heard of. <hi>Dauid</hi> sayes, <hi>Psalme 37. 25. I haue
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18128:233"/>
beene young and now am old, yet haue I not seene the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous for saken, nor their seed begging bread:</hi> And yet poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> died a begger, and was carried by the hands of the Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome: Now <hi>Dauids</hi> meaning is, not that there was none of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dauids</hi> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</note> or of their seed that did begge their bread, but that it was a rare thing, that hee had not seene it in his dayes, or in an Age: So wee may say of this point; It may bee a man may bee truely conuerted, and yet neuer shedde a teare in his life: but it is a rare case, no ordinarie thing, it is that which seldome falls out one of a thousand, but that at one time or other they are so pressed with their sinnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, secondly I say, that true teares are not to bee  commanded by vs, but are an effect of Gods grace wrought in man: as <hi>Zach. 12. 10. And I will poure vpon</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Za<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>the house of</hi> Dauid, <hi>and vpon the Inhabitants of</hi> Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>the Spirit of Grace and supplication, and they shall weepe, &amp;c.</hi> That is, they shall mourne and lament as a man that mourneth for his owne sinnes; nature may make a man mourne for the losse of his children, friends, goods, wife and such like, but it is onely the Spirit of God, of Grace that can make a man shed teares for his sinnes, so that a man may bee a naturall man, an vnregenerate man, an vnconuerted man, and neuer shed a teare for his sinnes all his life long, though hee bee a most wicked liuer. But if the Spirit of Grace once worke vpon his heart, hardly but at one time or other, his heart will melt and lament that hee hath offended God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, I say, if God let him liue any time in this  world (for a man may bee taken away immediatly vpon his conuersion, as the cheefe vpon the crosse) and then as hee wants time for other Christian duties, so for this also; but if God let a man continue any time, then one occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or other will bring him backe to the beholding of his sinnes, cause him to afflict his thoughts, repent through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and so worke teares out of him, yea bitterly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18128:233"/>
his sinnes, because no man truely conuerted can thinke of his sins with pleasure but with griefe. <hi>Iob</hi> saith thou makest mee to possesse the sins of my youth; so wee may bee free and haue little sorrow and few or no teares for sinne at first, and yet this case of compassion may affect vs in our riper age, or old age, or in the time of sicknesse and death, at which time wee may come in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse of soule to bewaile them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, againe I say, that at one time or other wee  shall shed teares for sinne, some doe mourne and weepe at their first conuersion, and lye a long time vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ere they can be comforted, As a many experiences of troubled consciences amongst vs doe shew. Some againe like to the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 39. and <hi>Lydia, Act.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 8. 39. Act. 16. 14.</note> 16. 14. when God opens their hearts, absenting matter of terror, and representing full matter of ioy, depart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at first reioycing, not mourning as others: So that I say the case is different in this case, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation and diuine impression vpon the soule of ioy or terrour in the present apprehension; or according to the former guiltinesse of the party conuerted: but this is most sure if we belong to the Lord, at one time or other, wee shall weepe and mourne for sinnes of our selues and others. See <hi>Psal,</hi> 25. 7. saith <hi>Dauid, Remember not O</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 25. 7. 2. King. 22. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord the sinnes of my youth.</hi> And 2. <hi>King.</hi> 22. 10. you shall finde how much good <hi>Iosiah</hi> was affected with the sinnes of the time, when <hi>Helkiah</hi> the Priest deliuered him a booke whereby hee apprehended how the people had offended God, so that whosoeuer of Gods children hath not yet felt conuersion throughly, hee shall feele it before this life leaue him: as I shewed formerly, a wound <note place="margin">Wound.</note> with a sword makes but a white stroke at first; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while the blood issues aboundantly: So euery one doth not by and by bleed vpon his first conuersion, and feeling of sinne, when hee is smitten by the Law: but tarrie awhile till some further working vpon
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18128:234"/>
his heart, and you shall see vnconcealed sorrow and teares issue forth amaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now the Reason of this I thinke is,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why some men mourne, and some doe not, but reioyce at their first conuersion; because it is with the motions of the minde, as it is with the motions of compounded bodies, Elements predominate tending still towards their proper orbe or place agreeable vnto them. So at that time of conuersion, looke what the soule is most possessed with at that time, thither it is carryed. As fill a bladder <note place="margin">A Bladder with winde.</note> with winde and throw it to the ground, it will not lye there but bend vpwards to the aire, because it is filled with ayre; but fill it with earth, and it will fall and lye on the earth, because of the earth that fills it: and our bodies being earthly fall to the earth againe: So it is in <note place="margin">Cause of feare or ioy.</note> the minde of a man at his first conuersion, if hee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the mercie of God in Christ, more then the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iudgements of God for sinne, then hee is carryed with comfort, but on the other side apprehending iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments most, then hee is cast downe and discouraged.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly I say, all that are truely conuerted shall shedde teares at one time or other, though not in a like measure, for some shed teares in a more abundant manner, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalen</hi> who sate at Christs feete and washed them with her teares, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. So of <hi>Peter, Math.</hi> 26. who went <note place="margin">Luk 7.</note> out and wept bitterly: and of <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 6. who wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his couch with teares: whom though all cannot fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, yet all must wish to imitate in true sorrow for sinne, in one measure or other; for it is well obserued of a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man that a man may let out the corruption of a byle, <note place="margin">Byle let out.</note> as well out of a little hole as out of a great one: as one may know that there is life in a man, as well by the stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">Life by stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> and wagging of a finger, as of the whole hand: so
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18128:234"/>
may the truth of Repentance as well bee discerned by a few teares as a great many. Thus wee haue seene the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the conclusion. That there be very few who are truely conuerted, if they continue any time after conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion but will shed teares for their sinnes at one time or other, in one measure or other. Now I come to confirme it diuersly;</p>

                     <hi>First by Reason thus,</hi> hardly is there any man liuing  be he neuer so stout hearted, and composed in himselfe, but there is one thing or other that will make him weepe though hee set neuer so good a face on the matter, the losse of wife, husband, children, or the vnkindnesse of friends, or some worldly calamitie; but in those that bee truely conuerted, <hi>the greatest griefe of all is the griefe for sinne,</hi> all other griefes whatsoeuer are nothing so great or sensible; If this bee throughly apprehended; nothing so workes on the heart of a renewed man, as the heauie and sad remembrance of sinnes past, whereby hee hath offended God, and grieued him to whom he oweth more seruice and duty then to all the world besides. And so seeing there is not any man liuing, but some extreamitie will make him weepe, and the greatest extremitie in any mans conscience truely considered is sinne, or for sinne, hardly is there any man liuing but at one time or other the conscience of his sinnes will make him weepe and draw teares from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2 By Authoritie.</note>Secondly, <hi>By Authoritie</hi> thus, <hi>Psal. 126. 5. They that sow in teares shall reape in ioy. Ierem. 50. 4.

21. 4. it is promised, <hi>And God shall wipe away all teares from their eyes,</hi> not onely the teares which they haue shed in regard of their miserie, but also those shed in regard of their sinnes: so it is most sure, that those who are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and shed teares for any thing, will especially mourne and weepe for sinne.</p>

The like may be said of the children of Israel, a proud insolent hard-hearted people, such as would not easily melt, yet when the Angel, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. 4. came and set their sins <note place="margin">Iudg. 2. 4.</note> before them, the text saith, <hi>That they lift vp their voice and wept:</hi> and in another case of sorrow, 1. <hi>Sam</hi> 7. 6. wee <note place="margin">Iudg. 2. 4. 1.

                  <p>That is in peace of a good conscience, and feeling of the promises and comforts of God made in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> so that these words shew vs that there is great cause for vs to inquire after. The case of Repentance wee last spake of, <hi>Whether euery one that hath truely repented can shew himselfe comfortable and heauenly minded at the houre of Death?</hi> Now the answer I will lay downe in two points:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That a man may truely repent, and yet depart out of this world with little or no comfort at the houre of death.</item>
                     <item>2. That there is neuerthelesse a very hopefull and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way, whereby true penitents may come boldly to die with comfort, if they doe not neglect the meanes.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Concerning the first point, I say a man may truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent him of his sinnes, and yet shew little or no comfort at the day of death. Yea the truth is, that the greatest part of Gods people as they liue well, so they die well and comfortably: as wee see <hi>Steuen</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 16. Hee <note place="margin">Steuens sight.</note> saw a heauenly vision, heauen opened, and <hi>Christ</hi> stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at his right hand readie to helpe him, and euen so for the most in the day of death, the people of God see heauenly visions: So <hi>Iacob</hi> went downe to Aegypt, and <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 33.</note>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:18128:237"/>
died there comfortably and in peace: The like wee reade of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who commanded his bones to bee remooued, <note place="margin">Gen. 50. 25.</note> at their departure from Aegypt. So <hi>Dauid, Moses,</hi> and other of the Saints died, and had honourable buriall in the peace of a good conscience. This made <hi>Balaam</hi> say, <hi>O that I might die the death of the righteous, and that my last end might bee like his:</hi> Hee would not liue the life of the Saints, but hee would gladly haue so died: it was too strict, too precise a way for a naturall man like him: too much against the currant and streame of the world, though hee would haue dyed like the righteous, because hee knew the difference was great betwixt their death and that of wicked men. So it is written, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. of <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 15.</note> the Fathers of the faithfull; <hi>They all died in faith,</hi> not all of lingring sicknesses, nor they died not all in their beds, nor amongst their friends, in bodily honour and pompe which may bee taken away and debarred men to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ioy: but in faith, in peace of conscience, in hope of heauen, in the comfortable application of the promises of Gods loue, in assurance of the pardon of sinne. So as I say, vsually and ordinarily, the people of God liue in this world with comfort, and depart out of this world as old <hi>Simeon</hi> did when hee had gotten <hi>Christ</hi> into his armes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. Yet sometimes it falls out by the wise dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Luk. 2.</note> of God that through their owne default, the most faithfull and beleeuing men haue very little comfort, and poore fruits of their faith when they come to die, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die without feeling (which is grieuous) or which is more fearefull with feare and horror; which not onely daily experience confirmeth, but Scripture also: as <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> 8. 9. All things come alike to all: there is one euent <note place="margin">Eccles. 8. 9.</note> to the righteous and to the vnrighteous, to the good and the bad, to the pure and the polluted, to him that sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth and to him that sacrificeth not, &amp;c. the meaning of which place is, that all worldly things fall alike to all with the same condition and time, to the wicked as well as the good, to the Iust, as to the vniust. Now if all things fall
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18128:238"/>
alike in their liues, then may some men say, it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so alike in their deaths, and so wee may not by and by  condemne a man that shewes little comfort at his death;<note place="margin">Note.</note> but if his life haue beene good, he hauing walked in the feare of God, shewed signes of his conuersion, wee are to iudge of him according to the whole course of his life, and not according to that one instance of his death: for as a man that sees his fellow sit vpon a high rocke a great <note place="margin">One on a Rocke.</note> way from him, though hee stirre neither hand nor foot, nor shew any motion of life, yet hee knowes there is life in him, because he sits vpright; there was life in him when he left him; and no body came since to take away his life; so in this case it is with a Christian, though wee see no motion or signe of spirituall life at the instant, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee knew him when hee had the life of God, and grace, and no body since could take it from him, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee, wee may conclude, but that it remaines still with him; as 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 9. it is said, <hi>Whosoeuer is borne of God</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cause of want of comfort in Death.</note>These be the three causes why many of Gods people  finde little comfort in the houre of death: <hi>First, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their complexion,</hi> for grace doth neuer abolish na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but onely tempers and mortifies it. Indeed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Grace is to abolish sinfull affection in man, but naturall affections it abolishes not, onely orders and keeps them within bounds and measure; as wee see in the two Kine who carried the Arke, there was a naturall affection <note place="margin">Kine carrying the Arke.</note> in them which made them low as they went, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 12. and there was also a power of God seene ouermaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nature, which made them carry the Arke vnto the place which God had appointed, thus Grace orders one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but destroys not nature, it qualifies and directs it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a seruant in all things. So obserue of what consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution a man is before Regeneration, and you shall finde him of the same after conuersion: If melancholie before, hee will bee melancholie after: if chollericke, the same after. Hence it is that the very best men may shew a great deale of difference betwixt what they were in life, and in the time of death: for if a man be chollericke by nature, if formerly hee haue beene hastie and rash, this man though a sanctified man, and the deare childe of God, may yet (vnlesse a great deale of grace with strength of iudgement ouermaster nature) shew much impatiencie, touchinesse, way wardnesse when hee comes to die. So if a man haue beene of a melancholie disposition, of a sad speech; or few words in his life, though excellent in grace, this man if not ouermastered by grace, for his life is not able to shew himselfe cheerefull and comfortable when hee comes to die. On the other side, if a man be of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18128:239"/>
a sanguine complexion, and so by consequence light and merry; this man although hee haue beene a vilde and a loose liuer, yet hee may shew himselfe comfortable at the day of death, when yet this comfort may be not a worke of grace but of meere nature. Thus when wee see a man distrust himselfe in the day of death, wee may set our selues from his owne disposition to comfort him; for in some complexions, one may come to die comfortably, though one want grace, and in some there may be a lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishnesse and discomfort, and yet haue a warrantable end: Therefore if wee would iudge rightly of any at the day of death, wee must consider of what complexion they are, and so deale iudiciously with our comforts and threatnings. As if wee poure a glasse of wine amongst <note place="margin">Wine.</note> wine, it tastes onely of wine, but if wee poure it into a glasse of water, then though the wine bee predominant, yet there will be a tange and taste of water; euen so when the grace of God is infused into our hearts, though that bee predominant, yet there will bee a tange and taste of nature in this life: which is one cause why Gods children die sometimes vncomfortably.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2 Cause why some Saints die vncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably. Blow on the head.</note>Secondly, another reason in Nature may bee, <hi>Because of the violence of the Disease;</hi> for there bee some disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in nature which worke more furiously vpon the spirits then others doe, as a man hauing a great blow vpon the head, may bee so stonied and amazed with the same, that for the same time hee may not know what hee speakes or doth: euen so a holy man may be so diseased for the time, and distressed with the extremitie of his paine, that hee may breake forth into rage and passion, hee knoweth not what: as it is said of <hi>Moses, Psal. 106. 33. That they did</hi>

So one may die of an Apoplexie or dead Palsie, in which case a man shall haue all his senses benummed so, as hee may die like a blocke without shew of iudgement or reason, and yet for all this bee in a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed state, because though the state of his body bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, yet the state of his minde and soule remaines vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched.</p>
                  <p>Yet I doe not maintaine so saying, as if all who died <note place="margin">Exception.</note> of these diseases died without comfort; or that one may not die comfortably being thus visited; yes it is most cleere, that if a man be not wanting to himselfe, and cast away the helpes which God giues him; hee may die with comfort of whatsoeuer sicknesse hee dies of. For of all deaths the most extreamely afflictiue is by fire, this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the sharpest and sorest of all bodily deaths, and yet we see many of the Martyres haue shewed themselues very ioyfull and comfortable euen in the very flames. The reason whereof is this; <hi>The power of grace is infinitely greater then the power of nature:</hi> as 1. <hi>Iohn 4. 4. Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

                     <hi>is hee that is in you, then hee that is in the world:</hi> as if hee should say, the power of nature is the spirit of the creature, but the power of Grace is by the Spirit of God: now the spirit of God being greater then any created spirit whatsoeuer, it comes to passe that the power of Grace brings the power of Nature vnto subiection, and ouertopping those spirits and senses workes excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding comfort, euen in the houre of death: as wee see <note place="margin">Contrarie windes.</note> when contrarie windes blow vpon a Ship, that which is

                     <hi>The second Generall Cause of want of comfort in the day of death</hi> is, <hi>The decay of Grace;</hi> for many times the people of God are negligent, growe secure, omit the meanes of growing in grace, grow loose, are not carefull to answer that expectation which is had of them, leaue off diligence in hearing the Word, and practise of holy duties: quench the good spirit with following vaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, giue way vnto temptations, suffering them to take hold vpon them; thus they breake out some one way, and some another, whereby it comes to passe, that it is the good pleasure of God to correct this loosenesse (though they thinke to shelter themselues vnder the Almightie as formerly) but they cannot doe it; wee see when <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>

                        <hi>Sampsons</hi> intent.</note> at other times, but for his life hee could not, for his strength was departed from him: thus when some of Gods people runne out in their liues, and venture on sin, many times they smart for it at their deaths, ere the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with conscience be ouercome, and peace in the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the forgiuenesse of sinnes be settled: So 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 30. the Apostle shewes them, <hi>For this cause many are</hi>

                     <hi>weake and sicke amongst you, and many sleepe;</hi> so that oft times the cause of little comfort in death, is by reason that men liue loosely and carelesly when they bee well. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1. <hi>Cor. 15. 56. The sting of death is sin, and the</hi>

                     <hi>strength of sinne is the Law;</hi> It is sinne that makes the sting of death to bee so grieuous, painfull, and bitter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: so that is plaine, the more loosely a man liues, the more licentiously hee giues himselfe ouer to the world,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18128:240"/>
the more will death grate and sting him when hee comes to die. Therefore if a man would lessen his owne paines in the day of death, hee must looke to lessen his owne sin in his life; because <hi>Death in death hath no sting but by the worke of sinne.</hi> If a man haue an apparant hot bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Feuer, the more hee drinkes hot Wines, and feedes <note place="margin">Burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</note> on fierie spices, the stronger and more violent must his fitts bee; where by the contrary, the more sober and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate hee is in diet, the weaker still will his fittes bee; euen so it is in death: Death is like a powerfull fitt of an Ague, if a man distemper himselfe before death, and liue loosely and licentiously, death will shake euery ioynt of him with mighty terrors, and threaten to bring him to the King of terrors, but if a man bee wise to weaken death by Repentance, Humiliation, holy prayer to God; then though death may come, yet the furie and strength of it shall bee much abated: and so wee may haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the houre of death, if we be carefull to watch ouer our liues.</p>

                     <note place="margin">3 Generall cause of our want of comfort in Death.</note>The <hi>Third generall Reason</hi> is, <hi>because of our indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition at the houre of Death,</hi> or in Death, because men doe not then striue with themselues to stirre vp their Faith, Zeale, and the graces of God in them, and prepare themselues with a good conscience to die; for a man may haue Faith and Repentance, and other graces of God in him, and yet because hee doth not stirre vp those graces in him, hee may die with little comfort. A man in this case is like wasting coales couered ouer with ashes, which <note place="margin">Dead coales.</note> must bee stirred, or else they will die suddenly; therefore when a man comes to die, hee must stirre vp his faith, hope, repentance, patience, care, loue, and all the graces of the spirit: euen as old <hi>Iacob, Gen. 49. vlt.</hi> when hee <note place="margin">Gen. 49. vlt.</note> came to die, did reare vp himselfe, leaned on his staffe, and worshipped God, though an old decrepid man, and bedrid, yet hee gat him vp vpon his knees, turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and renewed his repentance, so must a Christian

                     <hi>the feeling and apprehension of Gods loue may be so great in a man, that it may make him reioyce in his spirit, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued against all mischiefe and affliction whatsoeuer which is cast vpon him.</hi> As <hi>Iames 1. 2. Count it exceeding</hi>

                  <p>Now if a Christian may die thus comfortably in bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flames, in the greatest extremitie that can be, then it is more easie with diuine assistance to ouercome the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser tentations; for if a heart be sanctified by the power of Gods grace, settled, composed in it selfe, there is no doubt but that hee may die in peace with heauenly comfort, though hee be in perplexitie vpon his sicke bed. Thus it is cleere, there is a very probable way, for a man to die in comfort.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18128:242"/>
persecutions; yea, and death it selfe. The hope of eternall life affoords them such comfort, with the appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances thereof, that all the rest is either ouercome, or ouerpassed quickly. Yet in this case hee will say, <q>Lord I thanke thee I haue my jewell still, sicknesse hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away my strength, and afflictions my ease; theeues <note place="margin">q. d.</note> haue taken away my goods: but Lord I thanke thee I haue thee still: all these things haue not taken God from mee, nor <hi>Christ,</hi> nor the hope of Heauen, nor the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Angels, the intercession of my Sauiour, the peace of conscience, and the like; thus in this case a mans ioy remaines still.</q>

Wherefore if a man would die well, he must first come to liue well, for que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse as a man liues, so is he likely to die. If a man look vpon a tree when it is a felling he may giue a shrewd <note place="margin">Tree felling.</note> ghesse where it will fall; for looke where the greatest bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of boughes hang or grow, that way commonly the tree will fall, and euen so, looke which way a mans thoughts &amp; affections carry him in the course of his life, the very same inclination will sway him at the houre of his death.

                        <hi>haires of your head are all numbred.</hi> Secondly, wee must arme our selues against the feare of death, <hi>by considering the comfortable state which followeth after Death;</hi> For Christ hath quite altred and changed the nature thereof, so that whereas before death and hell by meanes of our sins were chained together to swallow vs vp, as it is <hi>Reu.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Reuel. 6. 8.</note> 6. 8. <hi>Death went before, and Hell followed after;</hi> Now Christ hath dislinked and disioyned them, and hath made a new vnion, so that now death goes before and heauen followes after to the godly and faithfull. And therefore as a man that is ready to passe ouer some great terrible Riuer <note place="margin">Great Riuer passage.</note> into some delicate garden, must not so much looke vpon the deepe waters, as thinke vpon the place whither hee is a going, so must wee doe in our iourney to heauen, wee must not so much be terrified with the obstacles in our way: as the benefites wee shall haue by dissolution, freed from sin, and to inioy the felicitie of the blessed for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; yea, and to consider, that as the Angels stood rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to carry <hi>Lazarus</hi> his soule into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, so stand the Angels round about the beds of the faithfull to carry their soules into heauen, which is a maine bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite wee now haue by death; <note place="margin">Note.</note>
                        <hi>for it is made to be the great enemie of sinne, although by sinne it came into the world;</hi>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:18128:245"/>
yet God hath so altered the former course, as he hath made death the onely meanes to abolish sinne in his seruants; <hi>this should make vs reioyce</hi> in the day of death, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whether death brings a soule fitted for heauen. If a man should be sent for vnto the court to liue there, and <note place="margin">One sent for to Court.</note> to receiue honour from the King, if as hee entered there should stand a terrible grim Porter at the gate, this man would not much feare the Porter being sent for to come to the King, but cast his eyes on the Pallace, and busie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the hopes of his entertainment at hand: So, when God sends for vs to liue with him in heauen, though death be like a terrible grim Porter, yet let vs not looke vpon his vgly face, but cast our eyes to heauen and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that, by considering the comforts of that place. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, wee must arme our solues against the feare of  Death, <hi>by considering, that by death wee die to sinne:</hi> and that death is the very accomplshing of our saluation: Sinne brings all to death, and God hath made death (as I said) a meanes to abolish sinne, so that first death is the messenger of God. Secondly, it is the doore to let vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen. Thirdly, it is the death of sinne. Fourthly, Death is a consu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation of our sanctification here in this world, therefore a true penitent soule hath no cause to bee affraid of death. Indeed the wicked worldling, whose hope and God in his wealth, hath great cause to be affraid of it, because in a moment it snatches away from him all that he hath beene a gathering and drudging for so many yeares together, leauing him nothing of all his hundreds and thousands, but a poore wooden coffin to lye in: this makes him affraid of death. And againe, he is affraid of death, because it is not a doore to let him into heauen, but an open wide gate to set him into hell where hee must lye eternally tormented with the Deuill and his angels for euer. But a godly soule who hath his place made, his sins repented of, who hath liued a watchfull life ouer his heart and wayes, hath now no cause to be terrified, but rather as Christ speakes; <hi>To lift vp his head and reioyce, knowing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18128:245"/>
that his Redemption drawes neere:</hi> and that his saluation is now neerer then when he first beleeued: So that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian vntill death come may truely say, <hi>Morior dum non morior, I die whilst I doe not die.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>a man that would die well, must labour to</hi>

                        <hi>weaken death betimes;</hi> If a man were to fight a combat with an enemy for his life, hauing the dyeting of him a weeke before the combat or more, I hope no man thinks but that it were good policie, to make his enemie so fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and poore, that hee should not be able to strike a stroke to hurt him: So euery man and woman liuing must haue a combat with death; and yet this is a great mercie of God shewed vs, that wee haue the dieting of death, so that we may weaken it if hee will, and abate his strength. Our good life weakens him, and our sins giue strength vnto him. Therefore if we haue any care of our estate, let vs prouide to weaken him before wee come to the combat, that hee doe not foile and ouercome vs. Let vs deale with him as the <hi>Philistims</hi> did with <hi>Sampson,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iudg. 16. 21.

Wherefore I exhort euery one of you who hope for the fauour of God, to repent you of your sinnes, and set a worke the power of grace, that so you may attaine for your comfort to finde Death weakened in the day of Death.</p>

                     </gap>gate the bitternesse of the paines of death; If one thus doe constantly beleeue it, hee shall finde great comfort in the houre of death. When the people had light vpon the bitter waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> yea so bitter, that they could not drinke them, <hi>Exod,</hi> 15. 15. as <hi>Moses</hi> saw <note place="margin">

Bitter waters.</note> the people in this extremitie, God shewed him a tree, which when <hi>Moses</hi> had cast a little of it in the water, by and by it became sweet, euen so must wee pray vnto God that into the bitter cup of our death, hee would cast in a little of the sweet wood of the crosse of Christ: I meane a little spirituall comfort in and through his gratious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and then as hee endured his sorrow and sweates, so the sourest death shall become most easie vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Thus hauing declared vnto you the duties of Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for death, it remaines I shew you how to practise the same. Wee reade, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 22. when the rich man <note place="margin">Math, 19. 22.</note> came to Christ, desirous to know how hee might attaine eternall life, and Christ had told him, that for attaining thereof hee must sell all hee had and giue to the poore, he went away sorrowfull. So it may be that many who come hither to learne how to die, when they heare that it must cost them so deare, that there is so much adoe about it, and must indure a great deale of labour and paine, will bee content neuer to goe about it. And yet as the wise <note place="margin">Wise mens iourney.</note> men tooke a long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ourney, with a great deale of trauell
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18128:248"/>
and paines to finde out Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 10. whom hauing found, they were exceeding glad and joyfull: so whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he be that labours and takes much paines to die well, hauing once attained the same, the joy of so comfortable a passage at such a pinch, wil make him rejoyce, and think all his labour and paines well spent. The next thing to be considered, is,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That there must be a holy disposition at the time of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For though a man haue made preparation for it, yet if he doe not holily dispose himselfe when he comes to die, he may want the blessing of a comfortable and quiet death. As when qualmes come ouer or vpon a man, if he <note place="margin">Cure of qualms.</note> haue <hi>Aquavitae, Rosasolis,</hi> or other comfortable waters by him, he may be refreshed and reuiued; but if because of some couetous humor or neglect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he let the bottles hang by, neither tasting or applying any remedie, it is all one as if he had beene without them. So it may be with a man at the time of death, he may haue the warers of good wishes by him, prepare himselfe for God, and pretend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand to receiue comfort in his sickenesse; yet if hee let them lie by, and applie them not, that is, stir them not vp in himselfe, for all his preparation, he may find little or no comfort at death. Therefore there must be a spiritual excitation and stirring vp of the graces of God at that time; the rather because that is the last act of our life, the last part we shall play vpon the stage of this world. Saint <hi>Paul, 1. Cor.</hi> 15. 26. calls it, <hi>The last enemie that shall be subdued, is Death, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore because Death is the <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 26.</note> last of our life, we should haue a speciall care to act &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that well. A good Mariner who hath carried a ship <note place="margin">Matiners care.</note> well two or three yeres through the raging seas, will espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially double his care for her safe landing; that she do not miscarrie when she as readie to enter into the Harbour. Euen so a man who hath well disposed of the little barke
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18128:248"/>
of his body fiftie or sixtie yeares through the troublesome seas of this world, must haue a great care to lay it downe well at the day of death, or else he shall staine all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cunning and knowledge. Thus you see there must bee a holy disposition in Death; which consists in six things.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That a man bee willing to die, when the time is</hi>

Therfore when a man wiltake on to enuie against any sin, be it swearing, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, &amp;c. and by and by runne into the same sinnes, it is an hypocriticall repentance. I grant some sinnes hang vpon a man through the corruption of Nature, and will hardly bee shaken off: So that if we doe not striue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them and labour to weaken their forces, they must and will by their vse and custome bring on hardnesse of heart, and so no repentance at all, wherefore let vs set a watch vpon our hearts for feare of returning to our old sinnes, and leaue sinne before it leaue vs.</p>

So <hi>Ahab</hi> made a shew of repentance for the killing of <hi>Naboth,</hi> but neuer repented for killing the Lords Prophets nor of his Idolatrie. It is true indeed, That he that repents truly of any one sinne, repents of all; because, <hi>Eadem formalis ratio,</hi> makes him hate all: which hatred will at last, make him get out of al these snares: yet there is in many a corruption ortaint of sinne cleauing to some, and forsaking others: which is another sort of hypocriticall repentance.</p>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18128:259"/>
a secret foe to sinne, that it makes one with all his heart indeuour to turne from it: therefore whosoeuer doth not turne from his sinne, is not likely to come vnto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

It is true then that all men shall repent at one time or other, sooner or later; either in this life or at the day of Iudgement. Therefore how much better were it for men to repent here in this life, where they may haue peace and ioy in God and their owne consciences, then too late, with all torments vnsupportable hereafter, when they shall haue no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite by such an afflictue penall repentance. Therfore let vs repent betimes since God is so gratious to accept of vs, though wee haue beene great and grieuous sinners; for this, see what <hi>Samuel</hi> said vnto the people, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, 1. <hi>Sam. 12. 20.

                        <note place="margin">Late Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> when a man neglects and puts it off all his life, vntill the day of death, it is greatly to be suspected, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when a man hath had good meanes of conuersion, growing in grace, and liuing vnder a good ministrie. Wee reade in the storie of <hi>Esau, Heb.</hi> 12. 17. because hee <note place="margin">Esaus <hi>Teares.</hi>

Secondly, his repentance was accompanied with so many graces of the spirit in that disgracefull extremitie, that few (who haue so liued) attaine vnto at the day of death; especially such who haue hard hearts, and all their life-time put it off vntill that time.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">2 Constrained Repentance.</note>Secondly, <hi>Constrained Repentance,</hi> when one does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,  but in the time of trouble, or in some great sicknesse, afflictions, or when the iudgements of God are vpon him: as was seen in <hi>Pharoah, Exod.</hi> 8. 15. of whom it is written; <hi>But when</hi> Pharoah <hi>saw that there was respite, hee harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his heart, and hearkened not vnto them as the Lord had said.</hi> So also <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 34. when the ground opened and swallowed vp <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> &amp; <hi>Abiram,</hi> with their

companie, the children of Israel hearing the crie fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and were affraid lest they also should bee swallowed vp, but yet notwithstanding after this iudgement they did murmure against God and against <hi>Moses.</hi> So there is a number of men and women amongst vs that neuer thinke of Repentance, but when the hand of God lyes heauie vpon them, as it is <hi>Psal. 78. 34. 35.

                  <p>Now if no mans Repentance bee <hi>perfect</hi> in this life, then no man liuing can <hi>perfectly repent</hi> him of his sinnes, and therefore when hee hath repented, hee had need to turne againe and to pray God to forgiue the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.

not imperfect in Nature, but in Measure and Degrees. Now that euery mans Repentance is imperfect in this life, it is prooued;</p>

                     <hi>Generally, because the state of this life is a state of Imperfection;</hi> therefore no man can possibly attaine to perfection in this world, this God hath reserued vntill wee come home to heauen. <hi>Schoolemen</hi> say well and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Scriptures: from <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 25. That as long as wee are in this life, wee are not in our countrey, but in the way: As there it is said, <hi>Agree quickly with thine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie whilst thou art in the way with him, &amp;c.</hi> Our way <note place="margin">Way.</note> now is the way to heauen, therefore because wee are but yet on our iourney in the way, our state is a state of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, as the Apostle shewes, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. 10. For we know in part and prophecie in part, but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himselfe, <hi>Phil 3. 12. Not as ehough I had already attained, either were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which I also am apprehended of Christ Iesus.</hi> So <hi>Iob 9. 20.

                     <hi>Particularly</hi> it is proued thus: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, <hi>No man can know all his sinnes,</hi> which if he cannot know, then hee cannot repent of them so fully as he should: to which purpose the Prophet speakes and prayes, <hi>Psal. 19. 12. Who can vnderstand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults:</hi> wherefore it is cleere, one cannot repent him expresly of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18128:263"/>
those sins he knows not; but what he knowes and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced of, those he ought to repent particularly. Secondly, <hi>No man, though he knew euery sinne he committed, is able to repent of the same perfectly, in regard of his corruption, so long as he carries fraile flesh about him,</hi> and why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no motion of the spirit, but it is much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by the tentations of the flesh: as <hi>Gal. 5. 17. For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and they are contrarie the one to the other, so that yee cannot doe the things that yee would.</hi> So the Apostle confesses of himselfe; <hi>Rom. 7. 18. For I know that in mee, that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing, for to will is present with me, but how to performe that which is good I finde not;</hi> and why? because the law of our members still rebells against the law of our minde, and therefore as when men poure water into a glasse of wine, the water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates <note place="margin">Water and Wine.</note> the strength, taste and colour of the Wine: euen so it is betweene the flesh and the spirit, the motions of the spirit be alwayes weakened with the motions of the flesh in some measure or other: so as wee cannot doe as wee would, but liue incumbred with a number of corruptions, clogged and weighed downe with naturall frailties; which make that we cannot perfectly repent vs of all our sinnes in this life.

Secondly, seeing our Repentance is imperfect in this  life; <hi>therefore it is cleere, that no man by his Repentance can merit any thing at the hands of God;</hi> The very <hi>Schoole-men</hi> say the selfe-same thing: that any defect, <note place="margin">Caietan. q. 11. ad Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is the opinion of some in the world, that if one haue repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a sinne, by and by he shall be saued by the vertue of his repentance. But the truth is, that though repentance bee a necessarie duty and disposition, without which no man liuing can be saued in this state of sinne; and though it be neuer so sincerely performed and often reiterated, yet because it is full of so many imperfections, it had need of the Blood of Christ to perfect it, and reconcile vs vnto God, holy, cleane, and vnblamable in his sight: as <hi>Peter</hi> tells vs; <hi>Yee also as liuely stones are built vp a spirituall</hi>

                     <note place="margin">2 Maine point. The increase of Repentance</note>The second maine thing is, <hi>That because euery mans Repentance is imperfect in this life; Therefore there must bee an increase thereof in the life of a Christian:</hi> As wee increase in other graces, so increasing in the grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Therefore Christians haue no cause to bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at this, when God brings them off againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to renew their Repentance. A number of poore Christians cannot tell what to make of this, when they haue repented their sinnes, and beene comforted with the Promises of the Gospell, and gone on a long-while in a cheerefull estate vpon a sudden; all their old sinnes are cast vpon them againe to terrifie them worse then before, and so by a heauy recourse of sorrow they become much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and amazed. <hi>But let such thinke that this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but Repentance:</hi> As in a little childe when hee begins first to write, hee frames his businesse somewhat <note place="margin">Childe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> vnhandsomely, when he hath perfected a letter, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster sets him to make the same letter againe, vntill he doe it better and better, vntill at last it bee excellently well. Euen so because there are not those firme and true inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions <note place="margin">Note well. Comfort.</note> of our affections in our first Repentance, the Lord is faine to goe ouer againe with vs, and to set vs anew to repent of our old sinnes: thus is the growth and frame of a Christians progresse in grace, to goe it ouer againe still, vntill it come to perfection. I haue heretofore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, <note place="margin">A Tree grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> that a tree alwayes growes vntill it come to his full pitch of state; yet it growes not alwayes in one sort, but sometimes it growes in the boughes, sometimes in the branches, sometimes in the root. Euen so it is with a Christian, hee hath his times of growth, hee doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes grow in one and the same sort; but sometimes in one Grace, and sometimes in another; sometimes in knowledge, faith, loue, obedience, &amp;c. and yet bee in a good estate, though he be put still to renew his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from time to time, which (if I may so speake) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes so much the purer, like gold when it is often refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; by ardent and often praying, againe and again: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18128:268"/>
distressed Christians in this case, haue no iust cause to be so perplexed and cast downe as many times they are.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore seeing it is necessarie still to grow in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <note place="margin">Exhortation to Repentance</note> and that it can neuer bee too pure nor perfect, not too often gone ouer in this life; wee must therefore labour, and euery day indeuour to be more and more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent for our sinnes, bitterly to lament them, and increase in the detestation and hatred of them: so making vse both of the mercies and iudgements of God this way, as to further vs in the growth of our repentance. So we see <hi>Peter</hi> did, by occasion of Christs mercie vnto him in the draught of fishes, <hi>Luk. 5. 8. Hee fell downe on his knees and said, depart from me, I am but a sinfull man ô Lord!</hi> So did the Lords people by occasion of the iudgement in the Thunder and lightning, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 19. say vnto <hi>Samuel, Pray for thy seruants vnto the Lord that wee dye not, for wee haue added vnto all our sinnes this euill to take a King;</hi> thus must we grow in this as in other graces. It is therefore a great corruption for any to desire to grow in other graces if this be neglected, and to doe some things conscionably, and to neglect those other maine duties in Religion. For if one had a childe, and the childe should <note place="margin">Childe.</note> grow in one part and not in another; one hand and one leg should thriue, but not the other, but keepe still at a stand, how bitterly would he complaine of this; and yet so is it in the state of many a Christian, one part of the graces of God growes well, but the other doth not grow at all; many increase in knowledge, shew a great deale of zeale, of deuotion, haue sufficiencie of faith and are cheerefull in their obedience, but they grow not a whit in Repentance, they are not a whit more humbled for their sinnes, more penitent and cast downe before the LORD, and therefore can say, what cause haue wee to bee deiected and afflicted so for it? but let vs of better knowledge, learne to bee better affected, our care being to bee more and more humbled for our sinnes.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18128:269"/>
Wee see in Nature when a man is buried and layed in the <note place="margin">Man buried.</note> ground, the more earth and mould you cast vpon him, the more hee consumes from day to day, being so much the more vnfit to rise vp againe, (suppose aliue) from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight and burden of the earth which presses him downe. Euen so it is with the sinne of a Christian: when a man hath buried sinne in himselfe, the more hee increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his repentance and holy humiliation, the more earth and mold hee casts vpon it in this kinde, the lesse able will it be to rise and reuiue againe: nay, our sad and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Repentance will make it that it shall not rise againe. Now there be three wayes wherein a Christian must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in the <hi>Grace of Repentance,</hi> as well as in other Graces.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1 In the number of Graces.</note>First for the <hi>Number of Graces;</hi> see what <hi>Peter</hi> saith, 2. <hi>Pet. 1. 5. Adde to your faith vertue, and to vertue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and to patience godlinesse, &amp;c.</hi> And so 2. <hi>Cor. 8. 7. Therefore as yee abound in euery thing, in faith and vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your loue to vs, see that yee abound in this Grace also.</hi> Therefore it should grieue a Christian to heare a man speake of any grace which hee hath not in himselfe. Fine and daintie <note place="margin">Daintie women.</note> women we know who haue a delight in curious gardens, if they heare of any goodly Plant, or delicate Flower in another bodies garden, they neuer rest till they haue got a slip of it into their owne: yea, here they beg a root and there a slip, and so set it into the ground. Euen so must a Christian doe, because his soule is the garden of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, therefore whatsoeuer grace of God hee heares of to be amongst others, by and by hee must labour to get it home vnto himselfe, therefore it is great corruption
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18128:269"/>
for men to get some one grace of God, and neglect the rest, to get a little knowledge, zeale, deuotion, &amp;c. and yet neuer labour for a good conscience, sobrietie, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, faith, loue, &amp;c. letting these things passe vnrespe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and vnregarded: A Christian must bee like a little childe, who euery yeare growes somewhat, and addes to <note place="margin">A Childe.</note> his stature and growth in all proportion of parts not growing in one member, and declining in another, so must Christians doe; indeuour to thriue in all graces.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <note place="margin">2 In the measure of Graces.</note>Secondly, <hi>Wee must grow vp in the measure of Graces,</hi> as the Apostle exhorts, 1. <hi>Thess. 4. 1. 10. Furthermore then wee beseech you Brethren and exhort you by the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, that as yee haue receiued of vs how yee ought to walke and to please God, so yee would abound more and more.</hi> So 2. <hi>Pet. 3. 18. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ.</hi> Therefore if wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, let vs beleeue more; if loue, indeuour we for more; if patient, let Patience haue its perfect worke (as S. <hi>Iames</hi> speakes) that we may be entire and want nothing. Wee reade <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 31. The graces of God are compared to a little seed, not to a little stone, because though a seed be <note place="margin">Seed.</note> little, yet it is of such a thriuing nature that it will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be little, but grow and increase to his limited sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and greatnesse: So the thing is cleere, a Christian must increase as well in the Measure as number of Graces, bee like the thriuing seed, not like to a little stone that growes no bigger; which shewes their fearefull estate, who grow not in the measure of their graces.</p>

Church prayes, <hi>Cant. 4. 16.

Dauid</hi> prayes, <hi>Giue mee vnderstanding and I shall keepe thy law, yea I shall obserue it with my whole heart.</hi> Therfore as <hi>Mary</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought a Boxe of oyntment to Christ, so that all the house was filled with the smell thereof: euen so must we <note place="margin">Ointment.</note> not onely bring our Boxes of ointments, of graces vnto Christ, but effuse and poure them out, that God may smell the sauour, and others may receiue good by them. If a man had a thousand Tunne of wine in a Cellar, <note place="margin">Wine.</note> which he had no vse of, but were kept closely there, what were any man the better for it? but if hee would make a large Cisterne, and turne out a Conduite cocke into the streete, that euery one who passeth by might drinke ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then would they commend his bountie, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto him: So when wee haue good graces of God which wee keepe to our selues, not being profitable vnto any, it is matter of rebuke and reproch, vntill wee let the cocke runne to water and refresh others.</p>

you concerning this Treatise: onely to intreate you that as one hauing passed alongst a goodly pleasant long val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, <note place="margin">Valley reuiew.</note> where he hath seene on both sides great store of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull Woods, Townes, Castles, Riuers, &amp;c. when he is readie to leaue that plaine, turnes about to view the place once more, and make impression thereof in his memorie: so that you (hauing passed along and heard so many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent points in this doctrine of Repentance,) would turne about againe, once more to view them all ere wee leaue them.</p>
                     <p>First, you haue heard of the <hi>Necessitie of Repentance,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Summe of all.</note> that wee cannot be saued without it. Secondly, <hi>The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it with other Graces;</hi> Repentance being first seene in the life of a Christian. Thirdly, <hi>The Nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> in which was foure things; First, that it is a changing and turning: Secondly, a turning in all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery faculty of the soule: Thirdly, a turning from all sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Fourthly, a turning from all sinne vnto God. Fourthly, <hi>The Causes of Repentance,</hi> were three: 1. God the Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cause: 2. The preaching of the Law and Gospell, the Instrumentall Cause. 3. The helping Causes: the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, his Iudgements and our owne considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Fiftly, <hi>The Time of Repentance</hi> was twofold: Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and Particular, in the Generall two Rules. 1. That we must repent in this life. 2. That we must repent as soon as we can. 2. In the speciall time of Repentance, were fiue Particulars: 1. When we haue fallen into any new sinne. 2. When the iudgements of God are threatned against vs: 3. When there is an offer of spirituall meanes of grace. 4. When we are to vndertake any great worke. 2. To renew our repentance euery morning and eueuing. Sixtly, <hi>The parts of Repentance</hi> in which foure things was obserued: 1. Examination. 2. Humiliation. 3. Deprecation. 4. Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the time to come. Seuenthly, <hi>The Impediments of Repentance,</hi> were two. First, in Iudgement. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in Affection: In Iudgement foure wayes: First, either to thinke our selues not sicke of sinne:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18128:272"/>
or secondly sicke, not so sicke as indeed we be. Thirdly, if sicke, yet that we may recouer without repentance; or fourthly, if Repentance must needs be, yet that it needes not to be so full and strict as Preachers tell vs. Secondly, Impediments in our affections, were first the loue of the world. Secondly the loue of pleasures. Thirdly, the loue of our owne ease. Fourthly, the loue of our sinnes. Fiftly, the desire to keepe credit with the world. Then we came to <hi>The Cases of Repentance,</hi> fiue in number: First, the case of Relapse: Secondly, the Case of Iteration: Thirdly, the Case of Restitution: Fourthly, the Case of Teares: Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Case of Comfort in death. Ninthly, <hi>The Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to Repentance.</hi> First Impenitencie. Secondly, vnsound Repentance. Lastly, the Increase of Repentance, in two things: First, that Repentance can neuer bee but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in this life: Secondly, wherein it failes?</p>
                     <p>Thus haue I, according to that abilitie God gaue, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to cast the seed of God into your hearts, now your wisedome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> to water it, when you are at home in your houses, that as my paines hath beene to preach it vnto you, so yours may be to remember and make a right vse thereof; and so I end, beseeching God that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of these things may remaine with you till your dying day. That as euery day you sinne, so euery day you may so renew your Repentance, as <hi>Peter</hi> speakes, <hi>Act. 3. 19. That your sinnes may bee blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.</hi>
