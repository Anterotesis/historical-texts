            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>And all the race sprung of <hi>Eliza Mure,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>With witches did consult and sprits conjure,</l>
                  <l>This to effect, and all th'infernall furies</l>
                  <l>With draughts and spels, and such unlawfull curies:</l>
                  <l>At length he finding that incarnat fiend,</l>
                  <l>Believ'd his response should have stedfast end,</l>
                  <l>Which was, that he should once before he die</l>
                  <l>Be crowned King with great solemnitie:</l>
                  <l>Which came to passe indeed, but not with gold,</l>
                  <l>For his familiar sprit keept that untold:</l>
                  <l>Thus these two traitours cruelly did hatch</l>
                  <l>The treason, which this good king did dispatch.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Both of these traitours at the crowne did aime,</l>
                  <l>Th'one thought his nephew might it some time claime,</l>
                  <l>And he without all question would succeed:</l>
                  <l>For well he knew to cut the fatall threed:</l>
                  <l>Likewise that other Hell-taught traitour <hi>Walter</hi>

Thus both of them fed with ambitious hopes,</l>
                  <l>Keep'd secret by themselves their partiall scops,</l>
                  <l>But mutually this one thing they intend,</l>

                  <l>But this Earle <hi>Walter</hi> subtile more than th' other</l>
                  <l>His quaint designe gan cunningly to smother,</l>
                  <l>Observing well the <hi>Grahames</hi> proud haughtie braine,</l>

                  <l>Just by this time we see the bridge of <hi>Tay</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>O happie sight indeed, was it that day;</l>
                  <l>A bridge so stately, with elleven great arches,</l>
                  <l>Joining the south and north, and commoun march is</l>
                  <l>Unto them both, a bridge of squared stone,</l>
                  <l>So great and fair; which when I think upon,</l>
                  <l>How in these dayes it did so proudly stand,</l>
                  <l>Ov'rlooking both the river and the land;</l>
                  <l>So fair, so high, a bridge for many ages</l>
                  <l>Most famous; But alace, now through the rages</l>
                  <l>Of furious swelling waters, thrown in deep,</l>
                  <l>Mine heart for sorrow sobs, mine eyes do weep.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:535:26"/>
And if my tongue should cease to cry and speak,</l>
                  <l>Undoubtedlie my grief-swoln heart would break.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But courage, <hi>Monsier,</hi> my good <hi>Genius</hi> sayes,</l>
                  <l>Remember yee not how <hi>Gall</hi> in those dayes</l>
                  <l>Did you comfort, lest melancholious fits</l>
                  <l>Had you opprest, your spleen so neerelie sits,</l>
                  <l>And told you in the yeer threescore thirteene</l>
                  <l>The first down-fall this Bridge did ere sustaine,</l>
                  <l>By ruine of three arches nixt the town,</l>
                  <l>Yet were rebuilt. Thereafter were thrown down</l>
                  <l>Five arches in the yeer fourescore and two,</l>
                  <l>Reedified likewise, and who doth know</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Monsier,</hi> but ah, mine heart can scarcelie sober!</l>
                  <l>Even that great fall the fourteenth of October,</l>
                  <l>Six hundred twentie one, repaird may bee,</l>
                  <l>And I do wish the same that I might see:</l>
                  <l>For <hi>Britaines</hi> Monarch vvill it sure repair,</l>
                  <l>Courage therefore, <hi>Monsier,</hi> do not despare;</l>
                  <l>Is't credible to bee believ'd or told,</l>
                  <l>That these our Kings, who did possesse of old</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Scotland</hi> alone, should such a work erect</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Britaines</hi> mightie Monarch it neglect?</l>
                  <l>Absurd it is to think, much more to speak it;</l>
                  <l>Therefore good <hi>Monsier</hi> yee do far mistake it;</l>
                  <l>For never had yee King vvas more inclinde</l>
                  <l>To do great vvorks; nor of a braver minde,</l>
                  <l>Providing he can have due information,</l>
                  <l>His vvord vvill prove of powerfull operation:</l>
                  <l>For Kings are Gods on Earth, and all their actions</l>
                  <l>Do represent th'Almighties great perfections.</l>

Thus <hi>Gals</hi> sweet words often do me comfort,</l>
                  <l>And my good <hi>Genius</hi> truely doth report</l>
                  <l>Them unto me, else sure my splene should wholly</l>
                  <l>Be overcome with fits of melancholie;</l>
                  <l>Therefore I courage take, and hope to see</l>
                  <l>A bridge yet built, although I aged be,</l>
                  <l>More stately, firme, more sumptuous, and more fair,</l>
                  <l>Then any former age could yet compare:</l>
                  <l>Thus <hi>Gall</hi> assured me it would be so,</l>
                  <l>And my good <hi>Genius</hi> truely doth it know:</l>
                  <l>For what we do presage is not in grosse,</l>
