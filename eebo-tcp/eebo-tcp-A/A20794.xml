            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thus then I may say that the Popes woman <note place="margin">The Iewes church and Popes church foule alike.</note> or Church, is as foule as the Church of Mahomet, and as foule as the Church of the Iewes: and who soeuer will proue this to be true, shall compare her traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and the Iewes traditions by the vew of a booke written by <hi>Petrus Galatinus,</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Iewes.

Againe, that woman that hath a foule head, is a foule woman: The woman or <note place="margin">The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d reason.</note> Church of Rome hath <hi>Antichrist</hi> to her head: therefore she is a foule woman.

               <p>Againe, if <hi>Peter</hi> were a fayre head, then this woman hath had many a long <note place="margin">The third reason.</note> day a foule head, and so hath bene a foule woman.

Peter woulde not haue captaine <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> to croutch to hym: this will haue Kinges &amp; Keysers prostrated at his féete. Peter could brooke to be blamed of Paul: this will not be blamed, though he draw thousandes to hell. Peter had neither golde nor siluer: this hath shod his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines ritch Palfries with siluer. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had <hi>caetera,</hi> that is, giftes and graces: this hath neither gift nor grace, but onely to say: <hi>I am ritch and welthie, and I sit like a Queene.</hi> Peter wept bitterly by way of repentance at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cockes crow: this neuer repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth, the greater part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome crying &amp; crowing agaynst him. Peter was somewhat ambitious for the Primateship, because he had left all and followed Christ: this leaueth nothing, nor followeth Christ, and yet his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:16606:33"/>
is infinite. Peter would not haue him selfe washed of Christ: this man will not haue him selfe iustified of Christ, but by his own merites. Peter would haue his head washed beyond Christes commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: this man enlargeth Christes commaundementes euen at his lust. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did sinne with loue towardes his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, forbidding him to goe vp to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: the Pope will haue his to suffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and to liue most pleasauntly in all thinges. Peter denied Christ thrise: the Popes life is nought but a denying of Christ. Peter when his Master was in ieoperdie, sayd: <hi>beholde two swordes:</hi> the Pope when there is no ieoperdie to Christ, but vpon his own lust, vnshetheth many thousands of swordes. Peter went with an vneuen foote to the Gospell: the Pope with a most croked f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Peter would not blame those that tooke his part in Iudaisme: the Pope will strike league with the stewes, if they will be Popish inough and Romishe Catholike. Thus if Peter be a little foule, the Pope is ten times more foule. Where Peter is fairest, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Pope is foulest.
<pb facs="tcp:16606:33"/>
If Peter be fayre, the Pope is foule. The Pope is the head of this woman: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this woman hath a foule head: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she is a filthy Church and a foule woman.</p>
               <p>Againe, if the Deuill be foule, then <note place="margin">The same reason o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes proued.</note> the Bishop of Rome is a foule head: and so this woman is a foule woman. The probation of this, is to proue a likelihode and great agréement betwixt the Deuill and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Bishop of Rome. Now me thinkes <note place="margin">The deuill and hys pope sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable.</note> that in déede there is a great agréement. For the <hi>Deuill</hi> is called <hi>Sathan,</hi> that is, an hinderer: the Pope is Christes greatest hinderer and chiefest hurter.

<pb facs="tcp:16606:34"/>
did not <hi>stand in the truth:</hi> no more did the Pope according to that saying: <hi>This day is poyson entred into the Church.</hi> The Deuill is a <hi>roaring Lion:</hi> So the Pope, so his <hi>Spanish Inquisitors.</hi> The Deuill is that Serpent which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuteth the woman in the earth: the Church in this earth hath no such perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Serpent, as that Serpentine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuter of Rome. Paule when he inuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth agaynst <hi>Elimas</hi> and calleth him the Deuils sonne, in the Actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, he séemeth to expound this worde, the Deuils sonne, in thys definition: <hi>Plenus omni dolo. &amp;c. A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> full of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of disceite, an enemie of all iustice, and one that ceasseth not to make ill the right wayes of God.</hi> This definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on toucheth the Pope of Rome most néer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in euery point. If this be the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Deuils sonne, he is vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Deuils owne deare sonne. The Deuill promised Christ all the wealth of the world: the Pope promiseth Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes, Abbeyes, Prebendes, &amp;c. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill is called <hi>a Whale,</hi> because he ruleth in the tumultuous waues of the sea: the Pope is a Whale, because he beareth a

swinge in the vaine waues of thys busie worlde. The Deuill is called <hi>a Dragon,</hi> because he deuoureth soules: the Pope is a Dragon, because he deuoureth both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes and soules. The Dragon drew the third part of the Starres out of heauen: the Pope withdrewe by liuinges and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges, the third part of the best learned men in Christendome from the true doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. It is sayd that the Deuill shoulde be let loose in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> latter dayes. <hi>Bibliander</hi> sayth, that Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> was the Deuils selfe set at libertie. So that now I say againe, the Pope is a foule head, because the Deuill is a foule head: And this woman or Church of Rome is as foule as the Deuill, because her head the Pope is as foule as the Deuill.</p>

behoue me to go downe by a long descent, and to tell a long story what warriers and fire brandes of warre these Popes of Rome haue bene.

them to vnderstand that all this fayre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is not fayrenesse from within the church, but an outward fayrenesse, and a paynted fayrenesse. And all those reasons which <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in the booke of kings doth bring, that a woman ought not to paint her face, may be alleged agaynst them, that they ought not to paint theyr church.

                  <hi>had moued me thereto.</hi> So that all the authoritie that they can gayne for the church out of this place, is but this: The church was an introduction to Sainct <hi>Augustine</hi> to beleue the Gospell: therfore it is of more authoritie then the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. So they may say that the starre did shew the wise men the way vnto Christ: therefore the starre hath more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie then Christ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>o <hi>Iohn</hi> bare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the light, and therefore was of more authoritie then the light it selfe. So in the first of <hi>Peter</hi> and the third chapter it is sayd: That men should be wonne to the word without the word, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation of women: so that the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of women should be of more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie then the word. But it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered that this argument is not good: The authoritie of the church to Sainct <hi>Augustine</hi> being a puny and a nouice in matters of religion, was greater then the authoritie of Christ: therfore the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the church is simply greater then the authoritie of Christ. No more then this argument: <hi>Iohn</hi> was in better cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with the Iewes then Christ, when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>are witnesse of Christ: therefore <hi>Iohn</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16606:39"/>
his witnessing ought to be the better. Or this argument: womens conuersation moueth some men more then the word: therfore it doth moue or ought to moue simply more then the word. But euen as <hi>Iohn</hi> that bare witnesse of Christ, did confesse that he was not worthy to loose Christes shoe latchet, no more the church though it beare witnesse of Christ in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of credit and authoritie, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to loose Christes shoe latchet. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as when Christ put forth him selfe and began to be knowen to the people, <hi>Iohn</hi> said: <hi>it behoueth me to waxe lesse, and him to waxe greater:</hi> so when the church hath geuen a man to vnderstand of Christ, and that Christ beginneth to appeare vnto vs, the church decreaseth in authoritie and estimation like <hi>Iohn,</hi> and Christ increaseth and waxeth greater in authoritie and credit. Euen so do the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritanes in the fourth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that were brought to Christ by the woman of Samaria say thus: <hi>we do not now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue for thy talke: for we our selues haue heard and do know.</hi> And yet S. <hi>Augustines</hi> case and ours is not like. For he was moued by the authoritie of that
<pb facs="tcp:16606:39"/>
church which perswaded him to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: the authoritie of the church of Rome doth bend it selfe, and is directed to moue vs onely to the church of Rome. Besides that, that church did compell no man as he writeth to <hi>Fundamentus</hi> in the 4. epistle: the church of Rome doth compell vs to beleue theyr church, or compell the soule to forsake the body. Agayne, they reason that the Church shall be a citie <note place="margin">The Church an hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The very true exposition of thys place is this, as it may appeare by all good expositors, that the Apostles are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the citie vpon a mountayne, &amp; the salt of the earth. So that the true meaning is this: a good Apostle is salt, and therfore let him season: a good Apostle is a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, citie, or a high citie, and therfore let him shew and shine so in workes, that he may glorify God his heauenly father. And in déede this text is expounded natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thus, and without violence. For it is very straunge to a diuine to thinke that Gods church should be a mountayne, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or a mounting citie, a high thing, or
<pb facs="tcp:16606:40"/>
a renounded thing, or a thing glorius in the world. For the church of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented <note place="margin">Gods church not mounting but misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> in the burning bush of <hi>Moses,</hi> it is neuer without fiery persecution: it is like the white horse in the Apocalips, that is alwayes chased with a red horse: it is like the Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> that is tossed in the sea, and this is tossed in the world: it is compared to the Moone that waxeth and wanteth by the presence or absence of the Sunne: It is like <hi>Iacob</hi> that slea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth <note place="margin">How gods church is mounting &amp; famous.</note> on a stone: It hath <hi>semen sanctum subsistentiam eius: holy seede and holy men the substance,</hi> and not commonly great personages and solemne persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the substaunce. I know the church of God is oftentimes famous: but that is thus: <hi>ascendamus in montem Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni. &amp;c. Let vs go vp vnto the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of the Lord, and he will teach vs of hys wayes.</hi> The teaching of Gods wayes maketh Gods church a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous mountayne. If Gods wayes be not truely taught, though she sit vpon seuen hilles, as the church of Rome vpon seuen hilles, shée is not a famous moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, but an ignominious valley. Then they reason thus: Christ prayed
<pb facs="tcp:16606:40"/>
for Peter that his fayth shoulde not faile: therefore Peter nor the Pope can erre. Christ prayed likewise for all those that <note place="margin">Christ prayed. &amp;c.</note> shall beleue hereafter: then they may thus conclude, that all those which haue, do, or shall beleue, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer erre.

               <p>But besides all this, they haue a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous interrogation, by which alone they thinke to master all the worlde, to make vs all starke dumme, and for euer to locke vp all our lippes, and that is: <hi>In such and such yeares where was your Church?</hi>

But in déede they, and such like brimme persecutors, haue of so long time kept vnder the Church, that we are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to beliefe onely, for they haue left scarse any sense, or memory of the true members of Christes Church. But they cry still a loude: <hi>Where was the Church?</hi> I tell them that it is sayd of God: <hi>Tu es vere Deus absconditus: Thou art verily a hidden God.</hi> So the Church is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hidden. The husband of an hidden condition, and the spouse of an hidden condition. <hi>Where was the Church?</hi> Christ stoode in the middest of them and they knew him not.

But where soeuer els it was, the Church of Rome this many yeares <note place="margin">The Church of Rome not the church.</note> was not the Church. The best argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they haue for the Church of Rome, is because it was once a holy place, and the sound of the Gospell went thence, and therfore still Rome must be the broode mother of religion, and that there néedes must be the Church. And peraduenture they will make it of the nature of Rome, that Rome hath the best religion: then
<pb facs="tcp:16606:42"/>
we may thus say: Mount Flascon hath the best wine, the Athenians the best ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, Persia the best oyle, Babylon the best corne, India the best golde, Tirus the best Purple, Basan the best Okes, Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus the best Ceders, Persia y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> best iewels, Arrabia the best spices, Tharsis the best shippes, England the best shéepe, Saxonie the best oxen, Cicilia and Dalmacia the best horses, Pirones the best fishe, Ithaca the best swine, and Rome the best religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Or thus: the Italians be most wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Spanyardes best water skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the Frenchmen best kéepers of holdes, the Scot with his Launce, the Irishe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on foote, the Germane in voice, the Mirmadons in strength, the olde Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes best suffering of hunger and colde, and the new Romanes are most religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Or thus: the Egyptians haue no Beaues, Affricke hath no Bores, the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Helaeus hath no Mules, the Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians haue no Iron, Athens hath no Owles, England no Wolues, Wight no Foxes, Ireland no venemous beast, nor Rome no bad religion. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I do sée in the Scriptures, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem was turned into <hi>Ierustikaker:</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16606:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that is, the valley of vision was turned into the valley of confusion: and the fine valley of <hi>Siddim</hi> into the valley of salt: that <hi>Lucifer</hi> did sinne in heauen, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in Paradise, and <hi>Lot</hi> in the holy Mount: that the mountaine <hi>Garezin</hi> where the fathers prayed, became a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane dwelling of the Samaritans: when I read that Mount <hi>Sion</hi> became a place for Foxes, and <hi>Bethel</hi> the house of God became to be <hi>Bethanem,</hi> the house of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, then me thinke I thinke of Rome, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> did of Ierusalem: <hi>Facta est meritrix ciuitas fidelis: That Citie which was once faithful is become an harlot.</hi> These places were altered for wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and Rome is altered for wicked life and wicked religion. And now me thinke of these Romanes I may thus say: The Moores are a vaine people, the Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians fearefull, the Israelites of an hard necke and loden with sinne, the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans vaineglorious, the Grecians light, the Galathians dullardes, the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians falsifiers of their fayth, the Cretes liers, the Sodomits full of bread, the Iewes vsurers, the Persians wasters, the Spanyardes lechers, the Flemminges

drinckers, the Englishe glottons, the Germanes vnciuile, the Lacedemonians théeues, the Canibals cruell, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes Idolaters. So may I say, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so do I say: for vndoubtedly y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Church of Rome is not Christes true Church.

Doues, and all that is sauage lay downe his nature. But still we sée that Bull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Bores be still brockish, Buckes rancke, Egles violent, Kites gréedie, Gripes rauenous, Cormorantes griple, the most of men like Horse and Mule. This beast linesse in men is not consumed by preaching and teaching, and therefore Christ is not fed, the world is this way fatte still, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ is leane still. The fatter the one, the leaner the other. I speake now to the worlde and beastly worldlinges, Bulles, Buckes, &amp; Bores, Egles, Gripes, Kites, and all ye haggarde birdes of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin, turne not. O turn not, as in <hi>Ouids Metamorphosis,</hi> out of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into beastes, but returne ye out of beastes into men: suffer ye Christ, and Christes godly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, to féede vpon your flesh, and eate vp your vile vices: conforme your selues to the forme of the doctrine of the Gospell of Christ Iesus: suffer your bodies to be chastened and to be brought vnder into seruitude. I will tell you that which is true to be tolde. Gods heauen is a coluer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, it is not a roome for Egles, for

Gripes, for Cormorantes. &amp;c: it is a caule for Shéepe, and not a staule for Bulles, not a pale for Buckes, not a stye for Bores: <hi>talium enim non est regnum coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum: <hi>for such truely the roume of heauen serueth not.</hi>

               <p>Againe, Christ is fedde with iustice and righteousnesse, with good life and true religion. So God is called an husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that planted a Uine, and thought to haue dronke of the wine, but the Uine brought forth sower Grapes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deceaue him selfe: leude fayth, and lose life is ill grapes and sower grapes. Let vs then bring forth good grapes, &amp; grapes of repentaunce, grapes to féede God, and grapes to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent God, or els short wordes will come vpon vs: a hatchet and a fire, a hatchet and a fire. <hi>Euery tree that brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not forth good fruite, shall be cut vp and cast into the fire.</hi> Our beloued Christ is dry for good life, geue him not sower grapes. He is dry, clappe him not on the lippes with eisill and Gaule. He is hungry for iustice, as <hi>Amos</hi> sayth: <hi>turne not iustice into Wormewood.</hi> Sower grapes are not delicate to man, nor Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry to God. Eisill is bitter drinke to
<pb facs="tcp:16606:53"/>
man, and euill life is to God. Wormwood is bitter to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and so is iniustice to God. And yet Christ is fed an other third way, or rather was fedde, or rather is and was fedde, as when he was at feastes, &amp; when he was with his disciples: so when he cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the figge trée: but that hunger of hys is now foredone, and as he sayth by his Prophet: <hi>Si esuriro non dicam tibi: If I shoulde happe to be hungry</hi> (people) <hi>I</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 50.</note> 
                  <hi>woulde not tell thee.</hi> Then how is he now hungry, and how is he now to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued? He is hungry in his néedie Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, in selie destitute Orphanes, and in impotent poore creatures. He that recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth those, receaueth Christ. He that sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth their hunger, slaketh Christes hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He that quencheth their thirst, quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the thirst of Christ the beloued.</p>
               <p>Touching Gods Ministers in these dayes, benefactors in olde time haue had towardes them a most liberall deuotion: and hereupon it commeth to passe, that though very much hath ben withdrawen, yet somewhat remayneth: yet I do not say that Christ in this kinde of people is now specially hungry. Howbeit I am not ignoraunt that many a poore Minister of
<pb facs="tcp:16606:53"/>
these times, is like <hi>Elizas.</hi> He had not pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor incke, nor table, nor candlesticke, but as his hostes allowed him: and these poore Gods men must be helped by their hoste or hostes, or one fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or other with coate, and cappe, and cuppe, and candle, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and table, or els they shall be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther harbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>lesse &amp; helpelesse. And néedes must I further yet say, that in many a poore scholer of the Uniuersities, Christ him selfe is full of hunger and necessitie. These be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble sonnes of the Prophets, and most apt of all others to be builders of Gods temple: yet haue I séene many a good witte, many a long day, kept low and leane, to be made broken with hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, and abiecte with pouertie. I do not now know the liberalitie of this Citie towardes both those places: onely this can I say, that lesse then the tenth part of that which is nothing but surfitte and sicknesse to the great excessiue eaters of this towne, wold cherishe and chéere vp hungry and thirstie Christ, in those his hungerstarued mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers right well.</p>
               <p>Touching the hunger of Orphanes, and such as be fatherlesse, I do not thinke but that it is very great, and I haue no
<pb facs="tcp:16606:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great hope that it will be much lesse. The fathers them selues in this worlde haue much adoe to shift for them selues: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must néedes be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> condition of these poore selie ones to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, to thirst, to pine, <note place="margin">The boyes of Christes Hospitall.</note> and to starue. Yet the example of thys good gentleman Alderman <hi>Dabbes</hi> &amp; his euer laudable goodnes to <hi>this litle poore people,</hi> was likely to haue stirred vp ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny after this time to haue done the like. But I trowe, for all that we can preach and exhort, it will be true, that when the sonne of man commeth there will be but little fayth and little good workes too. This man in these Orphanes hath clad Christ, and fed Christ. She that shed oyle vpon Christes head, shall haue a good name where soeuer the Gospell goeth, and the sheding of this reliefe vpon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes members is a thing of fame, and very worthy of standing memory.</p>
               <p>Concerning impotent persons, and poore in generall, though many Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals haue bene for them erected, and her Maiestie, and her Maiesties Counsell, haue had by one Acte of Parliament to their reliefe a goodly respecte, yet Christ this way and in this people, is more hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry

               <p>Of gathering of Lilies, many thinges may be spoken many wayes. And what Lilies do signifie in this place, I am to say as before: that when the beloued goeth down into his spicery to be fed in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardes and to gather Lilies, is no more but that he goeth to be refreshed in the earth. Howbeit the fathers haue made a further processe in this matter, and some yelde one sense, and some an other. But for my selfe I would not for any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse opinions vpon opinions, &amp; notes vppon opinions, and exhortations vppon notes, for that woulde be now long and werisome: onely I will say something of one exposition which <hi>Rabbi Iarhi</hi> and <hi>S. Barnard</hi> do séeme to embrace: that is, to gather vp Lilies, is to gather vp men: and yet euen in this one exposition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth to be handled that Christ is a gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and men be flowers. If Christ be a
<pb facs="tcp:16606:56"/>
gatherer, then is he no disperser. In déede it is méete that the shepeheard should ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his shéepe, and the hen her chickins, and the husbandman the graine into the barne. Euen so the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> sayth: <hi>That Christ should gather hys sheepe out of all landes, and gather</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>them into their owne land.</hi> So doth he him selfe say with an affection of most déepe loue: <hi>O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, how often would I haue gathered thee together, as the henne gathereth her chickins vnder her wing, and thou wouldest not.</hi> And as Lilies grow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed here one, and there one: so good men grow rare &amp; thinne. And as Christ picketh Lilies from among thornes (for they growe among thornes): so picked he <hi>Abraham</hi> from the thornes of Chaldée, <hi>Iob</hi> from the Hussites, <hi>Hiram</hi> from the Tirians, <hi>Naaman</hi> from the Syrians, the Niniuites from the Assirians. Lilies growe rare, and good men grow rarer: Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies amongest thornes, and good men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest thornes. And as the gathering <note place="margin">A man A Lily.</note> of Lilies and men be like: so men and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies be very like.

the pride and glory of a man is but the pride and glory of a Lilie. <hi>Salomon</hi> is a Lilie, King <hi>Salomon</hi> is a Lilie, King <hi>Salomon</hi> in hys glory is a Lilie, King <hi>Salomon</hi> in all his glory is a Lilie.

For the Lily of this our flesh is not so goodly gay, as the Lily of grasse: otherwise and in many imperfections we are very perfect, and true Lilies. The Lily of grasse shooteth vp for a time, but then he layeth downe his toppe, and is made euen to the floore.

            <p>Now, let me say a while, what it is <note place="margin">The second part what it is to be naked.</note> to be naked. It is, as I sayd, to be without weapon, to be without wéede. So was <hi>Adam</hi> in his first state, so was <hi>Adam</hi> in his best state. And here the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes</hi> (a people full of frensie and furor) would be glad to helpe them selues in their fancie, that no man ought to weare weapon, because that <hi>Adam</hi> in state of iunocencie wore not weapon. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <note place="margin">The Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistes reasoning agaynst warre.</note> that that they haue this argument, lest they should seme to be empty handed, they alledge further reasons of this proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as thus out of <hi>Esay: Mine is the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, &amp; I will require them.</hi> Agayne, out of the sayd <hi>Esay:</hi> that Christes king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is like y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> waters of <hi>Shiloah,</hi> which wa ters do run quietly and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out hurly burly.

Againe, out of <hi>Michah: that speres shall be turned into shares and swordes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mattockes.</hi> Agayne, out of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ: <hi>If any man geue thee a blow on the right side, turne thou the left side.</hi> Agayne: <hi>He that smyteth with the sworde must perish with the sword.</hi> Agayne: <hi>Let not the cockle be pulled out till the haruest time.</hi> Agayne, out of <hi>S. Paul: our weapons are spiritual wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</hi> But ye shall haue answer to these argumentes out of <hi>Augustine</hi> to <hi>Marsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> in the fifth epistle, and to <hi>Faustus Manichaeus</hi> in the 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> booke, and in <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these wordes: <hi>do not resist the euill.</hi> For I can not now my selfe stand vpon them, and these reasoners them selues are so vnreasonable, and so voyde of all credit, that to name them and their arguments, is to discredit them and their argumentes. And in déede it is easy to proue the contrary doctrine to theyrs. For Ecclesiastes sayth: <hi>Tempus belli &amp; tempus pacis: A time of warre and</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:16606:67"/>
fingers, yet <hi>Dauids</hi> fingers were holy fingers. In the booke of Kinges, <hi>Dauid</hi> sayth to <hi>Saul: thou fightest the Lordes battayles.</hi> And <hi>Abigail</hi> sayth to <hi>Dauid: thou fightest the Lordes battayles.</hi> If some warres be Gods warres, then all warres are not forbidden. The <hi>Baptist</hi> doth seeme to allow of souldiers, for he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them rules of life, as that they should smite no man, and that they should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with theyr owne wages. <hi>Paul</hi> would haue him selfe led to Cesaria by strength of souldiers. Our Sauiour doth say: <hi>Geue vnto Caeser that which is Caesers.</hi> That which was geuen to <hi>Caeser</hi> was tribute geuen to finde souldiers, as <hi>Augustine</hi> doth often say. Now, reasons why there should be weapons, there be many. But this is the speciall reason which the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, where euery man weareth a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, alledge for theyr so doing: that the magistrate and countrey may be assisted and defended. And if it be so, that euery man do weare weapon, and ought to weare weapon for the magistrate, and ought not onely to weare it, but also to draw it at the magistrates voyce, and to do as it is said in the 3. booke and 4. chap. of

               <hi>Esdras: If the the king alone say do kil, they do kill: If he say, do forgeue, they do forgeue: If he say smite, they do smite: If he say, banish, they do banish: If he say, cut vp, they do cut vp.</hi> I say, if the people ought thus to doo for the prince and magistrate, to draw theyr weapon in his cause, and to lay downe their life at his foote: how much more ought the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate for his owne cause, and for all their causes, to beare weapon, &amp; not to beare it in vayne? but to purpose.

And as it is good policy to punishe this misliued folke: so it is good diuinitie. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> writeth to <hi>Esdras</hi> after thys sort: <hi>Omnis qui non fecerit lege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dei tui et legem regis diligenter</hi>

For all those that be in kinges houses do accompt of them selues as exempt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons from controlement of preachers, and they will séeme to be priuiledged from the xj. chapter of Sainct <hi>Mathew:</hi> where it is sayd: <hi>They that weare</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> 
               <hi>soft clothing, are in kinges houses.</hi> But, me thinkes our Sauiour Christ hym selfe shoulde not haue séemed to speake these wordes to serue theyr turne that be in kinges houses. For me thinkes he should reason thus: <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16606:74"/>
eateth wilde hony, and is clad in hard ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and not such soft raiment as these tender courtlinges do weare: therefore it is likely that <hi>Iohn</hi> is no réede, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant man in religion. An other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be drawen fitly by this. Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers in kinges houses doo weare soft and delicate apparell, and fare not so hard, nor weare not so heard as <hi>Iohn</hi> doth: therfore these milkesoppes are likely inough to proue réedes, (if they come vnder duresse) and not hard rockes in religion. If I reason with Christ, I may properly thus reason: and if I should reason without Christ, me thinke you Christians should haue no further delight to here me rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. But let me take some further paine with this proposition. Those that be in kinges houses doo weare soft apparell: <hi>ergo</hi> they may weare soft apparell. If those that be in kinges houses be logiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they will neuer let this goe for an argument. For what an argument is this? It is worne in a kinges house: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be worne. Or thus: It is <note place="margin">Practises in kinges houses are not presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes.</note> done in a kinges house: therefore it may be done. Many thinges haue bene done in kinges houses, that might not be done,
<pb facs="tcp:16606:74"/>
and then this argument is naught.</p>
            <p>In king <hi>Abimelechs</hi> house, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> so godly and worshipfull a father, coulde scarsely be admitted to the kinges presence, to deliuer vp his wordes to the king selfe, because peraduenture he had not courtly port inough about him.

ye vp your selues, and God him selfe shall become your paramour. Concerning both mens, &amp; womens apparell, this may be sayd. Sainct <hi>Paul</hi> sayth: <hi>God made meates, and God made the belly, and that God will destroy both the meats, and the belly.</hi> So say I: God made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and God made the backe, and he will destroy both the one and the other. Yea, those heades that are now to be sene for their tall and bushy plumes, and that other sex that haue fire fresh golden caules so shéene and glosing, geue me but an hundred yeares, nay, halfe an hundred yeares, and the earth will couer all these heads before me, and mine owne to. And thus much of apparell.</p>
            <p>And now of the effectes of being naked: which is to blushe, or not to blushe. The cleare and crimelesse conscience doth not blushe. A criminous conscience doth or should blushe. So <hi>Adam</hi> afterward blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and the Publican durst not lift vp his eyes. And <hi>Paule</hi> writeth of the sinnes of the Romanes: <hi>In quibus nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c erubescitis.</hi> For which sinnes ye Romanes do now blush. <hi>Iesus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Sirach</hi> saith, that we should blushe of whoredome before fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and mother, to make a lye before a Prince, to sinne before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, to offend before the congregation, to do vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously before a companion or frend, to be reproued for geuing or taking, to lye with a mans elboes vpon the bread, not to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute one that hath saluted, to looke vppon harlots, to turne away thy face from thy kinsmen, to loke vpon other mens wiues, to trifle with maidens, to take and not to geue, to vpbraide thy frend with that thou hast geuen, to brute fames abroad, or to disclose secretes. These thinges (sayth he) are shamefull thinges, and matter of blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing. More then these thinges he doth not rehearse. But the catholicke and common corruption of this world doth yeld forth farre many moe blushing matters, and mutch greater blushing matters. O, if I should go about, to bid all states &amp; sortes of people to blushe: and if I should do it, as it should be done, &amp; in so many pointes as I should bid them, I should finde it a too too colde occupation, and a déede of least thankes: but of that I least recken. But I say very truely, that if my fleshe were flesh of stones, if I had that ruffling toung which <hi>Esay</hi> had, or that noble eloquence
<pb facs="tcp:16606:77"/>
which <hi>Nazianzene</hi> had, or that heroicall spirite which <hi>Martin Luther</hi> had, If my toung were many tounges, &amp; my mouth an hundreth mouthes, if my voyce were of good strong iron, and my sides of steddie brasse, yet it were in vaine for me to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to make a great number of enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious malefactors to blushe, so gracelesse are their foreheades, and so vntaught to blushe. Howbeit to those that be of a more honest nature, and prone to repentaunce, I will make most fayre besechinges, and pray them most hartily, to rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And I will tell ye one generall way, the which if ye take, ye shall not blushe, neither in this life, neither in that day when shame and confusion shall come vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: if ye take it not, blushing and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of saces shall be yours for euer, and that is out of the Prophet <hi>Dauid: Tunc non erubesca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cum respexero ad omnia man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>data tua: Then shall I not blushe</hi> (sayth he) <hi>when I haue a regard to all thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Agayne, as we ought to runne to all Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, &amp; embrace all the truth: so we ought to do it with all our body, with all our soule, and with our toung,
<pb facs="tcp:16606:78"/>
that we ought to beleue the truth, and to speake the truth. There be many Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers at these dayes that will be content to take that name, and as they say beleue so: but they will not make their talke of Christ, or of diuinitie, for that is no gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemanly talke, no fellowlike talke, no courtlike talke. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth is, the truth must be beleued, &amp; the truth must be tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. If they be ashamed to talke of Christ before men, Christ will be ashamed to talke of them before his heauenly father. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his booke of prescription a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst heretickes, saith thus: <hi>It is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for him to leaue speaking of the truth that doth remember the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day, where an open reason must be geuen of the truth.</hi> The Euaungelist doth say? <hi>Ye shall shew forth his death whilest he come.</hi> Euen to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Christ our talke ought to be of Christ, and of Christes death. <hi>Basil</hi> in a certaine Epistle doth say: <hi>They be traytors to the truth whosoeuer do not aunswere readily &amp; truely of religion, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in diuinitie.

with him selfe, so that he haue not one thing vpon his toung, and an other in his hart.</hi> The truth is truly to be bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and truely to be spoken. <hi>Vigilius</hi> in the end of his second booke, sayth thus: <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil cordi prodest credere. &amp;c: It is to no purpose for a man to beleue with his hart to iustice, except confession be made with his mouth to saluation.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Dauid</hi> sayth: <hi>I haue not hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy iustice in my hart, thy truth and thy sauing health haue I spoken.</hi>

inough content that Gods worde should runne, yet them selues are in Gods cause so faint and couragelesse, that they will not open their lippes to speake for Christ. And because we haue halted with God, and delt losely with God, therefore God hath duely delt thus with vs. To vs God might cry: <hi>Expectans expectaui,</hi> or <hi>Tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans tolleraui: <hi>I haue long looked for your ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, and I haue long borne with your euill doing.</hi>
