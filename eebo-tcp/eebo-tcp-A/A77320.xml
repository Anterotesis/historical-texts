            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He care of preſerving this City from ruine (being the moſt conſiderable in this part of the Kingdom) invited to entertain a Treaty, wherein at the leaſt ten dayes were ſpent in ſeveral Tranſactions, the Enemy ſtill uſing protractions and delayes in hope of their expected Relief: For which end, ſtrong preparations were made, whereof we received frequent Advertiſements from ſeveral perſons, That <hi>Aſhley</hi> and <hi>Vaughan</hi> had united their Forces, and lay hovering about <hi>Bridge-North.</hi> Their intention was to have joyned with the Welch For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under the Lord <hi>St. Paul,</hi> with thoſe Iriſh that came over in <hi>December</hi> laſt, and thoſe other now lately Landed at <hi>Blew-Morris,</hi> who were part of the Lord <hi>Digbies</hi> Regiment, ſome whereof are Engliſh, and ſome Lorrainers, as theſe Intercepted Letters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed mention. To prevent the Conjunction of which Forces, I ſent three Regiments of Horſe, the Warwickſhire, the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does Regiment, and part of the Staffordſhire Horſe, and ſome of the Cheſhire Dragoons, together with ſome of Colonel <hi>Mittons</hi> Horſe and Foot, which party was Commanded by Colonel <hi>Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who marched to <hi>Ruthin</hi> upon Saturday night, Ian. 24. intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fall upon the Enemy in their Quarters, but the Enemy eſcaped and marched to <hi>Denbigh,</hi> and ſo towards <hi>Conway:</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe our Forces came moſt ſeaſonably; for <hi>Ruthin</hi> Caſtle was ſo unprovided, as that we have now great hopes of Reducing that ſtrong Caſtle, however the Conjunction of the Enemies Forces is hereby prevented, which might probably occaſion the Enemies

Retreat, after they had Quartered three or four dayes about <hi>Bridge-North</hi> and <hi>Shiffnall,</hi> and had drawn out ſome ſmall pieces, and two Caſes of Iack. So as the Beſieged being now hopeleſſe of Relief, ſent out their Commiſſioners Ian. 30. to Treat with ours, whoſe Names are herein incloſed.</p>
            <p>The number was propoſed by them, and was the rather aſſented to by us, to the end better ſatisfaction might be given to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers, when ſome of their own Officers were intruſted and imployed in Treating and making Compoſitions for them, that they might thereby be alſo obliged to reſtrain their Souldiers from Plunder and violation of what is concluded and agreed upon.</p>
            <p>The firſt day nothing was concluded upon.</p>
            <p>This day Ian. 31. they were mighty importunate that the Treaty might be continued, and reſpited until Monday morning at nine of the clock; which being refuſed, as by my laſt Letter appears, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed not to enter into a Treaty; whereupon it was concluded to be delivered upon theſe incloſed Conditions, whereunto it was the rather aſſented, to prevent the Plunder of the City, which could not have been preſerved, if it had not been taken by Compoſition. That which further remains, is ſatisfying the Souldiers and ſetling of the City, which will prove a work of great difficulty, wherein my Endeavours ſhall not be wanting to the uttermoſt of my Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or to ſerve the Publique in any other imployment Commanded, and ſhall ever profeſſe my ſelf to be, Sir</p>
