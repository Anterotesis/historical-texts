         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

RECONCILEABLENESS
OF
God's Prescience, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe veneration I have long had
for your Name, could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me to apprehend less ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
than that of a Law, in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
to me this subject. For
within the whole compass of intellectual
employment and affairs, non but who
<pb facs="tcp:48507:3"/>
are so unhappy as not at all to know you,
would dispute your right to prescribe,
and give Law.</p>
            <p>And taking a nearer view of the
Province you have assigned me, I must
esteem it alike both disingenuous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful,
wholly to have refus'd it. For
the less you could think it possible to me
to perform in it, the more I might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv
of kindness allaying the Authority
of the imposition; And have the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
the more obvious to me that you
rather design'd in it mine own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
than that you reckon'd the cause
could receiv any, by my undertaking it.</p>
            <p>The doubt, I well know, was mention'd
by you as other Mens, and not your
own; whose clear mind, and diligent
enqiry leave you little liable to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumb'red
with greater difficulties.</p>
            <p>Wherefore that I so soon divert from
you, and no more allow these papers to
express any regard unto you, till the
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:48507:3"/>
shutting of the discourse, is only a
seeming disrespect or indecorum, put in
the stead of a real one. For after you
have given them the countenance, as to
let it be understood, you gave the first
rise and occasion to the business and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of them; I had little reason to slur
that stamp put upon them, by adding to
their (enough other) faults, that of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them guilty of so great a misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,
and impertinency, as to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
a discourse of this length, to one
that hath so little leasure or occasion to
attend to any thing can be said by them.</p>
            <p>WHat there is of difficulty
in this matter I cannot
pretend to set down in those most
apt expressions wherein it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48507:4"/>
to me, and must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
endeavour to supply a bad
memory out of a worse inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>So much appears very obvious,
That, ascribing to the ever blessed
God, among the other Attributes
which we take to belong to an
every way Perfect Being, a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
so perfect as shall admit of
no possible accession or increase;
and conseqently the Prescience
of all future events (as whereof
we doubt him not to have the
distinct knowledg when they
shall have actually come to pass.)
Since many of those events are
the sinful actions or omissions of
men, which he earnestly counsels
and warns them against; This
matter of doubt cannot but arise
hereupon, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How it can stand with the wisdom &amp;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48507:4"/>
rity which our own thoughts do by the
earliest anticipation challenge to that
ever happy Being, to use these (or any
other means) with a visible design to
prevent that, which, in the mean time
appears to that all-seeing eye, sure to
come to pass.</p>
            <p>So that, by this representation
of the Case, there seem to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
together. Either 1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> 
               <hi>Gods
wisdom</hi> with this part of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.
For we judg it not to consist
with the wisdom of a man, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and pursue an end, which he
foreknows he shall never attain:
Or 2<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> the same foreknowledg
with his <hi>sincerity</hi> and uprightness,
that he seems intent upon an end,
which indeed he intends not.</p>
            <p>The matter then comes shortly
to this summe. Either the holy
God seriously intends the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of such foreseen sinful actions
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48507:5"/>
and omissions or he doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it. If he do, His wisdom
seems liable to be impleaded, as
above. If he do not, his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness
and Truth.</p>
            <p>My purpose is not, in treating
of this affair, to move a dispute
concerning the fitnes of the words
[prescience] or [foreknowledg]
Or to trouble this discourse with
notions I understand not, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisibility,
and unsuccessivenes of
eternal duration, Whence it would
be collected there can be no such
thing as <hi>first</hi> or <hi>second</hi> fore-or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
in that duration. But
be contented to speak as I can
understand, and be understood.
That is, to call that foreknowledg
which is the knowledg of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that as yet is not, but that
shall sometime come to pass. For
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48507:5"/>
it were a meer piece of legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible: ambiguous glyph" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>in
only to amuse enqirers
whom one would pretend to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie.
Or to fly to a cloud for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
from the force of an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and avoid an occurring dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
by the present reliefless
shift of involving one-self in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Nor shall I design to my self so
large a field as a <hi>Tractate</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>divine Prescience.</hi> So as to
be obliged to discourse particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whatsoever may be thought to
belong to that Theological To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick.
But confine the discourse
to my enjoyned subject. And of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
only such considerations as may
some way tend to expedite or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate
the present difficulty.</p>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>Â§. II.</head>
               <p>II. It were one of the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
to Religion, a subversion
indeed of its very foundations.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48507:6"/>
And then by doing which, we
could not more highly gratifie
atheistical minds, instead, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of ascribing perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the nature of God, to ascribe
to it inconsistencies, or to give a
self-repugnant notion of that ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Being, The parts whereof
should justle and not accord with
one another. And yet eqal care
is to be taken, lest while we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to frame a consistent notion
of God, we reject from it any
thing that is truly a perfection, and
so give a maimed one. Whereby
we should undo our own design,
and by our over much caution to
make our conception of him agree
with it self, make it disagree to
him. For to <hi>an absolutely perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
no other can agree than that,
which not only is not made up of
contradictions, but which also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48507:6"/>
in it all real perfections
either explicitely, or which leaves
room for all, by not positively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
any of them. Which to
do, and afterward, to assign that as
the proper notion of God, were, it
self, the greatest contradiction. We
need therefore to be very warie,
lest we pronounce too hastily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
any thing, which to our
most sedate thoughts, appeares
simply a perfection in it self, that
it carries with it a repugnancie to
somewhat else, necessary to be
ascribed to him.</p>
               <p>We are first to suspect (as there
is greatest cause) and enqire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the aile be not wholly in our
own minds. Which in this and
such like cases, we certainly shall
upon due reflection, find labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the natural defect of
that incomprehensive narrownes,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48507:7"/>
that is, in some degree, unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
followed with confusion and
indistinctnes of thoughts. And
may perhaps find cause to accuse
them of the more culpable evils,
both of slothfulnes, that withholds
them from doing what they can,
and self-conceit by which they
imagine to themselves an ability
of doing what they cannot.</p>
               <p>It cannot be unobserved by
them that have made themselves
any part of their own study, that
it is very incident to our minds, to
grasp at more than they can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass;
and then, thorough their
own scantines (like the little hand
of a child) to throw away one
thing that hath pleased us, to make
room for another, because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend both together.</p>
               <p>It is not strange, that our so
straitly limited understandings,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48507:7"/>
should not be able to lodg com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously
the immense perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a Deity. So as to allow
them liberty to spread themselves
in our thoughts in their entire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions.
And because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noot,
we complain, when we feel
our selves a little pincht, that the
things will not consist; when the
matter is, that we have unduly
crouded and huddled them up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
in our incomprehensive
minds, that have not distinctly
conceived them.</p>
               <p>And tho this consideration
should not be used for the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of an usurped liberty of faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon God, arbitrarily and at
random, what we please (As in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
what so gross absurdity might
not any one give shelter to by
such a misapplication of it?) We
ought yet to think it seasonably
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48507:8"/>
apply'd, when we find our selves
urged with difficulties on one
hand and the other; and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it hard, with clearnes and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
to ascribe to God, what
we also find it not easie not to
ascribe.</p>
               <p>Nor would it be less unfit to
apply it for the patronage of that
slothfulnes wherein our discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
minds are sometimes too
prone to indulge themselves.</p>
               <p>To which purpose I remember
somewhat very apposite in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nucius
Felix,</hi> That many thorough
the meer tediousness of finding out
the truth, do rather, by a mean
succumbency, yeild to the first
specious shew of any opinion
whatsoever than be at the trouble,
by a pertinacious diligence, of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,
themselves to a thorough
search.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48507:8"/>
Tho the comprehension of our
Minds be not infinite, it might be
extended much further than usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
it is, if we would allow our
selves with patient diligence to
consider things at leasure, and so
as <hi>gradually</hi> to stretch and enlarge
our own understandings. Many
things have carried the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of contradiction and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistencie,
to the first view of our
straitened minds, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
we have, upon repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
consideration and endeavour,
found room for, and been able to
make fairly accord, and lodg to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Especially we should take heed
lest it be <hi>excluded</hi> by over-much
conceitednes, and a self-arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
pride, that disdains to be
thought not able to see thorough
every thing, by the first and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48507:9"/>
slightest glance of an haughty
eye; and peremptorily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
that to be unintelligible,
that an arrogant uninstructed
mind hath only not humility
enough to acknowledg difficult
to be understood. Whence it is
too possible some may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prone
to detract from God what
really belongs to him, lest any
thing should seem detracted from
themselves, and impute imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to him rather than confess
their own. And may be so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ascribing
to themselves, as to
reckon it a disparagement not to
be endured, to seem a little puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled
for the present; to be put to
pause, and draw breath a while,
and look into the matter again
and again; which if their humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and patience would enable
them to do; It is not likely that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48507:9"/>
the Author of our faculties would
be unassisting to them, in those
our enqiries which concern our
duty towards himself.</p>
               <p>For tho in mattes of meer spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
we may be encountred
with difficulties, whereof perhaps
no mortal can ever be able to
find out the solution (which is no
great prejudice, and may be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and instructive to us) Yet as
to what concerns the object of
our Religion, it is to be hoped we
are not left in unextricable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements;
Nor should think
we are till we have made utmost
trial. The design being not to
gratifie our curiosity, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
our selves of uncomfortable
doubtfulnes in the matter of our
worship, and (in a dutiful zeal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the blessed object thereof)
to vindicate it against the eavils
of ill-minded men.</p>

               <p>But if the unsuccessfulnes of
often repeated endeavours make
us despair of being able, with so
full satisfaction, to reconcile some
things which we have thought
were to be attributed to God; It
will be some relief to us, if we
find the things about which the
doubt lies, are not of the same
order, nor such as with eqal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and necessity are to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
of him.</p>
               <p>And when we make a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
we may find our selves at a
certainty concerning those his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
which most commonly,
and at the first view, approve
themselves to every man's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
               <p>Among which we little hesitate,
(as we are most concern'd not to
do,) about those which carry with
them the import of <hi>moral goodness;</hi>
and which render the object of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48507:10"/>
our Religion, at once, both most
venerable and lovely. For none
do more naturally obtain for
common notions concerning him;
so as even to prevent rationcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or argument, with whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the apprehension of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
hath place.</p>
               <p>Every man's mind, it being
once acknowledg'd that there is
a God, refuses to conceive other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of him, than that he is holy,
just, merciful, true, &amp;c. And rejects
with abhorrency the notion of an
impure, unrighteous, cruel, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
Deity.</p>
               <p>As for those that, by a long
train of our own more uncertain
and lubricous reasonings, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to deduce; If we find
our selves constrain'd any where
to admit a diffidence, It were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be plac't here. For it is at
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48507:11"/>
first sight evident, since God is
most certainly willing to be
known of them that are sincerely
willing to know him; that what
is a natural impression, stamped
by his own hand on every man's
mind, hath more of absolute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
than what depends on me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical
subtlety; whereof so
very few are capable, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
divers pretenders thereto, do
so freqently, (and perhaps very
dangerously) ensnare themselves.
And it is of far greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
such a notion of God be
entertained, as whereby he may
be rendered amiable, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting
object of love (the very
life and soul of all Religion) than
such as shall be the result, and
entertainment, only of Scholastic
wit.</p>
               <p>Yet also since it is very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48507:11"/>
that Man is now become a
degenerate Creature, and in an
Apostacy from God: He is very
little to be trusted with the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
his own <hi>Idaea</hi> of him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
certainly most unapt to allow
any thing a place in it, that would
have an unfavourable aspect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his vicious inclinations and his
guilty state. And the contagion
of man's sinfulnes having spread
it self as far as he hath propagated
his own Nature; so as no notion
in his Mind can be more common
than the perversion and distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of his mind it self; The pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
and danger is very obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
of mistaking a dictate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
nature for an authentic
<hi>common notion.</hi> And tho these
are not impossible to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished,
and in some cases very
easie, as when men find it impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48507:12"/>
unavoidably upon them, to
apprehend and acknowledg some
things which they are very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
should be true (In which case
their sentiments have the same
right to be believed as the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of an enemy on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
partie's behalf.) We have yet
no reason to neglect any other
means, whereby we may be more
certainly directed how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of God, or what we are to
attribute to him, and what not.</p>

               <p>Nor can we be at a greater
certainty, than in admitting such
things to belong to the Blessed
God as he plainly affirms of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
or any way, by his Word,
evidently discovers to belong to
him.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>For as none knowes the things

Taking therefore his own Word
for our measure in the present
case (which I will suppose the
Reader not to think it unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to appeal to; And what is
here said, is intended only for
those that have <hi>that</hi> estimate of
the Writings wont to go under
that name) what it saies of him
(much more what it proves) will
no doubt be admitted for certain
truth. Though, if it say such
things, as, to us, seem not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
to agree with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Our endeavour must be the
more earnest and solicitous (as
also it ought to be the more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest)
to discuss, and remove the
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap>, or whatsoever semblance
of disagreement.</p>
               <p>And whosoever concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to peruse that venerable
Book, will find every where, on
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48507:13"/>
the one hand, proclaimed and
magnify'd in it (what our own
minds cannot but have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed
of) <hi>the most exqisite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God,</hi> whereby he forms and
contrives the methods of all his
dispensations, and disposes them
in the aptest subserviency to his
own great and most important
ends.<note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> That <hi>all his waies are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and that he worketh all
things according to the <hi>counsel</hi> of
his Will.<note place="margin">Eph. 1.</note> In summe, that all
wisdom is appropriated to him,
that he is celebrated in the style
of <hi>God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 16. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>only Wise.</hi> Nor are we
therefore to think it strange, if,
many times, we are not able to
trace him out, or understand the
reason of every thing he thinks fit
to do. For the paths of the more
perfect wisdom, must therefore be
expected to be the more abstruse,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48507:13"/>
and remoter from common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension.</p>
               <p>How often do we find our
selves so far outgone by wise and
designing men, as that we are
sometimes constrain'd to confess
and admire their great prudence
and conduct (when they have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
their purposes) in those
managements, which we have
before beheld, either with silent
ignorance, or perhaps, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
censure. How much less
should the wisest of men regret
it, to find all their conjectures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by the infinite Wisdom.
In the contemplation whereof,
we find the great Apostle (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the vast capacity of
his divinely enlightned under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing)
exclaiming in a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note>
                  <hi>O the depths!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when our eyes tell us, from
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48507:14"/>
so manifest stupendous effects,
how far we are exceeded by him
in power, it were reasonable to
expect he should surpass us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
in the contrivances
of his Wisdom also.</p>
               <p>And whereas the conjunction
is rare, among men, of deep poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
wisdom, with integrity and
strict righteousness; This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the imperfection and
insufficiency of the former in great
part, that they know not how to
compass their designs, unless of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
by supplying their want of
wisdom, out of the spoil and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of their justice and honesty.
Otherwise, these are things not
so altogether out of credit in the
world, but that men would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
accomplish their purposes by
fair and unexceptionable means,
if they could tell how. Only the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48507:14"/>
respect and deference they have
for them is less, than what they
bear to their own interests and
ends.</p>
               <p>But besides the natural inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
rectitude of the divine Will,
we are secured, from his <hi>all-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie,</hi>
that we shall never be
fraudulently imposed upon by
any of his declarations unto the
children of men. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be gained by it: And we
cannot conceive what induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he should have, to make use
of any so mean and pitiful shifts
for the governing of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
whom he spontaneously
raised out of nothing, and hath
so perfectly within his power.</p>
               <p>Unless we should be so most
intolerably injurious to him, as to
imagine a worse thing of him
than we would of the worst of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48507:15"/>
men, that he loved falshood <hi>for
its own sake.</hi> And <hi>that,</hi> aginst his
so constantly professed detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, the declared repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of it to his Nature, and the
even tenour of his Word (every
where agreeing with it self here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in)
so often describing him by
that property, <hi>God that cannot lye.</hi>
And, with the same positivenes,
avowing his own uprightnes, and
reqiring it, expressing his great
love to it, and the high delight he
takes to find it in his (intelligent)
creatures.<note place="margin">Ps. 11. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>The righteous God loveth
righteousnes, and with his countenance
doth he behold the upright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is his testimony the less to
be regarded for that it is laudato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and of himself. For we are to
consider the Prerogative of him
that testifies, and that if he were
not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap> he were not God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48507:15"/>
that his giving us this, or any,
representation of himself (to
whom it were enough to enjoy
his own Perfections) is a <hi>vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safement,</hi>
and done of meer grace
and favour to us, that we may by
it be induced to place with satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
our unsuspicious trust and
confidence in him. As also, that
he saies, in all this, no other thing
of himself, than what our own
minds, considering him as God,
must acknowledg most worthy
of him, and agreeing to him with
the most apparent necessity.</p>
               <p>This part, therefore, of the <hi>Idaea</hi>
of God hath so firm a foundation,
both in the natural complexion
of our own minds, and the report
which his Word makes of him,
that on this hand we are hemm'd
in as by a wall of Adamant: And
cannot have the thought of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48507:16"/>
his <hi>Prescience,</hi> by intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon his Wisdom and Truth,
without offering the highest vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
both to him and our selves.</p>

               <head>Â§. V.</head>
               <p>On the other hand also, as it
cannot but seem to us an higher
perfection to know all things at
once, than gradually to arrive
to the knowledg of one thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another; and so proceed from
the ignorance of some things to
the knowledg of them; and that
nothing is more certain, than that
all possible perfection must agree
to God; So we find his own Word
asserting to him that most perfect
knowledg which seems to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the possibility of increase;
or that any thing should <hi>succeed</hi>
into his knowledg. For how
plainly is it affirmed of him that
he <hi>knows all things.</hi> And even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48507:16"/>
such future things as
about which our present enqirie
is conversant, The affirmation is
express and positive.<note place="margin">Isai. 46. 9, 10. with Ch. 41. 22, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>I am God, and
there is none like me, declaring the
end from the beginning, and from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
times the things that are not yet
done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is the affirmation naked,
and unfortify'd. For, in the same
sacred records, we have the same
thing both affirmed and proved:
Inasmuch as we find, in a great
part thereof, are contained things
foretold by most express Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
unto which the Events re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in other parts (and many
of them in other unqestioned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
besides) have so punctually
corresponded, as to leave no
place for doubt or cavil. Instances
are so plain and well known that
they need not be mentioned. And
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48507:17"/>
surely what was so expressly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
could not but have been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</p>
               <p>It seems then an attempt also
eqally hopeles and unrelieving,
as it were adventurous and bold,
to offer at the protection of his
<hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Sinceritie,</hi> by assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his <hi>Prescience</hi> or certain fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
of whatsoever shall
come to pass.</p>
               <p>And that their defence is not
to be attempted this way, will
further most evidently appear
from hence, That it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to assign particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of some or other most
confessedly wicked actions; against
which God had directed those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
means of counselling and
dehorting men, and which yet
it is most certain he did foreknow
they would do. As, tho it was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48507:17"/>
so punctually determined even
<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 12. 41.</note> to a day, and was (tho not so
punctually)<note n="â " place="margin">Gen. 15. 3.</note> foretold unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
how long, from that time,
<note n="*" place="margin">What there is of difficulty or doubt about this Prophecy, see fully cleared in the late Letter to the Deist.</note> his seed should be strangers in
a Land that was not theirs; Yet
how freqent are the counsels and
warnings sent to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
them sooner; Yea how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
are <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> directed
to claim their liberty, and exhort
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let them go, and at the
same time told,<note place="margin">Exod. 4. &amp;c.</note> he should not
hearken to them. Nor indeed is
it most seldome said that the
Lord hardened <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart, lest
he should. Tho it may be a doubt
whether those passages be truly
translated. For the gentler mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Hebrew idiom being
well known, it would seem more
agreeable to the Text, to have
expressed only the intended sense,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48507:18"/>
than to have strained a word to
the very utmost of its literal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and manifestly beyond what
was intended.</p>
               <p>After the like manner is the
Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> sent to the revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Israelites.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ch. 3. v. 4.</note> And directed to
speak to them <hi>with Gods own words,</hi>
The summe and purport where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was to warn and dehort them
from their wicked waies <hi>lest they
should die;</hi> when as yet it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told him, <hi>But the house of Israel
will not hearken to thee, for they will
not hearken to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto which same purpose it is
more pertinent, than necessary to
be added, That our Saviours own
plain assertions that he was the
Son of God, the many Miracles
by which he confirmed it, and his
freqent exhortations to the <hi>Jews</hi>
to believe in him thereupon, had
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48507:18"/>
a manifest tendency to make him
be known and believed to be so,
and conseqently to prevent that
most horrid act of his crucifixion
(for it is said, and the matter
speaks it self,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> that, <hi>if they had
known they would not have crucify'd
the Lord of Glory.)</hi> Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it was a thing which Gods
hand and counsel had determined
before to be done.<note place="margin">Act. 4. 28.</note> That is, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
wicked hands would be
prompt and ready for this tragic
enterprise, his Sovereign Power
and Wise Counsel concurred with
his foreknowledg, so only, and
not with less latitude, to define
or determine the bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of that malignity, than to
let it proceed unto this Execution.
And to deliver him up (not by
any formal resignation, or sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render,
as we well know, but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48507:19"/>
permitting him) thereunto. Tho
the same phrase of <hi>delivering him,</hi>
hath elsewhere, another notion
of <hi>assigning</hi> or <hi>appointing him</hi> to be
a propitiation for the sins of men,
by dying; which was done by
mutual agreement between both
the parties, him that was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiate,
and him who was to be
propitiated. In which respect
our Saviour is also said to have
given himself for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note>
Which purpose it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
not to hinder prepared
hands to execute in this way.</p>
               <p>Now if it did appear but in
one single instance only, that the
Blessed God did foreknow, and
dehort from the same act, It will
be plainly consequent, that his
warnings and dehortations from
wicked actions in the general, can
with no pretence be alledged as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48507:19"/>
a proof against his universal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
For if the argument [he
dehorted from the doing such an
action, therefore he did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know
it] would be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any thing, it must be of
sufficient force to conclude uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally;
which it cannot do, if
but a single instance can be given,
wherein it is apparent, he did both
dehort and foreknow. It can
only pretend to raise the doubt
which we have in hand to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss,
<hi>how fitly,</hi> and with what
wisdom and sinceritie, he can be
understood to interpose his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
and monitions in such a case.</p>

to any impartial under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
leave it no way suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
explicable, how the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
and concurrence, the holy
God hath to the worst of actions,
is to be distinguisht from that
which he affords to the best;
Wherein such inherently evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are less to be imputed to him
who forbids them, than to the
malicious tempter who prompts
to them, or the actor that does
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48507:20"/>
them, or wherein not a great deal
more. And leave it undeniable,
that the matter of all his Lawes,
in reference <hi>to all such actions</hi> that
ever have been done in the world,
was a <hi>simple and most strictly natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
impossibilitie.</hi> Nothing being
more apparently so, than either
not to do an action whereto the
agent is determined by an infinite
Power; or to separate the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
thereof, from an intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
evil action; And that this
<hi>natural impossibility of not sinning</hi>
was the ineluctable fate of his (at
first) <hi>innocent Creatures.</hi> Who also
(as the case is to be conceived of
with the Angels that kept not
their first station) must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<hi>irreversibly</hi> condemned to
the suffering of eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the not doing of what
it was (upon these terms) so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48507:21"/>
impossible to them to
avoid.</p>

               <p>This too hard Province the
present design pretends not to
intermeddle in, As being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
apprehended manageable,
for those briefly mentioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
and many more that
are wont to be insisted on in this
argument.</p>
               <p>Nor indeed at all necessary;
For tho many considerations have
been with great subtilty, alledg'd
and urged to this purpose, by
former and some Modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
(Which it is besides the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of these Papers severally to
discuss) These two, which seem
the most importunate and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
will, I conceive, be found
of little force; and then the less
strength which is in others, will
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48507:21"/>
be nothing formidable; <hi>viz:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it necessarily belongs to
the Original and Fountain-Being,
to be the first Cause of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Being; And consequently,
that what there is of positive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in any the most wicked acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
must principally owe it self
to the determinative productive
influence of this first and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Cause. Otherwise it would
seem there were some Being that
were neither <hi>Primum,</hi> nor <hi>a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again (which we are more
concerned to consider, because it
more concerns our present sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject)
that it were otherwise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
God should foreknow
the sinful actions of men (many
whereof, as hath been observed,
he hath foretold) if their futuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were a meer contingency,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48507:22"/>
and depended on the uncertain
will of the subordinate agent, not
determined by the Supream.</p>
               <p>But neither of these seem able
to infer the dismal conclusion of
God's concurring <hi>by a determinative
influence</hi> unto wicked actions.</p>
               <p>Not the former; for it may
well be thought sufficiently to
salve the rights and priviledg of
the first Cause, to assert that no
action can be done but <hi>by a power
derived from it;</hi> which, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to forbidden actions, intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Creatures may use or not
use as they please, without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asserting,
that they must be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistibly
determined also, even to
the worst of actions done by
them. Besides, that it seems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
to detract from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the ever Blessed God,
to affirm he was not able to make
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48507:22"/>
a Creature, of such a nature, as,
being continually sustained by
him, and supplyed with power
every moment sutable to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
should be capable of acting;
unless whatsoever he thus <hi>enables,</hi>
he <hi>determine</hi> (that is, for it can
mean no less thing, <hi>impel)</hi> it to do
also.</p>
               <p>And except it were affirmed
<hi>impossible</hi> to God to have made
such a Creature, (that is, that it
imply'd a contradiction, which
certainly can never be proved)
there is no imaginable pretence
why it should not be admitted
he hath done it: Rather than so
fatally expose the Wisdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and Righteousnes of God,
by supposing him to have made
Lawes for his reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
impossible, thorough his
own irresistible counter-action, to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48507:23"/>
be observed: and afterwards to
express himself displeased, and
adjudg his Creatures to eternal
punishments, for not observing
them.</p>
               <p>I am not altogether ignorant
what attempts have been made
to prove it impossible, Nor again,
what hath been done to manifest
the vanity of those attempts. But
I must confess a greater disposition
to wonder, that ever such a thing
should be disputed, that dispute
so plain a case. And that a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whereupon all moral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
depends, both humane and
divine, should not have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
at the first sight.</p>
               <p>'Tis not hard for a good Wit
to have somewhat to say for any
thing. But to dispute against
the common sense of Mankind,
we know before hand, is but to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48507:23"/>
trifle; as the essay to prove the
impossibility of local motion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>notion</hi> of the goodnes and
righteousnes of God, methinks,
should stick so close to our minds,
and create such a sense in our
Souls, as should be infinitely dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to us than all our senses and
powers. And that we should
rather choose to have our sight,
hearing, and motive power, or
what not besides, disputed, or even
torn away from us, than ever suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
our selves to be disputed into a
belief, that the holy and good
God should irresistibly determine
the wills of men to, and punish,
the same thing. Nor is it difficult
to urge more puzzling sophisms
against the former, than for this
latter.</p>
               <p>But the efforts of a sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Wit against sense, and more
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48507:24"/>
against the sense of our Souls, and
most of all against the entire
summe and substance of all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
and Religion, at once, are
but like the attempt to batter a
Wall of Brass with straws and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Nor is the assault, on this part,
more feeble and impotent, than
the defence is wont to be of the
other. For I would appeal to the
qick refined sense of any sober
and pious mind, after serious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
consultation with it self;
being closely urged, with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of so black a conception of
God [that he should be supposed
irresistibly to determine the will
of a man to the hatred of his own
most Blessed Self, and then to
exact severest Punishments for
the offence done] what relief it
would now be to it, to be only
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48507:24"/>
taught to reply, <hi>[That Man is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, and God above it.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A defence that doubles the
force of the assault. What! that
God should make a Law, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate
the violation of it! and
yet also punish that violation!
And this be thought a sufficient
<hi>Salvo,</hi> that himself is not subject
to any Law! Will a qick-sented,
tender spirit, wounded by so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable
indignity, offered to
the holy God, be any whit eased
or relieved, by the thin sophistry
of only a collusive ambiguity in
the word <hi>[Law?]</hi> Which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
signifies <hi>the declared pleasure
of a Ruler to a Subject,</hi> in which
sense any eye can see God can be
under no law, having no supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour.
But not-seldome also, <hi>an
habitual fixed principle and rule of
acting after one steady tenour.</hi> In
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48507:25"/>
which sense how manifest is it,
that the perfect rectitude of God's
own holy gracious Nature is an
eternal Law to him, infinitely
more stable, and immutable, than
the Ordinances of day and night!</p>
               <p>Or what relief is there in that
dream <hi>[of the supposed possibility of
God's making a reasonable Creature
with an innocent aversion to himself?]</hi>
For what can be supposed more
repugnant? Or what more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent?
If innocent, how were
it punishable? A Law already
made in the case, how can it be
innocent?</p>
               <p>But whatsoever strength there
may be in arguments, and replies,
to and fro, in this matter. That
which hath too apparently had
greatest actual efficacy, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
hath been the authority and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48507:25"/>
name of this or that man of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
and the force of that
art of imputing a doctrine, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
under a prejudicial doom, to
some or other ill-reputed former
Writer.</p>
               <p>I profes not to be skill'd in the
use of that sort of weapons. And
what reputation ought to be of
so great value with us, as that of
God and Religion!</p>
               <p>Tho if one would take that
invidious course, it were easie to
evince, that such a predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
influx to the production of
all whatsoever actions, is the
dearly espoused notion of one, of
as deservedly an ill character, as
ever had the name of a Christian
Writer. And whether he would
not take that name for a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to him, I pretend not to
know.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48507:26"/>
                  <hi>But let us take this sober ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the present case,</hi> [That
in this temporary state of trial, the
efficacious grace of God is necessary to
actions sincerely good and holy; which
therefore all ought undespairingly to
seek and pray for. But that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to other actions, he doth only
supply men with such a power, as
whereby, they are enabled, either to
act, or, in many instances (and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when they attempt any thing that
is evil) to suspend their own action.</p>
               <p>And surely it carries so unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable
a face and aspect with
it, that no man, that is himself
sober, will think the worst name,
of whosoever shall have said the
same thing, were a prejudice to
it; Or should more oblige him
to reject it, then we would think
our selves obliged throw away
Gold, or Diamonds, because an
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48507:26"/>
impure hand hath toucht them;
Or to deny Christ, because the
Devils confest him.</p>
               <p>Tho also, if any should impute
the so stating of this matter, to
any Authour, that hath been
wont to go under an ill name
and character, in the Christian
Church; There were a great
oversight committed (to say no
harder thing of it.)</p>
               <p>For the Writers whose names
would be supposed a prejudice,
have neither said the same thing,
nor with the same design.</p>
               <p>They would have this <hi>indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi>
of the power afforded to
the creature, to be so universal, as
to extend eqally to evil actions
and to good. And have asserted
it with a manifest design to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
efficacious grace, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the best actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48507:27"/>
Whereas this account would
make it not of so large extent.
(As it were very unreasonable
any should) For tho it may well
be supposed <hi>extendible</hi> to many
actions, besides those that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecally
evil, or to any that
are not spiritually good, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
enforces (nor can it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted)
that it should <hi>actually, and
alwaies extend</hi> so far. For who can
doubt but God can over-rule the
inclinations and actions of his
creature, when he pleases; and,
as shall best consist with his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the Purity of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
either lay on, or take off his
determining hand.</p>
               <p>Nor is it here asserted with any
other design, than to exempt the
Blessed God, as far as is possible;
from a participation in the evil
actions of his Creatures: In the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48507:27"/>
mean time entitling him, most
entirely, to those that are sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good. Tho it must be left im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
to men themselves (it
being thorough their own great
default) if they have not the
grace, which might effectually
enable them, to do such also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as for the latter.</hi> This sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
indetermination of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
will, in reference, especially,
to wicked actions, is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
capable of inferring, that God
cannot therefore foreknow them;
Or any thing more, than that we
are left ignorant of the way, how
he foreknowes them. And how
small is the inconvenience of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
that? Yea and how
manifest the absurdity of not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
the like, in many
cases? Since nothing is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
than that God doth many
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48507:28"/>
things besides, whereof the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
how he does them, we can
neither explicate nor understand!
For neither is it difficult to assign
instances, more than enough, of
actions done by our selves, of the
manner whereof, we can give no
distinct account, as those of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
intellection, with sundry
other.</p>
               <p>Some have been at great pains
we well know to explain the
manner of God's foreknowledg
of these futurities, otherwise than
by laying the foundation thereof
in his (supposed) efficacious will
or decree of them. They that
can satisfie themselves with what
<hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the followers of them
both; That can understand what
it is, <hi>with the one,</hi> for all things to
be eternally present to the Divine
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48507:28"/>
intellect <hi>in esse reali,</hi> and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by it, the World to have
been eternal. Or what, <hi>with the
other,</hi> that they be all present only
<hi>in esse representativo,</hi> and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by it barely <hi>that they are
all known,</hi> and no more, (which
seems like the explication of the
word invasion, by invasion) let
them enjoy their own satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>For my own part I can more
easily be satisfied to be ignorant
of the <hi>modus</hi> or <hi>medium</hi> of his
knowledg, while I am sure of the
thing; And I know not why any
sober-minded man might not be
so too. While we must all be
content to be ignorant of the
manner, yea and nature too, of a
thousand things besides, when
that such things there are, we have
no doubt. And when there are
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48507:29"/>
few things, about which we can,
with less disadvantage, suffer our
being ignorant; or, with less dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputation,
profess to be so.</p>
               <p>It cannot therefore be so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightful
a thing, to suppose God's
foreknowledg of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent
future actions, well to
consist with our ignorance, how
he foreknows them, as that we
should think it necessary, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
and mingle Heaven and
Earth, rather than admit it.</p>

of both be resolved into Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
capable of being confronted
to one another, And all that can
be made of the former, will only

These are at as great distance, as

upon, or jarring with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And wherein is the <hi>indecorum</hi>

               <p>We will, for discourse sake, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Prince, endowed with the

suppose we this his Prophetic abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

be said, because it is foreknown,
<hi>Man will</hi> do such a thing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>he may,</hi> where is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection?
For what influence can
foreknowledg have, to alter, or
affect, any way, either the nature
of the thing foreknown, or the
temper of the person that shall
do it; any more than the present
knowledg of the same thing, now

would deny to God: And which,
when it occurs to a man, is no
more understood to make an evil
action innocent, than the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

him that beholds it only, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
it at once. Surely what is,

               <p>But if what was otherwise
man's duty, be still his duty, what

be so? And how is that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to be done, than by these

fit, than it would be that God
should cease to rule over the
World? and qit the right of his

upon no other reason, than
only that he foresees they have a
mind to invade it?</p>
               <p>It may now, perhaps, be said,
All this reasoning tends indeed to
establish the contrary assertion,
[that notwithstanding God do

               <p>It may here, before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
further, not be unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to consider (A matter, as is
known, wont to be much vexed
in the Schools) <hi>how God may be
said to act for any end at all.</hi> And
it appears very certain, that he,
who is so every way absolutely
perfect, and happy, cannot be
thought to intend, and pursue an
end, after the same manner as we
are wont to do.</p>
               <p>We being conscious to our
selves of indigency, or, at the best,
of obligation to the Authour of
our Beings, are wont to design
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48507:33"/>
this or that end for the relieving
of our selves, or the approving
our selves to him. And, our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
depending upon the
attainment of it, we solicitously
deliberate about the fittest means
to attain it; and are tos't with
various Passions, of desire, and
hope, and fear, and joy, and grief,
according as the end is apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
more or less excellent, or
likely to be attained; varying
often our course upon new emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,
as this or that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
promote, or hinder the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of our pursuit. In short, we
pursue ends, as being both impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of disappointment, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
of their attainment.</p>
               <p>The Blessed God, being indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of nothing, nor under obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to any one, cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to propound an end to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48507:33"/>
himself as that whereupon his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
depends, which were
inconsistent with his already-compleat
felicity, and would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
him but potentially happy.
But acting alwaies from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
Self-sufficient fulnes of life,
and of all perfections, doth ever
satisfie himself in himself, and
take highest complacency in the
perfect goodnes, congruity and
rectitude of his own most Holy
Will and Way.</p>
               <p>And again, as he doth not seek
a yet-unattained satisfaction, in
any end he can be supposed to
propound to himself; So nor can
he be thought to deliberate, as
we are wont to do, concerning
the means of effecting any. For
deliberation would imply doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
and uncertainty, which his
absolute Perfection cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48507:34"/>
Nor doth need, the whole
frame and compass of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by him, in their distinct
references and tendencies, being,
at once, present to his all-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
view; so that there
can be no place for any interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate

any new resolves thereupon.

               <p>This being premised; It is now
further to be considered, that
howsoever one end oftentimes is
not attained, unto which the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly
extant declarations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Will have a visible aptitude,
<hi>viz. the obedient compliance of men
with them;</hi> another, more noble
end was, however, attainable, not
unbecoming the designment of
the Divine Wisdom, and which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48507:34"/>
it was every way most worthy
of God to be more principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon.</p>
               <p>It is fit the mention of this be
prefac't with an obvious remark;
That the misapprehension of the
state of things between God and
Man doth, in great part, owe it
self, to our aptnes to compare
unduly, the Divine Government
with that of Secular Rulers; and
our expectation to find them in
all things agreeing with each
other. Whereas there cannot but
be a vast difference, between the
<hi>constitution,</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of God's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
over (his Creatures,
and more especially) Mankind,
and that of Man over his fellow
Creatures of the same kind.</p>
               <p>The Government of secular,
humane Rulers, can never be, in
the constitution of it, altogether
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48507:35"/>
absolute, nor ought, in the design
of it, primarily to intend the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
advantage of the Ruler
himself, who as much depends
upon his Subjects, and hath (at
least) as great, need of them, as
they can be understood to have
of him. But as to the Blessed
God the matter is apparent, and
hath its own triumphant evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that since he is the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
and Root of all Being, that
all things are meer dependencies
upon his absolute pleasure, and
entirely of him, and by him, all
ought to be to him that he alone
might have the glory.<note place="margin">Ro. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, it must be asserted,
and cannot fail of obtaining to be
acknowledged, by every impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
and sober considerer of
things, that there is a much more
noble and important end, that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48507:35"/>
all God's public Edicts, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
to men (the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his Government over
them) do more principally aim
at, than their advantage, <hi>viz.
the dignity and decorum of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it self.</hi> And that he may be
found in every thing to have
done as became him, and was
most worthy of himself. And
what could be more so, than that
he should testifie the aversion of
his own Pure, and Holy Nature,
to whatsoever was unholy and
impure, his love of righteousnes
and complacency to be imitated
herein, together with his steady,
gracious Propension to receive
all them into the communion of
his own Felicity or Blessednes
(for the Redeemer's sake) who
should herein comply with him?</p>
               <p>Nor are we to understand that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48507:36"/>
he herein so designs the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Government, as men
are often wont to do things out
of design for their interest, <hi>in that
kind,</hi> that are <hi>otherwise,</hi> against
their (over-ruled) inclination. But
we are to account these his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
(altho they are acts of an
intelligent Agent, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
of wisdom and counsel, yet
also) the spontaneous emanations
of his own holy, and gracious
Nature, such as wherein he most
fully agrees, and consents with
himself. And is it now to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that, because he foresees
men will be wicked, and do what
shall be unworthy of them, he
must therefore lay aside his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and omit to do what shall
be worthy of himself?</p>

               <p>And hereupon it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48507:36"/>
the more ingenuous, and
candid, will allow themselves to
think the matter tolerably clear,
in reference to the former part of
the proposed difficulty; <hi>i. e.</hi> will
apprehend this way of dealing
with men <hi>not imprudent,</hi> or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the <hi>Divine Wisdom,</hi>
since, tho one end, in a great part,
fail, yet another, more valuable, is
attained.</p>
               <p>But yet, as to the latter part, the
difficulty may still urge, <hi>viz.</hi> how
it can stand with sinceritie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
that end also which failes, seems
to have been most directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that the Blessed God
should seem so earnestly intent
upon it. Since it is hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable,
that the same thing
should be, at once, seriously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
as an end, and yet, at the
same time, give the eye, which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48507:37"/>
seems to design it; no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
than of a thing never to be
brought to pass.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we are next to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that we may proceed gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually,
And not omit to say what
is in it self considerable; tho it is
not all (which cannot be said at
once) that is to be said; That the
public declarations of the Divine
Will, touching man's duty, do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that very end [his obedient
compliance therewith] in great
part, and as to may (altho it be
foreknown they will prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
with the most) and are
the no less successful, than the
apt means of attaining it.</p>
               <p>Nor, certainly, if it were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
the World would be so
divided, as that some would obey,
and others not obey, was it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fittest course, that these
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48507:37"/>
two sorts should, by some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
act of Providence, be
carefully severed from each other;
and <hi>those</hi> be dealt withal apart
from the rest: But rather, that
the Divine Edicts should be of an
universal tenour, and be directed
to all as they are; the matter of
them being of universal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and eqally sutable to the
common case of all men.</p>

            <div n="13" type="section">
               <head>Â§. XIII.</head>
               <p>Neither yet was it necessary,
that effectual care should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
they should actually reach
all, and be apply'd to every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual

to be resolved into the
wickednes of the World, that they
do not so; and that there is not
an universal diffusion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
into every part.</p>
               <p>For it being evident to any ones
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48507:38"/>
reflection, that men are in a state
of apostacy and defection from
their Maker and common Lord,
and therefore subject to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure;
Whereas the Merciful
God hath done his own part, and
so much beyond what was to be
expected from him; issued out his
Proclamations of Peace, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
upon so easie and indulgent
terms, as are expressed in his
Gospel; if, hereupon, men also
did their part, behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
sutably to the exigencie
of their case, and as did become
reasonable Creatures, faln under
the displeasure of their Maker,
(whereof their common condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
affords so innumerable, so
pregnant proofs) The Gospel,
wheresoever it should arrive,
would have been entertained
with so great a transport of joy,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48507:38"/>
and so ready and universal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
as very soon to have
made a great noise in the World:
And being found to be of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
tenour and concernment,
and that what is saies to one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it eqally saies the same to
every one; It could not but be,
that Messengers would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
have run from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to Nation; some to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
others to enqire after
those strange tidings of great joy
unto all people, lately sent from
Heaven; concerning the <hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>
God with us; God, again
upon his return to Man, and <hi>now
in Christ reconciling the World to
himself.</hi> And thus how easily,
and <hi>even naturally,</hi> would the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
soon have spread it self tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the World? Especially the
merciful God having so provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48507:39"/>
that there should be an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
constituted, and set up; a
sort of men, whose whole busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it should be, to propagate,
and publish those happy tidings.</p>
               <p>But that men should so indulge
their sensual, terrene inclination,
as not at all to use their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
and considering power,
about other matters than only
what are within the sight of their
eye, when by so easie and qick a
turn of thoughts they might <hi>feel
and find out</hi> who made them, and
was the Original of their life and
being, and that things are not
right, and as they should be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and them; and so by
what is within the compass of
natural revelation, be prepared
for what is super-natural. And
not that only, but to that stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by which they are unapt to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48507:39"/>
enqire after, and receive, to adde
that obstinate malignity, by which
they are apt to reject, and oppose
the merciful discoveries, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of their offended, reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Creatour, and Lord: How
manifestly doth this devolve the
whole business, of the little, slow
progress of the Gospel in the
World, upon themselves only!</p>
               <p>As suppose we a Prince of the
greatest Clemency, Benignity,
and Goodnes, from whom a
whole Countrey of his Subjects
have made a most causeless de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
hereupon to send, to
the whole Body of the Rebels, a
gracious Proclamation of free
Pardon, upon their return to their
allegiance, and duty; and it only
from hence comes to pass, that
every individual person of them,
distinctly understands not what
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48507:40"/>
the Message from their Prince
did import; because, they that
heard it would not, many of
them, allow themselves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
and regard it; and others
of them, with despiteful vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
fell upon the Heraulds,
barbarously but chering some of
them, and ignominiously repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the rest. Who would not
say, that Prince had fully done
his part, and acqitted himself an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably
to the best Character,
tho he should send to the Rebels
no further overtures. Much
more, if, thorough a long tract
of time, he continue the same
amicable endeavours for their
reducement; notwithstanding the
constant experience of the same
ill success? Who would not cast
the whole busines of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ill understanding, between
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48507:40"/>
him, and the revolters, upon
themselves. And reckon it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
any should be ignorant,
of his kind and benign inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and intentions, if an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
enmity, and disaffection to
him, and his Government, were
not their common temper?</p>
               <p>Tho, so infinitely do the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God, exceed those of the
most Merciful Prince on Earth,
as well as his knowledg and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
that wheresoever there are
any exempt cases, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, eqally able, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
to consider them distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And so vastly different, may
we well suppose, the degrees of
happines and misery to be, in the
other World; as that there may
be latitude enough, of punishing
and rewarding men, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
to the degrees of light
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48507:41"/>
they have had, and the more or
less malignity, or propension to
reconciliation, was found with
them thereupon.</p>

               <p>Nor again was it at all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous,
or unbecoming, that the
Blessed God, this being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
temper, and disposition of
all men, to reject his gracious
tenders, should provide, by some

might not be finally rejected by
all. For what can be more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
to Sovereignty (even
where it is infinitely less abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute)
than, arbitrarily, to design
the objects of special favour? Who
blames a Prince, for placing spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
marks of his Royal bounty,
or clemency here and there, as
he thinkes fit? or that he hath
some peculiar favourites, with
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48507:41"/>
whom he familiarly converses,
whom he hath won, by some or
other not-common inducements,
and assured their loyal affection:
tho there be thousands of Persons

as they? It belongs to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty,
only so, to be favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to some, as, in the mean
time, to be just towards all.</p>
               <p>Yea and it must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
such are the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the holy God towards the
whole community of mankind,
as import, not only strict righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
but great clemency and
mercie also.</p>
               <p>Tho they might easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
themselves to be offenders,
and liable to the severities of his
Justice, they are spared by his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
sustained by his bounty,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48507:42"/>
protected by his power, Their
lives and properties are fenced by
his own lawes. And whereas
they are become very dangerous
enemies to one another: and each
one his own greatest enemie;
It is provided by those laws, even
for the worst of men, that none
shall injure them, that all love
them, and seek their good. He
interposes his authority on their
behalf; and, if any wrong them,
he takes it for an affront done to
himself. By the same lawes,
they are directed to industry, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality,
Sobriety, temperance, to
exercise a Government over
themselves, to bridle and subdue
their own exorbitant lusts and
passions, their more immediate
tormentours, and the sources of
all the calamities and miseries,
which befal them in this World.

By all which evidences of his
great care, and concern for their
welfare, They might understand
him to have favourable propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

they have offended him, he is not
their implacable enemy; And
might, by his goodnes, be led to
repentance.</p>
               <p>Yea and moreover; he hath
sent them a Redeemer, his own
Son, an incarnate Deity, who
came down into this World, full
of grace and truth, upon the most
merciful errand. (And they have
some of them been in transports,
when they have but fancy'd such
a descent, for the doing them, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
some lighter good turn; as

that thou wilt finally disregard

to hear,</q> and obey, and live.
Indeed sending a Prophet to a

him of such ill success<note n="*" place="margin">Ezekiel. Ch. 3. 7.</note>. But it

               <p>But the Course the great God
takes, is only to apply himself to

with the rest. For if it be
said he also applies himself to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48507:44"/>
them by the private dictates of
his Spirit; He doth not, by it,
make formed speeches to men.
But as to those its common mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whereby it applies it self
unto them, doth only solicite, in
a stated manner of operation, in
and by their own reason and
consciences (as he concurres with
our inferiour faculties, and with

to their natures and capacities)
speaking no other, than their own

out of his Word, or by other

to them that persist in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
till they finally perish, which it
can be thought not consistent with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie
to have inserted, upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

               <p>And what more convenient course

               <p>
                  <hi>As to the former.</hi> It may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,

grieved that any perish.<note place="margin">Ps. 81. 12, 13.</note> Now
these things, compared with his
public declarations, and tenders,
directed, in an universal tenour,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48507:45"/>
to all men, carry that appearance
and shew with them, as if he
would have it believ'd, his end
were to save all. Wherewith
his foresight of the perdition of so
many, seems ill to agree. For,
how can that end be seriously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
which it is foreseen will
not be brought about? And
how can it be thought to consist
with sincerity, that there should
be an appearance of his having
such an end, unto which, a <hi>serious
real</hi> intention of it doth not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond?</p>
               <p>Wherefore we shall here exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
what <hi>appearance</hi> such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
as those above recited,
can, by just interpretation, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to amount unto.</p>
               <p>And then shew that there is
<hi>really</hi> with the Blessed God, what
doth truly and fully correspond
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48507:46"/>
to that appearance. And very
agreeably too, with the hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
of his foreseeing how things
will finally issue, with very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
               <p>And first, that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the true import of the
expressions which we have
mentioned, and others of like
sound and meaning. We are to
consider, that (tho being taken
severally and apart, they are not
capable of a sense, prejudicial to
the cause, the defence whereof
we have undertaken, which we
shall afterwards more distinctly
evince, yet) it were very injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
to go about to affix a sense,
unto a single expression, without
weighing the general design of
the writings, whereof it is a part.</p>
               <p>It were qite to frustrate the
use of words, when a matter is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48507:46"/>
to be represented, that is copious,
and consists of many parts and
branches; which cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in one, or a few sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
if we will pretend to esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and make a judgment of
the Speakers full meaning, by this
or that single passage, only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we have not patience, or
leasure, to hear the rest; or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
have a greater disposition to
cavil his words, than understand
his meaning.</p>
               <p>If a Course resembling this
should be taken, in interpreting
the Edicts, or Lawes of Princes,
and States (suppose it were a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
of Pardon to delinqent
Subjects) and only this or that
favourable clause be fastened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without regard to the inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Proviso's and Conditions;
The (concerned) interpreters
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48507:47"/>
might do a slight, temporary, and
easily remedible wrong to the
Prince; but are in danger, more
fatally, to wrong themselves.</p>
               <p>The Edicts of the great God,
that are publicly extant to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
(the universal publication
whereof, they partly withstand,
and which they too commonly
deprave, and perversly mis-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret,
where they do obtain) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
no such appearance with them,
as if he had ever proposed it to
himself, for his end, to save all
men, or any man, let them do
what they please, or how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
a Course soever they
take, and shall finally persist in.</p>
               <p>If that were supposed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
his so seemingly serious
counsels, and exhortations, were
as ludicrous, as they could be
thought, if it were as perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48507:47"/>
determined all should perish.
For what God will, by Almighty
Power, immediatly work, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the subordinate concurrence
of any second cause, must be <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily.</hi>
And it is eqally vain,
solicitously to endeavour the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
of subordinate Agents, to
do that which <hi>without them</hi> is <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary,</hi> as it were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
that, <hi>by them,</hi> which is

               <p>That which his declarations

very great conseqent miseries;
he is willing to pardon, save and

(the recompence due to his

               <p>'Tis true that he frequently uses
much importunity with men, and
enforces his Lawes with that ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnes,
as if it were his own great
interest to have them obey'd;
Wherein, having to do with men,
he doth like a man, solicitously
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48507:49"/>
intent upon an end which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be satisfy'd till he attain. Yet
withal, he hath interspersed, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where in his Word, so frequent,
God-like Expressions of his own
Greatnes, All-sufficiency and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency
upon his Creatures,
as that if we attend to these his

compare one thing with another,
we shall find the matter not at

<hi>this</hi> to be the state of things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him, and us; that he makes
no overtures to us, as thinking us
considerable, or as if any thing
were to accrue to him from us.
But that, as he takes pleasure in
the diffusion of his own goodnes,
so it is our interest to behave our

and continue in it, or do not, so
we may expect the delectable
communications of it, or tast,
otherwise, his just severity. That,
therefore, when he exhorts, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests,
intreats, beseeches that we
would obey and live; speaks as
if he were grieved at our disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and what is like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
to us therefrom; These are
merciful condescentions, and the
efforts of that goodnes, which
chooseth the fittest wayes of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us,</hi> rather than that he is <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himself,</hi> by any such Passions,
as we are wont to feel in our
selves, when are pursuing our
own designs. And that he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safeth
to speak in such a way as is
less sutable <hi>to himself,</hi> that it may
be more sutable <hi>to us,</hi> and might
teach us, while he so far complies
with us, how becoming it is that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48507:51"/>
we answerably bend our selves
to a compliance with him. He
speaks, sometimes, as if he did
<hi>suffer somewhat humane,</hi> as an apt
means (and which to many
proves effectual) to bring us to
<hi>enjoy,</hi> at length, <hi>what is truly divine.</hi>
We may, if we consider, and
lay things together, understand
these to be gracious insinuations;
Whereby, as he hath not left the
matter liable to be so mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
as if he were really affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with solicitude, or any pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
concerning us (which he
he hath sufficiently given us to
understand his Blessed Nature
cannot admit of.) So nor can
they be thought to be disguises of
himself, or misrepresentations,
that have nothing in him corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponding
to them. For they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
signifie the obedience, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48507:52"/>
blessednes of those his Creatures
that are capable thereof, to be
more pleasing and agreeable to
his Nature, and Will; than that
they should disobey and perish.
(which is the utmost that can
be understood meant, by those
words, <hi>God will have all men to be
saved and come to the knowledg of the
truth)</hi> But withal, that he so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
the indignity done to
his Government, by their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
that if they obey not (as
the indulgent constitution and
temper of his Law, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
now are, in and by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer)
they must perish. And
that he hath also such respect to
the congruity and order of things,
as that it shall not be the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
method of his Government
over reasonable Creatures, to
over-power them into that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48507:52"/>
by which it may come to
pass that they perish not. All
which may be collected from
those his own plain words, in
that other recited Text (and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
besides of like import.) When,
with so awful solemnity, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses,<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.</note>
that <hi>as he lives he takes no
pleasure in the death of sinners, but
that they may turn and live;</hi> and
adds, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will you
die?</hi> That is, that their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and consequent welfare,
would be <hi>more grateful</hi> to him,
than their perdition, upon their
persevering in destructive waies.
But yet, that if they were not
moved to repent, by these his
pleadings and expostulations used
with them, they <hi>should die,</hi> and
were therefore concern'd, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
and hearken, to such his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings
and warnings, as the apt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48507:53"/>
means to work their good; not
expecting he should take extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
courses with them, in
order to it. And that the <hi>real
respect</hi> he had thereunto, should
never induce him, to use any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decorous
course, to bring it about;
but that he had a more principal
respect to the rules of Justice, and
the order of his Government,
than to their concernments. And
that he, notwithstanding, expresses
himself aggrieved that any final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perish; If we consider and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect,
what notices he hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
our Minds with, of the
Perfections of a Deity, and what
he hath remonstrated to us of his
own Nature, so plainly, in his
Word; we cannot understand
more by it, than the calm dispas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
resentment and dislike,
which most perfect Purity, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48507:53"/>
Goodnes have, of the sinfulnes
and miserable ruine, of his own
Creatures.</p>
               <p>In all which we have a most
unexceptionable <hi>Idaea</hi> of God, and
may behold the comly <hi>conjuncture</hi>
of his large Goodnes, strict Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,
and most accurate Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
all together. As we are
also concerned, in making our
estimate of his waies, to consider
them. And not to take our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of what is sutable to God,
by considering him according to
one single Attribute only; but as
they all are united, in his most
Perfect <hi>Being.</hi> And in that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
harmony, as not to infer with
him a difficulty what to do, or
what not. Which sometimes falls
out with men, where there is an
imperfect resemblance of those
Divine Excellencies, not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48507:54"/>
contempered together. As it
was with that <hi>Spartan</hi> Prince and

a necessity to march his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and taking notice of one, for
whom he had a peculiar kindness,
that, thorough extream weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
was not possibly to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he look't back upon him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
his sense of that exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,

               </p>
               <p>God's own Word misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
him not, but gives a true
account of him, if we allow our
selves to confer it with it self, one
part of it with another. Nor doth
any part of it, taken alone, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
him so to have will'd the
happines of men, for any end of
his, that he resolved he would,
<hi>by whatsoever means</hi> certainly effect
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48507:54"/>
it; As we are wont, many times,
with such engernes to pursue ends
upon which we are intent, as not
to consider of right or wrong, fit
or unfit in our pursuit of them,
and so let the cost of our means,
not seldom, eat up our end. Nor
did that belong to him, or was
his part as our most benign, wise,
and righteous Governour, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
that we should certainly not
transgress, or not suffer prejudice
thereby; but that we should not
do so, thorough his omission of
any thing, which it became him
to do to prevent it.</p>

               <p>It may therefore be of some

(which is more to our purpose)
such of them as are intelligent,

               <p>As to the former sort of these

were all most absolutely intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

               <p>For the latter, It cannot be

not entirely his ends, But
partly his, and partly prescribed
by him, to his reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to be theirs. We are to

intends to do, what he righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
esteems congruous<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> should
be his own part; which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
and limits, as seems good
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48507:55"/>
unto him. And sometimes, of his
own good Pleasure, assumes to
himself the doing of so much, as
shall ascertain the end; Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
procuring, that his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
shall do his part also. That
is, not only enacts his Law, and
adds exhortations, warnings, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
to enforce it, but also
emits that effectual influence,
whereby the inferiour wheels
shall be put into motion, the
powers and faculties of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
Creature excited and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
and (by a spirit in the
wheels) made as the Chariots of
a willing people. At other times
and in other instances, he doth
less, and meeting with resistence,
sooner retires; follows not his
external Edicts and Declarations,
with so potent and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
an influence; but that the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48507:56"/>
Creature, through his own great
default, may omit to do his part,
and so <hi>that end</hi> be not effected.</p>
               <p>That the course of his Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
towards men on earth is,
<hi>de facto,</hi> ordered with this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
seems out of qestion. Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
experience shews it. Some
do sensibly perceive that motive
influence, which others do not.
The same persons, at sometimes,
find not that, which at other
times they do. His own Word
plainly asserts it. <hi>He works in us
to will and to do, of his own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Where he will, he,</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
<hi>shews mercy; where he will, he
hardeneth,</hi> or doth not prevent but
that men be hardened. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
we should be constrain'd to
rase out a great part of the Sacred
Volume, if we should not admit

               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:48507:56"/>
And as the eqity and fitnes of
his making such difference (when

without profanenes be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so it is evident, from what
was before said, they are far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the reach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of any reasonable doubt;
since he forsakes none, but being
first forsaken.</p>
               <p>Nor have men any pretence
to complain of subdolous deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or that they are surprisingly
disappointed, and lurcht of such
help, as they might have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
inasmuch as this is so plainly

            </div>
            <div n="20" type="section">
               <p>Nor is it reasonably to be
doubted, <hi>(such a will</hi> being all that
can be pretended to be the visible
meaning of the passages before
noted) whether there be such a
Will in God or no. And so some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
really corresponding (the
next thing promised to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed)
to the aspect and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
hereof, which is offered to
our view. For what should be
the reason of the doubt? He, who
best understands his own Nature,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48507:58"/>
having said of himself what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
no less; why should we
make a difficulty to believe him?
Nor indeed can any notices we
have of the Perfections of the
Divine Nature be less liable to
doubt, than what we have of
<hi>his unchangeable veracity;</hi> whence,
as it is <hi>impossible</hi> to him to lye, it
must be <hi>necessary,</hi> that he be <hi>really
willing</hi> of what he hath <hi>represented</hi>
himself so to be.</p>
               <p>I must here profess my dislike
of the terms of that common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
the <hi>voluntas beneplaciti, et
signi</hi> in this present case. Under
which, such as coyned, and those
that have much used it, have
only rather, I doubt not, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
a good meaning, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by it an <hi>ill one.</hi> It seems,
I confess, by its more obvious
aspect, too much to countenance
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48507:58"/>
the ignominious slander, which
profane and atheistical dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
would fasten upon God, and
the course of his procedure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
men; and which it is the
design of these Papers to evince
of as much absurdity and folly,
as it is guilty of impiety and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes:
As tho he only intended
to <hi>seem willing</hi> of what he really
was not; That there was an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
to which nothing did
<hi>subesse.</hi> And then why is the
latter call'd <hi>voluntas?</hi> unless the
meaning be he did only will the
<hi>sign,</hi> which is false and impious;
and if it were true, did he not will
it with the will of <hi>good pleasure?</hi>
And then the members of the
distinction are confounded. Or,
as if the evil actions of men
were, more truly, the objects
of his good Pleasure, than
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48507:59"/>
their forbearance of them.</p>
               <p>And of these faults the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the distinction of God's
<hi>secret Will,</hi> and <hi>revealed,</hi> unto this
case, tho it be useful in many, is as
guilty.</p>

               <head>Â§. XXI.</head>
               <p>The truth is (unto which we
must esteem our selves obliged to
adhere, both by our assent, and
defence) that God doth <hi>really</hi> and
<hi>complacentially</hi> will (and therefore
doth with most unexceptionable
sincerity declare himself to will)
that <hi>to be done and enjoy'd by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men,</hi> which he doth not, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally,
will <hi>to make them do, or
irresistibly procure that they shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</hi>
Which is no harder asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than that the impure will
of degenerate sinful Man is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the Holy Will of God;
and the malignity of Man's will
to the benignity of his. No har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48507:59"/>
than that there is sin and
misery in the World, which how
can we conceive otherwise, than
as a repugnancie to the good and
acceptable Will of God?</p>
               <p>Methinks it should not be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to us to acknowledg, that
God doth <hi>truly,</hi> and <hi>with compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie,</hi>
will, whatsoever is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
righteous matter of his own
Lawes. And if it should be with
any a difficulty, I would only
make this supposition. What
if all the World were yet in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie,
yielding entire, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
obedience to all the now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Laws of God, which have
not reference to Man as now
faln (as those of repentance, Faith
in a Mediatour, &amp;c.) would it
now be a doubt with any, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God did truly and really
<hi>will,</hi> and were <hi>pleased with</hi> the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48507:60"/>
holines and righteousnes which
were every where to be found in
the World? Surely we would
not, in this case, imagine the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
will more pure and holy
than the Divine; or that he were
displeased with men for their
being righteous and holy. Now
again suppose the World revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
what then is that holy Will
of God changed? will we not
say it remains the same holy Will
still? And stands the same Rule
of righteousnes and duty that it
was? Doth the change of his
Rebel-Creatures infer any with
him? Or do only the <hi>declarations</hi>
of his former Will remain to be
their rule, and keep them still
obliged, <hi>his Will it self</hi> being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
another from what it was?
Surely he might as easily have
changed his Lawes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:48507:60"/>
And if we say his Will is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
how should we know it to
be so? <hi>If we know it not,</hi> surely
such a thing should not be said
or thought. <hi>If we know it,</hi> how
should those yet-extant Lawes
and Declarations continue to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige,
<hi>against the Law-givers known
will?</hi> And then the easie expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to nullifie the obligation of
a Law, that were thought too
restrictive, were to disobey it.
And men might, by sinning once,
license themselves to do the same
thing (tho then we could not call
it sinning) alwaies. And so the
Creatures should be the supream,
and ruling will. Nor had it been
a false suggestion, but a real
truth, that Man, by becoming a
sinner, might make himself a
God.</p>
               <p>Or, if it shall be thought fit to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48507:61"/>
say, that the Divine Will would
not, in that supposed case, be said
to be changed; but only, that
now, the event makes it appear
not to have been, what we
thought it was; That were to
impute both impuritie and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
to the Holy Blessed
God, as his fixed Attributes. And
what we thought unfit, and
should abhorre, to imagine might
have place with him one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to affix to him for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitie.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="22" type="section">
               <head>Â§. XXII.</head>
               <p>And whereas it may be thought
to follow hence, that hereby we
ascribe to God a liablenes to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
and disappointment.
That is without pretence. The
resolve of the Divine Will, in
this matter, being not concerning
the event <hi>what Man shall do,</hi> But
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48507:61"/>
concerning his duty <hi>what he should,</hi>
and concerning the connection
between his duty, and his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Which, we say, he doth not
only seem to will, but wills it
really and truly. Nor would his
Prescience of the event, which
we all this while assert, let fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
be so much as possible to
him. Especially, it being at
once foreseen, that his Will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
crossed in this, would be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in so important a thing, as
the preserving the decorum of
his own Government. Which
had been most apparently ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misht,
beyond what could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with the Perfections of the
Deity, if either his Will concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man's duty, or the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of that Will, had not been
substantially, the same that they
are.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:48507:62"/>
We are, therefore, in assigning
the object of this or that act of
the Divine Will, to do it <hi>entirely,</hi>
and to take the whole object to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
without dividing it, as if
the Will of God did wholly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
upon what indeed is but
a part (and especially if that be
but a less considerable part) of
the thing willed. In the present
case, we are not to conceive that
God, <hi>only,</hi> wills either Man's duty
or felicity, or that herein his Will
doth solely and ultimately ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate.
But, in the whole, the
determination of God's Will is,
<hi>That Man shall be duly governed,
that is, congruously both to himself,
and him. That such and such things,
most congruous to both, shall be Man's
duty, by his doing whereof, the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Honour of God's own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48507:62"/>
might be preserved, which
was the thing principally to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd;
and in the first place. And,
as what was secundary thereto, that
hereby Man's felicity should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for.</hi> Therefore, it being
foreseen a violation would be
done to the sacred rights of the
Divine Government, by Man's
disobedience, it is resolved, they
shall be repaired and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by other means. So that the
Divine Will hath its effect; as to
what was its more noble and
principal design, the other part
failing, only, by his default, whose
is the loss.</p>
               <p>And if yet it should be insisted,
that in asserting God to will what
by his Lawes he hath made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Man's duty, even where
it is not done, we shall herein
ascribe to him, at least, an <hi>inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:48507:63"/>
and an <hi>imperfect Will,</hi> as
which doth not bring to pass the
thing willed.</p>
               <p>It is answered, that imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
were with no pretence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
to the Divine Will, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for its not effecting every thing,
whereto it may have a <hi>real</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension.
But it would be more
liable to that imputation, if it
should effect any thing, which it
were <hi>less fit</hi> for him to effect, than
not to effect it. The absolute
Perfection of his Will stands in
the <hi>proportion,</hi> which every act of
it bears, to the importance of the
things, about which it is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant.
Even as, with men, the
perfection of any act of will is
to be estimated, not by the meer
peremptory sturdines of it, but
by its proportion to the goodnes
of the thing willed. Upon which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48507:63"/>
account, a meer <hi>velleity</hi> (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
love to speak) when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of goodnes in the object
claims no more, hath unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably
greater perfection in it,
than the most obstinate <hi>Voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And since the Event forbids us
to admit that God did ever will
the obedience and felicity of all,
with such a VVill as should be
effective thereof; if yet his plain
Word shall be acknowledged the
measure of our belief, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which so plainly asserts him
<hi>someway</hi> to will the salvation of
all men, 'tis strange if, hereupon,
we shall not admit rather of a
will <hi>not-effective</hi> of the thing wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
than <hi>none at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The VVill of God is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be vindicated from all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,
if he have sufficient
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48507:64"/>
reason for all the propensions,
and determinations of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the value of the things
willed, or from his own Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
who wills them.</p>
               <p>In the present case, we need
not doubt to affirm, that the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and felicity of all men, is
of that value, as whereunto a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension
of will, by only <hi>simple
complacency</hi> is proportionable. Yet,
that his not procuring, as to all
(by such courses as he <hi>more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily</hi>
takes with some) that
they shall, in event, obey and be
happy, is upon so much <hi>more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable</hi>
reasons (as there will be
further occasion to shew ere long)
as that, <hi>not to do it</hi> was more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
with the <hi>higher complacency,</hi>
of a determinative will.</p>
               <p>And since the public declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his good will, towards
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48507:64"/>
all men, import no more than
the former, and do plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
so much; Their correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to the matter declared is
sufficiently apparent.</p>
               <p>And so is the congruity of
both with his prescience of the
event.</p>
               <p>For tho, when God urges and
incites men, by exhortations,
promises, and threats, to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their own part (which it
is most agreeable to his holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Nature to do) he foresee,
many will not be moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
but persist in wilful neglect,
and rebellions till they perish:
He, at the same time, sees that
they <hi>might do</hi> otherwise, and that,
if they would comply with his
methods, things would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
issue with them. His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
no way, imposing upon
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48507:65"/>
them a <hi>necessity</hi> to transgress. For
they do it not because he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew
it, but he only foreknew it
because they would do so. And
hence he had, as it was necessary
he should have, not only <hi>this</hi> for
the object of his foreknowledg,
<hi>that they would do amiss and perish.</hi>
But the whole case in its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
<hi>that they would do so, not
thorough his omission, but their own.</hi>
And there had been no place left
for this state of the case; if his
public Edicts and Manifests, had
not gone forth, in this tenour as
they have.</p>
               <p>So that the consideration of his
prescience, being taken in, gives
us only, in the whole, this state of
the Case, That he foresaw men
would not take that course, which
he <hi>truly</hi> declared himself willing
they should (and was graciously
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48507:65"/>
ready to assist them in it) in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their own well-being.
Whence all complaint of insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
dealing is left without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>

               <p>Nor (as we also undertook to
shew) could any course (within
our prospect) have been taken,
that was fit, in it self, and more
agreeable to sincerity.</p>
               <p>There are only these two waies
to be thought on, besides. Either
that God should wholly have
forborn to make overtures to
men in common.</p>
               <p>Or, that he should efficaciously
have overpow'red all into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with them. And there is
little doubt, but, upon sober con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
both of these will be
judg'd altogether unfit.</p>
               <p>The former; Inasmuch as it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48507:66"/>
had been most disagreeable <hi>to the
exact measures of his Government,</hi>
to let a race of sinful Creatures
persist, thorough many successive
Ages, in apostacy and rebellion,
when the characters of that Law,
first written in Man's heart, were
in so great measure outworn, and
become illegible; without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
the impression, in another
way; and reasserting his right
and authority, as their Ruler and
Lord; <hi>To the Holines of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
not to send into the VVorld
such a declaration of his Will, as
might be a standing testimony
against the impurity, whereinto
it was lapsed; <hi>To the goodnes of it,</hi>
not to make known upon what
termes, and for whose sake, he
was reconcileable; <hi>And to the truth
of the thing,</hi> since he really had
such kind propensions towards
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48507:66"/>
men in common not to make
them known. That it had, it
self, been more liable to the
charge of insinceritie, to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
from men what was <hi>real
truth,</hi> and of so much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to them. And he did, in
revealing them, but act his own
Nature; the goodnes whereof is
no more lessened, by mens refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of its offers, than his Truth
can be made of none effect by
their disbelief of its assertions.
Besides the great use such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
revelation of the way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
was to be of, to those
that should obediently comply
with it, even after they should be
so to do.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="24" type="section">
               <head>Â§. XXIV.</head>
               <p>And the latter we may also
apprehend very unfit too; tho,
because that is less obvious, it
requires to be more largely insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:48507:67"/>
For it would seem that if we
do not <hi>effect</hi> any thing which we
have a real will unto, it must
proceed from impotencie, and
that we <hi>cannot do it,</hi> which who
would say of the great God?</p>
               <p>Herein, therefore, we shall
proceed by steps. And gradually
offer the things that follow to
consideration.</p>
               <p>As, that it were, indeed, most
repugnant to the notion of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to suppose any thing, which
includes in it no contradiction,
impossible to <hi>God,</hi> considered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that <hi>Single Attribute of
Power,</hi> only.</p>
               <p>But yet we must add, That this
were a very uneqal way of esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
what <hi>God can do,</hi> that is to
consider him as a <hi>meer Being of
Power.</hi> For the notion of God so
conceiv'd, were very inadeqate
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48507:67"/>
to him, which taken entirely,
imports the <hi>comprehension of all
Perfections.</hi> So that they are two
very distant qestions, <hi>What the
Power of God alone could do;</hi> And,
<hi>What God can do.</hi> And whereas
to the former the answer would
be, <hi>Whatsoever is not in it self re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to be done.</hi> To the latter,
it must only be, <hi>Whatsoever it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes,
or is agreeable to a Being every
way perfect to do.</hi> And so it is to
be attributed to the <hi>excellencie of
his Nature,</hi> if amongst all things
not simply impossible, there be
any, which it may be truly said
<hi>be cannot do.</hi> Or, it proceeds not
from the imperfection of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but from the concurrence of
all other Perfections in him. Hence
his own Word plainly affirms of
him, <hi>that he cannot lye.</hi> And by
common consent it will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48507:68"/>
that he cannot do
any unjust act whatsoever.</p>
               <p>To this I doubt not we may
with as common suffrage (when
the matter is considered) subjoyn,
that <hi>his Wisdom</hi> doth as much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the exercise of his Power, as
<hi>his Righteousnes</hi> or his Truth doth.
And that it may with as much
confidence, and clearnes, be said
and understood, that he cannot
do an <hi>unwise,</hi> or imprudent act as
an <hi>unjust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, That as his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
corresponds to the <hi>Justice of
things,</hi> to be done or not done, so
doth his Wisdom to the <hi>congruity</hi> or
fitnes. So that he cannot do what
it is <hi>unfit</hi> for him to do, because he
is Wise; and because he is most
Perfectly &amp; Infinitely Wise, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
nothing that is <hi>less-fit.</hi> But
whasoever is <hi>fittest,</hi> when a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48507:68"/>
is made between doing
this or that, or between doing and
not doing, <hi>that</hi> the Perfection of
his Nature renders <hi>necessary</hi> to
him, and the opposite part <hi>impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, that this <hi>measure</hi> must
be understood to have a very
large and most general extent
unto all the affairs of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the object it concerns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so very large. We, in our
observation, may take notice, that
fewer qestions can occur concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong,</hi> than
what is <hi>fit,</hi> or <hi>unfit.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
any man may in a moment be
honest, if he have a mind to it;
very few (and that by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience)
can ever attain to be
wise. The things about which
<hi>Justice</hi> is conversant being redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
to certain rules, but <hi>Wisdome</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:48507:69"/>
supposes very general knowledg
of things scarce capable of such
reduction. And is, besides, the
primary reqisite, in any one that

               <p>It is moreover to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that innumerable congruities
lie open to the Infinite Wisdom,
which are never obvious to our
view or thought. As to a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>studied
Scholar, thousands of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
notions, which an illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
person never thought of.
To a practic't Courtier, or well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>educated
Gentleman, many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies
and indecencies in the
matter of <hi>civil behaviour,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
which an unbred rustic
knowes nothing of. And to an
experienced States-man, those
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48507:69"/>
importancies, which never occur
to the thoughts of him who dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follows the plough. What
Government is there that hath
not its <hi>arcana,</hi> profound mysteries
and reasons of State that a vulgar
wit cannot dive into? And from
whence, the account to be given,
why this or that is done or not
done, is not, alwaies, that it
would have been <hi>unjust</hi> it should
be otherwise, but it had been <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent.</hi>
And many things are,
hereupon, judged <hi>necessary</hi> not
from the <hi>exigencie of Justice,</hi> but
<hi>reason of State.</hi> Whereupon, men
of modest and sober minds, that
have had experience of the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of their Governours, and
their happy conduct, thorough a
considerable tract of time; when
they see things done by them, the
leading reasons whereof they do
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48507:70"/>
not understand, and the effect and
success comes not yet in view,
suspend their censure; while as
yet all seems to them obscure,
and wrapt up in clouds and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Yea tho the course that is
taken have, to their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
an ill aspect. Accounting it
becomes them not, to make a
Judgment of things so far above
their reach, and confiding in the
tried wisdom of their Rulers, who,
they believe, see reasons for what
they do, into which they find
themselves unable to penetrate.</p>
               <p>With how much more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss,
and humble veneration,
ought the methods of the Divine
Government to be beheld &amp; ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
upon the certain assurance
we have, that all things therein,
are managed by that VVisdom,
which could never in any thing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48507:70"/>
mistake its way. VVhereas, there
was never any continued admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of human Government,
so accurate and exact, but that, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some tract of time, some or
other errours might be reflected
on therein.</p>
               <p>Again, it may further be said,
without presuming beyond due
bounds, That tho infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities
must be supposed to lye
open to the Divine Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which are concealed from
ours, yet that these two things
in the general are very <hi>manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
congruous</hi> to any sober attentive
Mind, that directly concern, or
may be apply'd to the case, under
our present consideration, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>That the course of God's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
over the VVorld,
be, for the most part, steady,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48507:71"/>
and uniform; not interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by very freqent, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and anomalous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And again,</p>
                  <p>That he use a royal liberty, of
stepping out of his usual
course, sometimes, as he sees
meet.</p>
               </q>
               <p>It cannot but appear to such
as attend, highly incongruous,
should we affirm the <hi>antithesis</hi> to
either of these; or lay down
counter-positions to them, and
suppose the course of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Government to be manag'd
agreeably thereunto.</p>

               <p>For, <hi>as to the former;</hi> what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
would it make in the
World, if there should be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
innovations upon Nature;
continual, or exceeding freqent
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48507:71"/>
impeditions, and restraints of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

the Vertues and proper qali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of things, being never cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
could never be understood,
or known. <hi>In that of Policy,</hi> no
measures, so much as probable,
could ever be taken. How much
better is it, <hi>in both,</hi> that second

inclinations? And why is it not
to be thought congruous, that,
in some degree, things should be
proportionably so, <hi>in the sphere of
Grace?</hi> (whereto by and by we
shall speak more directly.)</p>
               <p>We pray, when our Friends
are sick, for their recovery. What
can be the sober meaning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of such prayers? Not that
God would work a Miracle for
their restitution, (for then we
might as well pray for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48507:72"/>
after death) But, that God
would be pleased so to co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
in the still and silent way of
Nature, with second Causes, and
so bless means, that they may be
recovered, if he see good. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that they, and we may be
prepared to undergo his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
And agreeable hereto ought
to be the intent of our Prayers, in
reference to the public affairs, and
better posture of the World.</p>
               <p>And we may take notice the
Divine Wisdom laies a very great
stress upon this matter, <hi>the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the common order of things;</hi>
and cannot but observe a certain
inflexiblenes of Providence, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
And, that it is very little apt
to divert from its wonted course.
At which weak minds are apt to
take offence. To wonder, that,
against so many prayers and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48507:72"/>
tears, God will let a good man
die; or one whom they love;
Or that a Miracle is not wrought
to prevent their own being
wrong'd at any time; Or, that
the Earth doth not open and
swallow up the person that hath
done them wrong. Are apt to
call for fire from Heaven, upon
them that are otherwise minded,
and do otherwise, than they
would have them. But a Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
person would consider, if
it be so highly reasonable that
my desires should be comply'd
with, so extraordinarily, than
why not all mens? And then
were the VVorld filled with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies
and confusion. The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
would soon be to all,
eqally discernable, and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(as the Heathen Poet takes
notice, Should <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Ear be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48507:73"/>
over-easy) Yea and the impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
were obvious of gratifying
all, because of their many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-desires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for the other,</hi> it were no
less incongruous, if the Supream
Power should so tie its own
hands, and be so astricted to <hi>rules
and methods,</hi> as never to do any
thing extraordinary, upon never
so important occasion. How ill
could the World have wanted
such an effort of Omnipotencie,
as the restriction upon the flames
from destroying <hi>Shadrach, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shach,</hi>
and <hi>Abednego?</hi> Or the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
wrought in our Saviour's
and the next following Daies?
Such things are never done; but
when the all-comprehending
Wisdom sees it <hi>most congruous.</hi> And
that the cause will over-recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
the deflection from the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48507:73"/>
common course. If no such thing
did ever fall out, what a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
were it to mankind, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
into their beleif an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent

Besides that the convincing testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
were wanting, which we

of any particular revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from God, which comes not
within the compass of natures dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
(upon which account, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
it is as apparently necessary
such extraordinary works should
not be over-frequent, for then
they become ordinary, and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to that special end) so that
here the exertions both of the
<hi>ordinate</hi> and <hi>absolute</hi> power God
(as some distinguish) have their so
appropriate, and so visibly apt,
and congruous uses, that they are
discernable to a very ordinary

               <p>Now hereupon we say further,
There is the like congruity, upon

affaires of Grace, There be <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
correspondent.</hi> That, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,

in the use of ordinary means.
And that, sometimes, its sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
shew it self in preventing
exertions. And in working so
heroically, as none have, before
hand, in the neglect of its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
methods, any reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
               <p>And we may fitly add, That
where Sovereignty is pleased
thus to have its exercise and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
it self, It is sufficient
that there be a <hi>general congruity,</hi>
that it do so sometimes, as an
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48507:74"/>

such extraordinary things,</hi> but that
there should be a <hi>particular leading
congruity</hi> or antecedent reason, to
invite these extraordinary opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of grace, to one person more
than another, is not necessary.
But it is most congruous, that,
herein, it be most arbitrary. Most
agreeable to the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of God;
to <hi>the State of Sinful Man,</hi> who
hath infinitely disoblig'd him,
and can deserve nothing from
him; Yea, and even to the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing.</hi> For, where
there is a parity, in any objects
of our own choice, there can be
no leading reason to this, rather
than that. The most prudent
man, that is wont to guide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by never so exquisite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
in his daily actions, where
there is a perfect indifferency,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48507:75"/>
between doing this thing or that,
is not liable to censure, that he is
not able to give a reason why he

               <p>To summe up all, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it obvious to the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

was more congruous the general
course of Gods Government, over

               </p>
               <p>And, howsoever it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unreasonable, to imagine, that
God cannot in any case, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
oversway the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and determine the will of
such a creature, in a way agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
enough to its nature, (tho
we particlarly know not, as we
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48507:76"/>
are not concerned to know, or
curiously to enqire in what way)
And highly reasonable to admit
that in many cases he doth.</p>
               <p>It is notwithstanding manifest,
to any sober reason, that it were
very incongruous, this should be
the ordinary course of his conduct
towards Mankind, or the same
persons at all times.</p>
               <p>That is, that a whole order
of intelligent creatures should be
moved, only by inward impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
That Gods precepts, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and comminations, whereof
their nature is capable, should
be all made impertinencies,
through his constant overpow'r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those that should neglect
them; That the faculties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
men are capable of moral
Government, should be rendered,
<hi>to this purpose,</hi> useless and vain;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48507:76"/>
And that they should be tempted
to expect, to be constantly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
as meer machines, that
know not their own use.</p>
               <p>Nor is it less apprehensible,
how incongruous it were also, on
the other hand, to suppose that
the exteriour frame of Gods Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
should be totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accompanied
with an internal
vital energie; or exclude the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
motions, operations, and
influences, whereof such a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is also fitly capable. Or
that God should have barr'd out
himself, from all inward access
to the spirits of men, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with them. That the
supream universal, <hi>paternal mind</hi>
(as an heathen call'd it) should
have no way for efficacious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications,
to his own ofspring,
when he pleases; that (so unsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48507:77"/>
to sovereignty) he should
have no objects of special favour,
or no peculiar waies of expressing
it.</p>
               <p>It is manifestly congruous
that the divine Government, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
man, should be (as it is) mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or composed of an external
frame of lawes, with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

and an internal effusion of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and vital influence, corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent
to the several parts of
that frame; and which might
animate the whole, and use it,
as instrumental, to the begetting
of correspondent impressions on
mens spirits.</p>
               <p>That this Power be put forth,
not (like that of a natural Agent)
<hi>ad ultimum</hi> (which if we would
suppose the Divine Power to be,
new Worlds must be springing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48507:77"/>
up every moment) but <hi>gradually,</hi>
and with an apt contemperation
to the subject, upon which it is
designed, to have its operations,
and withal, <hi>arbitrarily,</hi> as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Great Agent from
whom it proceeds, and to whom
it, therefore, belongs, to measure
its exertions, as seems meet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him. That it be <hi>constantly</hi> put
forth (tho most gratuitously, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the disobligation of the
Apostacy being considered) upon
all, to that degree, as that they
be enabled to do much good, to

course, tended to render his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
over the world more
<hi>august,</hi> and awful, <hi>for the present,</hi>
and the result, and final issue, of
all things more glorious <hi>at length,</hi>
and were consequently, <hi>more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous;
that</hi> could not be <hi>so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
as to be effectually procured by

               </p>
               <p>For whatsoever obligation

he cannot do, <hi>most wisely</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
That is, which his infinite

               <p>Things cohere, and are held
together, in the course of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation,
by congruities as by

be otherwise. That is, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and taking things together,
especially the most important.
For otherwise, to have been nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
curious about every minute
thing, singly considered, that it
might not possibly have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(as in the frame of this or

disposition, than of true Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>But <hi>To him</hi> whose Being is most

which, all things considered,
would be <hi>simply best, i.e.</hi> most
