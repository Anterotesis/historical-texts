            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue both heard &amp; read oft tymes,
that Bookes and Cheeses may very
well be likened one to the other,
in this poynt: for the diuersitie of
mens iudgementes giuen of them.
For they are wares both, to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
on for loue, and bought for
money. The Cheese once out of the
Presse, shortly after comes to market
to be solde: where (perhaps) it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
of many, before it be bought. And bookes once imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
are presently in shoppes, where many peruse them, ere they
be solde. Nowe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some that haue tasted the Cheese, wil say (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce)
tis too drye: an other wyl say, tis too ful of whaye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
third wyll say, the meate is good, but it is yll handled: the
fourth wil (contrary) say, it lookes better then it is. Come an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
he wyl say, Berlady tis prety good meate. Some wyl say,
It is litle worth: and some wyll say, It is starke naught, but
that is an euyl toungd felow. Some wyl say, Tis Cheese: thats
a blunt whorson. Some wyl say, Twil serue: he is to be borne
withal. Some wyl say, Tis good meate when one is hungry:
he is woorthy to haue a peece of it (if he can get it) when he
hath nothing els to dynner. Some wyl like it very well, and
giue money for it: he is most worthy to haue it, &amp; much good
may it doo hym. And thus of Bookes, and so of this my
booke among others. Some wyl say, It is too dry, it wants the
sap of Sapience, neither hath it yenough of the Runnet of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Some other wyl say, It is too sul of the whay of wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which in wise mens taste, seemes very sowre. Some wyll
say, The inuention is prety, but it is yll pend. Some other wyll
more commend the pennyng, then the matter. Some wyl say,
It is prety Poetrie. Some wyl say, It is meane stuffe. And some
(perhaps) wyl say, It is bald ryme, not worth the reading: but
that is a malicious Lob, for my lyfe. Some wyll say, Tis verse:
he speakes his mynd plainly. Some wyl say, Twil passe for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aetrie:
<pb facs="tcp:4905:3"/>
let hym passe for &amp; cetera. Some wyl say, It is good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to reade, when a man hath nothing els to doo: he may
reade it (if he can come by it) in such idle tyme. Some (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)
wyll prayse it more then it deserues, and geue coyne for
it, rather then goe without it. Such are best woorthy to haue
it: and wel may it like them, when they haue bought it. Well,
such as like it not, I pray you beare a good tongue, and let it
alone, and God be with you. I wish you well, and perhaps
I wyl agaynst the next Terme, prouide you some other
newe ware for your olde golde. Tyll when, and
euer, I wish you all, with my selfe, the grace
of God, and well to fare.</p>

               <lg>
                  <l>The Farmer, he, that newe breakes vp a ground:</l>
                  <l>and dooth not know, what fruit, the soyle will yeelde.</l>
                  <l>The cheapest seede, that (lyghtly) may be found,</l>
                  <l>be (commonly) bestowes vpon that fielde.</l>
                  <l>For tryall, first, as (best for his behoue,)</l>
                  <l>by proofe of that, how better graine wil prooue.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And as I thinke the cheapest kynde of grayne,</l>
                  <l>on newe digd grounde the Farmer can bestowe,</l>
                  <l>Whereof to reape some profit for his payne,</l>
                  <l>are Otes, a grayne which euery man dooth knowe:</l>
                  <l>Which proouing yll, his losse can be but small,</l>
                  <l>if well, such gaynes, as he may lyue withall.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>What sayd I? otes? Why, Otes there are I see,</l>
                  <l>of diuers kyndes, as some are counted wylde:</l>
                  <l>And they are light: and yet with them some be,</l>
                  <l>in steed of better many tymes beguyld.</l>
                  <l>And sure I thinke that wylde lyght kynde of grayne,</l>
                  <l>my selfe haue sowne, within my barren brayne.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But tis no matter, smal hath been my cost:</l>
                  <l>and this is first tyme that I sturd my brayne,</l>
                  <l>Besydes, I haue, but little labour lost,</l>
                  <l>in idle tyme to take a little payne.</l>
                  <l>And though, I loose, both payne, and grayne in deede:</l>
                  <l>my ground, I crowe, will serue for better seede.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For as the Farmer, though his croppe be yll,</l>
                  <l>the seede yet lost will fatten well the grounde.</l>
                  <l>And when he seekes for better grayne to tyll,</l>
                  <l>and sowes good grayne, then is the profit found.</l>
                  <l>For, all the first, that good was, for no grayne,</l>
                  <l>will beare good fruite, but with a little payne.</l>
               </lg>

                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:4905:4"/>
So my rude brayne, that at the fyrst (God wote)</l>
                  <l>was good for naught, no kynd of fruite would yeelde</l>
                  <l>New broken vp, will now yet beare an Ote,</l>
                  <l>and as I hope, wil prooue a prety field:</l>
                  <l>I lyke it tothe better, that I fynd,</l>
                  <l>the Otes so sowne, do not come vp in kynd.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For surely, all the Otes I sowed, were wilde,</l>
                  <l>and light God wote: and cheape, they cost me nought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </l>
                  <l>And now if that I be not much beguild,</l>
                  <l>they prooue good Otes, and will be quickely bought:</l>
                  <l>Mary my croppe I reape is very small,</l>
                  <l>but what is lost, my ground is made withall.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And when I till, and sow a better grayne,</l>
                  <l>mine Otes so lost, I shall not then repent:</l>
                  <l>My profite then, will so requite my payne,</l>
                  <l>as I shall thinke, my labour pretly spent:</l>
                  <l>And eke in time, I hope with taking payne,</l>
                  <l>to make it fit, to beare a right good grayne.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>These Otes (alas) are fonde and foolish toyes,</l>
                  <l>which, often tymes, doo enter in the minde:</l>
                  <l>The thoughtes of which, giue cause of griefe or ioyes,</l>
                  <l>which are so lighte, as turne with euery winde.</l>
                  <l>And, suche wilde Otes, I meane wilde thoughts God knowes,</l>
                  <l>are all the grayne that in my ground now growes.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But yet I see that all the Otes I sowde,</l>
                  <l>I meane the thoughts that enter in my minde,</l>
                  <l>Are not come vp: not halfe of them is showde:</l>
                  <l>and some come vp, are blowen away with wynde.</l>
                  <l>The rest that stand, are such as here you see,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>These thoughts in deede, were causes of such crimes,</l>

Which, as I sat halfe idle many tymes,</l>

                  <l>new nothing is a pleasant prety toy:</l>

               <p>¶An odde gretinge, and as madde a wooing betweene
a clowne of the country, and his sweete harte. Whose
names were Simon and Susan. Simon ouertaking his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
sweete Susan, hauing some former acquaintance
with her, and yet not all so frolyke, as to clappe her on
the lippse in a cold morninge after the country fashion,
wente cunningly as he durst to worke with her: salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her with some friendely speeche, which shee as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly
aunswered. The wordes betweene them were these
that folow: I laught at them hartely when I hearde
them, and I persuade my selfe, that some that reade
this recorde of them, will smyle a litle at it, be they
neuer so solemne. I pende them for myne owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
I hope they will displease none, who lykes not
the reading of it, turne ouer the leafe, and you
shall finde somwhat els to your contentmente. Well, to the
matter, though women are comonly full of toung, and
ready of speeche, yet when they ar wooed, they muste be
firste spoken to, or els they will condemne their woer for
a foole: and therefore Simson hauing on his considering
cappe, although not a man of the greatest capacity, yet as
his audacity serude him, he boldely brake forth into this
salutacion.</p>

                  <l>such cost, as if they lye long sicke, vndooeth many men.</l>

                  <l>First, I gan take long comfites for to tast,</l>
                  <l>and hauing scarcely swallowde downe the same:</l>
                  <l>They brought (me thought) vnto my minde at last,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>The Comfites then I tasted next, were rounde,</l>
                  <l>wherein I found small Coriander seedes,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>These Comfites then did bring vnto my minde,</l>

                  <l>Then next to these, I Ginger Comfites tooke,</l>
                  <l>whose tast did set my mouth all in a heate,</l>
                  <l>These Comfites, like the long Comfites did looke,</l>
                  <l>and as I found, were holsome for to eate:</l>

                  <l>But all was well, for why by Gods good grace,</l>
                  <l>it ceased soone, and as I drewe me nier,</l>
                  <l>So many hands were helping at the same,</l>
                  <l>I saw it nere quite quenched ere I came.</l>
