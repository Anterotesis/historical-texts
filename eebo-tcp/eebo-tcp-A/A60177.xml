         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

great hight, (the ſad effects whereof, he oftentimes
foretold and bemoned) upon the not concurring of his
judgement, in the manner of <hi>Church-Goverment</hi>
with them who were other wayes minded; He was
called to <hi>afflictions</hi> and <hi>ſufferings,</hi> and which he,

2. TIM. 3. 16. yet the Pſalmes among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of ſcripture, have been ever thought
to have a ſpeciall excellencie, <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> in
the 5. Tom. of his works, &amp; 6. Hom. of Repentance; ſaieth,
That this was the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſenſe of Chriſtians in his time: albeit
ſaieth he, <hi>Moſes</hi> was the great Lawgiver &amp; <hi>ſaw God face to face,</hi>
yet ſaieth he, his books are ſcarce read once a yeare. The goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
wherin Chriſts miracles are regiſtrat, wherin we ſee death
deſtroyed, &amp; life reſtored, and God as it were converſing with
men, is read ſaieth hee, but once or twyce a weeke. The <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi>
of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> who was the Orator of Chriſt, who was taken
up to the third heaven, who ſaw things which is not lawfull to
utter, are read ſaieth he, but twice a weeke. But ſaieth he, in
the meane time DAVID is read day and night. All carrie him
about at all times, as a precious and ſweet ſmelling oyntment.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100463:6"/>
If wee abide in the Church all night, David is the firſt, and
the middle, and the laſt with whom wee end. If wee ſing
hymnes to God in the morning, DAVID is the firſt, and the
middle, and the laſt. If wee have pompe at the Funerals of the
dead, DAVID is the firſt, the middle, and the laſt. Even they
that have not letters, have him as it were ingraven in the heart.
Neither is this only in Churches and towns, but in all places &amp;
in all times. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 1. The ſweet ſinger of Iſrael, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veeneth
as as it were the ſervants of God into their ſacred ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
exciteth, inflameth, &amp; ſo adorneth them, that he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
as it were men into Angels, and earth into heaven. Hee
accommodateth himſelf to all ſorts and all eſtates of men, to
the young, to the old, to them that are in joy, to them that ar in
ſorrow, to the righteous, and to the ſinner; That he is as it wer
a divine Harpe, joyning as it were, the ſoules of men together,
to ſing the ſongs of God, in a moſt ſweet and melodious har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.
Such is the excellencie of this part of ſcripture which
wee call the Pſalmes.</p>
            <p>Againe amongſt the Pſalmes,<note place="margin">2. Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of this Pſame.</note> I may juſtlie ſay, That this
whereof I have read a part, hath a ſpeciall ſtamp and degree of
worth. If you looke to the matter, IT is no leſſe then God his
infinite and divine perfections which are declared and praiſed
here throughout the whole Pſalme. If you looke to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of framing this ſong; IT is moſt divine, all is ſet down
here ſo ſweetlie, ſo grauelie, ſo powerfullie. Hence albeit God
be praiſed in many other pſalmes, yet the <hi>Tytle</hi> of this Pſalme
by way of excellencie is DAVID <hi>his praiſe, or his pſalme of praiſe.</hi>
Beſide every verſe beginneth with the letters of the Alphabet
in order. Of which kinde there are no more but ſeven in the
whole book of the Pſalmes, the xxv. the xxxiv. the xxxvi.
the cxi. the cxii. cxix. &amp; this cxLv. which is the laſt of them.</p>
            <p>The matter &amp; argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this pſalme as we ſaid, is the praiſe
of God,<note place="margin">3. Argument of it.</note> &amp; his perfections; his infinite greatnes, infinite power,
infinite mercy, the ſplendor &amp; excellencie of his kingdom, the
righteouſnes and holines which appeares in his ways &amp; works,
and laſtly his wonderfull providence to all, eſpeciallie to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
and moſt ſingularlie to his own people. In the words
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100463:6"/>
that I have read, he ſetteth down his purpoſe to praiſe God in a
poeticall manner, by converting his ſpeech to God, <hi>I will extoll
thee, my God, O King,</hi> &amp;c. There are two things chiefly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
in the words. Firſt, The Perſon whom he intendeth
to praiſe, and a ſhort deſcription of him containing the ground
of all his praiſe, namlie, The <hi>King</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> as he hath manifeſted
himſelf by his NAME. 2. The praiſe which he intendeth of
him, which is not ſimple praiſing, but extolling and bleſſing,
every day, continuallie, for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Let us come firſt to the Perſon praiſed, and to the grounds
of his praiſe.<note place="margin">4. Summe of the words.</note> 1. He calleth him <hi>God,</hi> which importeth. That
he hath in himſelf infinite perfection, and ſo is worthie of all
praiſe. 2. Hee ſaieth, <hi>O King,</hi> which importeth his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
over all creatures, even over himſelf who was a king and
over others. For hee calleth him King abſolutlie, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King of kings, and Lord of lords: Who ruleth all, &amp;
is ruled by none, who doth whatſoever he will both in heaven,
and in earth. And thus alſo he termeth him, to ſignifie that he
was to praiſe him for his Attributs and works belonging to
him as King and Governour of all, eſpecially of his own people.
3. He calleth him his God, to ſignifie that he had intereſt in the
great goodneſſe of God, and that he was to ſpeak what he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
heere, out of the ſenſe of his goodneſſe towards himſelf.
Laſtly, He mentioneth his NAME in the 2. verſ. Which contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
yet a further obliedgement to thankfulneſſe and praiſe, as
wee ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
            <p>IT will not be needfull to ſpeak of God, as he is God &amp; King;
for that which concerneth him this way,<note place="margin">5. Davids applicatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> is ſet down at length
in the Pſalme herafter. We ſhall content our ſelf at this time to
ſpeak a little of this application which DAVID maketh, when
he ſaieth, <hi>My God,</hi> and of his NAME, which he promiſeth to
bleſſe every day. Firſt, Hee ſaieth, <hi>My God,</hi> God as hee is in
himſelf, God infinitlie perfect, and King over all, is moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to be extolled, bleſſed and praiſed, yet this praiſe will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
flow from us ſo kyndlie and ſweetly as it ought to do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we find him to be our God, and to have an intereſt in him
and communion with him as DAVID profeſſeth here. <hi>Thou art
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100463:7"/>
my God,</hi> ſaieth David pſal. cxviii. 28. <hi>and I will praiſe thee: Thou
art my God, I will exalt thee.</hi> It is the common doctrine of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,</hi>
That a man can have no aſſurance of this, that God is
his God, &amp; that he enjoyes his love &amp; favour but by deceivable
conjectures, and they oppoſe both our Divines and their own
men who teach the contrar. But if we had no other ground for
this but conjectures; to how weake a ground (I beſeech you)
ſhould that praiſe, joy &amp; confidence leane; which DAVID pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
here in his own name, and in the name of all the godly.
Suppone there bee infinite goodneſſe and perfection in God as
there is; what ſound or ſolid comfort can I have in God, except
I know him to be mine, and that I have his favour &amp; the light
of his countenance lifted up upon me. Albeit David knew that
his ſinne was pardoned by the voice of <hi>Nathan,</hi> yet had he not
contentment, till he heard God himſelf ſpeake, as it were, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; <hi>Restore unto me the joy of thy ſalvation: and uphold me
with thy free spirit. Make me to beare the voice of joy and gladnes:
that the bones which thou hast broken, may rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O but ſay they, We cannot know aſſuredly that God is ours,
and that wee have his favour, unleſſe wee aſſuredly know that
thoſe graces are in us which he requireth,<note place="margin">6. Certainti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vour poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</note> and this knowledge
cannot be had without revelation. I minde, by Gods grace, to
ſpeak at length of this, when I come to the 16. verſe of the
eight chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> where it is ſaid,
<hi>That the Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſſe with our ſpirit, that wee are
the children of God.</hi> Now ſhortly I ask, what are theſe graces
required in us? The chief are by the conſent of all, <hi>Faith, hope</hi>
and <hi>love.</hi> As for <hi>Faith</hi> it may bee knowne, for S. PAUL ſaieth,
<hi>Prove your ſelves, whether yee bee in the faith.</hi> 2. cor. 13. 5. <hi>S.
Auguſtine</hi> in his 13. book of the Trinitie, 1. chap. ſaieth, <hi>That
hee who beleeveth, knoweth by a moſt firme knowledge that he doeth
beleeve, as hee who beleeveth not, knoweth that he doth not beleeve.</hi>
The reaſon is manifeſt, <hi>Faith,</hi> (ſay our Adverſaries) <hi>is an Act of
the underſtanding, and a man hath certaintie of nothing more then of
ſuch acts.</hi> Beſide, a true Chriſtian is prepared to ſuffer any
thing, rather then to quite his faith, it cannot be therefore but
he is aſſured that he doth beleeve. Laſtly the prime ſchoolmen
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100463:7"/>
ancient &amp; recent grant this. <hi>Thomas</hi> in the 1. of his 2 part. 112.
quaeſt. and 5. art. ſaieth, <hi>That hee who hath ſcience or ſaith know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that he hath it.</hi> So <hi>Vaſquez</hi> in his 201. diſpute, <hi>and diverſe
others.</hi> The ſame alſo he granteth of <hi>Hope,</hi> and if hee would
deny it the ſcripture is cleare, where wee find the ſaints pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
and avowing their hope in God moſt confidently; But
ſay they, yet, for all this wee are uncertain of our <hi>Love.</hi> But
conſider I pray you, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> being demanded by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
concerning his love to him; anſwereth moſt confidently.
<hi>Thou knoweſt that I love thee. Thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt
that I love thee.</hi> So <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in his 8. book of the Trinitie,
7. chap. ſaieth, <hi>That wee more certainlie know the love that we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to our brother, then our brother himſelf.</hi> They anſwere to this,
That wee may know indeed certainly, that there is in us a love
and affection to God and our neighbour: but yet ſay they, we
cannot know for what end, and upon what motive wee love
him, and conſequently whether our love be ſuch as it ought to
be. But they ſhould conſider that the Apoſtle ſaieth 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1. <hi>That the ſpirit of a man knoweth the things of a man, and that
wee haue received the Spirit of God, that we might know the things
that are freely given to us of God.</hi> Hence a moſt learned Romaniſt
<hi>Vega</hi> in his 9. book of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſtificat. 39. chap. granteth, That wee
may know not only our own inward actions, but alſo for what
end and upon what motive they are exerciſed by us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
that we love God above all things: and that wee are
ready to ſuffer the loſſe of all things rather then to offend him,
and that wee have truly ſorrowed for our bypaſt ſinnes.</p>
            <p>But to leave this, let us mark here, That it is not without
great cauſe that DAVID intending to bleſſe &amp; exalt God,<note place="margin">7. This gives confidence.</note> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
particularly this his aſſurance, that God was his God,
&amp; that he had a particular intereſt in him. This, as we touched
before, is a moſt ſingular benefit, from which many excellent
fruits do ſpring. For firſt, hence floweth a boldneſſe toward
God, a boldneſſe to come in his preſence, and a confidence to
be heard of him in our praiers. <hi>If our heart condemne us not, we
haue confidence towards God.</hi> 1. Iohn 3. 21. A ſon that is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of his fathers love, is bold to come, to him, and to preſent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100463:8"/>
his ſutes unto him when occaſion ſerveth: ſo wee being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that God is our God and Father, are confident to poure
out our hearts in his boſome, and to expect a gracious anſwere
from him. <hi>I have written unto you</hi> ſaieth S. Iohn 1. 5. 13. 14. 15.
<hi>that ye may know that ye have eternall life, And this is the confidence
that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he
heareth us. And we know that we have the petitions that we deſired
of him.</hi> Where firſt, wee have the knowledge of eternall life,
then, confidence to be heard, &amp; to have our petitions granted.
If wee have to do with a man of whom wee know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he loveth us or not, we can have but ſmall hope to obtain
our ſutes from him: but if wee be aſſured that we have his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
wee are confident to obtaine our requeſts according to
that degree of favour which we perſwade our ſelves to enjoy:
ſo if we be perſwaded that God is our God and Father, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doubt of obtaining from him that which is good. <hi>If ye that
are evill can give good things to your children, how much more will
your heavenly Father give his good Spirit and all good things to them
that ask him. He that gave to us his own Son (when we did not pray to
him) how much more with him will he give to us all things which wee
pray for?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This aſſurance that God is our God, and that we
are in his favour,<note place="margin">8. Alacritie in GODS ſervice.</note> maketh us to go on cheerfully in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of God. It enlargeth our heart with comfort, ſo that
<hi>wee runne the way of Gods Commandements.</hi> There is nothing that
will make a good ſervant cheerfull in doing his Maſters will,
ſo much as to know that himſelf and his ſervice is well accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
ſo nothing more fit to ſtirre us up to alacritie in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then to know that our perſons and works are acceptable
to God. This is a notable ſpurre to a good life, <hi>Hee that hath
this hope purgeth himſelf, that he may be holy as God is holy</hi> ſaieth
S. Iohn. <hi>I have hope towards God, of the reſurrection of the juſt and
unjuſt,</hi> ſaieth S. PAUL <hi>Acts 24. 16. And herein do I exerciſe my ſelf
to have alwayes a conſcience void of offence toward God, and toward
men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">9. Peace in troubles.</note> This aſſurance that God is ours, and that we have his
love; breedeth to us peace that paſſeth underſtanding and joy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100463:8"/>
unſpeakable and glorious even amidſt all our worldly troubles,
<hi>S. Paul</hi> having ſaid, <hi>Rom. 5. 1. being justified by faith wee have
peace with God,</hi> ſubjoyneth, <hi>That we rejoyce in the hope of the glory
of God, and that wee rejoyce alſo in our tribulations.</hi> For being at
one with God, <hi>the peace of God keepeth our mindes,</hi> Philip. 4. 7.
It guardeth and defendeth them, as a wall or garriſon (ſo the
word ſignifieth) It guardeth I ſay, not only our bodies or eſtats
always: but alſo our minds, that we ſink not through the weight
of our afflictions, nor fall away from our ſtedfaſtneſſe by any
croſſes. For he that is in this eſtate can reaſon thus; Though my
wealth and preferment be taken away, though my friends have
forſaken mee, though want and troubles ſeaſe upon mee; Yet
Chriſt is mine, God is mine, heaven and the inheritance of the
joyes of it is mine. Theſe outward troubles can do no more but
batter without, and at the moſt pull down the earthly houſe of
this bodie, but <hi>That building which is without hands in heaven,</hi>
they cannot reach unto. Theſe troubles may take away my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
joyes, but that joy which is within, which is in God even
my God, is beyond the power of <hi>Life or death, of height or depth,
of principalities or powers, of things preſent or things to come,</hi> Rom.
8. 38. This comforted <hi>Iob</hi> in the midſt of all his grievous ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes;
<hi>I know</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>that my Redeemer liveth, and that with
mine eyes I ſhall ſee him.</hi> This comforted the godly <hi>Hebrews</hi>
chap. 10. 34. <hi>Yee took joyfullie the ſpoiling of your goods, knowing in
your ſelves that ye haue in heaven a better and an enduring ſubſtance.</hi>
Hence, hope which is grounded upon this aſſurance, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to an Anchor, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19. An Anchor holdeth the ſhip
firme and ſtable, that it be not driven hither and thither or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed,
although the ſea bee ſtormie and tempeſtuous;
even ſo our hope ſetleth our ſoules in the midſt of tribulations,
that wee bee not ſwallowed up thereby So it is compared to an
helmet 11. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 8. For as an helmet ſecuring the head, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
courage in a Souldier to fight, ſo <hi>hope</hi> ſecuring us of the
maine point <hi>our eternall ſafety,</hi> giveth courage and confidence
to us in all our troubles. I come now to <hi>David</hi> his laſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>that,</hi> which he intendeth to praiſe and bleſſe; That is the
<hi>Name</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:100463:9"/>
I <hi>will bleſſe thy Name</hi> ſaieth hee. IT is not without great
cauſe that he mentioneth here the NAME of God. For clearing
of this, wee ſhall ſhew you ſhortly, firſt, what is meaned by his
Name.<note place="margin">10. Gods name what</note> 2. How great a ground this is to us of praiſe and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
For the firſt, A name properlie is not the thing it ſelf
which is named, but is without it, ſignifying repreſenting and
manifeſting it. Now God who in himſelf is hid, cannot be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
to us but by his works and word whereby we attaine
to the knowledge of him, &amp; that knowledge of him, or rather
himſelf or his divine perfections as they are made known and
diſcovered to us is called his Name. When he doth the works
of Almightie power, wee call him Omnipotent; When he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the works of Iuſtice, wiſdom, goodnes, &amp;c. wee call him
juſt, wiſe, good &amp;c. And of all theſe is made up his dreadfull,
glorious and bleſſed Name which he hath amongſt men. So
that the Name which God hath amongſt us lyeth firſt inwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in his works, and from thence by the knowledge and due
eſteeme of them is convoyed to our hearts, whence againe it is
publiſhed and proclaimed everiewhere. To this purpoſe the
Lord being to declare his Name to Moſes <hi>Exod. 34. 6. The
LORD, The LORD GOD, mercifull &amp; gracious, long ſuffering,
and aboundant in goodneſſe and truth. Keeping mercie for thouſands,
forgiving iniquity, and tranſgreſſion, and ſin,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the Name
of Chriſt Ieſus in whom God was reconciling the world to
himſelf, is called <hi>Iſai. 9. 6. Wonderfull, Counſellour, the mighty
God,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23. 6. his name is called IEHOVA, <hi>The Lord
our Righteouſneſſe.</hi> Let us now come to the ſecond point, and
conſider how great a ground, of comfort and praiſe this Name
is.</p>
            <p>Firſt it is ſo great a ground of comfort and conſequently of
praiſe, that no grace is beſtowed upon us, nor promiſe of it
made unto us, but for this Names ſake. The Name of God is
the originall, root and ſpring, out of which all flow, and into
which all are reſolved; It is of his goodneſſe &amp; mercie (which
is his Name) that he promiſeth any thing to us, and it is of his
trueth and power (which alſo belong unto his Name) that
theſe promiſes are accompliſhed, Hence DAVID Pſal. 25. IT
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100463:9"/>
               <hi>For thy Names ſake O Lord, pardon mine iniquity for it is great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As wee can have no good, but for and through
his Name; ſo in it and by it, all goodneſſe is to be had. There is
in it,<note place="margin">12. All Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in it.</note> infinite ſufficiencie of comfort againſt all our diſtreſſes,
wants and temptations, if wee know it, beleeve in it, and call
upon it. Are thou perplexed with thy ſinnes? look upon the
Name of God <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. This is a part of it, <hi>The Lord God merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
Hee is the <hi>Lord God,</hi> and therefore able to forgive. Hee is
<hi>Mercifull,</hi> &amp; therfore willing. But it may be thou will ſay, thy
ſinnes have made thee moſt unworthy of any favour. Looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
upon his Name. <hi>Hee is Gracious, and aboundant in goodnes</hi>
ſaieth it. Thy ſinnes do not ſo abound, but his grace &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſuperabound. If thou ſay, thou haſt continued long in ſin
and often relapſed. Look to his Name, there is comfort in it
againſt this alſo. <hi>Hee is long-ſuffering and ſlow to wrath.</hi> In a
word, whatſoever be the heinouſneſſe of thy ſinnes, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the circumſtances, yet there is comfort in his Name, and
a ground of the hope of pardon, for his Name beareth, That
he keepeth mercy beſide him, as it were in treaſure; <hi>forgiving
iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin.</hi> Needeſt thou refreſhment aſ well
as pardon? Look to his Name, as it is elſwhere deſcrived; <hi>Hee is
the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, Who comforteth us
in all our tribulations.</hi> Would thou have peace? <hi>The God of peace</hi>
is his name alſo. Would thou have grace to heale thy corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
<hi>Hee is the God of all grace.</hi> Would thou have wiſdome
to direct thee? <hi>Hee is the Father of Lights.</hi> All this belongeth
to his Name.</p>
            <p>In likemanner if wee look to the Name of Chriſt,<note place="margin">13 Comfort in Chriſts Name.</note> in whom
and for whoſe ſake, all good is beſtowed upon us by God, wee
ſhall find all manner of comforts. His Name is, <hi>The Prince of
peace:</hi> and according to it, able to give us tranquillity in all out
troubles. His Name is the <hi>mighty God,</hi> &amp; accordingly <hi>He is able
to ſave us to the uttermoſt,</hi> though there be nothing but troubls
without, and terrours within. Would thou have his Image re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
in thee? Hee is the <hi>Everlasting Father,</hi> A Father to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
his <hi>Likeneſſe</hi> in us, and Everlaſting to preſerve it in us. To
give us wiſdome, he is the <hi>Counſellour,</hi> and he is <hi>Wonderfull,</hi> to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100463:10"/>
work in us and for us, beyond all that we can ask or think, even
to wonderment and admiration. And if our ſinnes diſquiet us,
Hee is IEHOVA, <hi>our Righteouſneſſe.</hi> The righteouſneſſe that is in
him, is ours, aſwel ours to ſave us truſting in him, as his to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
him.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, what matter of unſpeakable comfort we have in
the name of God, as he is God, &amp; as he is the father of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">14. This up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth us whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other comforts faile.</note> and in him our Father. When all other comforts
faile us, yet in this Name comfort is to be found. IT falleth
out ſomtimes with the godly, that they are not ſenſible of that
former comfort of the aſſurance of Gods favour; They cannot
bee perſwaded of it, neither of the truth and ſinceritie of the
graces of God in them, they find not that delyte which before
they had in prayer or in other meanes; yet when all failleth, we
find <hi>the Name of the Lord, to be a ſtrong Tower:</hi> Proverb. 18. 10.
<hi>and the Righteous flee to it and are ſaved.</hi> Yee know the uſe of a
Tower is that when all other fortifications are taken and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken,
when the wals are ſcaled and houſes left, men flee to
it, as to the laſt refuge: ſo when wee are beleggered with
troubles without and terrours within: when wee are forced to
quite all other holds &amp; grounds of comfort, yet have we Gods
Name to flee unto, as to a ſtrong Tower. Whatſoever be our
diſtreſſe, we may ſay to him, <hi>O Lord, there is mercy &amp; power with
thee,</hi> that is thy Name. <hi>In Ieſus there is Righteouſneſſe, even our
righteouſneſſe:</hi> that is his Name; And thou haſt commanded us
to call on thy Name in the time of our trouble. To this Altar I
flee. I take hold on the hornes of it, &amp; if I periſh, here will I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.
So yee ſee the Name of God, is a moſt ſoveraigne ground
of comfort. Whence DAVID ſaieth to God <hi>Pſal. 9. 10. They that
know thy Name, will put their truſt in thee.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi>
10. 13. out of the PROPHET, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call on the name of
the Lord ſhall the ſaved.</hi> Great reaſon therfore have we to praiſe
&amp; bleſſe it, and that for ever and ever. This much of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of DAVIDS praiſe: wee come now to the praiſe it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Hee is not content to ſay ſimply that he will praiſe God, but
uſeth ſundry pregnant words to this purpoſe, to ſignify the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie
and fervencie of his deſire to honour God. Firſt he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100463:10"/>
ſaieth, <hi>I will extoll thee or exalt thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">15. Exalting what.</note> Wee cannot exalt God by
making him higher, for he is moſt high: and we are low and
baſe. There can be no acceſsion to his Higneſſe, and though
there could, yet cannot we contribute to it. We are ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
him in that ſenſe, that we are ſaid to magnifie, glorifie and
ſanctifie him. This we do by acknowledging, proclaiming, &amp;
worſhipping his <hi>Greatneſſe, Glory</hi> &amp; <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> So we exalt him
when wee acknowledge his infinite <hi>Highneſſe</hi> and <hi>Excellencie,</hi>
when we moſt highly eſteeme of it, moſt highly love it, and
moſt humbly ſubmitt our ſelves unto it. Thus, <hi>I will extoll thee,</hi>
is as if hee had ſaid, I will moſt highly praiſe thee, reverentlie
worſhip thee, magnificently proclaime and incomparably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thy <hi>Highneſſe</hi> and <hi>Excellencie</hi> to all others.</p>
            <p>Secondly he ſaieth,<note place="margin">16. Bleſſing what.</note> 
               <hi>He will bleſſe Him and his Name.</hi> BLES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SING
is a wiſhing of good to another, and the beſtowing and
conferring of it, when it lyeth in our power. IT comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
two acts: the one of the <hi>Will,</hi> the other of the <hi>Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi>
By the firſt, wee wiſh or will good, by the other we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
it, and ſo it is a practicall kinde of ſpeech. This <hi>Bleſsing</hi> as
it proceedeth from God, is ever effectuall. If he ſpeak good to
us, it is done: his word is able to do, whatſoever he willeth: As
when a King hath the honours of a kingdom in his own hand,
If he ſay to one, be thou a <hi>Duke,</hi> to another, be thou an <hi>Earl,</hi> it
is ſo, by vertue of this his ſpeech, theſe honours are conferred.
But it is not ſo with our bleſſing, eſpecially of God. His good
is either inward or outward; as for his inward good, it is in
himſelf, in infinite perfection. Hee laiketh nothing, nor can
wee contribute any thing in that kinde. All that wee can do
in reſpect of this good, is to congratulate and expreſſe our joy
at this, that he poſſeſſeth in himſelf all good. As for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
good which belongeth to him, namlie the <hi>knowledge,</hi> the
<hi>love,</hi> the <hi>feare</hi> and <hi>worſhip</hi> of his Name, unto that we may and
ought to contribute by his grace. Wee ſhould not only wish
that good, but ſo much as lyeth in us ſhould endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it. Thus when DAVID promiſeth to bleſſe him and his
Name, he meaneth that he wiſhed all to know, to feare, to love
him, and that hee would to the uttermoſt endeavour to effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuat

what he wiſhed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">17. Praiſing what.</note> Hee promiſeth to <hi>praiſe Him.</hi> PRAISE is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
of the excellencie that is in any by reaſon of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and worthie deeds. So God is often praiſed for his acts
of <hi>mercie juſtice</hi> and <hi>power. The excellencie that is in any by nature,
is rather honoured then praiſed,</hi> ſaieth the Philoſopher: yet often
men are praiſed for naturall excellencies, as <hi>engyne, beauty,
ſtrength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp;c. And God here and often elſwhere in ſcripture, is
praiſed for his Naturall excellencies, <hi>Infinite greatnes, goodnes,
power, mercie,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, DAVID promiſeth thus to exalt, praiſe and bleſſe God
and his Name <hi>Every day, for ever and ever.</hi> He will beginne it
now, but is never to end it. So long as hee lived hee did praiſe
him, and now being dead doeth praiſe him on earth, by this &amp;
other ſongs of praiſe;<note place="margin">18. God ſhould be praiſed in al eſtats</note> and in heaven doeth and ſhall for ever
bleſſe him. Beſide this he promiſeth to do it without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>Every day</hi> ſaieth he, which ſignifieth, that nothing ſhould
befall, no change, no trouble that ſhould divert him from this
exerciſe. Whence we may learne this profitable inſtruction,
that it is our duty in every eſtate, whatſomever befall us, to
praiſe and bleſſe God. No trouble or temptation ſhould make
the praiſe or bleſſing of him to depart from our mouth, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhould make our courage to quaile, our patience to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
our tranquillitie to ceaſe or ſtay the lifting up of our hearts,
to bleſſe his holy Name. For this ſhould be done by us every
day, and at all times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 1. Thou ſhould bleſſe him in the
day of thy ſickneſſe, aſwell as in the day of thy health, in the
day of thy want, aſwell as in the day of thy aboundance, in the
day of deſolation, aſwel as in the day of conſolation, in the day
of adverſitie, aſwel as in the day of proſperitie. <hi>What great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is it,</hi> ſaieth holy AUGUSTINE upon this place, <hi>that thou bleſſes
God in thy joyfull day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when all things flow to thee according to thy
heart? What if a ſorrowfull and melancholious day appeare? will
thou not bleſſe him then alſo? If thou will not, thou did not truly ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Every day will I bleſſe thee.</hi> How many and how grievous
evils came upon <hi>Iob,</hi> and that how ſuddenlie? yet did hee
not intermitt the praiſing of God in that his moſt ſorrowfull
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100463:11"/>
day. When all the evill tydings had come unto him, hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped
and ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath given, &amp; the Lord hath taken, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be the Name of the Lord.</hi> Thus ought we all to do, and the
reaſons are manifeſt.</p>
            <p>For firſt,<note place="margin">19. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> If God be thy God, then thy heart is upon him, &amp;
thou places in him, thy ſoveraigne good, which is to be found
in him alone. Now no croſſe or trouble can bereave thee of
him, unleſſe thou thy ſelf forſake him. <hi>Iob</hi> his hudge wealth
was taken away, and his children, for whom he keeped it, were
taken away: but God who gave the one and the other, and was
able to reſtore that and infinitly more, could not be taken from
him. Thus the day of worldlie ſorrow cannot take our God
from us, and ſo we have the ground and matter of our true and
chief joy, and conſequently have reaſon ſtill to bleſſe him. 2.
Whatſomever God doeth to his own, he doeth it for the beſt.
He maketh all their ſorrows and troubles to work for their
good, yea oftentimes promoveth their good by <hi>ſickneſſe, want,</hi> &amp;
<hi>adverſitie,</hi> more then it ſhould have been advanced by <hi>health, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance,</hi>
&amp; <hi>proſperity.</hi> LAZAR us ſores &amp; poverty wer more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to him, then all the wealth &amp; dainties of the Rich-man
were to him. Both found it to be ſo in end, when the Rich-man
was laid in flames of fire, &amp; was faine to beg one drop of water,
which yet he could not have, and when <hi>Lazarus</hi> was carried
by the angels into the boſome of ABRAHAM. Wee may not
judge of theſe outward evils by our own ſenſe, but by the <hi>word,
wiſdome, goodnes</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of God, which maketh them all to
ſerve to our good. Now if it be ſo, we have reaſon in the midſt
of all our worldlie ſorrowes to bleſſe and to praiſe the Name of
our God. Happy is he that can do ſo, this is a moſt happy &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way, by which a man may go through all the ſorrows of this
life to heaven, rejoycing and exulting. The Lord grant that we
may ſo do, &amp; that for the merits of Chriſt Ieſus, to whom &amp;c.</p>

            <p>THe holy Prophet having ſet down his purpoſe of extolling
and praiſing God in the two firſt verſes; he now entereth
into the praiſe intended by him, and in a moſt divine manner
declareth and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth the chief of his divine perfections.
IT is marked by holy <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his Preface on this Pſalme,
That God is both the <hi>Object</hi> and the <hi>Authour</hi> of the praiſe that
is here ſet down.<note place="margin">God prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> God is commended and praiſed here, and it
is God who praiſeth himſelf. DAVID was but the Inſtrument
and Pen-man of the Spirit, by whoſe inſtinct and endytment
he uttereth this praiſe of him. Neither ſhould it ſeeme ſtrange,
that God doth praiſe himſelf. It is otherwayes with God then
with man. It is arrogancie in man to praiſe himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ſaid, PROVERB. 27. 2. <hi>Let another man praiſe thee, and
not thine own mouth, a ſtranger and not thine own lips.</hi> But for God
to praiſe himself, it is a ſingular work of mercie: For firſt, by
praiſing himſelf, he inſtructeth us, how we ſhould praiſe him,
2. By ſetting forth his own praiſes, he repreſenteth to us his
<hi>Excellencie</hi> &amp; the lovelineſſe thereof, that we may be inflamed
with his love, wherein our happineſſe conſiſteth. Let us now
come to the words</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great is the Lord, and greatlie to be praiſed</hi> &amp;c. The PROPHET
beginneth his praiſe of God,<note place="margin">2. Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods greatneſſe the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his praiſe.</note> at the conſideration of his <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
and not without cauſe. Wee can never praiſe God aright,
till we have ſome apprehenſion of his <hi>Greatneſſe.</hi> But when we
look upon it, and thereby are brought into admiration and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment,
our praiſe, extolling and bleſſing of him, floweth
kyndly as it were, from this fountaine. And thus in generall;
The meaning of DAVIDS words is; <hi>O my God, who art the
King of kings,</hi> I ſaid, <hi>That I would extoll, and bleſſe and praiſe
thee, and that Every day, and for ever and ever.</hi> And good
reaſon have I ſo to do; for <hi>Great art thou, even above all,</hi> and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100463:12"/>
therfore, thou deſerveth to be praiſed greatly &amp; above all; yea
<hi>Thy greatneſſe is unſearchable,</hi> or <hi>without end,</hi> and therefore thy
praiſes ſhould be without end or bound.</p>
            <p>In the words <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee have two things particularly to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
Firſt the <hi>Perfection</hi> of God, which DAVID commendeth.<note place="margin">3. Diviſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the words.</note>
2. The <hi>Duty</hi> whereunto wee are oblieged by reaſon of that
perfection. The <hi>Perfection</hi> of God commended heere, is his
<hi>Greatneſſe,</hi> which firſt is ſimplie ſet down; <hi>Great is the Lord,</hi> and
thereafter, is more particularlie deſcrived, namelie that his
<hi>Greatneſſe</hi> is ſuch that it is <hi>unſearchable</hi> or <hi>incomprehenſible.</hi> The
<hi>Duty</hi> which we owe to God, by reaſon of this his perfection
is <hi>Praiſe,</hi> and that in the higheſt degree, under which many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
duties are comprehended; <hi>Great is the Lord</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>&amp;


greatly to be praiſed.</hi> Before we enter into the matter, it is to be
obſerved that the laſt words are diverſlie rendred. Our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
render them, <hi>His greatneſſe is unſearchable:</hi> and upon the
margine, <hi>Of his greatneſſe there is no ſearch:</hi> The ſeventie and
vulgar latine render them thus, <hi>Of his greatneſſe there is no end.</hi>
but both come to one purpoſe. Gods <hi>greatneſſe</hi> is truly <hi>unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
as we ſhall hereafter heare, and the <hi>word</hi> in the the original
properlie ſignifieth ſo much. Hence in the 40 of <hi>Iſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ah,</hi> where
it is ſaid <hi>That his underſtanding is unſearchable,</hi> yee have the ſame
<hi>word</hi> that is uſed here. Upon the other part, the reaſon why
the <hi>Greatneſſe</hi> of God is <hi>unſearchable</hi> is this, namely that
it hath no end, no bounds or limits: Therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee ſearched into or comprehended: and ſo both the
expoſitions do well agree, both with the words and amongſt
themſelves.</p>
            <p>For clearing of this point the better, and that we may make
our uſe of it more fruitfullie, wee ſhall conſider firſt,<note place="margin">4 Points to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> What is
this <hi>unſearchable greatneſſe</hi> of God, where of the PROPHET ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.
2. Wee ſhall ſhew you that it is in him. 3. We ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
more particularlie <hi>what things</hi> belong to it. And 4. How
truly, in reſpect of theſe thing, it is called <hi>unſearchable</hi> As for
the firſt, It is certaine the <hi>Greatneſſe</hi> here ſpoken of, is not the
greatnes of bodily quantity. That is not in God nor is it of it
ſelf the <hi>object</hi> of praiſe: ſo out of all doubt the <hi>Greatneſſe</hi> here
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100463:13"/>
ſpoken of is the greatneſſe of <hi>perfection,</hi> which the PROPHET
not only aſcriveth to God, but alſo in the higheſt degree, while
as he ſaieth, That it is ſuch a <hi>greatneſſe</hi> that cannot be ſearched
into, and conſequently hath no end, or bounds or limits, but is
boundleſſe and infinite.</p>
            <p>Neither is this <hi>greatnes</hi> of God infinite or boundles onlie in
ſome reſpect, but alſo every way. A thing may be ſaid to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
two ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ways.<note place="margin">5. Infinitnes what.</note> Firſt, becauſe in reſpect of ſome thing
or other it is unbounded or unlimited. This way a <hi>line,</hi> if drawn
out in length without end, ſhould be infinite, namely in reſpect
of length: ſo the <hi>Merite</hi> of Chriſt in reſpect of worth &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is infinite, for ther is not, nor can be any merite in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſo great, but the <hi>Merite</hi> of Chriſt, in worth doth infinitlie
exceed it: and that becauſe he is not only Man but alſo God to
whom it belongeth. 2. A thing may be ſaid to be <hi>Infinite,</hi> not
in this or that reſpect, but every way, as containing in it ſelf
the whole fullneſſe of <hi>being</hi> or <hi>perfection,</hi> that is or can be: and
that in the moſt eminent or excellent manner. Thus God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
and this infinitneſſe is his <hi>greatneſſe,</hi> whereof the PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHET
ſaieth here, that it is <hi>unſearchable,</hi> or that it hath no limits
or bounds. Thus much ſhortly of the firſt point; I come now
to the ſecond, to ſhew you, that this abſolute <hi>Infinitneſſe</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
and unlimited <hi>greatneſſe,</hi> is in God.</p>
            <p>This is cleare both by the light of nature, and by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Firſt, by the light of nature, by which we know that God
is the firſt and independent <hi>Being,</hi>
               <note place="margin">6. It is in God.</note> who hath his <hi>Being</hi> from
none, and giveth being unto all things. Now if it be ſo, (which
if it were not, there ſhould bee nothing at all: for wee muſt
come to <hi>One firſt,</hi> and <hi>pryme Beginning;</hi> which giveth being to
all other things) The <hi>Being</hi> of God cannot bee any wayes
bounded or limited. Firſt, becauſe there was none to bound or
limite him; The creatures are bounded and limited, becauſe
they are and do depend from one, who hath ſet to every one
his bounds; but he that is the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>pryme Being,</hi> could have
none to limite or determine him. 2. If the <hi>Perfection</hi> of God
had any bounds or limits, then ſomething might be added to
him, and if he be capable of any addition or increaſe, then ther
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100463:13"/>
moſt bee ſome one prior or ſuperior, who may adde unto or
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ugment his perfection, and conſequently the firſt &amp; ſupreame
<hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng,</hi> ſhould not be the firſt and ſupreame; but in ſome reſpect
dependent from another, which implyeth a manifeſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
Thus the light of nature leadeth us to the infinitneſſe
of God. By the light of ſcripture this is alſo manifeſt, for
beſide this &amp; many other like places, the Lord deſcriving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
to his ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 3. 14. taketh the name of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to himſelf, as proper and peculiar to him; <hi>Thus ſhalt thou ſay
to the children of Iſrael,</hi> ſaieth the Lord, (<hi>I AM) hath ſent mee
unto you.</hi> by which name he ſignifieth, that he is alone of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
whereas all other things of themſelves are not. That he is
fullie, containing in himſelf the amplitude of al that is, or hath,
or can have any being, that he is eternally and unchangably.
So being that he cannot ceaſe to be at all, or to be what he is,
and in a word, that he is <hi>Being</hi> it ſelf, the unbounded <hi>Ocean</hi> of
being: from which all <hi>being</hi> fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>weth and dependeth, whence
<hi>S. Paull,</hi> out of the poet ſaieth, <hi>That in him we live, move, &amp; have
our being;</hi> ſo then the <hi>Being</hi> of God both by the light of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and nature is ſuch as excludeth, not <hi>being</hi> infinitly: which
therefore hath not nor can have any place in him. IT is not ſo
with the creatures; They are of themſelves nothing; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of themſelves, they tend to nothing, and while they are,
bounded and limited within ſome one kind of being, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which they are not. But ſo it is not with him whoſe <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
hath no end or bounds, which the PROPHET here aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to God. Now let us in the third place, ſee more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
what belongeth to this infinite and unbounded <hi>greatneſſe</hi>
of God.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that belongeth to him,<note place="margin">7. All perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ar in him.</note> by reaſon of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<hi>Greatneſſe,</hi> is that hee comprehendeth in himſelf all kinde
of being and perfection that either is or is poſſible, created or
increa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed. There is no good in man, or angels, in earth or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
no j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y or bleſſe, no goodnes or beautie, &amp;c. which is not
in him. If it he in the creatures, it muſt needs be in him; <hi>Shall
not hee ſee, who made the eye,</hi> or <hi>ſhall not hee heare, who made the
eare.</hi> There is no perfection in the creature, which is not the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100463:14"/>
expreſſion of his eternall conception, and a footſtep o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of that perfection which is in him. In like manner, that
is nothing or perfection poſſible which is not in him. If any
ſuch thing or perfection be poſſible, it muſt needs be in him by
whom alone it can be brought forth and made actually to bee:
for if hee have it not himſelf, how can he give it unto others?
So then name or conceive what perfection you will, <hi>Senſe, Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Vnderstanding, goodnes, Beauty, Wiſdom, Mercie, Power, Truth,</hi> &amp;c.
it is in him, yea infinitly more perfections are in him then wee
can conceive, even all that are or any way can be. This is the
firſt thing which belongeth to his infinite <hi>Greatneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is,<note place="margin">8. In the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fection.</note> That all the kindes of being or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
are in him in the higheſt degree of perfection and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
that can be. As all things are in him: ſo there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in him according to that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in which
we perceive by our ſenſe or conceive by our minde. Look unto
things ſenſible, to the heavens, to the earth, or to any thing
that is therein, there is nothing like to him. <hi>To whom will yet
liken God, and what likneſſe will ye compare unto him?</hi> Iſai. 40. 18.
There is <hi>Beauty</hi> indeed in him, but not ſuch a beauty as we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in things bodily: but a beauty which the angels ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.
There is <hi>Light</hi> in him, but not ſuch a light as is in the
ſun or the ſtartes; he dwelleth in light that cannot be approac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed
unto, which no man hath ſeen or can ſee. There is <hi>Sweetnes</hi>
in him, but not ſuch as is in meat or drink or any ſuch like thing:
but a ſweetnes which exceedeth the capacity of al other things.
Hence holy AUGUST. in his 10. book of the city of God, and 6.
chap. ſaieth, <hi>what do I love when I love my God? Not the beauty of
bodies nor of bodily ſound, or ſmell, or ſweetnes: &amp; yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I love him,
I love a certain light, &amp; voice, &amp; ſmell &amp; food &amp; embracement; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the light, &amp; voice, &amp; ſmell, &amp; food, &amp; embracement of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man; wher that ſhyneth to my ſoul which place ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend,
&amp; that ſoundeth which time taketh not away, &amp; that ſmelleth, which
no blaſt can diſſipate,</hi> &amp;c. And again look to the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which
our minds conceive; theſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not in God as conceived by us. For
example, Neither <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> nor <hi>juſtice</hi> nor <hi>wiſdome</hi> nor <hi>mercie
nor truth,</hi> at in him as we conceive them: we conceive them but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100463:14"/>
imperfectly, and ſo they are not in him, as they are conceived
by us, they are finite and bounded, and diſtinct one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
but ſo in him they are not. So if wee would conceive
God and his <hi>greatneſſe</hi> aright; wee muſt not only tranſcend our
ſenſe, but alſo all the imaginations and thoughts of our minde:
and muſt conſider, that he is infinitly more high and excellent
and all that is in him, then all that we can conceive or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.
His <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as I ſaid is not as ours, but of a boundles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
It containeth all the kinds, degrees and meaſures of
wiſdome, that is or is poſſible, and extendeth it ſelf to all that
can be underſtood, that actuallie is or is not, preſent, bypaſt &amp;
to come. His <hi>Beauty</hi> in likemanner, comprehendeth all kinds
and degrees of beauty bodily or ſpirituall, that are or can bee,
and in a manner infinitly more perfect then wee can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
So it is with his <hi>Goodneſſe, Power,</hi> &amp;c. This is the ſecond
thing that belongeth to his infinite <hi>greatneſſe,</hi> namlie that hee
hath in himſelf, all perfections in the higheſt degree of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie.</p>
            <p>The third thing is,<note place="margin">9. In a most perfect u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</note> That he hath all theſe his perfections joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the moſt perfect manner, namlie in a moſt perfect <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
and <hi>ſimplicity.</hi> His perfections are not in him, as ours in us.
Our perfections are diſtinguiſhed one from another, but it is
not ſo in him. By his moſt ſimple nature and eſſence, as hee is
God: ſo hee is <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Juſt,</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenz,</hi>
&amp;c. each of theſe perfections including other, as they are
in him: for they are one and the ſame with his own Eſſence.
God, ſaieth holy <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 6. book of the Trinitie and 7.
chap. is called <hi>Great,</hi> and <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>True: but wee may not think
that his Greatneſſe is another thing then his Wiſdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that his
Wiſdome is another thing then his Goodneſſe and Truth, or that his

then nothing, and vanitie.</hi> If yee would compare the hudge <hi>Ocean</hi>
with a ſmall drop of water taken out of it, yee would think
there were a great diſtance betwixt them, and yet far greater
diſtance is there, betwixt this great God, and all the creatures
that are or are poſſible. That drop of water, is of that ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the reſt of the water of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> but the perfections
of the creatures, are not of that kinde with that which is in
God, as we have ſhowen. That drop of water, little as it is, was
a part of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> but the perfections of the creatures, ar no
part of God. 3. If many drops were added to that one drop, it
might at laſt equall the whole <hi>Ocean,</hi> but adde whatſoever ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

can conceive, to the goodnes, to the power, to the wiſdom, &amp;c.
that is in the creatures, they can never equall the <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> or
<hi>Wiſdome,</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> that is in God. So his <hi>Greatneſſe</hi> is infinitly

ſhould be incloſed, as it were, within the compaſſe of our
mindes, which cannot be, except our underſtanding and ſight
were infinite. Hence, by the way, we may learne that we ſhould
not curiouſly pry into his nature, decrees &amp; counſels, which are
unſearchable as himſelf is. It becometh us to praiſe him that
he hath revealed and manifeſted himſelf to us ſo far forth as he
knoweth to be fit for his own glory and our ſalvation, and ſo
much the rather, that he hath ſent his own Son for this effect.
<hi>God hath no man ſeen at any time;</hi> Ioh. 1. 18. <hi>but the only begotten ſon,
that is in the boſome of the Father, he hath revealed him unto us.</hi> We
ſhould be content with this, and ſhould labour to make a right
uſe of this knowledge, purging our hearts daylie, that we may
bee prepared for the bleſſed ſight of his countenance, with
which there is fulneſſe of joy. This much of the <hi>Perfection</hi>
of God; Let us now come to the duties which wee ought
to it.</p>
            <p>DAVID expreſſeth this one,<note place="margin">12, Praiſe due to him.</note> That he ſhould be greatly prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<hi>Great is the Lord,</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>and greatly to bee praiſed.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his <hi>greatnes,</hi> ſo ſhould his praiſe be. His <hi>greatnes</hi> is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
as we have ſhowen: and therefore he is worthie of infinite
praiſe. Hee deſerveth to be praiſed not only for ever and ever,
but alſo with an infinite affection, if it were poſſible to us. It
is true, all that wee can do in this kinde is ſmall; For what can
our little tongue contribute to the praiſing of the great God?
yet wee ſhould labour to do what wee can to the uttermoſt.
Our endeavours to praiſe him ſhould be without end, and our
continuance in his praiſes, ſhould be without end. This is a part
of ſervice from which the bleſſed ſpirits of men and angels i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

heaven, are not exempted. They praiſe him that ſit upon the
Thron and the lamb, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſing, and glorie, and power, and
honour, and dominion be to him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and to
the Lambe for ever.</hi> Neither do they ever intermitt or end this
exerciſe. <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe,</hi> ſaieth DAVID,
<hi>they are ſtill praiſing thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the more full clearing of this dutie, We are to conſider,
That the due co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of Gods excellency.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100463:16"/>
Firſt inflameth our heart with ſincere love of him,<note place="margin">13. Love the immediaet fountain of it.</note> and that
love being kendled in our hearts, filleth both our ſoules with
joy, and our mouthes with praiſe. There ariſeth from it joy in
us, when we look upon theſe ineſtimable perfections of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<hi>Wiſdome, Power, Joy</hi> and <hi>Bleſſe</hi> that are in God. If thou
aſſuredly knew, that thy beloved ſon abounded in <hi>wealth, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
and all <hi>happineſſe,</hi> it could not be but matter of exceeding
joy unto thee: ſo it cannot but fill thy ſoule with joy, when
thou conſidereſt that thy God and Father hath within himſelf
the infinite fulneſſe of all good and bleſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From this love ſpringeth the praiſe of God. When
we ſee his perfections,<note place="margin">14. What praiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from it.</note> and love him that hath them, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
choiſe but praiſe and bleſſe him, we cannot but deſire his
glory above all things, being ready to imploy all the powers
of our bodie and ſoule, to the promoving of it. Wee are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to praiſe and honour him our ſelves, but labour to draw all
men with us to the ſame exerciſe; As good Courtiours that
ſerve a worthy Prince, ſo praiſe his vertue and power; as that
they labour to draw others to the love and obedience of him;
Even ſo, they that ſerve this great King aright, endeavour to
bring all others as much as lyeth in them to the knowledge of
of his infinite <hi>Greatneſſe, Wiſdome, Power</hi> and <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;
to the love and reverence of him. Neither labour they only by
their words to do this, but alſo by their deeds, &amp; by obedience
to him in their life and converſation; according to that of our
Saviour, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhyne before men, that all that ſee your
good works, may glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi>

and provoke others to do the like. We profane his Name,
his Word and other holy Ordinances: by the wickedneſſe of
our lives, we contemne &amp; miſregard the greatnes of all his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and carry our ſelves toward him, as if there were no

All the works of God, praiſe him in their own kinde; <hi>The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens

his handie work:</hi> and ſo it is with the reſt of the works of God,
only man amongſt theſe viſible creatures faileth in this dutie,
albeit of all others hee be moſt bound. God hath made him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
according to his own Image, hath loaded him with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
bleſſings, and all for this end, that he ſhould ſet forth the
praiſes of him, <hi>Who hath called him out of darknes, to his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
light.</hi> His obliedgement to God, is many wayes infinite, &amp;
therfore his unthankfulnes is moſt worthy of infinite wrath &amp;
puniſhment. Iuſtly therfore, is the wrath of God revealed now
againſt wicked and unthankfull man. We will not <hi>take the cup
of ſalvation, and call upon his Name with praiſe,</hi> therfore he juſtly
preſenteth unto us, the cup of his furie: yea <hi>the wicked ſhall
drink the dreggs of it hereafter:</hi> even <hi>Everlaſting pain;</hi> which
ſhall make them ſo drunk and mad, that they ſhall curſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and blaſpheme God himſelf. This much of the duty
mentioned by the PROPHET.<note place="margin">16. Our heart ſhould bee ſet upon him.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Beſide this, wee may learne from the conſideration of Gods
infinite <hi>Greatneſſe.</hi> Firſt, That in him alone, wee ought to ſeek
the ſatisfaction &amp; contentment of all the deſires of our hearts.
Nothing can be deſired by us, which is not in him, and in him
moſt perfectly. All <hi>good</hi> is in him, all <hi>truth,</hi> all <hi>beauty,</hi> all <hi>honour</hi>
and <hi>dignitie,</hi> all <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> all <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>treaſures,</hi> all <hi>joy</hi>
and <hi>comfort,</hi> all <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>bleſſe</hi> and <hi>eternall life,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
in it; <hi>That which the eye hath not ſeen, the eare hath
not heard, and hath not entered in the heart of man to underſtand.</hi> So
there is in him that which is able fully to ſatisfie all our deſires.
Why ſuffereſt thou then thine heart to go a-whoring after the
creatures? all the good whereof is as but a ſhadow and vanitie,
when compared with that good which is in him. If a man we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
ſitting under a moſt fruitfull tree, where he might have aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of moſt delightſome fruits, if he would but look up and
ſtretch out his hand, would hee not be thought mad: if negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
this, he ſhall look only to the ſhadow of the fruits upon
the ground &amp; follow after it. Far greater madneſſe is it, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after that ſhadow of Gods perfections, which is in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100463:17"/>
creatures, when thou might enjoy that true, that ſolide and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
good that is in God, if thou would but look up to him,
and ſtretch out the hand of thy ſoule to lay hold upon him. If
we had that all which is in this world, &amp; have not him, we have
no more but a dreame of happineſſe: but if we have him, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
wee had nothing elſe, wee ſhould find in him true and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide
bleſſe. Let therefore all the deſires of our heart bend to
this great God, the onely center wherein they will find reſt.
Thus David pſal. 27. 4. <hi>One thing I have deſired and that I will
ſeek after: that I may ſee the beauty of the Lord, all the dayes of my
life, and enquire in his holy temple.</hi> And againe pſal. 73. <hi>Whom
have I in heaven but thee? and in earth there is nothing that I deſire
beſides thee. Thou art the ſtrength of my heart, &amp; my portion for ever.</hi>
Hence our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Martha,</hi> though b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſied in ſerving
himſelf; <hi>Martha, Martha, thou are troubled about many things:
leaving that good part, which ſhall not be taken away;</hi> namly to ſit
at Chriſts feet, to heare his word, that our ſouls may enjoy him.</p>
            <p>But it may be,<note place="margin">17. Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirs of him ſhould bee effectuall.</note> yee will ſay; There is none of us who deſireth
not God, and the enjoying of that great goodneſſe which is in
him. <hi>I Anſ.</hi> If thy deſire were ſincere and true, it would bee
effectuall, that is, it would make thee to do all that thou canſt
for the obtaining of them. As in naturall things, That inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which they have to that which giveth them reſt &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
maketh them to break through all impediments, if
they bee able; Thus a ſtone if it had power, ſhould break tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the very earth, till it came to the center: ſo if our deſire
of God were true and ſincere, wee ſhould do all that is poſſible
unto us, for finding of him. Now through his grace nothing is
impoſſible, and therfore, nothing ſhould withold us from him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From the conſideration of this infinite <hi>greatneſſe</hi>
of God,<note place="margin">18. Nobilitie of GOD, ſervice.</note> wee may learne, that it is a moſt high and honourable
thing to ſerve him. The greater any King is, his ſervice is the
more honourable. Now, God is infinitlie greater then any
earthly Monarch, and therefore his ſervice is far more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
then that of any earthly Prince. Yea, it is more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to ſerve him, then to reigne in this world: For to bee ſet
over men, is leſſe then to be conjoyned with God, to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100463:17"/>
to his preſence, that we may preſent our ſutes to him, to
enjoy his familiaritie, and to receive favours from him. Hence
DAVID who was a king over a mighty people gloried not in
that, but in this, that he was the ſervant of God, <hi>I am thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi>
ſaieth he, <hi>I am thy ſervant</hi> &amp;c. And againe, <hi>I had rather hee
a doore keeper in the houſe of my God, then to dwell in the tents of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">19. Reverenes in our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to him.</note> This <hi>Greatneſſe</hi> of God, ſhould teach us to carry our
ſelves before him in all reverence &amp; humility. The greater any
King is, the more he ſhould be reverenced; God therefore, who
is infinitly great, is worthy of infinite reverence, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
Hence <hi>Abram</hi> though it pleaſed God to uſe him very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly,
ſaid to him, <hi>Behold I am but dust and aſhes, and I have
taken upon mee to ſpeak unto my Lord.</hi> Yea the moſt glorious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
the <hi>Ceraphims,</hi> in acknowledgement of his greatnes, &amp; of
their own ſmalnes &amp; nullity: cover their faces before him; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God of hoſts</hi> &amp;c. How much more
becometh it us vile and ſinfull creatures to humble our ſelves
before this infinite Majeſtie? Of our ſelves we have no good, &amp;
can do none; All the good we have is of God, &amp; that hath joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with it in us manifold corruptions and miſeries. Now wee
are in health, and incontinent ſick againe, now in joy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent

our breath goeth out, wee are filled with terrours within, and

when wee come into the preſence of this infinitly great
King, when he vouchſafeth to ſpeak to us, or wee have libertie
to ſpeak to him?</p>

comforted you from this place, I appeale to your own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
But that which is moſt of all, I am perſwaded, he had
the true feare of God in his heart, in his wayes, he ſet him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his eyes, and was fervent and frequent in the devot ſervice
of him. He made not a ſhew of devotion: but God <hi>Who ſeeth in
ſecret,</hi> I truſt hath now <hi>openly rewarded him.</hi> Hee had indeed an
apprehenſion of death, a long ſpace before his end; and I very
well know; that he was moſt earneſtly and devotly prepared
for it. His preparation was fruitfull: for God gave him a ſweet
and calme, and holy departure, which joyned with integritie
of his life aſſureth us, that he is now tranſlated from this valley
of teares into his Fathers houſe, and to that <hi>City that hath foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
whoſe Builder and Maker is God.</hi> For my ſelf, I make no
doubt at all, but that he is with this great God, and is now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into his joy. So it is well with him, but alace, Theſe and
the like loſſes are matter of ſorrow and heavineſſe to us, yet as I
ſaid, we muſt not be too much caſt down: There is comfort
againſt this in all our evils, in that infinite <hi>greatneſſe</hi> and <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie</hi>
of God, whereof I have been ſpeaking. The Lord grant
us confidence in him, and that for the merits of Chriſt Ieſus; to

is the benefit of <hi>Vnitie,</hi> and how good and pleaſant a

                  </gap>itie.</note> which alſo importeh the reaſon why this
ſhould be done, as we ſhall heare; To dwell together in <hi>Vnitie,</hi>
is not to dwell in one place. The <hi>Vnitie</hi> he ſpeaketh of, is the
<hi>unitie</hi> of brotherlie <hi>Concord,</hi> wherby, as the latine word impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
the hearts of men are knit together, according to that
<hi>Act. 4. 32. And the multitude of them that beleeved were of one
heart, and of one ſoule:</hi> This <hi>Concord</hi> maketh a man not onlie to
do that which another willeth, but alſo to will that which he
willeth, and therefore preſupponeth the union of mindes and
judgements, (eſpeciallie in things of importance, and is
grounded upon the will of God revealed to us) into a true
and perfect <hi>Concord.</hi> So it is not true <hi>concord</hi> or <hi>unitie</hi> of hearts,
when fear impoſeth a neceſſitie of obeying or when hatred,
malice, envy, are clocked with outward ſhewes of love. Feare
commandeth not this <hi>Concord,</hi> neither can ſubtiltie of wit work
it. Temporall gaine cannot buy it, neither can paper and inke
keep it: but the God of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Vnitie,</hi> who hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it; giveth, confirmeth, preſerveth and keepeth it. They
that have this <hi>Concord</hi> dwell together in <hi>unitie,</hi> although they
be in diverſe places and have many bodies, yet they have as it
were, but one heart and one ſoule.</p>

               <hi>Brethren.</hi> All men
in ſome ſort are <hi>brethren,</hi> being deſcended of this ſame firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and partakers of this ſame nature, but DAVID meaneth
thoſe who were more ſtraitly tyed together, as partakers of the
ſame kingdom and countrey, &amp; members of the ſame Church.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100463:20"/>
Thoſe are <hi>brethren,</hi> and there ought to be no diviſion betwixt
brethren. <hi>Let there be no ſtrife, I pray thee, between thee and mee:
for wee are brethren</hi> ſaid ABRAHAM to LOT, <hi>Gen. 13. 8. Feare,</hi> &amp;
<hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>ſorrow</hi> ſhould be common unto brethren, and nothing
more hatefull then that one brother ſhould hate another, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
at his evill be grieved at his good, or that he ſhould caſt
him down and trample him under his feet. So when he ſaieth
<hi>brethren,</hi> he not only ſheweth <hi>who,</hi> but alſo <hi>why</hi> wee ſhould keep
<hi>unitie</hi> amongſt our ſelves, even becauſe wee are <hi>brethren.</hi> Now
wee have the thing commended. <hi>The unitie and concord of breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.</hi>
Let us ſee how he commendeth it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How good and how pleaſant is it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">6. Concord good and pleaſant.</note> ſaieth he. It is not only good,
nor only pleaſant, but both good and pleaſant. Some things are
good, that are not pleaſant, as <hi>Travels, repentance, faſting, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome,</hi>
and ſome things are pleaſant, that are not good, as
many <hi>ſinfull actions:</hi> but <hi>Concord</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> are both good and
pleaſant. Beſide he ſaith not ſimplie, that it is good &amp; pleaſant:
but <hi>How good &amp; how pleaſant,</hi> to ſignifie the <hi>excellencie</hi> of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and pleaſure that is in it; and therefore the ſeaventie Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
render it thus, <hi>What is good and pleaſant? but that brethren
dwell together in unitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then,<note place="margin">7. Goodneſſe of it.</note> 
               <hi>It is good,</hi> and ſo <hi>good,</hi> that without it nothing is
good, and by it all neceſſar good is attained; In naturall things,
everie thing is that, which it is by union or unitie, and by that
ſame unitie is conſerved in the <hi>being</hi> thereof, and if it bee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of further perfection, is by that unitie ſtrengthned, till it
attaine to that perfection which is due unto it. Nay further the
<hi>bleſſednes</hi> of God himſelf conſiſteth in <hi>unitie,</hi> wherby he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to himſelf, and whereby he hath all his divine perfections
moſt ſtraitly and unſeparablie united. In like manner the <hi>Wel-being</hi>
of all Societies civill or eccleſiaſticall, dependeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their
unitie. When the Chriſtian Church was firſt planted, it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
of a ſmall number, but being of one heart and of one ſoul,
did ſoone ſpread it ſelf throughout the whole world. When
<hi>Rome</hi> was firſt founded, it was ſcarse two myles of compaſſe,
but by unitie &amp; warrlike vertue it came to paſs, that in the time
of <hi>Aurelian</hi> the Emperour, it had the compaſſe of fiftie myles,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100463:20"/>
and the dominion of the world almoſt. By <hi>concord</hi> ſmall things
grow to an hight: and ſo it is good &amp; profitable, but by <hi>diſcord</hi>
and <hi>diviſion</hi> all things even the greateſt things declyne from
their pryme eſtate, and are weakned, diminiſhed, and in end
periſh. If the members of the body ſhould riſe up one againſt
another, if the right hand ſhould cutt off the left, if the fingers
ſhould pull out the eyes, if one member ſhould draw the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
from another; the body could not ſtand: even ſo, no
houſe, nor city, nor kingdome, nor church divided againſt it
ſelf can ſtand.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">8. Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it.</note> As the <hi>unitie</hi> of brethren is <hi>good,</hi> ſo it is <hi>pleaſant</hi> &amp;
<hi>beautifull.</hi> That which maketh this World to bee a beautifull
frame is the unitie that is in it. So long as the heaven, the ayre,
the ſea, and the earth, &amp; every thing therin agree, and do their
own duties, for which they were appointed calmly &amp; without
perturbation, it hath an incomparable beautie. But if things
ſhould become confuſed and diſordered, nothing ſhould bee
more deformed: ſo is it in reſpect of humane ſocietie. Nothing
more beautifull and deſirable then the unitie &amp; peace thereof,
and nothing more uglie and horrible, then diviſions and tup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
therein. Hence it is, that there is no man but he deſireth
peace, As all men deſireth to rejoyce, ſo al deſire to have peace
ſaieth holy <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> even <hi>Martiall men, that have the ſword in
the one hand, &amp; fire in the other, they are ſeeking peace, ſuch a peace,
as they imagine to be right,</hi> as the ſame Father obſerveth in the 19.
of the city of God, and 12 chap. In a word, we deſire it in our
houſes, in our wives, in our children, in our friends, and in all
things wee wiſh to have peace. It appeareth by a ſermon of <hi>S.
Auguſt.</hi> upon the CXLVII. pſal. That when hee had uttered
theſe words of the Text, <hi>Hee maketh peace in thy borderit</hi> The
people at the hearing of the name of <hi>Peace,</hi> incontinently cryed
out. What maketh you to cry? ſaid that holy Father, I haue
ſaid nothing on theſe words, I have not yet expounded them,
and yet ye cryed out, at the mentioning of peace. This ſhewes
that ye loved it, and love it yee could not, unleſſe ſome way ye
did ſee it, and ſee it with the eyes of the body yee cannot, but
it hath an inviſible beautie, which raviſſieth the heart, when it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100463:21"/>
is preſented to it: and what ſhall I ſay of it ſaieth he? I cannot,
I am not able to expreſſe the goodneſſe and the beautie of it; ſo
writting on this pſal. he ſaith that every man albeit he could not
reade, had this verſe by heart, <hi>Behold, how good and how pleaſant
it is for brethren, to dwell together in unitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we proceed,<note place="margin">9. Vnitie in the church co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded.</note> Let us mark hence a leſſon verie neceſſar
for theſe times, namlie, that if all brethren ſhould be ſo carefull
to keep unitie, as a thing moſt good and moſt pleaſant, then eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie
ought Chriſtians ſo to do, and Chriſtians who are of
the ſame religion. They are called, &amp; are moſt truly brethren,
they haue one Father, to wit God, they haue one mother, the
Church, one Lord, one faith, one baptiſme. And therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all others, <hi>ſhould keep the unitie of the ſpirit in the bond of
peace.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 3. Hence our Saviour before his death, ſaid to
them, <hi>A new co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement I give unto you, That ye love one another.
Hereby ſhall all men know, that yea are my diſciples, if ye love one
another.</hi> Ioh. 13. 34. 35. and praying for them before his death,
he ſaid, <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone: but for them alſo which ſhall
believe on me through their word: That they all may be one, as thou
Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us,</hi> Ioh.
17. 20. 21. To this effect he ſaid unto them, <hi>My peace I giue
unto you, my peace I leave with you,</hi> Ioh. 14. 27. yea, for this end
he dyed, that he might gather together in one, the children of
God that were diſperſed. So the bleſſed Apoſtles recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
nothing more then unitie and peace. S. PAUL ſaieth 1. <hi>cor.</hi>
1. 10. <hi>Now, I beſeech you, brethren, by the Name of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Christ, that yee all ſpeak the ſame thing, and there be no diviſions
among you: but that yee be perfectly joyned together in the ſame
minde, and in the ſame judgement.</hi> &amp; 2. <hi>cor. 13. be of one minde, &amp;
live in peace: &amp; the God of love &amp; peace ſhal be with you.</hi> So <hi>Philip.</hi>

did laugh at this. <hi>S. Auguſt.</hi> asked at them, If a Chriſtian had not

whom he was one in Chriſt. On the contrar <hi>Schiſm</hi> or <hi>breach</hi> of
<hi>Vnitie</hi> in the Church, they highly condemned. <hi>It is an hudge
Cryme,</hi> ſaieth <hi>Optatus Milivitanus,</hi> and <hi>yee your ſelves cannot
deny, that it is an evill in the higheſt degree,</hi> ſaieth he to the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi>

againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> chap. 6. he ſaieth, <hi>That they did heall men
indeed of Infidelity &amp; Idolatrie, but did wound them more deadly with
Schiſm. The puniſhment of Shiſm (ſaith he) was greater then of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie:</hi>

perdition, but a Child of peace. Hee did not ſee the Trueth in that
point, but God permitted that, that we might ſee in him, that which
was better then that Trueth, even Charitie: for that Trueth without
Charitie would not have ſaved him; but Charitie without that
Truth, obtained to him through the Mercie of God, the Crowne of
Martyrdome, and ſo the cloud of errour which creeped in his bright
ſoule, was baniſhed away by the brightneſſe of his blood (as it were)
ſhade for the love of Chriſt.</hi> I proceed now to the following
words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is as the precious oyntment upon the head,</hi>
               <note place="margin">11. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cord lik an ointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here by two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
ſimilituds the PROPHET ſheweth the beautie &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of brotherly <hi>unitie</hi> and <hi>love.</hi> The firſt is taken from the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
oyntment that was poured on the high Prieſt at his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration,
which you have deſcrived <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. The ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
is remarkable, Firſt, brotherly <hi>love</hi> wherof concord and
peace is the fruit, <hi>is like anoyntment.</hi> An <hi>oyntment</hi> maketh ſouple
and active, and <hi>Love</hi> maketh us prepared and readie to every
good work. 2. <hi>It is like unto the Prieſtly oyntment.</hi> That was
an holy and an ſacred thing: ſo brotherly <hi>love</hi> conſecrateth us
to God, and is not to be found but among the godly. <hi>Peace</hi> is
the fruit of the Spirit, and ſpringeth not but from him that is
rooted in Chriſt; the peace of the wicked is no true peace. It is
either not ſincere, but corrupted by ſome by reſpect of gaine or
pleaſure, or not grounded upon the right foundation which is
God. 3. This <hi>Concord</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> is not like to any oyntment
poured on the Prieſts, but like to <hi>that precious oyntment that was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100463:22"/>
poured on the head of Aaron the High Priest, and poured in ſuth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
upon him, that it did runne down to his beard, and to the
hemme of his garment ſending forth a moſt ſweet ſmell,</hi> wherby
all that were preſent were refreſhed; ſo is the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>love</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
brethren. It is in it ſelf a moſt excellent thing, and moſt
pleaſant and comfortable to all that perceive it. Wo to that
man whom this ſweet ſmell offendeth, he cannot be but miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>The ſecond compariſon followeth.<note place="margin">12. Like the dew.</note> 
               <hi>As the dew of Hermon,
and as the dew &amp;c.</hi> Here alſo an excellent compariſon. The ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
is taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dew, &amp; dew deſcending on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
even the mountains of <hi>Hermon</hi> and <hi>Zion,</hi> which were
in the holy Land among the people of God, the one upon the
one ſide, and the other upon the other ſide. The <hi>dew</hi> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
a pleaſant but alſo a moſt profitable thing. <hi>Rayn</hi> is ſomtimes
harmefull, but <hi>dew</hi> is never hurtfull. On the contrar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it is moſt
profitable to the earth, eſpecially to the mountains, upon which
the <hi>rayn</hi> lyeth not: but tunneth down to the valleyes; ſo <hi>Peace</hi>
and <hi>Concord</hi> is a moſt fruitfull thing. Wher it is preſerved, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
learning, juſtice, wealth &amp; all good things abound. 2.
He compareth this <hi>Concord</hi> to <hi>dew</hi> upon the mountains, and to
the <hi>oyntment</hi> upon the head, running thence to the beard; to
ſignifie that this <hi>Concord</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> ſhould be carefully keeped
by thoſe who are Heads and Rulers of people either in the
Church or, in the ſtate, that thence it may be convoyed to them
that are inferiours. If theſe that are moſt high and eminent be
at variance, what wonder? that thoſe who are lower follow
their example: but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they be joyned in <hi>Vnitie,</hi> the like may
eaſily be found among others. 3. The <hi>dew</hi> cometh from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
the earth hath no power of it ſelf to bring it forth; ſo this
brotherly <hi>Concord</hi> is the gift of God. It cometh from heaven,
and from heaven it muſt be earneſtly ſought, by them who
would have it. But why I pray you, doth all this good accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
brotherly <hi>Concord</hi> and <hi>Vnitie?</hi> The reaſon is ſet down by
the PROPHET in the next words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Lord hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded a bleſſing there,</hi>
               <note place="margin">13. Bleſſing followes it.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
whence all that good floweth, which accompanyeth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100463:23"/>
               <hi>Peace,</hi> God hath commanded his <hi>bleſſing</hi> to attend it, &amp; where
his bleſſing is, there all good is; for what he bleſſeth, ſhall bee
bleſſed indeed. Hee hath commanded not only the bleſſings of
this life, to attend this <hi>unitie</hi> and <hi>love</hi> of brethren, but even life
for evermore, which is begun in this life, by that peace of God
which paſſeth underſtanding, that keepeth our hearts and
mindes through Chriſt Ieſus, and ſhall be accompliſhed by that
eternall <hi>peace,</hi> which ſhall be in the ſight of God for ever in the
heavenly <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which ſignifieth as much as the viſion of
<hi>peace.</hi> He that is united to his brother in God, ſhall be bleſſed
with that bleſſed union with God, and he that is divyded from
his brother to whom he ſhould adhere in God, ſhall be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from God himſelf. Hee will ſay to him, <hi>Depart from mee ye
curſed</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> hath given us a ſhort, but a divine portracture of
brotherly <hi>Concord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">14. The por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cture of it.</note> wherby we may alſo perceive what <hi>Diſcord</hi>
&amp; <hi>Diviſion</hi> is. If we look to brotherly <hi>Concord,</hi> and behold her,
as hee comemndeth her; Nothing in her face, but <hi>beautie</hi> and
<hi>ſweetneſſee</hi> nothing in her heart, but <hi>love.</hi> The ſongs of <hi>joy</hi> are
in her mouth, Whereſoever ſhee goeth, ſhee ſendeth fourth a
ſweet ſmelling ſavour, <hi>like precious oyntment,</hi> or <hi>like a field which
the LORD hath bleſſed.</hi> Her ſtepps drop <hi>fatneſſe.</hi> Shee is from
heaven, &amp; heavenly bleſſings attend her wherſoever ſhe goeth,
and in end, Eternall bleſſing crowneth her. One the contrar,
<hi>Diviſion</hi> is as an horrible and helliſh <hi>Monſter. Hatred</hi> is in her
heart, <hi>furie</hi> in her eyes, <hi>horror</hi> is in her face, <hi>deſtruction</hi> is in her
hands; ſhee ſendeth forth moſt filthie and noyſome <hi>ſmell</hi> both
to God and man, whereſoever ſhee ſteppeth, there is <hi>deſolation.</hi>
Did ſhee meete with the fields of <hi>Nin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

garden of <hi>Eden</hi> was, ſhee can make it a <hi>Wildernes,</hi> &amp; can make
<hi>graſſe</hi> to grow in the ſtreets of the moſt populous cities. It is no
<hi>bleſſing</hi> but a <hi>curſe</hi> that followeth her, and which will preſſe her
down to eternall perdition. In a word, The very wicked ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
themſelves abhorre this Monſter of <hi>diviſion</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and labour as much to hold her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themſelves, as they
are earneſt to place her among others. <hi>For if Satans kingdome
were divided it could not ſtand,</hi> ſaieth our Saviour,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:100463:23"/>
From all this,<note place="margin">15. we ar bene to diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> obſerve firſt the corruption of our nature,
which is ſuch, that we ſtand in neede to be exhorted to a thing
ſo good, ſo pleaſant, ſo bleſſed as brotherly <hi>unitie;</hi> Neither need
wee onlie to bee exhorted to it, but the Spirit of God alſo
thought fit to uſe reaſons for this effect, taken from our own
utilitie and pleaſure. Hee might have ſaid, This is a thing that
is righteous, and which God hath commanded; but he ſaieth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to alluire us to this excellent good. <hi>How good &amp; how pleaſant is it
for brethren to dwell together in unitie. It is like the precious ointment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
&amp; like the fruitfull dew,</hi> &amp; is acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyed by aſſured bleſſing. All
this argueth our corruption &amp; pronnes to diſſention, which we
ſhould labour to be ſenſible of, that we may ſtrive againſt it, &amp;
that wee may earneſtly beſeech God, whoſe gift this is, as we
ſaid, to ſend down this heavenly dew on our ſoules. Our corrupt
&amp; cankered nature ſtriveth againſt it, the divell laboureth by al
means to deprive us of it. It is well remarked by <hi>S. August<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in his
book of the profit of faſting. <hi>That the divell careth not much for
the diſſention of them that worſhip a falſe god, becauſe he hath them
alreadie: but he is moſt earneſt to divide them who are the worſhippers
of the true God, and have rejected his ſervice.</hi> he ſeeth he cannot
divide the true God, nor put an idoll in his place, to make them
to worſhip it, and therefore he laboureth to make <hi>herefies,</hi> and
<hi>ſchiſmes,</hi> and <hi>contentions</hi> among them, that ſo at leaſt he may
overcome them. Beſide all this, our manifold ſinnes deſerve at
Gods hands, that he ſhould ſuffer us to caſt away this bleſſing
of <hi>Peace,</hi> and therefore in all theſe reſpects we ought carefullie
to take heed to it, to humble our ſelves under the hand of God,
to turne from our ſinnes, <hi>Drunkenneſſe, whoredom, profaning of
the Lords Day, Pryd, malice,</hi> and others our <hi>abominations;</hi> and
fervently to pray, <hi>That the Lord yet would ſpare his people, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

through ſtrife or vaine glorie,</hi> ſaieth <hi>S. Paul</hi> exhorting to <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
Philipp. 2. <hi>But let each one in humilitie think of another better
then of himſelf.</hi> So our Saviour ſaieth, <hi>Learne of me, for I am meek
and lowlie in heart.</hi> Alace if wee had this humilitie, our conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
might ſoon be at an end, it would make us think leſſe of
our own thoughts, and not to deſpyſe others. Men that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

they may erre aſwell as others. <hi>To erre in nothing</hi> ſaieth <hi>S.</hi> AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUST.

incident to humane infirmitie, but for a man to love his own opinion:
ſo that for maintenance of it, hee would fall in hereſie or ſchiſme is a

            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">17. Meeknes neceſſar.</note> 
               <hi>Meekneſſe</hi> is required. Our Lord, the Prince of

it the chief benefits beſtowed upon man by God. Firſt he ſetteh
down benefits ſpirituall, namely the choiſing of men to be his
people, the hearing of their prayers, the pardoning of their ſins,
the ſealing of them with his Spirit, by the light wherof they
know him, and by the ſweetnes whereof they are refreſhed and
ſatisfied in his houſe, that is his Church. 2. He conſidereth
the goodneſſe of God, in eſtabliſhing and defending the civill
Eſtate; againſt the furies of the divell and tumults of men, that
humane ſocietie may be maintained and flowriſh, in honeſtie

through aſtoniſhment becometh as it were ſilent, notable to
reach to the due commemoration and eſteeme of Gods boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

his people are ſuch and ſo many daylie and hourly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon them, in generall, in particular, known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
that no minde can ſufficiently conceive, nor tongue
utter them. In him wee live, move, and have out being. Hee
maketh his ſun to ſhyne and his rain to fall upon us. Hee hath
endued us with reaſon and underſtanding. When we were loſt,
he did not forſake us, but even when blinded with our own ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance

our life from deſtruction, and to this effect ſent his own Son
(which the Church now clearly knoweth) to bee born, and
ſuffer, and by his moſt perfect ſacrifice to purge all our ſinnes,
and withall ſendeth his Spirit in our heart to guide us through
all difficulties, till we attaine to the bleſſed ſight and joy of his
Countenance. Thus he compaſſeth and crowneth us with lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
kindneſſe and tender mercies: for which if wee had a
thouſand hearts and a thouſand tongues, could wee give him
ſufficiently <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>thanks?</hi> No, <hi>Praiſe</hi> it ſelf is forced as it

DAVID, <hi>O Lord, What ſhall thy ſervants ſay? What ſhall we render

<hi>and</hi> Praiſe <hi>as that.</hi> Rejoyce not in this, <hi>ſaieth our Saviour,</hi> that the

he hath taſted &amp; ſeen how good the Lord is, he cannot praiſe
as he ſhould, on the other part God alſo looketh not ſo much
to the mouth, as to the heart of the praiſer. He reſpecteth not
ſo much the tongue as the Converſation. What availeth it to
bleſſe God with thy mouth, and blaſpheme him with thy life;
this is an abomination, and therefore it is truly ſaid by holy

            <p>Thirdly, As Sion ſhould, and onely can, ſo alſo ſhe will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly

            <p>Hence, we may clearly ſee how neceſſare is this duty of <hi>praiſe</hi>

the ſpirit and latter <hi>chap.</hi> 11. when God firſt made the world
he ſequeſtred one day of every week, as for his ſervice, ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
for a thankfull remembrance of the benefit of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Under the law he appointed one day in the month, to wit,
the firſt which was the feaſt of the <hi>new moone</hi> for a thankfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance

            <p>Under the goſpel now,<note place="margin">7. Vnder the Goſpel.</note> I may ſay, it is yet more neceſſar. The

the benefits we have receaved, and procureth the increaſe of

            <p>
               <hi>And unto thee ſhall the vow be performed.</hi> As <hi>Praiſe,</hi> ſo <hi>vowes</hi>
and the performance thereof belongeth to <hi>Thankefulneſſe.</hi> And
therefore theſe two are ordinarly joyned in ſcripture.<note place="margin">8. A vow is a Promiſe.</note> For clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this point, we will ſhortly ſhew what is a <hi>Vow.</hi> 2. How
it belongeth to <hi>Thankefulneſſe.</hi> For the firſt, <hi>A Vow is a religious
promiſe, made to God willingly of a thing acceptable to him.</hi> It is a
<hi>promiſe.</hi> A purpoſe to do a thing, is not ſufficient to make a <hi>Vow,</hi>
which is a kinde of Contract betwixt God and man, oblied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
a man to the performance of ſomething by way of fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which obliedgment cannot be without a promiſe or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
kinde of ſpeech, as <hi>Schoolmen</hi> ſpeak, whereby a man tyeth
himſelf, as he tyeth another by his commandement.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">9. Made to God,</note> It is a <hi>Promiſe</hi> made to God. <hi>Vnto thee</hi> ſaieth my
Text, <hi>ſhall the vow be performed. Vow, &amp; pay your vowes unto the
Lord,</hi> pſal. 76. 11. <hi>Offer unto God thanksgiving, &amp; pay thy vows unto
the moſt High,</hi> pſal. 50. 14. In a word, everiewher in holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
we find <hi>vows</hi> made to none but to God; And yet this day the
practiſe of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is to make vows to ſaints. And
their Doctours labour to juſtifie this practiſe. It is acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by <hi>Bell.</hi> That a <hi>vow</hi> in holy ſcripture is ever taken for a
<hi>promiſe</hi> made to God, <hi>And yet,</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>vows are rightly made to
ſaints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> A ſtrange thing, How can theſe two conſist? Heare I
pray you his anſwere, <hi>When the ſcripture was written</hi> ſaieth he,
<hi>vowing to ſaints was not in uſe.</hi> This certainly is true, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
it, what elſe is it, but to condemne their own practiſe, as
an innovation? whereby the honour due to God alone, is given
to the creature. <hi>O</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>The ſaints are Gods by participation,
They in a moſt excellent manner are partakers of his naturall glory,</hi>
but by no diſtinction may the honour due to God be given to
any other, &amp; by the ſame ſhift, they might alleadge offering of
ſacrifice to ſaints, with which making of vows is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in ſcripture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:100463:27"/>
Thirdly,<note place="margin">10. Religious.</note> I ſay, <hi>It is a religious Promiſe.</hi> VOWING is a proper act
of Religion, or the worſhip of God. As by an Oath which is an
proper act of worſhip, we profeſs God to be the ſupream truth,
and the Maintainer of it, ſo by a vow, wee profeſſe God to bee
moſt good, and to be well pleaſed with the doing of good: and
indeed a vow is not much different from a promiſarie oath, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
That the Oath is made to man, but the vow is made to
God. 2. To vow to a falſe God ſhould be Idolatrie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a vow to the true God, is true religion and worſhip, which
ſhall hereafter more appeare.</p>
            <p>Fourthly.<note place="margin">11. willingly.</note> It is <hi>a promiſe made willingly,</hi> God loveth <hi>a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
giver</hi> &amp; repelleth that which is done by conſtraint or vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
A vow is as it were a private Law, whereby a man
bindeth himſelfe, and differeth in this from a general Law,
that a general Law bindeth a man whether he be willing or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing,
but ſo doeth not a vow, &amp; therefore if made without
the uſe of reaſon, or through ignorance or fear; it obliedgeth
not.</p>
            <p>Fifthly.<note place="margin">12. Of a thing gracious.</note> It muſt be of <hi>a thing acceptable to God.</hi> That is of ſuch
a thing, the doing thereof is better then the not doing of it. If
the thing vowed cannot ſerve for an good purpoſe, it is but
the ſacrifice of fools. If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a thing evil; as was that of theſe
who vowed <hi>not to eat or drink till they had killed S. Paul. Act.</hi>
23. 12. It maketh the vow abominable, for beſide the wickednes
of intending or doing ſuch a thing, he that voweth it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth
akynd of blaſphemy in ſo far as by vowing it he confeſſeth that
God is pleaſed with ſuch an evil. The matter therefore of a
vow muſt be a thing that may be done acceptable to God. but
theſe things are of two ſorts, ſome are not neceſſare in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to be done, by ſuch or ſuch a perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome againe are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare.
Of both ſome doubt is made, whether they bee a fit
matter of vow.</p>
            <p>Some Papiſts affirme,<note place="margin">13. A vow of a thing not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded.</note> that our Divines deny that a vow may
be made of a thing not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded or not neceſſar, but this is a
calumnie. Our learned Divines acknowledge that ther at ſome
things, which if a man omitt, he ſhal not ſinne, yet to do them
were better then not to do them, and conſequently that a man
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100463:28"/>
may vow to do ſuch a thing; For example, ſuch or ſuch a man
ſhould not ſin, not to give ſuch a ſumme of money to the poo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
or pious uſes, yet if he would give it, he ſhould do better, and
may vow ſo to do. The ſame may be ſaid of Faſting or abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
at ſuch and ſuch times. That ſuch things may be vowed
is cleare from ſcripture, which everie where almoſt ſpeaketh of
ſuch vows. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 21. 22. The Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands <hi>That if a man
mak a vow be ſhal perform it,</hi> but ſaith the Lord, <hi>If thou forbeare to
vow it ſhall not be ſinne unto thee.</hi> To give ſuch or ſuch a ſumme of
money to the poor, is a good work without a vow, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to God, being an act of charitie, why then ſhould it not be
pleaſing to God, when a <hi>Vow</hi> is paſſed upon it? That which
our Divines condemn in ſuch vows is, That men aſcrive Merite
unto them, account them works of ſupererogation, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them raſhly enſnare their own Conſciences. Theſe and
like abuſes being removed, they acknowledge that vows made
of ſuch things are hinderances of ſinne, nouriſhments of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and profitable exerciſes, whereby the minde is confirmed
in good, and keeped back from evill.</p>
            <p>Neither is this Wil-worſhip as ſome imagine;<note place="margin">14. Not Wil-worſhip.</note> For Wil-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is to apply things vaine and frivolous, and where with God
cannot be pleaſed to the honouri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of God, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did,
who placed Holineſſe in manifold waſhings of themſelves, or
as they againſt whom the Apoſtle reaſoneth, who abſtained
from ſome meats as uncleane of their own nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. Wil-worſhip alſo is to place neceſſitie in
things not neceſſare, when there is neither precept nor practiſe
to be found in Gods Word or in his Church to enforce any ſuch
neceſſitie. This is Wil-worſhip, but no Wil-worſhip, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to God a thing which being done may ſerve to good and
profitable uſes.</p>
            <p>If any man ſay,<note place="margin">15. Obliedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do good.</note> Are we not bound to do all the good that we
can? <hi>I An.</hi> By way of gratitude we ar, but not by vertue of ſtrict
Commandement, ſo that if we do not ſuch or ſuch a thing we
commit not ſin, as was ſhewen before.</p>
            <p>As for things neceſſare, ſome <hi>Romaniſts</hi> affirme that they
cannot be the matter of a vow, but the beſt learned acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100463:28"/>
that it may be,<note place="margin">16. Vows of things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſar.</note> and it is cleare from ſcripture, For <hi>Jacob</hi>
geneſis 28. 20. 21. <hi>vowed that the Lord ſhould be his God.</hi> Which
was a thing neceſſare, although he had not vowed it. Wee are
tyed indeed to the doing of ſuch things neceſſare and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by vertue of Gods Commandement although wee vow
not, but notwithſtanding we may adde to that bond the bond
&amp; obliedgment of a vow, to ſtirre up and confirme the more
in the obedience of God, our languiſhing wils, even as a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who is already bound to another man by his promiſe, may
bind himſelf alſo by his oath. This kinde of <hi>vow</hi> was made by
the people of God, when turning back from their ſinnes, they
renewed their covenant with him, and promiſed to walk in his
Commandements. And this much of the nature of a <hi>vow.</hi> I
come to the ſecond point, which is, how this duty belongeth
to <hi>Thankfulneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For clearing of this conſider,<note place="margin">17. GOD ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by vows.</note> That when a man promiſeth
any thing to God, he doeth not ſo, that God may have any
gaine or help therby, but that he may give due honour to God.
More particularlie by vowing a man honoureth God, in ſo far
as hereby he acknowledgeth, that God hath a care and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of humane effaires, and that it is he, to whom we ſhould
have out recourſe in tro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ble, &amp; who alone can help us, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
whom we receive whatſoever we haue. 2. By vowing a man
honoureth God, in ſo far as he intendeth by the reverence and
feare of God to confirme himſelf in weldoing. 3. By vowing
and performing of our vows wee honour our God, in ſo far as
wee direct the thing which we have vowed to the ſervice of
God, or to the enabling of us to ſerve him more acceptablie
then otherwayes we would do.</p>
            <p>From this which hath been ſaid appeareth firſt,<note place="margin">18. vows law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full now.</note> That vowing
may be now lawfully performed, though the legal and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
vows hath ceaſed, yet all vows are not therefore abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.
Vowing is no lewiſh ceremonie. Our <hi>vows</hi> prefigure not
Chriſt; And <hi>Jacob</hi> vowed long before <hi>Moſes</hi> was, yea vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not a ceremony at all. A Ceremonie is a thing outward &amp;
ſenſible, but vowing may be accompliſhed in the minde. I ſay
more, though men ſhould not be raſh to vow, yet ſomtimes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100463:29"/>
ſome things when done out of a vow, ar better then if they wer
done without any vow, becauſe beſide all the goodneſſe which
they ſhould have otherwayes, they are done out of a religious
affection towards God, and done out of a more firme and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
purpoſe, then otherwayes they ſhould, and with a
more full reſignation of our ſelves, both the work and the will,
the fruit and the tree being given to God, and therefore the
ſcripture recommendeth this duty to us, and in the 19. 21. of
<hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſtians, ſaieth, <hi>That they ſhall vow and

            </p>

firſt part, which is the ground of the PROPHETS ſupplication,
and of his hope &amp; confidence to be heard, it is ſet down in the
firſt words, we have in it three <hi>Prerogatives</hi> aſcrived to God, the
firſt that he is UNCHANGEABLE. <hi>Thou O Lord remaineſt;</hi> Sayeth
he, ſecondly, he aſcriveth to him <hi>abſolute Dominion,</hi> imported
by this, that <hi>Hee is the Lord and hath a Throne.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Eternity</hi>
is aſcrived both to him and his Kingdome. <hi>Thou O Lord remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
for ever &amp;c.</hi> Let us conſider theſe points ſhortly, both in
themſelves, and with a reference to the PROPHETS petitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou O Lord remaineſt &amp;c.</hi> Here the PROPHET to ſtrengthen
his hope &amp; the hope of the Church,<note place="margin">2. GOD un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> fixeth the eyes of his faith
upon the <hi>Vnchangeablnes</hi> of God; <hi>thou</hi> ſayeſt he <hi>remainest.</hi> The
word in the originall ſignifieth to dwell, to abide, or ſit ſtill, &amp;
importeth, when aſcrived to God; his <hi>conſtancie</hi> &amp; <hi>immntabilitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For clearing of this we are to conſider, that this is in God in
a moſt excellent manner. He is ſimple <hi>Vnchangeable</hi> both in his
<hi>nature,</hi> and in his <hi>decrees</hi> or <hi>purpoſes,</hi> both which are meaned
here. In his <hi>nature</hi> &amp; at his perfections he is <hi>Vnchangeable.</hi> If any
cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of this kynde could have place in him, it ſhould be either
from imperfection to perfection, or from perfection to imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
but neither of theſe can be, no new perfection can
haue place in him, becauſe as we ſaid before, in him is the infinite
fulnes of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n, which is not capable of any increaſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100463:31"/>
Neither can he change to any imperfection; for none of
his infinite perfections can be loſſed. They are one &amp; the ſame
with his own <hi>nature</hi> and being. Now his being is neceſſar, for
he hath it not from another, and therefore as it ever was, ſo it
can never ceaſe to be, and conſequently is <hi>Vnchangeable,</hi> for
<hi>Vnchangeablnes</hi> is nothing elſe but a neceſſitie of being that
which he was before. Thus it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> moſt evident that God in his
<hi>nature</hi> &amp; eſſentiall perfections is Unchangeable, the acquiring
of any new perfection being repugnant to the infinite fulnes of
being that is in him, and the loſſe of his perfection being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
to the neceſſitie or infinit firmnes or ſtabilitie of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Nature.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">3. In his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</note> as he is <hi>Vnchangeable</hi> in his naturall <hi>perfections,</hi> ſo
in his <hi>decrees</hi> and purpoſes toward us, we often change our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
and purpoſes: and the reaſon is, we do not perfectly
perceive and conſider the good or the evil, the conveniencie or
inconveniencie of that which we are about, &amp; therefore when
thereafter we find our own errour, we change and retraite the
will and purpoſe which we had before. This cannot have place
in God who from all eternitie hade a moſt clear ſight of all the
good and evil, expediencie and inexpediencie that is in every
thing, and therefore not ſubject to any errour or change. Hence
I am. chap. 1. 17. calleth him <hi>the Father of lights, with whom is
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> variableneſſe, neither ſhadow of turning.</hi> Hence the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
ſayeth of himſelf, Malach. 3. 6. <hi>I am the LORD, I change
not: therefore yee ſons of Iacob are not conſumed.</hi> Num. 23. 19. <hi>God
is not as man, that he ſhould lie, neither the ſon of man, that he ſhould
repent: hath he ſaid, and ſhall be not do it? or hath he ſpoken, and
ſhall he not make it good?</hi> To this ſame purpoſe David pſal. 102.
ſpeaking to God, ſayeth <hi>thou art the ſame, and thy years ſhall have
no end.</hi> Thou art not now one, and now another: but alwayes
one &amp; the ſame. Thus we ſee his being is the ſame alwayes &amp;
ſo are his <hi>decrees, the counſell of his heart ſtandeth, and his thoughts
throughout all generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</hi> Thus we ſee his <hi>unchangeablnes</hi> by reaſon
whereof the PROPHET ſayeth here <hi>Thou O Lord remainſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we may perceive that no change which we ſee in
the creatures doeth any way affect God, he made this world &amp;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100463:31"/>
all things in it,<note place="margin">4. No cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge in him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his works.</note> he changed them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing to this <hi>being</hi> which
they now have, but without any change in himſelf. When
the ſhadow of thy face appeareth in a glaſſe, there is no change
in thy face from that which was before: when thy foot
leaveth an impreſſion or mark in the way, thy foot is nothing
altered, now what is the creature but as it were the ſhadow of
the countenance of God, A footſtepe, impreſſion or ſmal reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of that perfection which is in him proceeding from him
without any alteration of him at all, ſo without any change he
ruleth and governeth this world which he hath made, albeit
ther be innumerable changes or alterations in it, yet he is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with no new affections, no new thought or counſel aryſeth
in his mynde. Whatſoever counſell or purpoſe, love or hatred,
lyking or disſlyking is now in him, was in him from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
and what was in him, is yet, and ſhall be, for all eternitie.
Once for al before the foundations of the world, even fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
he conceived and decreed what he would have done or
permitted to be done in al ſucceding ages, and by vertue of that
his eternall decree all things come forth in their own times, he
remaining fixt and firme &amp; immutable in his moſt ſimple Unity
and prime eſtate; ſuppoſe that this world, have its being and all
the creatures eſpecially men &amp; angels concurre to ſerve, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
to praiſe and enjoy him, this addeth nothing to his inward
joy or bleſſe, or to any his inward perfections. He had in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
without them, the infinite fulnes of that, &amp; he made them,
not to ripe any comfort or gaine by them, but to communicate
the ſuper aboundace of his goodnes, &amp; to make them partakers
of his riches ſo far as they are capable. On the other part.
Suppoſe the whole world &amp; al the creaturs therin ſhould periſh,
it would diminiſh nothing of the joy &amp; bleſſe of God. For he
hath infinite <hi>happines</hi> in himſelf, which cannot be impaired, as
we haue ſhewn, &amp; all the creatures ar in him, in a moſt excellent
manner, in his <hi>wiſdom</hi> &amp; in his <hi>power,</hi> for in himſelf he beholds
them and delights in them aſwell as in themſelves.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſome man will ſay,<note place="margin">5. How he is ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</note> it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeemeth that there may
be ſome change in God, ſince the ſcripture aſcriveth repentance
to him, <hi>Gen. 6. 6. And it repented the Lord that he had made man
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100463:32"/>
on the earth.</hi> And the PROPHET expoſtulateth with him for <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe.</hi>
I Anſ. That the ſcripture aſcriveth theſe and the
like things unto God, condiſcending to the weaknes of our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
not to ſignifie that there is any ſuch thing in God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly:
but to ſignifie, that ſuch effects come from him, as uſe
to proceed from repenting and forgetfull men. <hi>Repentance</hi>
properly taken in men preſuppoſeth an errour or fault for the
which the Penitent is grieved. So <hi>Wrath</hi> includeth the flame of
an incenſed minde: <hi>Mercie</hi> importeth the <hi>miſery</hi> of a condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
heart. <hi>Jealouſie</hi> ſome inward <hi>diſpite</hi> and <hi>envy.</hi> Thus it is
that theſe things are aſcrived unto men, but in God it is far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes.
His <hi>Wrath</hi> (A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of ſinne.</hi> His <hi>Mercy</hi> is a ſuccurring <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> His <hi>Jealouſie</hi>
in his <hi>Providence,</hi> whereby he will not ſuffer them to go free
or unpuniſhed, who love that which he forbiddeth, ſo his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
is nothing elſe but an unlooked for clearing of things
that are in his power. IT importeth no change in him, but in
the outward effects which he altereth, without any change in
his Will or purpoſe. Hence in 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 29. It is ſaid, <hi>The
strength of Iſrael will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man that he
ſhould repent,</hi> albeit it be ſaid a little before in that ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>That he had repented that he had ſet up Saul to be King.</hi> So when
he repenteth, he changeth things, but is not changed, when he

<hi>mercie,</hi> he helpeth, but is not grieved, and when he is <hi>Jealous,</hi>
he afflicteth, but is not afflicted. In like manner, when hee is
ſaid to <hi>remember</hi> or <hi>forget;</hi> The ſpeech is borrowed from men.
His <hi>Remembrance</hi> importeth his <hi>Love,</hi> his <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Protection,</hi>
and his <hi>Forgetfulneſſe,</hi> ſignifying that he leaveth or ſeemeth to
leave men expoſed to dangers; This much of his <hi>Vnchangeabl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">6. unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablneſſe proper to GOD.</note> It is to be obſerved, That the PROPHET aſcriveth
this <hi>Vnchangeablneſſe</hi> to God as proper to him, and competent
to no other. <hi>Thou O Lord remaineſt</hi> as if he would have ſaid.
This is thy prerogative, <hi>O Lord thou, and none but Thou remaineſt.</hi>
All other things whatſomever are changeable. This World we
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100463:32"/>
ſee is full of changes &amp; alterations, and nothing more certain
then the uncertaintie of it, and therefore the Apoſtle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.
31. compareth it to a <hi>Shew</hi> upon a ſtage, where ſuddenly all

So it is with our ſelves, our bodies, our ſoules and the whole
man. Our bodies are expoſed to a perpetuall change. Now
they are in health, &amp; incontinent in ſickneſſe, now in ſtrength,
and againe in weaknes. <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, and the goodlineſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
as the flower of the field.</hi> Iſai. 40 6. ſo that <hi>Every man,</hi> this way,
<hi>in his best eſtate is altogether vanitie. When God with rebukes corrects
us for iniquitie, he makes our beauty &amp; whatſomever is deſirable in us,</hi>
as Davids word importeth, <hi>Pſal. 39. to melt away, or to conſume
like a moth.</hi> Our ſoules albeit of a more excellent nature, being
ſpirituall and heavenly, ar in like manner toſſed to and fro with
changes, now they know, now they are ignorant, now againe
they forget, now they are moved with one affection, &amp; againe
with the contrare; ſomtimes with <hi>love,</hi> ſomtimes with <hi>hatred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

changeable while he is here, and in end there abideth him a
great change from his eſtate in this world whatſomever it be,
to an eternall eſtate in the world to come, either in well or in
woe. If wee aſcend to the things above our ſelves, the very
heavens are ſubject unto change, <hi>The heavens are the work of thy
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ands</hi> ſaieth David. <hi>They ſhall periſh, but thou ſhall indure; yea all
of them ſhall wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e old like a garment, and as a vesture thou ſhale
change them, and they ſhall be changed. The heavens ſhall paſſe away
with a noiſe</hi> ſaieth <hi>S. Pet.</hi> What ſpeake I of the heavens?
The Angels themſelves are not exempted from this change or
mutabilitie. As they came from nothing, ſo may they be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to it, and would be if God did not uphold them; and a
great part of them have been actually changed from enjoying
the favour of God, to the ſuffering of eternal pains. <hi>They keeped
not their firſt eſtate,</hi> ſaith S. IUDE, <hi>and therfore are reſerved in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
chains under darkneſſe, unto the judgement of the great day.</hi>
So all creatures even the moſt excellent are changeable, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100463:33"/>
this is a maine argument of our continuall humilitie before
God, and thankfulnes toward him. But on the other part, God
himſelf is free from all change, as we have ſhewn, and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that he hath this unchangeablnes joyned with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
glory and majeſtie, as <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> obſerveth upon the 5.
pſal. Amongſt men the things that are moſt glorious, are moſt
commonly changeable, the more high wee are, wee are the
more ready to fall, expoſed to the more dangers, wheras they
that are of a low and meane eſtate are more ſure and firme.
But in God, ſupreame glory &amp; abſolute immutabilitie are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together. All things are in him moſt excellently and with
all moſt firmly; And thus we have ſhewn both that this perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of immutabilitie is in God, and is in him alone. Now let
us ſee to what purpoſe it is mentioned here by the PROPHET.
It is pertinently conſidered by the PROPHET, in reſpect of both
the petitions preſented by him;<note place="margin">7 Comfort hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt troubles:</note> For underſtanding whereof
conſider that the ſervants of God are in one of theſe two caſes,
either they have not changed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their due obedience to God,
or they have; and in both, the meditation of Gods unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenes
is profitable. In the firſt caſe, when we have not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from the obedience due to God, but ſtill continue in
his feare, and yet are afflicted with many troubles, it is moſt

us confidence to ſay with the PROPHET here, <hi>Wherefore

troubles ſathan tempteth us with this, that God hath forſaken
us, &amp; that if ever he had any love toward us, he hath now chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it: and therefore hath given us over as a prey to ſorrows.
But our comfort in this temptation is, The Lord changeth not

Where the Lord ſheweth, that his love to his own is not only
moſt tender as is the love of mothers toward their young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100463:33"/>
but alſo moſt conſtant and firme. He is ſo far from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
them, that he hath them <hi>ingraven even upon the palms of
his hands,</hi> that they may be alwayes in his ſight. Again albeit
the love of fathers &amp; mothers toward their children be tender
&amp; change not, it may be, when they are young yet afterwards
it will often change, eſpecially from that tendernes which it
had before: but ſo is it not with God. <hi>Yee are borne by me from
the bellie and from the wombe.</hi> Iſa. 46. <hi>And even to your old age I
am he, and even to your hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made,
and I will beare, even I will carrie and deliver you.</hi> And ſo
Gods love changeth not from us at any time but embraceth
us at all times alike and maketh him to beare and carrie us, as it
were, ſtill in his armes. To this purpoſe he ſaith moſt ſweetly in
the 54. of Iſa. <hi>The mountains ſhall depart, and the hills ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,

            </p>
            <p>To conclude this point,<note place="margin">8. Gods Love cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges not from us in trouble.</note> no change of our outward eſtate
ſhould make us think that Gods love or purpoſe towards us is
changed, if our hearts be ſound to him. No, on the contrare,
thou may be aſſured that God who unchangeablie loveth them
that fear him is with thee, howſoever it fare with thee in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things. Thy <hi>friends,</hi> it may be, haue changed their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
thy <hi>riches</hi> haue taken the wings of the eagles and flown

               </hi>
and will not leave thee for any change that can come, if thou
leave him not. But you will ſay, How cometh it to paſſe then
that my <hi>peace</hi> is turned into <hi>trouble,</hi> and my <hi>joy</hi> into <hi>heavineſſe,</hi> if
God be with me as before? I Anſ. This may ſtand very well

Hee will have them whom he loveth, to be made conforme
to the Image of his Son, who went by his Croſſe to his Crown:
and ſuffered before he hee entered into his glory. God can bee
with the in <hi>trouble,</hi> aſwell as without it, and he knoweth how
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100463:34"/>
to deliver thee when he thinketh fit; <hi>And faithfull is he who

Thus we ſee, if we have continued in Gods feare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His <hi>Vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geablneſſe</hi>

it is his <hi>Goale</hi> or his <hi>Priſon.</hi> All the creatures are his ſervants,
even the unreaſonable and ſenſleſſe creatures; the <hi>fire,</hi> the <hi>haile,</hi>

his</hi> Majeſtie, and the wicked ſpirits in hell tremble at his
power. His dominion reacheth as to all things, ſo to all that is in
them, our dominion goeth no further then the ſuperfice, as it
were, of things. And we have rather the uſe of things then the
dominion; but the dominion of God reacheth to their verie
ſubſtance, which he hath made, &amp; can preſerve or deſtroy as he
will. What ſay I of the things that are, even the things that are
not, &amp; are only poſſible, are ſubject unto him? He calleth the
things that are not, as if they were. If he ſhould call, and but
ſpeak the word, they ſhould come forth out of that darknes of
nothing wherein they lurke. Thus he is the ſupreame and the
true Lord and the King, before whom the glorie and Majeſtie
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100463:35"/>
of all earthly kings is but vilenes, they depend from him and
others as we ſaid, he depends from none; they haue ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and riches, he hath all. They ſo rejoice in their crowne &amp;
the glorie of it that ſtill they haue their own ſollicitudes and
fears, and therefore ſome haue laid down their crownes, but he
reigneth in all tranquillitie, ſecuritie and peace. Thus yee haue
ſhortly his Dominion and Kingdome. Now let us ſee how the
conſideration of it ſerveth for the uſe of the PROPHET, &amp; may
ſerve for ours.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of this moſt perfect Dominion of God,
is a moſt notable comfort againſt the temptations that are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in our mindes in the time of trouble and adverſity,<note place="margin">12. Comfort hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt troubles. 1. reaſon.</note> when we
think that God hath forſaken us; &amp; hath left us as a prey to our
enemies, to be ſwallowed up by them. If thou be tempted by
this, conſider firſt, that thou are the ſpecial &amp; as it wer the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick
ſervant of this King, albeit all the ſubjects of a king
be his ſervants, and that which they have, his in ſome ſort; yet
he hath ſome ſpeciall ſervants that are nearer to him and more
particularlie regarded. He hath particular <hi>houſes,</hi> and <hi>poſſeſſions,</hi>
and <hi>jewels,</hi> and <hi>treaſures</hi> of his own, ſo it is with God; They
that feare him, are his particular ſervants, they are his <hi>Houſe</hi>
wherein he walketh, they are his <hi>Vineyard</hi> which he hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and which he manureth, they are his <hi>Jewels</hi> and his <hi>Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Treaſure</hi> as he calleth them himſelf: ſo it cannot be but
they are deare to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">13. 2. reaſon.</note> Conſider that he is ſuch a <hi>King</hi> as is both willing
and able to maintaine his own. Yee know that it is ſaid in the
end of the Lords praier; <hi>thine is the kingdome and the power and the
glorie.</hi> As the <hi>kingdome</hi> is his, ſo <hi>glorie</hi> is his, whereof he is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
aboue all things and as the <hi>glorie</hi> is his, ſo <hi>power</hi> is his, he is
able to vindicate his glorie and to maintaine his ſervants againſt
all that dare injure them. Earthly kings ſomtimes forſake their
ſervants for want of power: but the <hi>power</hi> of this King is <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,</hi>
able to ſecure all his friends and to ſubdue al his enemies.
<hi>If God be with us, who can be againſt us?</hi> ſaith the holy Apoſtle. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the kings of the earth would take counſell and princes would
gather themſelves together, yet he that ſitteth in heaven, but laugheth
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100463:35"/>
at them and hath them in deriſion. He can break them with a rod of
iron, and daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſel.</hi> His <hi>rod</hi> is the rod
of ſtrength, <hi>he rules in the midſt of his enemies, and ſtricketh through
kings in the day of his wrath</hi> Pſalm. 110. So then if we believe
that we have ſuch a Lord and ſuch a king, why do we fear for
the terrours &amp; troubles of this world? Hear what DAVID ſaith
Pſalm. 99. <hi>The Lord reigneth let the people tremble.</hi> Suppoſe all the
people of the world conſpired againſt thee, theſe three words
ſtedfaſtly believed, <hi>the Lord reigneth,</hi> is enough to give thee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and courage. Whatſoever injuries are done this Lord ſeeth
and will redreſſe and revenge in his own time. <hi>The Lord reigneth</hi>
ſaieth that ſame DAVID Pſalm. 93. <hi>His throne is eſtabliſhed, the
floods haue lifted vp, O Lord, the floods haue lifted vp their voice, the
floods haue lifted vp their waves. The Lord on high, is mightier then
the voice of many waters, yea then the mightie waves of the ſea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be thou will ſay to me,<note place="margin">14. Why Hee permitteth our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> how cometh it to paſſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that the ſervants of this great King are ſo many wayes afflicted
and troubled? Conſider I beſeech thee, that in al thy afflictions
he hath a ſupreame hand. Now all that thou haſt, is his; &amp; he
may do with his own what he will. Thy <hi>wealth,</hi> thy <hi>promotion,</hi>
thy <hi>children,</hi> yea thy <hi>life,</hi> is his: he gave all &amp; he may take back
againe all when he will. Theſe things he hath but committed
unto thee, reſerving ſtil the dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them to himſelf, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may require them back againe at his pleaſure. Beſide I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
thy own conſcience, did ever any thing befal thee ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
in thy life, but thy ſinnes deſerved as much, yea a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
times more? laſtly conſider, that as he is a moſt abſolute, ſo he
is a moſt <hi>Gracious</hi> Lord and moſt <hi>wiſe,</hi> who dealeth with us ſo
here as he knoweth is moſt fitting for our eternall well. He
looketh not only to that which is preſent but alſo to eternitie,
and afflicteth us here that hereafter it may be well with us for
ever.<note place="margin">15. His power to convert us.</note> 
               <hi>We are Iudged by the Lord, that wee periſh not with the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the conſideration, of this great dominion of God
it giveth us confidence to put up the ſecond petition of the
PROPHET and to ſay with him; <hi>turne thou us O Lord, and we ſhal
be turned.</hi> This great Lord and King hath power of the <hi>ſoule</hi> &amp;
<hi>ſpirit</hi> aſwel as the <hi>body,</hi> &amp; can work upon it no leſſe then upon
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100463:36"/>
the <hi>body,</hi> the power of earthly kings reaches no further then the
<hi>body,</hi> they cannot draw the <hi>heart</hi> effectually and infalliblie, but
God can ſubdue the heart unto his <hi>ſcepter,</hi> and can make them
that were averſe and unwilling to be a willing people. Pſalm.
110. <hi>He can enlighten the minde, create a clean heart, and renew a
right ſpirit. He can take away the hert of stone and give us a heart of
fleſh, he can put his ſpirit within us, and cauſe us to walk in his ſtatutes
and keep his Iudgements.</hi> Paul was a <hi>perſecuter,</hi> but no ſooner did
the heavenly light of this great Lord ſhine upon him, no ſooner
did his hand touch his heart, but he cryed out, <hi>Lord what will
thou haue me to do?</hi> Before he was his enemie &amp; perſecuter, now
his obedient ſervant, and acknowledgeth him to be the Lord,
and ſeeketh no more but to know what he would haue done, or
what he would have him to ſuffer, profeſſing that he was ready
to obey. So albeit thou have turned away from this Lord, yet
diſpaire not, he is ſo infinitely <hi>good</hi> and <hi>powerfull,</hi> that he can,
and will turne thee back againe to him, if thou ſeek it of him;
as thou ought. Which the Lord grant unto us, and that for the
merits of Chriſt Ieſus: To whom. &amp;c.</p>

to God a fervent prayer for his church, of whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe
he had made a moſt pittifull complaint in the words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.
He prayeth for two things, firſt that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
his favour and the former fruits thereof unto his people.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100463:36"/>
This he ſeeketh firſt, ſecretly by a loving expoſtulation, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doſt thou forget us for ever &amp;c.</hi> And thereafter expreſly and
directly, <hi>renew our dayes as of Old.</hi> The ſecond thing which he
prayeth for, without which the firſt could not be had, is their
converſion or turning againe to God, <hi>Turne thou us unto thee O
Lord, And we ſhall be turned.</hi> The ground of theſe petitions, &amp; of
his confidence to be heard in them is ſet down in the firſt verſe,
and it is Gods own nature and the perfections thereof, <hi>Thou O
Lord &amp;c.</hi> Here three things are aſcrived to God. Firſt <hi>immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</hi>
Secondly <hi>a dominion</hi> and <hi>kingdome.</hi> Thirdly <hi>eternitie,</hi> which
belongeth to himſelf and to his kingdome. <hi>Thou O Lord,</hi> ſaieth
he, <hi>remaineſt for ever, and thy throne &amp;c.</hi> Of the ſecond and firſt
we haue ſpoken already: let us come now to the third. Which
we ſhall handle in this order; firſt we ſhall ſhow what this <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi>
is. Secondly that it belongeth both to God and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Thirdly we ſhall give you the uſes of this doctrine.</p>
            <p>To come to the firſt,<note place="margin">2 Eternitie is one with Gods eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</note> yee are to underſtand that the <hi>eternitie</hi>
of God, which is the only and properly ſo called <hi>eternitie,</hi> is not
a thing diverſe from his nature or eſſence. There is nothing in
God which is not God, and one and the ſame with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature. So the <hi>eternitie</hi> of God is nothing elſe but this own
divine <hi>eſſence</hi> or <hi>exiſtence</hi> conſidered as it abideth &amp; perſevereth
indeficiently &amp; unmeaſurably without beginning or end.<note place="margin">We cannot conceive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity but after the manner of time.</note> Wee
cannot conceive this indurance of God but with a reference to
the time of indurance of the creatures, as we cannot conceive
the <hi>immenſitie</hi> of God but with a reference to a bodily ſpace,
wherein the creatures are or may be, and therefore the <hi>eternitio</hi>
of God as conceived by us, includeth a reference to the duratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; continuance of other things, whereas in it ſelf it differeth
from them infinitelie.</p>
            <p>For the more particular underſtanding of this point ye are
to conſider that the <hi>eternitie</hi> of God hath three notable proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.<note place="margin">3. It is unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable.</note>
Firſt it is ſuch a duration that hath neither beginning nor
end, but is altogether unmeaſurable time may be meaſured, and
is meaſured by our minds, and uſed as a meaſure of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of other things. It had a beginning, and ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it 6000. years are not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> yet paſt. But if we ſhould go
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100463:37"/>
beyond this time 100000. years, yea millions of ages, we ſhould
come infinitely ſhort of <hi>Eternitie</hi> which hath no beginning at
all. So time ſhall haue an end, but if we go beyond that end as
many millions of ages as there are ſtares in heaven, pickles of
ſand on the ſea ſhoar, drops of water in the ocean, yet are we
infinitely ſhort of the length of <hi>eternitie,</hi> which hath no end at
all. So it is an indurance ſimplie and altogether unmeaſurable.</p>
            <p>The ſecond propertie of it, is that it is ſuch an indurance as
hath no fluxe in it,<note place="margin">4. It is all at once.</note> no ſucceſſion of one part to another, but is
all at once &amp; altogether indiviſible. Time ye know is a fluid &amp;
paſſing thing. One part of it is gone, which we call time by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt,
another part is yet to come, and a moment only is preſent
which hath no abiding, but paſſeth away incontinent. Such are
our joyes alſo that are in time, they remaine not, though we
would faine arreſt them, they are no ſooner come but they are
gone, and no ſooner braid as it were, but they die. IT is farre
otherwayes with the <hi>eternitie</hi> of God, and with that which is
truly eternall. Here nothing is bypaſt, nothing to come, but all
at once abiding, ſteble and ſtadfaſt. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is true we imagine two
parts in <hi>eternitie,</hi> one already bypaſt before all ages that we can
conceive, another as yet to come behinde all ages that we can
imagine: but indeed there are no ſuch parts in <hi>eternitie</hi> which is
as it were a ſtanding and permanent moment. In like manner
when we ſpeak of God, we ſay, that he was, that he is, and is to
come; but thus we ſpeak in reference to the things that haue
beene or ſhall be, with which his being doth exiſt, otherwayes
if we will ſpeak of him as he is in himſelf; Words of the preſent
time belong properly to him. All that which we conceive in
him as extended throughout the tract of infinite time, is in him
united &amp; gathered altogether at once. As his <hi>immenſitie</hi> gathers
al his <hi>greatnes</hi> together as it wer in a point, ſo his <hi>eternitie</hi> gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
as it were all his <hi>duration age</hi> and <hi>life</hi> into a moment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any diviſion or ſucceſſion. Hence no <hi>vitall act,</hi> no <hi>knowledge,</hi>
no <hi>thought,</hi> no <hi>love,</hi> no <hi>hatred,</hi> no <hi>liking</hi> nor <hi>diſliking,</hi> no <hi>joy</hi> nor
<hi>bleſſe</hi> is in God now, which was not in him from all <hi>eternitie,</hi>
whereas the thoughts and words and affections of men &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
ſucceed one to another. There is nothing that we can
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100463:37"/>
conceive which is to be done, which is not already done with
God. Nothing concerneth us, which is not there already deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
and tranſacted. There we and all our actions are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
and weighted. There our eternall <hi>reward,</hi> or eternall <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi>
is prepared, and in a manner already given. There wee
reigne in glory with God and his angels, or burne in flames of
fire for ever with the devill and his angels. So <hi>Eternitie</hi> ſtill
ſtandeth and remaineth, whereas in <hi>Time</hi> there is a continuall
fluxe. I may compare <hi>Eternitie</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> to the <hi>Banke</hi> and the
<hi>River.</hi> The <hi>Banke</hi> yee know ſtandeth ſtill, but the <hi>River</hi> floweth
under it continually: one part having paſt already, &amp; another
comeing in the roome of it; <hi>Eternitie</hi> is, as it were, the <hi>Banke</hi>
ſtanding ſtedfaſt, <hi>Time</hi> and the <hi>Things temporall</hi> are, as it were,
the <hi>River</hi> running and flowing under <hi>Eternitie,</hi> one part having
paſſed, and another ſucceeding in place thereof. And ſo yee
have the ſecond propertie, which is very wonderfull.</p>
            <p>The third propertie of it is,<note place="margin">5. It is ſo of it ſelf.</note> 
               <hi>That of it ſelf it hath theſe former
perfections, of it ſelf, and without dependence from any other.</hi>
God who is <hi>Eternall</hi> and <hi>Eternitie</hi> it ſelf, is unmeaſurable in his
indurance, and in all his perfections united and gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at once. Hee hath this, I ſay, of himſelf, and by vertue of
the inward perfection of his <hi>Nature,</hi> independently from the
will of any other. His <hi>Indurance</hi> leaneth not to any other thing,
but one the contrare, is the ground and foundation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of all other things, &amp; that inexhauſted <hi>Fountaine</hi> from
which the duration of the creatures, and of all the branches
thereof flow: and that ſo far forth, that the <hi>indurance</hi> of any
other thing cannot be ſo much as conceived or imagined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
dependence from it. This is the third propertie.<note place="margin">6. It maketh good or evil infinitel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Before wee go hence, wee may remark that this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Eternitie,</hi> to make every thing good or evill, infinitely
better or infinitly worſe. This is doth firſt in reſpect of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<hi>indura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> of it. Ye know that any thing which is good, is the
better the longer it continue. That good which continueth a
week, is better then that which endureth but a day, and that
which continueth a yeare, is better then that which continueth
but a week; but if it ſhould continue an hundreth yeares, it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100463:38"/>
ſhould bee yet much better: if then this good of <hi>Ioy,</hi> or <hi>richet,</hi>
or <hi>honour</hi> continue for ever, it muſt needs be infinitely better
then that which endureth but for a time. So on the other part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Evill which continueth a week, is worſe then that which
continueth but a day; and if it continue a yeare, it is yet worſe:
but if it endure for ever, it is infinitly worſe. 2. <hi>Eternitie</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the good or evill upon which it falleth, infinitly better or
worſe, by reaſon it gathereth together at once, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
all the good or evill which is in ſuch a thing, and maketh
it in ſome manner to be apprehended &amp; felt at once. IT is true,
The <hi>Eternitie</hi> of the <hi>joy</hi> or <hi>paine</hi> of the creature, doth not unite
and collect the good or evill, as the <hi>eternitie</hi> of God; yet in
ſome ſort it doeth it. <hi>Eternitie</hi> of <hi>joy</hi> in the bleſſed, includeth an
aſſurance of never loſſing their joy, which maketh all that joy
which is in <hi>Eternitie</hi> to bee in a manner preſent every moment:
ſo <hi>eternitie</hi> of <hi>paine</hi> in the damned, includeth a certainty that
there ſhall never be any eaſe or end of it, which being alwayes
before the eyes of the damned, maketh the whole weyght of
eternall paine to preſſe them as it were at once. This much of
the firſt point; I come to the ſecond, to ſhew that this <hi>Eternitie</hi>
belongeth to God and to his kingdome.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">7. It belonges to GOD.</note> that it belongeth to God, is moſt cleare. <hi>Haſt thou not

                  </gap>oftie One that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth
eternitie. What elſe is the riches and treaſure of God? but Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi>
ſaieth TERTULL. There is nothing more proper unto
God, or which is more fit to expreſſe his divine Nature.</p>
            <p>Neither doth this <hi>Eternitie</hi> belong only to Himſelf. <hi>Thou O
Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">8. His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom never began.</note> 
               <hi>remainest for ever,</hi> ſaith the Prophet here, <hi>and thy throne
from generation to generation. Thy kingdome is an everlaſting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations,</hi> ſaieth
DAVID, pſal. 145. If wee look to the ages bypaſt, before all
ages, even from <hi>eternitie</hi> God is King and Lord. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſome difficultie in explaining of this. <hi>Dominion</hi> importeth
a reference to ſubjects; now the creatures which are ſubject to
God, were not from <hi>eternitie,</hi> but made in time; and therefore
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100463:38"/>
it would ſeeme that <hi>Dominion</hi> agreeth not to God but in time.
TERTUL. moved by this argument, granteth that the Tytle of
<hi>LORD,</hi> belongeth not to God but in time. <hi>The Name of GOD,</hi>
ſaieth he, <hi>is a Name of nature and ſubstance, and therefore belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to GOD from eternitie: but the Name of LORD, is a Name of
dignitie and authoritie which God hath over the creatures, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as they were not eternall, ſo this name agreeth not to him from
eternitie.</hi> S. Auguſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his 12. book of the City God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 15.
chap. in modeſtie refuſeth to determine this queſtion. <hi>Vpon
the one part</hi> he ſaieth, <hi>that he dare not deny but God was LORD
from all eternitie, and one the other part</hi> he ſaieth <hi>it is hard to conceive
this, ſince Dominion importeth a reſpect to the creatures, which begane
in time.</hi> But if we conſider well, we will find that the queſtion
is rather verball then reall. For clearing whereof ye are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that there are two things imported by the <hi>Dominion</hi> of
God. The firſt which is the chief and principall is his power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all things that actually are, or are poſſible. The ſecond is a
reference unto the creatures ſubject unto God. This belongeth
unto God but in time: but it is nothing elſe then an outward &amp;
ſecondarie reſpect: that which is inward and principall in the
<hi>Dominion</hi> of God to wit, his <hi>Power</hi> was from <hi>eternitie,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is truly from <hi>eternitie</hi> LORD. His <hi>Dominion</hi> is grounded
on his <hi>Power,</hi> which is one with his eſſence and that is <hi>eternall.</hi>
Neither is it the creatures that actually are, who alone are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to him. Even the things that are not, at under his <hi>Dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi>
he calleth the things that are not, as if they were. They obey his
commandement; and commandement preſuppoſeth <hi>Dominion</hi>
by vertue whereof it hath power. Thus the <hi>Dominion</hi> of God
was from all <hi>eternitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">9. It ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver end.</note> It we look to following ages, this <hi>Dominion</hi> and
<hi>Kingdome</hi> endureth after them to all <hi>eternitie.</hi> This is true both
of Gods <hi>Kingdome</hi> generally and particularly conſidered. That
is the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of his <hi>Power</hi> (as it is called) by which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
and ruleth all things. It is certaine this <hi>Kingdome</hi> ſhall
never end: for God ſhal ever have ſupreame power over things
that are or are poſſible. His particular <hi>Kingdome,</hi> is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he reigneth in his church, and this alſo ſhall have no end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:100463:39"/>
Hence the Angell ſpeaking of our Saviour LUKE 1. ſaieth <hi>Hee
ſhall reigne in the houſe of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdome there
ſhall be no end.</hi> Wee muſt not think that this <hi>Kingdome of</hi> God
and Chriſt ſhall end, when this World endeth; no, it ſhall be
moſt perfected and eſtabliſhed, when all other <hi>Rule, Authority</hi>
and <hi>Power</hi> ſhall be put down. Here it is the kingdome of <hi>grace,</hi>
God ruling in the hearts of his ſervants by his Spirit &amp; grace:
hereafter it ſhall be the kingdome of <hi>Glory,</hi> wherein the glory
of Gods <hi>Wiſdome, Mercie</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> ſhall be manifeſted in the
eternall ſalvation of his own, and the glory of his <hi>Power</hi> and
<hi>juſtice</hi> ſhall appeare in the eternall confuſion of his enemies.
Now the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of God is, but not peaceable: now his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are overcome, but not wholly rooted out and trampled
under foot. Sathan remaineth yet, <hi>and goeth about like a roaring
Lyon, ſeeking whom hee may devoure. Sinne</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> remain.
As yet there are many that rebell againſt the <hi>Law</hi> of God, and
deſpiſe his <hi>Commandements:</hi> but all theſe enemies ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
rooted out: <hi>Sathan</hi> with his angels ſhall be chained in hel,
and ſhall have no more leave to tempt. <hi>Sin</hi> ſhall be baniſhed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
in the godly it ſhall not be. Their fleſh ſhall no more reſiſt
the ſpirit, and the ſpirit God: and the <hi>wicked</hi> ſhall have no more
liberty to commit any new ſin. <hi>Death</hi> ſhall be rooted out by
the reſurrection; ſo that we may then ſing, <hi>Death is ſwallowed
up in victorie, O death, where is thy ſting? O grave where is thy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie?</hi>
Laſtly, <hi>wicked men</hi> the rebels of this great KING, and
diſobedient to his Will, ſhall be ſubjected to eternal pains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their will, whereas the ſervants of God ſhall be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the participation of his eternall glory. Thus this his
<hi>Kingdome</hi> ſhall be <hi>Eternal,</hi> and not only ſo in reſpect of himſelf,
but alſo in reſpect of his ſervants. <hi>Feare not little flock,</hi> ſaith our
Saviour, <hi>it is your Father will to give you a kingdom. To him that
overcometh will I give</hi> ſaith he, Rev. 3. <hi>to ſit with me in my Throne,

which are but fraile and momentanie: ſuppoſe they endured
never ſo long, yet at laſt they have an end; and when that end
is come; they are, as though they had never been. Put the caſe

of the World, yet theſe ſhould end, and being ended leave thee
nothing but a ſad and ſorrowfull remembrance of them, and
the more ſad and bitter, the more ſweet and deare they were
to thee when thou had them. I will yet ſay more, theſe things
not only have an end, but alſo end ſuddenly to us. Their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
is moſt uncertaine and ſhort. All our enjoying of them
is grounded upon this mortall life; and how fraile that is, wee

continue a year, and buy, and ſell, and get gain. And yee know not
what ſhall be to morrow: for what is your life? but a vapour that
appeareth for a little whyle, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> Now the life
being ended, all this World endeth to us. That which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

is it to a man to gaine the whole World, if he loſſe his bodily life?</hi>
More, our <hi>health</hi> is more uncertaine then <hi>life,</hi> and without it we

What is the whole man but, as it were, an <hi>earthen veſſel,</hi> which
God in whoſe hand is a rod of <hi>Iron,</hi> is able to daſh in pieces

a hundreth year in <hi>fire,</hi> and yet take a thouſand and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

               <hi>contempt</hi> here. Theſe ſeeme to us ſo terrible monſters, that to
eſchew them we care not what we do, even againſt God, and
againſt conſcience: but what are theſe to eternall <hi>fire</hi> and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<hi>darknes</hi> and to the eternall companie of the <hi>Devill</hi> &amp; his
<hi>Angels.</hi> Would God this <hi>eternitie</hi> were alwayes before our eyes
and deeply ſettled in our hearts. It alone were enough to beat
down all our <hi>pride,</hi> to breake the hardeſt heart, and daunt the
ſtouteſt courage of bold &amp; impenitent ſinners. It alone were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to make us detaſte all wickednes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which this eternall

if he conſidered deeply that his <hi>Luſt</hi> will kindle a fire, which
will burn both the <hi>ſoul</hi> &amp; the <hi>body</hi> for ever, &amp; that it will breed

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, The conſideration of this <hi>eternitie</hi> ſhould make us
carefull of the right uſe of this preſent time. Since though
it be but a moment;<note place="margin">14. Tyme ſhould not bee spent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> idlely.</note> yet from the uſe of it our eternall well or

not to miſpend our time in things unneceſſare &amp; unprofitable.
The time is ſhort and precious in reſpect of the uſe of it; thou
are ſtill haſting to the <hi>Tribunall</hi> of the great Iudge, who is to
paſſe an eternall ſentence of thy <hi>Bodie</hi> and <hi>Soul:</hi> what folly then
is it, to ſpend the ſhort time upon things, which will availl us
nothing then? Hee might be juſtly accounted a foole, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This ſhould teach us not only to abſtain from vain

theſe things which may further us to the obtaining of this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

made to them. The means of attaining it, were ſo liberally of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
unto them, that they were in a manner already in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

<hi>God continued his Kingdome no longer with them.</hi> Let us
not therfore flatter our ſelves with a vain hope of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
if wee walk not in the high way of wel-doing which leadeth
unto it. If God reign not in our hearts by his <hi>Grace</hi> here, we ſhal
never reign hereafter in <hi>Glory</hi> with him. Good reaſon it ſhould
be ſo. If we do otherwayes, we but advance the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of

THeſe words are a part of a <hi>ſong</hi> endyted by Gods Spirit to
ISAIAH,<note place="margin">1. Intention of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</note> and delivered by him to the people of God, not
only for the comfort of them who were then, but alſo, for the
comfort of all them who in following ages ſhould bee in like
manner diſtreſſed. The PROPHET had foreſeen, and had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
alſo, that great <hi>calamities</hi> were to come upon the people of
the <hi>Jews,</hi> then Gods Church; Namly that they ſhould be lead in
captivitie to <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp; there, ſhould be forced to endure what
the furie of a cruel enemie, pleaſed to inflict. The conſideration
of this, before it came to paſs &amp; much more the feeling of it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
might have ſwallowed up that people with griefe &amp;
diſpair. Therfore the holy PROPHET endyts to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this <hi>ſong</hi> of
<hi>thanksgiving,</hi> not only that they might praiſe God after this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

when they ſhould be delivered, but alſo, that in the time of

his people, inſtructeth them what to do, and exhorteth
them to the performance of theſe duties which were required
upon their part, to make them partakers of the <hi>Promiſes.</hi> All
this he ſetteth down be way of a <hi>ſong,</hi> that it might be the more
eaſily learned, the more firmly retained, &amp; the better remarked
by all <hi>poſteritie.</hi> There is nothing in holy ſcripture, which is not

the <hi>forme</hi> and <hi>ſtyle</hi> of a <hi>ſong,</hi> as this, and that other before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
This much ſhortly for the <hi>generall.</hi> I am come now to

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou will keep him &amp;c.</hi> In theſe words firſt is ſet down a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
promiſe with an eye to the <hi>calamitees</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> that wer
ſhortly to enſue as was ſaid. <hi>Thou wilt keep him &amp;c.</hi> 2. we have
an exhortation to them and to all the godly to put their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100463:42"/>
alwayes in God.<note place="margin">3. The firſt part.</note> 
               <hi>Truſt ye in the Lord Jehovah for ever &amp;c.</hi>
To returne to the firſt, we have in it firſt the benefit promiſed,
to wit; <hi>That God will keep in perfect peace,</hi> ſecondly the <hi>deſcription</hi>
of them whom he will ſo preſerve, even <hi>them whoſe mind is ſtayed
on him &amp; that truſt in him. For thou wilt keep him &amp;c.</hi> Firſt a little
of the words then of the matter. The words are pregnant <hi>peace</hi>
is doubled in the originall. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in peace peace. &amp;c.</hi>
In the hebrew language <hi>Peace</hi> is uſed to ſignifie not only that
which we call ſo, but alſo the <hi>aboundance</hi> and <hi>affluence</hi> of all the
good which we can wiſh, &amp; the word is redoubled in this <hi>place</hi>
to ſignifie the <hi>Greatnes</hi> or <hi>Perfection,</hi> the <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuetie,</hi>
of this <hi>Peace.</hi> Secondly it is not ſaid only that God will
give this <hi>peace,</hi> but that he will keep a man in it, and the word is
pregnant ſignifying to <hi>preſerve,</hi> to <hi>defend,</hi> to <hi>confirme,</hi> that every
way the <hi>joy</hi> of the godly may be full. But let us now come to the
matter.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">4. Peace ſought by all,</note> 
               <hi>Peace</hi> is promiſed. <hi>Peace</hi> is all that which a man deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
All the endevours, all the actions of men bend to this,
even of them who are moſt turbulent, by <hi>fire</hi> &amp; <hi>ſword</hi> they ſeek
for that <hi>Peace</hi> which is pleaſant in their eyes. Everie one that
followeth his own will doeth or undoeth what ſeemeth good
to him, perſueth after <hi>preferment, riches, pleaſurs,</hi> but ſeeking
<hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Reſt</hi> which he imagines he will obtain, when he gets
that which he deſireth. Wherefore doth the greedie man toile
and tormoile day and night, but that he may ſay in end with the
<hi>Rich man</hi> in the goſpell, <hi>Soul take thy reſt, thou haſt much laid up
&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> In a word the deſires of our ſouls ar, as it wer, their <hi>motions,</hi>
and their <hi>Love</hi> their <hi>weight,</hi> whereby they are ſtill pouſed and
moved in the perſure and ſeeking of that which will give them
<hi>Reſt</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> which if they could obtaine they ſhould be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,
for let the heart of man have once true <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Reſt,</hi> and
it needs no more. But what is this <hi>Peace</hi> that is promiſed here
you will ſay?</p>
            <p>It is not the outward or wordly <hi>Peace:</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. Out-ward peace not meaned here.</note> for this promiſe is
made to men compaſſed about with worldly <hi>troubles</hi> and <hi>calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
The Church in this <hi>ſong</hi> profeſſeth ſo much her ſelf. <hi>O Lord
our God ſay they,</hi> Verſ. 13. <hi>other Lords beſids thee haue had dominion
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100463:43"/>
over us:</hi> and againe. <hi>Like as a woman with child, that draweth near
the time of her delivery, is in pain, &amp; crieth out in her pangs: ſo have
we been in thy ſight, O Lord, We haue been with childe, we have been
in paine, we have as it were brought forth winde, we have not wrought
any deliverance in the earth, neither have the inhabitants of the world
fallen.</hi> So by the way, ye may remarke, that the people of God
notwithſtanding of this promiſe hath not alwayes that outward
<hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Plentie</hi> which follow it. Our Saviour Ioh. 16. telleth
his diſciples. <hi>That though they ſhould have<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in him, yet in the
world they ſhould have tribulation.</hi> So in the time of the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<hi>captivitie</hi> which the PROPHET looketh unto, there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
nothing but <hi>wrath,</hi> and, <hi>warr,</hi> and, <hi>blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and, <hi>miſerie</hi> in the
words &amp; actions of God towards his people. <hi>If the people of God
rebell againſt him and vex his holy ſpirit,</hi> Iſa. 63. <hi>He turneth in ſome
ſort their enemie &amp; fighteth againſt them.</hi> If DAVID ſinne againſt
God, <hi>He breaketh his bones &amp; turneth his moyſture unto the drought
of the ſummer.</hi> IOB was a perfect man, <hi>doing good &amp; eſchewing euill</hi>
yet when it pleaſed GOD to exerciſe h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, that the graces
wrought by his Spirit in him might appear &amp; be the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
<hi>He made his terrours, to march in array againſt him, and did
write bitter things againſt him, making him to poſſeſſe the ſinnes of
his youth.</hi> Iob 13. He did write, as it wer, books againſt him, &amp;
drew, as it were, in his conſcience the characters of his <hi>wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence, It followeth firſt, that the outward <hi>trouble</hi> &amp; <hi>diſtreſſe</hi>
of any people,<note place="margin">6. GODS people hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</note> or of any man, is not a ſure argument; that God
hateth &amp; hath rejected them. The Church in the 44. Pſal. Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
<hi>Thou haſt covered us in the place of dragons, and haſt covered us
with the ſhadow of death. For thy ſake are we killed all the day: and
counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter. Yet have we not forgotten thee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have we dealt falſty in thy covenant. Our hearts have not turned
back, neither have our ſteps declined out of thy way.</hi> It is true that
theſe outward <hi>troubles</hi> are comonly the effects of Gods anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our ſins, but that ſtandeth well with his love to our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
<hi>For whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth.</hi> Heb. 12. Hence the
Church in the 7. of Micah. 8. 9. 10. <hi>Rejoyce not over me, O mine
enemie: when I fall, I ſhall riſe againe, when I ſit in darkneſſe, the
LORD ſhall be a Light unto me, I will hear the indignation of the

LORD, becauſe I have ſinned against him, untill he plead my cauſe,

and ſhame ſhall cover her which ſaid, where is the LORD thy GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly remarke, If Gods own people be not exempted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
outward <hi>troubles</hi> and <hi>calamities,</hi> what may the wicked look for?<note place="margin">7. Dreadful state of the wicked.</note>
               <hi>If judgement beginne at the houſe of God, what ſhall the end of them be
who obey not the Goſpell!</hi> If it be ſo with Gods children, who are
the children of <hi>Peace,</hi> what <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>indignation</hi> ſhall be to
them, who are the children of <hi>diſobedience</hi> &amp; <hi>wrath?</hi> flatter not
thy ſelf therefore with thy preſent <hi>Peace,</hi> wo to thee if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in ſinne, and have not made thy <hi>Peace</hi> with God, <hi>He hath
whet his ſword, he hath bent his bow and hath made ready the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of death.</hi> The time cometh wherein thou ſhalt find ſuch
<hi>terrour</hi> in his face, that thou ſhalt wiſh the hils and mountains fal
upon thee, rather then that thou ſhould be made to looke upon
it. All the creatures in like manner ſhall fight againſt thee to
revenge the quarrell of God, none of them contributing ſo
much as a <hi>drop</hi> of water to quench the heat of thy tongue. Now
let us proceed and ſee what is the <hi>Peace</hi> here ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>Since it is not the outward <hi>Peace,</hi> as we have ſaid, and yet is
a <hi>Peace</hi> promiſed to the Saints even in this life, it muſt needs be
the inward <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>tranquillitie</hi> of the minde which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
here.<note place="margin">8. Inward peace of minde here underſtood</note> This <hi>Peace</hi> is nothing elſe, but ſuch a ſtate of the mind
whereby it is ſo diſpoſed, that it is not ſhaken, either with <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie</hi>
or <hi>adverſitie,</hi> but being ſtayed on God, hath <hi>Reſt</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi>

<hi>Peace</hi> our Saviour ſpeaketh when he ſaieth Ioh. 14. <hi>Peace I give
you, my Peace I leave with you.</hi> This is that <hi>Peace</hi> of God, <hi>which
paſſeth underſtanding &amp; which keepeth our hearts &amp; minds in Chriſt

not away to <hi>errour,</hi> and that in Chriſt Ieſus that we may abide
in him, and be more and more joined to him. It maketh us fit
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100463:44"/>
to diſcerne the <hi>trueth,</hi> for it clears the minde which cannot ſee
aright, when the eye of it is troubled. It giveth joy to the heart,
<hi>For a calme and peacable minde is a continuall feaſt.</hi> It raiſeth up
in us <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>magnanimitie.</hi> As <hi>confidence</hi> be getteth <hi>peace,</hi>
ſo <hi>peace</hi> increaſeth this <hi>confidence.</hi> When a man conſidereth that
he is at one with God, hath him to be his friend &amp; Father, who
hath a moſt loving &amp; tender care of his children: when, I ſay,
a man conſidereth, weigheth and believeth this, hee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
himſelf wholly to God, that he will guide him aright in al
his wayes, and defend him againſt all his enemies. Thus ye ſee
what the <hi>peace</hi> is which here is meaned; Now let us ſee whence
it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou,</hi> to wit, <hi>O Lord,</hi> ſaith the PROPHET, <hi>will keep</hi> &amp;c. Firſt.
It is the Lord alone who giveth and keepeth this <hi>peace</hi> in us,<note place="margin">9. God alone giveth it.</note>
Hence it is called; <hi>The peace of God,</hi> and he is called <hi>The God of
peace.</hi> To proclaime <hi>warre</hi> or <hi>peace</hi> hath been accounted the
prerogative of Kings: Now God is, <hi>The King of kings, &amp; Lord
of lords,</hi> and therefore to him alone belongeth to ſettle <hi>peace,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in the ſoule. Hee is the <hi>Judge,</hi> and therefore to him
belongeth to pronunce this ſentence of <hi>peace.</hi> If a man be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned
before a <hi>Judge,</hi> his minde is not quieted, though all the
ſtanders by encourage him, and bid him be of good comfort,
till he heare <hi>abſolution</hi> out of the mouth of the <hi>Judge.</hi> So God is
the ſupreame <hi>JUDGE</hi> of the World, before whom wee ſtand
guilty, &amp; till he ſpeak <hi>peace,</hi> ther is no ſolid <hi>calmnes</hi> in our minds.
Beſide, our hearts naturally are full of <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>tormoyle,</hi> and
therefore cannot have <hi>peace</hi> unleſſe it be created in them. Now
this is the proper work of God who ſaieth, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57. to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<hi>I creat the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is a far off.</hi>
Laſtly, ſo long as ſinfull <hi>corruption</hi> is not healed in our ſoules,
their wound remaineth greene, which ſuffereth us to have no
reſt. Now it is God alone, who can heal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the ſoule, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is he only who can give <hi>peace</hi> to it; Thus the working of
this <hi>peace</hi> in us, is the peculiar work of God. If he ſtand by, no
man nor angell can give it. Hence DAVID even after the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings

have a notable place <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44. There the Lord is thus deſcrived.
<hi>The Lord who ſaieth to Jeruſalem, be thou inhabited, and to the cities
of Judah be yee built, that ſayeth unto the depth be dryed up, &amp; that
ſaieth to Cyrus his ſervant, thou art my ſheepherd, and ſhalt perform
all my pleaſure.</hi> So the Lord needeth no more but a word to
build <hi>Judah,</hi> to make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> inhabited, to remove all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
out of the way of his people, &amp; to perſwade the heart
of <hi>Cyrus</hi> an heathen man to be their nurſing father. Thus <hi>Pſal.</hi>

it ſhall be obeyed. When the ſea is moſt raging, and

This ſerveth exceedingly for our comfort, that our God whom

of them to whom it belongeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whoſe minde is ſtayed on thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">11. Stayednes of minde referred to GOD.</note> &amp;c. The words in the originall,
ſignifieth the <hi>minde</hi> or <hi>thought</hi> is ſtayed; and by ſome are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to God, by others to the godly. Learned CALVIN writting;
upon this place, referreth the words to God thus. <hi>The counſell
and purpoſe of God, whereby he hath decreed to preſerve the peace of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100463:45"/>
his ſervants is unchangeable, and therefore he will keep them in peace.</hi>
There can no alterations fall out in this world, which may
change his immutable minde; ſo there is a ſecret oppoſition
betwixt Gods thought and ours. <hi>My thoughts are not as yours,</hi>
Iſai. 55. <hi>neither are my wayes as your wayes, but as high as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is above the earth, ſo high are my thoughts above your thoughts,
and my wayes above your wayes.</hi> The minde and the counſell of
God is immutable, whereas our thoughts are changeable every
moment upon the leaſt occaſion. <hi>He is the Lord and changeth not,
and therefore wee are not conſumed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The words may bee referred to the godly, thus.
<hi>Their minds are ſtayed and fixed on God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">12. Reference of it to the Godlie.</note> and therefore <hi>he will keep
them in peace.</hi> Our Interpreters have ſo expounded the words,
and this ſeemeth beſt to agree with them. But yee will ask,
what is this to have our minds ſtayed on God? I anſwere unto
this, firſt is required that our hearts bee withdrawn from all
things elſe. Wee cannot have our minds on God and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
both, for <hi>Wee cannot ſerve two maſters.</hi> Hence our bleſſed
Lord requireth of his diſciples that <hi>they deny themſelves,</hi> and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them, <hi>that none can be his diſciple, except he hate father, and
mother, wiſe, and children,</hi> &amp;c. So it wee would have our hearts
ſtayed on God, they muſt ſettle upon nothing beſids him,</p>
            <p>This is neceſſarie for the obtaining of our <hi>peace,</hi> which wee
cannot enjoy ſo long as our hearts are fixed upon any creature.
The reaſons are cleare;<note place="margin">13. Withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie.</note> Firſt, the creatures are tranſitorie and
changeable, and therefore the heart ſet upon them, muſt needs
change with them. 2. While as the heart is inordinatly ſet on
the creature, the affections are contrarie to ſound reaſon, and
our actions are contrarie to God and, his Law: ſo during this
inordinat <hi>love,</hi> we have a <hi>warre</hi> which ſtandeth not with <hi>peace.</hi>
3. As long as the heart doth cleave inordinatly to any creature,
there muſt needs bee a continuall <hi>feare,</hi> which is contrarie
to the <hi>Peace</hi> of the minde. For either wee feare, that
wee ſhall not obtaine that which wee love, or that wee ſhall
loſſe it when it is obtained, or that we ſhall not recover it when
it is loſt. Either we feare that our will ſhall be croſſed, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
our deſires ſecond us in all things, yet our guilty conſcience
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100463:45"/>
accuſeth and tormenteth us. 4. There is no creature how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
ſoever enjoyed by us that can give ſatisfaction to out
ſoules, without which they can haue no <hi>peace.</hi> Such is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
of our ſoule, ſuch is the excellencie of our minds and
wils, that a world, yea a thouſand worlds known, beloved and
poſſeſſed cannot give them <hi>rest</hi> &amp; <hi>contentment.</hi> Either the <hi>Object</hi>
delighted in, is unproportionated to the ſoule, as the ſound to
the eye, or the colour to the eare, or at leaſt is unable to equall
the infinite deſire of it. This none can do but God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>O LORD
thou haſt made us for thy ſelf,</hi> ſaieth holy AUGUST. <hi>and our hearts
are reſtleſſe till they reſt in thee.</hi> Thus when ever we would have
<hi>peace,</hi> or have our hearts on God, wee muſt withdraw them
from the creatures.</p>
            <p>The next thing that is required for ſtaying our hearts upon
God,<note place="margin">14. Neceſſitte of ſetling our love on GOD, and ſubmiſſion to his wid.</note> is that we joyne unto him by ſincere <hi>love,</hi> and by humble
ſubmiſſion of our deſires &amp; wills to his, ſo that we love nothing
but in him or for him, deſire nothing but his <hi>Glory</hi> and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of his will. This is the ſolid way to <hi>Peace,</hi> when
men will and nil the ſame things, then there is true friendſhip &amp;
a ſincere <hi>Peace.</hi> ſo it is betwixt God and us, when we deſire ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
nothing but that which pleaſeth him, fully reſting upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his holy will &amp; that out of a unfained love to his <hi>Glory.</hi> When
we are thus affected nothing can trouble us. Not the fear of the
want of any good. For if we have God, we can lacke nothing,
ſince in him is all <hi>Good. If we ſeek his Kingdome,</hi> that is himſelf
&amp; his will, <hi>all other things ſhall be casten to us.</hi> It coſteth us much
travail and time to find that pleaſure and reſt in the creature,
which we deſire, and often times we faile of that alſo, wheras
if we would imploy ſo much time and pains in ſeeking God,
we ſhould undoubtedly find both ſolid <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>reſt.</hi> I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them who go a <hi>whoring</hi> from God to the creatures, to a
man, who being a thirſt, and having a cleare fountaine neare
him, will needs go in by-wayes to a puddle, ſo that when all his
travell is ſpent, he muſt needs retu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne, and go to the fountaine,
which he left, or elſe his thirſt ſhall remaine unquenched. So is
it with thee who leaveſt God <hi>The fountaine of living waters, and
followeſt the broken ciſternes of the creatures.</hi> Thou wearieſt thy ſelf
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100463:46"/>
in difficult &amp; by-wayes. Thou ſeekeſt <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> where it is
not to be found, whereas thou might eaſily have it in God who
is the Ocean of <hi>goodnes. Come unto me</hi> ſaieth our Saviour <hi>and ye
ſhall find reſt unto your ſoules. Ho every on that thirsteth let him come
unto the waters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why ſpend ye your money for that which is not bread
and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not? Iſai.</hi> 55. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
if our <hi>love</hi> be fixed upon God and our will ſubjected to his,
and conſequently one with his, neither <hi>grief</hi> for by paſt evils,
nor <hi>fear</hi> of evils to come can trouble us. We ſhall not be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for that which is by-paſt becauſe nothing hath befallen but
that which it pleaſed God to permitt, whoſe bleſſed Will we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
and preferre unto our own. For the ſame reaſon the fear
of evils to come ſhall not diſturbe us, ſince we know nothing
can befall hereafter but according to the will of God decreeing
or permitting to which we have conformed our wils, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
nothing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſimplie come againſt out own will, which
is one with the will of God. Hence an ancient truly ſaid; <hi>That the
will of him is ever done and never croſſed, who hath reſigned his own
will, and hath ſubmitted it only to the will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any man ſhall think this a hard task<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">15. Equitie of this, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of GOD his excellency.</note> Let him conſider that
it is moſt reaſonable, whither we looke to God his <hi>excellencie</hi>
or to our own <hi>profite.</hi> For the firſt God is the <hi>ſupream Lord</hi> of al,
and hath made all things for himſelf, his infinite <hi>dignitie</hi> &amp; <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie</hi>
requireth that all things ſhould be referred to his <hi>Glory</hi>
and to the obedience of his will. in reſpect whereof all other
things are of no worth or moment. what then art thou, being
but a miſerable worme, that thou will have thy own will and
thy own deſires as if thou thy ſelf were the laſt end of thy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
what elſe is this but to equall thy ſelf to God, &amp; to put
thy ſelf as it were in his ſtead?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our own utilitie and advantage requireth this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
of our ſelves &amp; ful acquieſcing to the will of God.<note place="margin">16. Equitie of it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our profite</note> He
from <hi>eternitie</hi> hath diſpoſed all things according to the counſell
of his will, and according to the eternall Idea of his mind. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to this he made all things, and now ordereth and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
all things. Nothing eſcapeth his <hi>provide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> which reacheth
from the beginning to the end, and ordereth all things ſweetly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100463:46"/>
and wiſely &amp; powerfully. The tree loſſeth not a leafe, the ayre
loſſeth not a bird, thy head loſſeth not a haire, without his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Will. He alone knoweth both his own particular ends, &amp;
the fitteſt way to obtain them. Is it not then more profitable for
thee to be guided by his will, then by thy owne? Thy will is
blind; thou often thinkeſt that to be harmfull, which is moſt
advantagious; and that to be moſt adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tagious, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious.
Thy will is often perverſe, and ſet upon the things that
are evill. But the Will of God is guided by his undeceiveable
<hi>Wiſedome,</hi> is ever holy, &amp; moſt profitable to thee, for he loveth
thee better then thou doeſt thy ſelf. Who would not think that
he were a mad man, who will ſtand up and ſay to God. O Lord
albeit thou know the way infinitely better then I, although thou
be the ſhepheard of my ſoul, and my moſt loving Father, yet
will I not yeeld to thee, the conduct of me, but will be lead by
my ſelf. To ſay ſo, were <hi>madnes</hi> and <hi>blaſphemie,</hi> and yet in effect
thou ſaieſt as much, When thou repineſt againſt the Will of
God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude this point,<note place="margin">17. This is the way to peace.</note> we may eaſily perceive from that
which we have ſaid, that the only and undoubted way to <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie</hi>
and <hi>peace</hi> of minde, is to ſettle our hearts upon God the
true <hi>center</hi> of our ſoules and abſolutlie to ſeek nothing but him
and his Will. We may indeed deſire that which in reaſon ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
good, &amp; may uſe our beſt endevoures for obtaining of it,
but this ought ſtill to be with a ſubmiſſion of our will unto the
Will of God, which ſhould be ſo dear to us, as that we ſhould
wiſh nothing to come to us againſt it. Thus the ſervants of God
have ever calmed their minds amidſt their greateſt <hi>troubles.</hi>
When God had looſed the hand of Sathan upon IOB, upon his
<hi>bodie,</hi> upon his <hi>goods,</hi> upon his <hi>children,</hi> he found <hi>tranquillitie</hi> in
this. He ſat down and worſhiped, and ſaid <hi>Naked I came into the

15. <hi>Take back the ark againe:</hi> ſaid he <hi>to Zadok, if I ſhall find favour
in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and ſhew me both it,
&amp; his habitation. But if he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee: behold,
here am I, let him do to me as ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> So in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>Acts</hi> 21. When the diſciples could not perſwade S. PAUL to
forebeare his journey to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where he was to meete with
bonds, they ſaid <hi>The Will of the LORD be done.</hi> This ought to be

            <p>IN theſe words wee have ſet down the <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>fall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Peter ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to us.</note> even the
hight of the <hi>Fall</hi> of the holy Apoſtle, and his bleſſed <hi>Riſing</hi>
againe by repentance. This his <hi>Fall</hi> is regiſtrated in holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
not only to ſhew the trueth of divine <hi>Hiſtorie,</hi> the <hi>Pen-men</hi>
wherof concealeth not the <hi>faults</hi> of them that were moſt deare
unto them, as commonly humane Hiſtorians do: but alſo it
was written for our inſtruction &amp; comfort; <hi>That they who ſtand,
may take heed, leſt they fall, &amp; they who have fallen, may learn how
to riſe.</hi> The regiſtrating of this <hi>Historie</hi> is, as it were, a
ſending of <hi>S. Peter</hi> by God to teach us this. I may ſay of him,
as holy AUGUST. ſpeaketh of DAVID, upon 51 pſal. <hi>As Nathan</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:100463:48"/>
ſaieth he, <hi>was ſent to David, ſo David is ſent to thee, whil as his fal

him crying, Have mercie upon me O Lord, according to thy tender
mercies, &amp;c. Hee cryeth, that thou mayeſt learne how to cry, hee

is ſet before our eyes in this <hi>hiſtorie,</hi> that hee may be a preacher
to us of our humane <hi>frailtie,</hi> of the <hi>mercie</hi> of God, and a patern
of <hi>repentance.</hi> That we may make our uſe herof more fruitfully,
Wee ſhall firſt ſet down in order the <hi>Summe</hi> of the <hi>Historie,</hi> of
that which we have read out of all the foure Evangeliſts.</p>
            <p>The unlearned &amp; unconſiderat READER might think,<note place="margin">2. The hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> That
the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> agree not well in relating this <hi>Hiſtorie:</hi> but if
wee compare them together, wee ſhall find a very ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and that the cauſe of the apparent diſagreement is, only
that one hath that, which another wanteth. Now according to
them all, this is the <hi>Historie.</hi> Our LORD being arraigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Cajaphas</hi> and his Councell the night before his death, <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
having followed him to the HALL of the high Prieſt, and
having twice denyed him there, is now the third time aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Firſt about the ſpace of an houre after his ſecond deniall,
one cometh to him, and affirmeth confidently or ſtrongly (as
<hi>S. Luke</hi> telleth us) and confirmeth his <hi>ſaying</hi> with this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>That he was of Galilee,</hi> where Chriſt for the greateſt part
converſed, and whence the greateſt part of his diſciples were.
By occaſion of this ſome others ſtanding by, (as <hi>S. Matth.</hi> and
<hi>S. Mark</hi> importeth) urge him in like manner, <hi>Of a truth,</hi> ſay
they, <hi>this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean, and his ſpeech
bewrayeth him to be ſuch an one.</hi> There was but one language in
the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Syriack</hi> at that time; but there
was a diverſitie in the pronunciation and manner of ſpeech,
betwixt the <hi>Galileans</hi> and others, as there is in our own or any
other country, betwixt them that are of diverſe provinces.
Notwithſtanding of all this, <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſtandeth to his deniall. In
the meane time, <hi>There cometh a ſervant of the high Prieſt, a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of his whoſe care Peter had cut off.</hi> (as we learn from <hi>S. Iohn</hi>)
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100463:49"/>
and he preſſed the Apoſtle more perempterly; <hi>Did I not ſee thee
in the garden with him,</hi> ſaieth he? as if he would have ſaid, <hi>How
dareſt thou refuſe? how caneſt thou deny? Did I not ſee thee with theſe
eyes of mine with him in the garden?</hi> Here the Apoſtle being
brought to a perempter perceiving himſelf to be in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and fearing that he ſhould be arreigned aſwell as his Lord,
and expoſed to the cruelty of the <hi>Jews</hi> aſwell as he; hee is not
content ſimply to deny him, but he doeth it with oaths &amp; exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations,
ſwearing and curſing <hi>that he knew not the man, that he
did not ſo much as know what they ſaid Now immediatly while hee
is yet speaking, the Cock croweth the ſecond time,</hi> as <hi>S. Mark</hi> telleth
us, <hi>and Jeſus turning him about, looked upon S. Peter, Whereupon
he remembred and called to minde the words of Jeſus, How hee had
ſaid; Before the Cock crow twice, thou ſhalt deny me thrice: and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
upon this, he went out and wept bitterly.</hi> This is the <hi>Historie</hi>
in order.</p>
            <p>In it there are two particulars chiefly conſiderable. Firſt, his
<hi>Fall</hi> or <hi>ſin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Peter tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deuieth Chriſt.</note> ſecondly his <hi>Riſing</hi> or <hi>repentance.</hi> For clearing the
firſt, Wee ſhall conſider firſt; his <hi>ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſecondly the <hi>grievouſneſſe</hi>
of it, and Thirdly ſhall ſhew you, what <hi>uſe</hi> ſhould be made by
us thereof. But before we enter into theſe particulars, yee are
to underſtand that ſome have excuſed or extenuated this <hi>ſin</hi> of
<hi>Peter,</hi> that either they thought it no <hi>ſin,</hi> or a very ſmall one,
but this is well refuted by <hi>S Jerome, If</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>we affirme that
Peter denied not Chriſt, then we give Christ the lie, who ſaid, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the cock crow twice, thou ſhalt deny mee thrice.</hi> To this ſame
purpoſe holy <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in 66. Treatiſe upon <hi>Iohn: If Christ spake
trueth, whereof to doubt is impietie, then</hi> PETER <hi>indeed denied</hi>
Chriſt. <hi>Let us not accuſe Chriſt,</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>to defend Peter; let hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
infirmitie acknowledge its ſin, for in him that was Trueth is
ſelf there could bee no lie. S. Peter</hi> himſelf acknowledged both
the <hi>ſin</hi> and the <hi>grievouſneſſe</hi> thereof, he refuteth his <hi>defenders,</hi> &amp;
his tears are witneſſes againſt them. Let us come now to the
firſt point, and conſider his <hi>ſin</hi> what it was.</p>
            <p>Firſt in that he denied the LORD,<note place="margin">4. Branches of his ſin.</note> he ſinned againſt <hi>Trueth;</hi>
and that two wayes, firſt becauſe he denied that he knew him,
whom indeed he knew very well. Secondly, becauſe hee break
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100463:49"/>
his promiſe to his Lord, which was. <hi>That he would not deny him,
though he ſhould die for him.</hi> 2. He ſinned againſt <hi>faith;</hi> For the
commandement wherby we are tyed to beleeve, bindeth us not
only to beleeve inwardly, but alſo outwardly to confeſſe; <hi>For
with the heart man beleeveth unto righteouſnes, and with the mouth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
is made unto ſalvation.</hi> 3. He ſinned by <hi>perjurie,</hi> calling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
God and deſiring him to bear witnes to his lie. 4. He ſinned by
<hi>curſing,</hi> and wiſhing all kinde of miſchief to himſelf, if he ſpake
not trueth. All theſe wayes he ſinned in this his third deniall.
Now let us conſider the <hi>grievouſneſſe</hi> of his ſin.</p>
            <p>For clearing of this point conſider firſt. That he many wayes
offended before his deniall.<note place="margin">5. Grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his deniall.</note> Firſt, there was in him too great
confidence of himſelf and over-wee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing of his own ſtrength.
Hence when our Lord. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 36. Said, <hi>Thou canſt not follow me
now; he anſwered, Lord why cannot I follow thee now? I am ready to
go with thee both to priſon and to death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and againe, <hi>Though all men
ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e offended at thee, yet I will never be offended.</hi> Secondly there
was a kind of misbeleeving the words of our Lord; for he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
him of his <hi>fall,</hi> and yet he would not take heed unto it.
Thirdly, he neglected that commandement; <hi>Wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h and pray that
ye enter not into temptation. For the ſpirit indeed is readie, but the fleſb
is weak.</hi> He was ſleeping ſound, when he ſhould have been <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>praying.</hi> Fourthly, when he followed Chriſt he followed
him coldly, &amp; a far off, &amp; did not cleave to him neatly &amp; ferve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as his true follower ſhould have done. Fiftly, by entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the HAL of the High Prieſt amongſt his enemies, he did caſt
himſelf into danger, without neceſſity or any calling. Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
waies he procureth his own <hi>Fall,</hi> which aggravateth his <hi>ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">6. his curſing</note> There are many things concurring in his <hi>ſinne</hi>
which doth greatly aggravate it, Firſt, he not only denied
Chriſt, but alſo he denied him with <hi>oaths,</hi> againe and again, and
not content with this, he curſed and anathematized himſelf, if
it was not ſo, as he ſaid. The <hi>word</hi> uſed in the original ſignifieth
that he wiſheth himſelf to be an <hi>Anathema,</hi> which is as much as
one that is accurſed, execrable and unworthy of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of good men, and that is devoted and appointed for <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell.</hi>
The <hi>word</hi> which the <hi>Syrian</hi> Interpreter uſeth ſignifieth to <hi>deſtroy</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:100463:50"/>
and <hi>aboliſh,</hi> &amp; in the old Teſtament co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſignifieth <hi>A thing
devoted to God, which cannot be redeemed, but muſt needs be aboliſhed
and deſtroyed.</hi> So the Apoſtle by this <hi>anathematizing</hi> or <hi>curſing</hi>
wiſhed all miſchiefs to himſelf, both to his body and ſoule,
which is no leſſe then eternal condemnation. Neither did hee
ſimply curſe this way, but hee did it vehemently, as the word
uſed by <hi>S. Matth.</hi> importeth.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe there had been no more,<note place="margin">7. How grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous a ſin it is.</note> This <hi>curſing</hi> was a grievous
<hi>ſin.</hi> God oftentimes even in this life hath declared his <hi>Wrath</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it by dreadfull judgements. In this kinde we have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
example in <hi>Euſebius</hi> his eccleſiaſtick Hiſt. 6. book and 8.
chapter. There he reporteth, that three wicked men had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
againſt <hi>Narciſſus</hi> Biſhop of IERUSALEM, in the time of
the Emperour <hi>Severus,</hi> who was a man of ſingular holineſſe, but
ſomwhat ſevere. Theſe wicked <hi>perſons</hi> fearing to bee cenſured
by him, accuſe him of <hi>Vncleanneſſe,</hi> &amp; to perſwade men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
them, did uſe fearfull <hi>curſes</hi> and <hi>impreea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ions</hi> againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
if they ſpake not the truth. The firſt of them wiſhed,
<hi>that he might be burnt.</hi> The ſecond wiſhed, <hi>that his body might rot
&amp; be conſumed.</hi> The third wiſhed, <hi>that he might be blinde,</hi> if it was
not true which they ſpake. Notwithſtanding of all this, the
people were ſo perſwaded of the holineſſe of their <hi>Paſtor,</hi> that
they beleeved them not; And in the meane time, ere it was
long the judgement of God came upon theſe three. The <hi>houſe</hi>
of the firſt took <hi>fire,</hi> and in it, hee and his familie was burnt.
The ſecond fell into a grievous <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> which conſumed his
bodie away. The third conſidering the <hi>vengance</hi> of God that
had come upon his fellowes, is brought to <hi>repentance,</hi> confeſſeth
publickly the whole matter, &amp; ſhed tears ſo aboundantly then
and afterwards, that he loſſed the ſight of his <hi>eyes.</hi> So the <hi>curſe</hi>
of every one of them fell upon themſelves. Thus we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the Apoſtle his <hi>curſing</hi> did much aggravate his <hi>ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">8. Grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the matter.</note> the matter which he denied with <hi>oathes</hi> &amp; <hi>execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
was moſt great and important. It was no leſſe then his
<hi>LORD</hi> and <hi>SAVIOVR,</hi> even he to whom before he had ſaid,
<hi>Lord whether ſhall we go from thee, for thou haſt the words of eternall
life, and we know and are ſure that thou art the Chriſt the ſon of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100463:50"/>
living God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">9. In respect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, he who denied this was no mean <hi>perſon</hi> but a great
and prime <hi>Apoſtle</hi> which aggravateth the <hi>offence,</hi> it was <hi>Peter</hi>
whoſe name Chriſt had changed, and whom he had called <hi>Peter</hi>
to ſignifie that the ſtrength and firmnes of a <hi>rocke</hi> ſhould be in
him. It was <hi>Peter</hi> who had been ſo familiar with his Lord, had
ſeen him worke ſo many <hi>miracles</hi> and had wrought <hi>miracles</hi>
himſelf in his <hi>Name. Peter</hi> who had been with him in mount
<hi>Tabor,</hi> had taſted there the heavenly <hi>joyes</hi> &amp; had heard this voice
from heaven, <hi>Thou art my well beloved ſon &amp;c. Peter</hi> to whom the
Father had revealed this, <hi>That Jeſus was the ſon of the living God.
Math.</hi> 16. And to whom our Saviour ſaid, <hi>To thee will I give
the keyes of the Kingdome of heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt binde
upon earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe
upon earth ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">10. His puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimitie.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, In this his denial, appeareth great <hi>puſillanimitie,
weaknes</hi> and diſtruſt of God. for at the firſt aſſault of a <hi>hand-maid</hi>
and <hi>doore-keeper</hi> he denyed <hi>That he knew Chriſt. Behold,</hi> ſaieth
holy AUGUSTINE, <hi>The most firme pillartrembls whollie at one ſmall
blaſt of the aire.</hi> Where now ſaieth he is thy former <hi>confidence,</hi>
and bold <hi>promiſes?</hi> where now are theſe words <hi>I am ready to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thee both to priſon and to death?</hi> Is this to follow thy Lord, to
deny that thou knoweſt him? Is this to lay down thy life for
him, to deny him at the voice of a <hi>damſell?</hi> for preſerving thy
life? how ſtrangely is thy voice changed now? and yet thou art
not brought unto publick, thou art not preſented yet before
kings or governours, thou art not yet put to the <hi>rocke</hi> or <hi>torture.</hi>
It is not a <hi>ſcribe,</hi> or <hi>phariſee,</hi> or <hi>prieſt,</hi> or <hi>ſouldier,</hi> or <hi>executioner,</hi>
that demandeth of thee, but a <hi>woman,</hi> a <hi>ſervant,</hi> and a <hi>doore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper.</hi>
Thus we ſee there was in him exceeding great <hi>weaknes,</hi>
and <hi>feare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">11. His obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie.</note> There was a kinde of <hi>obſtinacie</hi> in his ſinne, for he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
and ſwore againe and againe and the third time. There
was betwixt his ſecond and third deniall about the ſpace of an
houre, wherein the had time to recollect his confounded
thoughts and to call to minde what he hade done, that he might
have repented, or at leaſt might have eſchewed a new ſinne;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100463:51"/>
but notwithſtanding of this he continued ſtill unmindefull of
Chriſt and what he had done. Thus we ſee his <hi>ſinne</hi> in many reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
was grievous, which we have diſcovered not for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of that great and holy <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (God forbid) but that
we may learne theſe uſes from it, Which the ſpirit of God
would have us to learne, which is the third point propounded
by us.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>uſe</hi> that we ſhould make of this <hi>fall</hi> of the great
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> is,<note place="margin">12. Humane weaknes.</note> we may perceive clearly in it humane <hi>weaknes</hi> &amp; <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie,</hi>
how great it is, and how little it ſhould be truſted unto.
This great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was by nature fervent and ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ement, and
had received many excellent <hi>graces</hi> and <hi>priviledges</hi> from Chriſt
as we ſaid before, yet when he truſteth to much in himſelf, and
is for triall and humiliation left to himſelf, he falleth and that
moſt foullie. He that aſſured himſelf of victory before the fight,
trembleth now before the ſound of the trumpet: he that ſhould
not have denied Chriſt, although the ſword had been at his
<hi>throat,</hi> denieth him now at the voice of a <hi>damſell.</hi> The like we
may ſee in DAVID, who was a man according to the heart of
God, and yet fell both in <hi>adulterie</hi> &amp; <hi>murther.</hi> This ſhould teach
us all <hi>humilitie, feare</hi> and <hi>watch fulnes,</hi> and to truſt in nothing but
in God and his <hi>Grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> S. Peter</hi> himſelf learned theſe things by
his <hi>fall.</hi> When our Lord after his reſurrection asked him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he did love him more then others did, he did not preferre
himſelf to any, but was content to expreſſe his own ſinceritie,
ſaying; <hi>LORD thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> So in his 1. epiſt. 1.
chap. He ſaieth, <hi>That we are kept by the power of GOD through
faith unto ſalvation,</hi> and in the 5. chap. of that epiſt, he giveth
this exhortarion to all, <hi>Be ſober, be vigilant: for your enemie the
devil, goeth about as a roaring lion ſeeking whom he may devoure.</hi> Let
us in like manner learne to be <hi>humble,</hi> and to <hi>feare</hi> and <hi>watch.</hi>
If the ſtrong pillars and mighty cedares be ſo ſhaken and ſo
ſoone, what may become of us, who have ſcarce <hi>grace</hi> rooted
in our hearts in the day of our temptation? <hi>What is man without
the Grace of God,</hi> ſaieth holy AUGUSTINE, in his 124. Sermon
of time, <hi>But that which Peter was when he denied his LORD?</hi> yea
ſuppoſe thou had never ſo much <hi>grace,</hi> yet thou haſt this <hi>treaſure</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:100463:51"/>
in an earthen <hi>veſſell,</hi> thou art like to a rich ſhip full of precious
<hi>wares,</hi> that is toſſed in the ſea, and in danger to be ſwallowed
with the waves, or to daſh upon the rocks. <hi>Be not therefore high
minded, but feare. Let him that standeth, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that S. PAUL hath ſaid, <hi>Worke out your ſaluation with
feare and trembling:</hi> And that he himſelf did beat his body down
and kept it in ſubjection, <hi>Leſt by any means when he bad preached
unto others, he himſelf ſhould be a caſt-away.</hi> Our <hi>ſecuritie</hi> is to feare
alwayes; our <hi>ſtrength</hi> is to diſtruſt our own <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and to put
all our confidence in the <hi>Mercie</hi> of God, and <hi>Merites</hi> of Chriſt,
<hi>Who hath prayed for us that our faith faile not.</hi> Let us therefore ſay
to God every one of us, <hi>LORD thou haſt been my help leave me not,
neither forſake me, O GOD of my ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, we may perceive from this <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> that one
<hi>ſinne</hi> eſpecially,<note place="margin">13. One ſinne draweth another after it,</note> if it be <hi>grievous;</hi> draweth another after it and
that without ſtay, till Chriſt look againe upon the <hi>ſinner.</hi> Hence

entangled. If thou give place but to a light luſt at the firſt, as
<hi>Peter</hi> did to the <hi>ſervant-maid,</hi> one to a hundereth, but from that,
thou ſhalt fall into a greater <hi>ſinne,</hi> &amp; from that, to worſe againe,
as <hi>S. Peter</hi> from <hi>denying,</hi> came to <hi>ſwearing,</hi> and from <hi>ſwearing,</hi>
came to extreame <hi>curſing</hi> of himſelf. This ſhould teach us not to

            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">14. Neceſſitie of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</note> It is obſerved by holy AUGUSTINE in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
citted; that this <hi>fall</hi> of S. <hi>Peter</hi> was permitted by God to
make him the more ready to compaſſionate others when they
ſhould fall. He was by nature vehement as appeareth by many
paſſages of the Goſpell, and particularly by cutting off the eare
of <hi>Malchus.</hi> He was to be a prime <hi>pastor</hi> &amp; <hi>ruller</hi> of the Church,
and to receive <hi>the keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> An innumme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
multitude of people was to be committed unto him, loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with manifold <hi>iniquities.</hi> Now if he had never fallen himſelf
like enough it was, that he would have been the leſſe inclind to

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100463:52"/>
               <hi>The ſecret of Gods providence was ſo dispoſed, that he himſelf was
permitted firſt to fall, and that foullie, that he might temper the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the ſentence againſt others, by the remembrance and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his own fall.</hi> Thus God hath taught us alſo by his <hi>fall</hi> that
it is moſt neceſſar in a <hi>paſtor</hi> to have a tender heart ready to pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
&amp; compaſſionat others. He will never act the part of a <hi>paſtor</hi>
faithfully that can do nothing elſe but rule with <hi>authoritie, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie,

but to drive unſtabliſhed ſouls from God, and to caſt thoſe that

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">15. Wee deny CHRIST alſe</note> It is to be obſerved that a man may deny Chriſt;
although by his mouth he ſay not that he knowes him not, as S.
<hi>Peter</hi> did. We may profeſſe that we know him with our
<hi>mouths,</hi> and yet by our <hi>works</hi> deny him, as S. PAUL teacheth us
<hi>Tit.</hi> 1. we deny him alſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we deny our ſelves to be his <hi>diſciples</hi>
as we ſee in <hi>S. Peter</hi> here. Now our Lord hath told us, <hi>That he
that will not take up his croſſe and follow him, cannot be his diſciple;
and that hereby all men ſhall know that we are his diſciples, If we love
one another.</hi> And <hi>That we must abide its his word, and do the will of
his Father, If we would be his diſciples,</hi> So alſo S. PAUL ſaieth.
<hi>That they that are Christs hath crucified the fleſh with the luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>

art not carefull to do the will of his heavenly <hi>Father,</hi> and to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
thy <hi>fleſh</hi> with the luſts of it, thou denies thy ſelf to be his <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi>
&amp; conſequently denies him. In a word Chriſt is the trueth,
and therefore if thou believe him not, thou denieſt him. Chriſt
is the <hi>way,</hi> If thou follow not him, thou doeſt deny him.
Chriſt is the <hi>life,</hi> &amp; therefore if thou be given to the dead works
of <hi>ſinne</hi> thou denieſt him. Thus alace many wayes &amp; often-times
have we denied him, and ſo have deſerved that he ſhould deny
us before his Father and his Angels, and have need to ſlie to the
mercie of God, whereof we may ſee a notable demonſtration
in Chriſt his dealing with <hi>S. Peter.</hi> But there is <hi>mercie</hi> with God,
as yee will ſee moſt clearly in the next part of my <hi>text</hi> to which

               <hi>S. Peter</hi> having fallen in the manner before declared, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100463:52"/>
whill he was yet ſpeaking, the <hi>Cock</hi> crew the ſecond time

and called to minde the words of Jeſus how he had ſaid, before
the cock crow thou ſhalt deny me thrice, and ſo went out and weeped bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.</hi>
Here is the <hi>hiſtorie</hi> of his <hi>riſing,</hi> or <hi>repentance,</hi> Two things
are to be conſidered in it, Firſt the <hi>cauſe</hi> of his repentance, 2.
the <hi>repentance</hi> it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the firſt; the <hi>cauſe</hi> of his repentance was
<hi>Jeſus turned and looked upon him.</hi> Some thinke that the <hi>Look</hi> of
Chriſt was only ſpirituall, and that he did not look upon him
with his bodily eyes; But the <hi>Text</hi> ſhoweth that he did this alſo:
for it is ſaid, <hi>That be turned and looked upon him.</hi> Now to what
purpoſe ſhould his <hi>turning</hi> been mentioned, if he had not looked
upon him with the eyes of his body. But ſay they <hi>S. Peter</hi> was
without, and could not be ſeen with the bodily eyes of Chriſt.
Yet this convinceth not, but it may bee that he was brought to
the <hi>court</hi> wherein <hi>Peter</hi> was, or that being in an upper <hi>roome,</hi> as
the Goſpell ſhoweth; he might from thence being turned about
ſee him, with the eyes of his body; Nevertheleſſe it is certain
that his ſpirituall <hi>look</hi> was that which pierced into the ſoul of
<hi>S. Peter,</hi> and cleanſed and renewed his heart.</p>
            <p>For clearing of this more fully,<note place="margin">17. Gods loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note> ye are to conſider that the

looked thus upon <hi>Sedom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah Gen, 18. I will go down</hi>

The <hi>neceſſitie,</hi> for till Chriſt looked upon. <hi>Peter</hi> he neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
what he had done, not conſidered the hynouſneſſe
thereof. The <hi>cock</hi> crew againe and againe, and this ſhould have
been a <hi>memoriall</hi> of his <hi>fall</hi> and an admonition to <hi>repent:</hi> but all
this availed nothing till Chriſt looked upon him. Likewiſe ſo
powerfull was this <hi>Look,</hi> that no ſooner doeth Chriſt look upon
him, but he remembereth and conſidereth, his heart melts, and
his eyes guſh out with tuares. <hi>They whom Christ looketh upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
their ſinnes,</hi> ſayeth S. AMBROSE as without it there is no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
good, ſo where it is there is all good. <hi>Whence was it
that the bleſſed Virgine was the Mother of our LORD? It
was becauſe God had Looked upon the low eſtate of his handmaid.</hi>
Whence is it that we enjoy any good in this life or in the life to
come more then others? it is becauſe it pleaſed God to look
upon us from eternitie, with the eyes of his mercy. Hence that
<hi>prayer</hi> of the ancient Church, <hi>Lord look upon me with theſe eyes
wherewith thou looked upon Marie Magdalen in the banquet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

of God to ſhow mercie even to moſt grievous <hi>ſinners.</hi> Our Lord

Peter</hi> had forſaken him, denied him, &amp; that with <hi>Oaths</hi> &amp; <hi>curſes:</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:100463:53"/>
yet forgetting the <hi>injuries</hi> done to him both by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and by his own <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> he remembereth him <hi>and looketh

was ready to devoure him. This and the like examples of <hi>mercie,</hi>
ſerve much to encourage and comfort diſtreſſed ſouls ready to
deſpaire through the ſight of their own ſinnes. S. AUGUSTINE
in his 9. &amp; 10 ſermons on the words of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> 1. Tim. 1.
15. hath a ſweet meditation to this purpoſe of the <hi>Mercie</hi> of
God ſhewn to, S. PAUL; <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>an excellent &amp; ſkilful

wrought a rare cure upon a man deſperatly diſeaſed, would ſay to him
whom he had cured, go thy: wayes now to other men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who have the like

            <p>I Have made choiſe of theſe <hi>words</hi> at this time, which containe
a moſt notable <hi>historie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Fitneſſe of the text for humiliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> and moſt fit for the <hi>worke</hi> which we
have in hand this day: for in it is ſet before us an exact <hi>paterne</hi>
teaching us how to pray, and how to wreſtle with God, ſo as
we may prevaile and have a bleſſed ſucceſſe, as the <hi>woman</hi> here
mentioned had, who prayed with ſuch <hi>faith, confidence, humilitie</hi>
and invincible <hi>conſtancie,</hi> that not only obtained ſhe her <hi>deſire,</hi>
but much more, <hi>O woman!</hi> ſaid our Saviour unto her, <hi>great is thy
faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi> The <hi>hiſtorie</hi> is very eaſie and
and plaine and requireth not ſo much to be explained, as to be
remarked and applyed. Three <hi>things</hi> are chiefly conſiderable in
it. Firſt the <hi>deſcription</hi> of the perſon ſo much commended here.
Secondly her <hi>carriage</hi> toward Chriſt,<note place="margin">2. Diſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon heere ſpoken of, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her ſex and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note> and his <hi>behaviour</hi> toward
her. Thirdly the <hi>obtaining</hi> of her <hi>ſuite</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> of her faith.</p>
            <p>To come to the firſt. The <hi>perſon</hi> that was here a ſupplicant to
our Lord was a <hi>woman.</hi> One of the weaker ſex, by which the
devill firſt prevailed againſt <hi>man,</hi> &amp; expelled him from <hi>paradiſe</hi>
and the joyes of it. Secondly ſhe was a <hi>gentile,</hi> or a <hi>heathen woman,</hi>
as <hi>S. Mark</hi> telleth us, ſhe was none of the <hi>peculiar people</hi> of God,
but a <hi>greek</hi> as it is in the <hi>original,</hi> which according to the phraſe
of ſcripture, is as much as a <hi>gentile,</hi> and ſo a ſtranger from the
<hi>Common-wealth</hi> of Iſrael, and had her being among them who
worſhiped the devil in ſtead of the true God. Thirdly yet more,
ſhe was a <hi>Canaanite</hi> as <hi>S. Mathew</hi> calleth her. <hi>S. Mark</hi> calleth her
a <hi>Syrophenician</hi> both which agree very well. <hi>Phenicia</hi> where
Tyrus and Sidon here mentioned were, was poſſeſſed by the
poſtoritie of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as we may ſee in the 10. of <hi>Gen.</hi> Where
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100463:56"/>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> telleth us, that the ſonnes of <hi>Canaan</hi> inhabited both <hi>Iudea</hi>
and this part alſo, and the eldeſt ſonne of <hi>Canaan</hi> was <hi>Sidon,</hi> who
gave the name to that ancient &amp; famous town expreſſed here.
So then theſe whom the <hi>greeks</hi> called <hi>Phenicians</hi> from the
aboundance of <hi>Palme trees</hi> that grew in their countrie were
called by the Iſralites <hi>Cananites.</hi> Hence in the 5. of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> thoſe
that were called in the <hi>hebrew,</hi> kings of <hi>Canaan,</hi> are now called
by the ſeaventy INTERPRETER 9. kings of <hi>Phenicia.</hi> S. MARK
addeth, that ſhe was a <hi>Syrophenician,</hi> not only becauſe that
Countrey was a part of <hi>Syria,</hi> but alſo becauſe it was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
termed <hi>Syrophenicia:</hi> in reſpect it was next adjacent to the
chief part of <hi>Syria.</hi> Thus yee ſee, She was not only an heathen
<hi>woman,</hi> but alſo a <hi>Cananite;</hi> That is one of the worſt of the
<hi>Heathens,</hi> who for their grievous and unnaturall, ſinnes were
very abhominable.</p>
            <p>This part of her <hi>Diſcription</hi> is ſet down not only to ſhew,<note place="margin">3. Why this is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note>
               <hi>That the Spirit of God doeth breath where it pleaſeth,</hi> but alſo that
the glory of the <hi>grace</hi> of God wrought in this <hi>Woman</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
by her at this time, might appeare the more. When
the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Scribs</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> who had the LAW and PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHETS
daylie in their hands, did flye from our Saviour, Who
followed them, and made him at this time to retyre from them
for a while, becauſe of their unworthineſſe, yet this <hi>woman</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
him, though in appearance flying from her, and would
by no meanes leave him, till ſhe obtained her ſuit. Beſids the
<hi>benefite</hi> beſtowed upon her, was a preſage, as it were, of that
mercie which was to bee taken from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and by which the devill who ſo long
and ſo grievouſly had vexed their ſoules, drawing them to ſo
many errours and ſinnes, was to be expelled from them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>She</hi> is deſcrived from her <hi>diſtreſſe</hi> &amp; <hi>miſery.</hi> Her <hi>daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had an uncleane spirit</hi> ſaith S. MATTH,<note place="margin">4. Her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe.</note> 
               <hi>and was vexed therby.</hi> So
it was <hi>affliction</hi> that drew her unto Chriſt, and was the occaſion
of this ſingular manifeſtation of the grace that was in her. IT
would have ſeemed that none had been more miſerable then
ſhe, but yet experience taught <hi>that it was good for her that ſhe was
ſo afflicted.</hi> Had it been otherwiſe with her, it may be ſhe would
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100463:56"/>
not have taken ſuch notice of Chriſt as ſhe did, when ſhe heard
of him, &amp; it may be would never have come to him. So it was
good for <hi>Manaſſes</hi> that he was bowed down with heavie bonds,
that hee could not lift up his head nor get any releaſe, that did
drive him to God, and made him ſeek God moſt humbly and
earneſtly, who alſo heard him and was intreated of him. It was
good for the <hi>Prodigall ſon,</hi> that he could not get ſo much as the
<hi>huskes</hi> that the ſwine did eat. This made him come to himſelf
againe, &amp; to returne to his father, who received him graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
It was good for the <hi>Theefe</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Saviour converted, that
he was nailed to the Croſſe; if it had been otherwiſe, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is like
enough he ſhould not have been in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> as he is now. So
look not to the croſſe and to the bitterneſſe of it, but look to
the fruit thereof. Happy is that <hi>croſſe,</hi> although it were <hi>to beo
vexed with a devill,</hi> that ſends a man to Chriſt, to get ſalvation
in him. But let us now come to the behaviour of this <hi>Woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here yee have firſt her <hi>addreſſe</hi> to Chriſt, and the manner of
it.<note place="margin">5. She comes to Chriſt.</note> 2. The mighty <hi>temptations</hi> which her <hi>faith</hi> meet with and
overcame. Firſt being ſenſible of the greatneſſe of her own
<hi>miſery,</hi> and underſtanding that Chriſt was come to theſe parts,
although as man he laboured to keep it as ſecret as could bee,
and having no doubt heard that he was called the Son of God
and the Meſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, and that he had proved himſelf to be ſuch an
one by many miracles, and that he lovingly received and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
delivered all that came unto him; She, I ſay, having
heard this, cometh to him full of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>confidence,</hi> that ſhe
will be alſo relieved by him. She goeth not to <hi>Inchanters</hi> or <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers,</hi>
to drive out one devill by another, as appearantly hath
been the practiſe of theſe heathen parts where ſhe lived, but
forſaking theſe <hi>impieties,</hi> ſhe goeth to Chriſt to ſeek help. And
mark, I pray you, how ſhe cometh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>She</hi> goeth not as CHRYSOST. obſerveth to <hi>Peter, James,</hi> or
<hi>John</hi> or any of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> that they might get her acceſſe;<note place="margin">6. Her faith</note> but
<hi>ſhe</hi> goeth to himſelf immediatly, and <hi>ſhe</hi> cometh to him with a
<hi>prayer</hi> full of <hi>faith, fervencie; humilitie</hi> &amp; moſt fit to ſtirre up <hi>pittie</hi>
and <hi>compaſſion.</hi> SHE cryed after him, who ſeemed to haſten from
her, &amp; cryed farre lowder with her heart, then with her mouth,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100463:57"/>
               <hi>Have mercie upon me O LORD, thou ſonne of David, for my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is grievouſly vexed with a devil, O LORD</hi> ſaieth ſhe; ſee her
<hi>faith,</hi> ſhe acknowledgeth by this <hi>ſtyle</hi> his <hi>Deietie</hi> and almighty
<hi>Power. Thou Sonne of David.</hi> Here her <hi>faith</hi> acknowledgeth that
he was the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and promiſed <hi>Saviour</hi> of the world: for it is
manifeſt by many places of the Goſpell, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was
commonly ſo called be way of excellencie, becauſe he was to
come of his ſeed, and to ſit in his throne. This was the ground
of her <hi>confidence.</hi> It might have been ſaid, If he be the <hi>LORD,</hi>
how dareſt thou ſo importune him? but her <hi>faith</hi> was ready to
reply, he is the <hi>Sonne of David alſo</hi> and the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the world.
For this end came he down from heaven, hath humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and hath aſſumed ſuch fleſh as I have, that I might have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
unto him, that I might not be affraied to ſpeak unto him.
Therefore ſayeth ſhe, <hi>O LORD thou Sonne of David, have mercie
upon me, for my daughter &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon of her <hi>cry</hi> is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>my daughter
is grievouſly vexed with a devil.</hi>
               <note place="margin">7. Expreſsion of her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</note> This was a lamentable caſe and
could not well be fully expreſſed by words. We may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how much this diſtreſſe afflicted her. What a dolefull
ſpectacle was it for her, to ſee her daughter daylie ſo tormented
as they are whom the devil getteth power to vex? We know
that ſome naturall <hi>diſeaſes</hi> breed ſo terrible convulſions &amp; ſuch
intollerable <hi>paines,</hi> as hardly can we endure to look upon them,
that are in ſuch a caſe. The <hi>eyes</hi> are like to burſt out of the head,
the <hi>mouth</hi> fometh, the <hi>face</hi> is turned about, <hi>ſenſe</hi> is taken away
&amp;c, How much more miſerable may we think the eſtate of this
<hi>woman</hi> was, who was vexed with a devil. Fathers and mothers
who have ſenſe of naturall affection, may conceive this better
then I expreſſe it: her lowd and importunate <hi>cries</hi> ſhew how
ſenſible ſhe was of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe might have ſaid, <hi>Alace, O LORD my
torment is intollerable. What ſhall I do? whether ſhall I go? I cannot
leave my daughter, ſhe is ſo tormented. I cannot stay with her, The
beholding of her ſufferings is ſo grievous unto me, ſhe is not dead, and
yet a thouſand times worſe then dead, O LORD therefore have mercy
upon me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is her <hi>ſuit,</hi> that he would <hi>have mercy upon her.</hi> Marke
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100463:57"/>
the words,<note place="margin">8. She ſeekes mercie.</note> I pray you. ſhe ſayes not, <hi>Pray to God for me, but Lord
have thou mercy, and it ſhall be well.</hi> Thou art the <hi>LORD,</hi> I
have not brought her to thee. Thou ſees that which is abſent,
Thou knoweſt that which is hid. I deſire thee not to go to her,
nor yet to ſpeak a word that ſhe may be whole, only <hi>have mercy,</hi>
and that will put away the devil, and ſubdue all his power. See
here the wonderfull ſtrength of her <hi>faith.</hi> Secondly ſhe ſaieth
not, <hi>have mercy upon my daughter,</hi> but <hi>have mercy upon me.</hi> She
counteth the miſerie of her <hi>daughter</hi> her own, it touched her as
if ſhe had been in that ſame eſtate herſelf. Secondly it ſeemeth
ſhe hath thought her <hi>daughter</hi> was ſo afflicted becauſe of her
ſinnes, which ſhe deſires to be removed by <hi>mercy,</hi> that ſo her
<hi>daughter</hi> might have health. Laſtly it is remarkable that the
thing ſhe requireth is the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of <hi>mercy. Mercy</hi> is but one
word, but comprehendeth under it all <hi>Good</hi> that we ſtand in
need of, and with all includeth a confeſſion of our own <hi>miſerie,</hi>
as if ſhe would have ſaid, <hi>O LORD it is not in confidence of any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines
or righteouſneſſe in me, that I preſent my ſelf unto thee, I flie
to thy mercy the haven and harberie of ſinners. My miſerie is great,
but thy Mercy is greater. The diſeaſe is grievous, but nothing to thee
the Great and mercifull Phiſitian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we may learne what we ſhould fix our eyes upon this
day,<note place="margin">9. Why it ſhould bee ſought by all.</note> after we duly viewed the great miſeries wherein we are
plunged either by reaſon of our <hi>ſinnes,</hi> or by reaſon of their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

<hi>Have mercy upon me O LORD, according to thy Loving kindneſſe,
and according to the multitude of thy compaſſions, blot my tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
out.</hi> This <hi>Mercy</hi> is the refuge of ſinners. This is our maine
comfort that our God is the God and Father of <hi>Mercies,</hi> that his
Mercies are over all his works, and reach even unto the heavens.
<hi>Mercie</hi> is the name wherin God delighteth moſt, <hi>The LORD,
The LORD Mercifull &amp;c.</hi> and wherein our ſtrength againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire
lieth, and as we ſaid, it comprehendeth all the good we
have or would have. If we ſay God is <hi>Light,</hi> that importeth but
one thing, if we ſay God is our <hi>Strength,</hi> that importeth but the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100463:58"/>
ſtrengthening of us, but when I ſay, that he is the God of my
<hi>Mercy,</hi> that imports all whatſoever we are, whatſoever we have
or deſire, in <hi>nature,</hi> in <hi>grace,</hi> in <hi>intention,</hi> in <hi>converſation,</hi> in <hi>faith,</hi>
in <hi>hope,</hi> in <hi>love,</hi> in <hi>deliverance</hi> from <hi>evill</hi> or injoying of <hi>good,</hi> that
is all of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and his <hi>Mercy</hi> can give it all.</p>
            <p>Come therefore O <hi>man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">10. Invitation to it.</note> if thou have a penitent heart, fix thine
eyes this day upon this <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, be not ſwallowed up

remember what the <hi>Mercy</hi> of Chriſt did to that <hi>Theefe</hi> who
was crucified with him. Many villanies, it may be, had he done,
yet when he with a penitent heart ſaid, <hi>LORD remember me when
thou comeſt to thy kingdome,</hi> this <hi>Mercy</hi> anſwered, <hi>verily to day
thou ſhalt be with me in paradiſe.</hi> haſt thou been a <hi>perſecuter</hi> and
<hi>blasphemer?</hi> Remember what this <hi>Mercy</hi> did to S. PAUL, it
made him who was before a <hi>wolf,</hi> to be a <hi>paſtor,</hi> it made him to
be an <hi>Apostle,</hi> who was before a <hi>perſecuter,</hi> and to be a prime
<hi>builder</hi> of that Church which before he waſted. But let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and ſee how this fervent &amp; devote <hi>Prayer</hi> was accepted.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid by S. MATTHEVV <hi>that he anſwered her not a word.</hi>
               <note place="margin">11. Chriſt his ſilence.</note> What
a ſtrange thing was this? this miſerable woman <hi>prayes, cryes</hi>
againe &amp; againe for <hi>mercy,</hi> &amp; yet the Saviour and lover of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
giveth no anſwer, he that is the eternal <hi>Word,</hi> is ſilent. He
that was the <hi>opened fountaine,</hi> ſeemeth to be cloſed, he that was
the great and moſt kinde <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> ſeemeth to deny all cure.
This was the firſt aſſault of this womans <hi>faith,</hi> and it was not a
ſmall <hi>temptation.</hi> She might have thought with herſelf, alace I
heard he received al that came unto him graciouſly, but now I
find by mine own experience, that either this report is <hi>falſe,</hi> or
at leaſt, I am extreamly <hi>unhappy,</hi> man cannot help me, and God
will not heare me. What ſhall I do? but ſuch thoughts entered
not into the devot heart of this <hi>woman.</hi> For al this ſhe continueth
crying ſtill, as appeareth by the following words.</p>
            <p>Hence we ſhould learne that which our LORD often urgeth
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100463:58"/>
that we <hi>ſhould pray and not faint.</hi>
               <note place="margin">12. Her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance.</note> There is in us naturally <hi>impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi>
wherby we weary ſoon when we are not heard. If God
hide his face for a while, &amp; ſeeme to forget us. we give over.
O ſay we, we have prayed and it may be againe and againe, and
yet we had no anſwer returned us. But conſider, although thou
haſt prayed, yet it may be, thou haſt not cryed, thou haſt not
been earneſt nor fervent in ſeeking God. Alace how often do
our hearts wander, when our lips move in prayer? and we do
not ſo much as remember that we are praying. Secondly ſuppoſe
thou haſt cryed with fervency to God, yet that is not enough,
thou muſt alſo perſevere and not weary. Thou muſt ſtill <hi>ask</hi> &amp;
<hi>ſeek</hi> &amp; <hi>knock.</hi> God hath not promiſed to grant our deſires upon
the firſt or ſecond or third <hi>petition.</hi> This aſſurance is only given
to them who continue without fainting. <hi>Abraham</hi> was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
years old before he obtained <hi>Iſaac</hi> that was promiſed him.
No doubt the mother of <hi>Samuel</hi> hath poured out her heart ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
before God, erre ſhe conceived. <hi>Simeon</hi> waited long for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> before he got Chriſt in his armes, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. So
<hi>Anna</hi> the propheteſſe departed not from the temple, but ſerved
God day and night with faſting &amp; praying, erre ſhe was bleſſed
with the ſight of our Saviour. O LORD ſaieth DAVID <hi>Pſal.</hi>
22. <hi>I cry to thee in the day time, and by night I am not ſilent.</hi> So then
<hi>perſeverance</hi> in prayer is neceſſary for obtaining our <hi>ſuites.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
need we feare that this importunity will diſpleaſe God. It is
not with God as it is with the great ones of this world. If they
vouchſafe not an anſwer to our petitions, and yet be againe and
againe importunated, this is the way to offend them and make
them more difficult. But a reſtles importunitie and a kinde of
violent urgeing of our deſires, is moſt acceptable to God, which
if we uſe rightly, we are ſure to obtaine that which we ſeek or
that which is better. Now let us proceed to the ſecond tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherewith the <hi>faith</hi> of this woman was aſſaulted.</p>
            <p>The diſciples of our Lord moved either with pitty or impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
at the hearing of the frequent <hi>cryes</hi> of this <hi>woman,</hi>

him that he would diſmiſſe her, <hi>ſend her away,</hi> ſay they, <hi>for ſhe

               <hi>I am not ſent but unto the loſt ſheep of Iſrael.</hi> Strange! and as it
would ſeeme very uncomfortable words for this woman.</p>
            <p>The meaning of the <hi>words</hi> is not, that he came not to redeeme
any but the <hi>Jews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">14. how chriſt is ſent to the lost ſheep of Iſrael.</note> The ſcripture clearly telleth us, <hi>That he is the
propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole world: &amp; that God ſo loved the

was ſent to be <hi>Borne</hi> among them, to worke his <hi>miracles</hi> among
them, to be viſibly converſant with them, whence he is called
<hi>The Miniſter of the circumciſion.</hi> Rom. 15. God carried that

that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was both to come of them, and to do

               <hi>Suffer The children to be firſt ſatiſfied,</hi> ſaid our Saviour unto her,
as it is in <hi>S. Mark, For it is not good to take the bread of the children,
and to caſt it unto dogs.</hi> What I pray you could ſeeme more harsk
then this? he repreſents her <hi>unworhines</hi> unto her in reſpect of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> to whom, he ſaid before, he was ſent. He calleth them <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
and her a <hi>dog,</hi> and inſinuateth that ſuppoſe ſhe wer to get
any help from him, yet was it not to be expected at this time,
ſince the <hi>children</hi> were not yet ſatisfied, whoſe <hi>bread ought not to
be caſten unto the dogs.</hi> This was the third <hi>comptation</hi> &amp; a mighty
one. She looked for a gracious <hi>acceptance</hi> at the firſt; and yet
findeth herſelf ſtill rejected, and that with a reproach in end,
yet her <hi>faith</hi> is ſo farre from being broken with this, that the
<hi>vigor</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> of it ſtill increaſed. A little <hi>flame</hi> is ſoon quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
but a great <hi>fire</hi> the more it is oppoſed becometh the more
violent: ſo a ſtrong &amp; lively <hi>faith,</hi> overcometh al impediments,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100463:60"/>
and maketh a man to ſay with <hi>Job, although the LORD ſhould
ſlay me, yet I will truſt in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence this woman claſpeth yet faſter to her Saviour and his
<hi>Mercies. Trueth LORD, ſaid ſhe, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs that
fall from their masters table.</hi>
               <note place="margin">18. Her victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie over it</note> Strange! and wonderfull words full

ſhe expreſſeth only what is due to <hi>dogs,</hi> not inferring what was

Her <hi>faith</hi> alſo ſhineth in theſe words for ſhe profeſſeth that ſhe
beleeved the miraculous deliverance of her <hi>daughter</hi> to be but as
it wer a <hi>crumbe,</hi> in reſpect of theſe great things which his <hi>Mercy</hi>

for ſhe taketh advantage of our Saviour his own words, &amp; uſeth
that as a moſt pregnant argument to perſwade him, which he
uſed as an argument to repell her, as if ſhe would have ſaid, O
LORD, thou calleſt me a <hi>dog,</hi> and I confeſſe that in truth it is ſo:
but in the mean time, even <hi>dogs</hi> have liberty to eat of the <hi>crumbs</hi>
that fall from the tables of their maſters. this is all I ask. I take
not upon me to ſit down at the <hi>table,</hi> nor to take a way the <hi>bread</hi>
of the children. That which I deſire is but as it were a <hi>crumbe</hi> in
reſpect of theſe great <hi>miracles,</hi> which thou haſt done and can do

            <p>Thus ye ſee how ſtrongly ſhe wreſtleth with God,<note place="margin">19. Joincture of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</note> and that

leadeth to <hi>preſumption,</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> without <hi>confidence,</hi> leadeth
to <hi>deſpair.</hi> Hence we may learne how to behave our ſelves in the

relieve us. For were our <hi>ſinnes</hi> never ſo great, yet are they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
as it were in reſpect of the infinite <hi>Mercy</hi> of God. <hi>When

            <p>
               <hi>O woman</hi> ſayeth our LORD,<note place="margin">20. her praiſe</note> 
               <hi>Great is thy faith, be it unto thee
even as thou wilt.</hi> He cannot longer conceale his <hi>Love</hi> &amp; <hi>affection</hi>
and therefore breaketh out in words of <hi>Praiſe</hi> &amp; <hi>admiration,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
that his former <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>refuſels</hi> proceeded not from
want of <hi>love</hi> which was ſo great in him that with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
he had hid it till now. <hi>Great is thy faith</hi> ſayeth he. Thy
<hi>faith</hi> is not common nor ordinary but <hi>ſingulare</hi> &amp; <hi>great;</hi> GREAT
in reſpect of the great things which thou beleeveſt of me. Great
in reſpect of the invincible <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>firmnes</hi> of it. Great in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the ſmall meanes of <hi>faith</hi> which thou haſt had. Thou
haſt not <hi>ſeen me cure the leprous, open the eyes of the blind, or raiſe
the dead,</hi> and yet beleeveſt ſo firmly ſo great <hi>things</hi> of me. <hi>Be it
therefore unto thee as thou wilt.</hi> This great <hi>faith</hi> of thine is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to obtaine this <hi>benefit</hi> which thou askeſt, but alſo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
thou wilt. Thus ye ſee her difficult <hi>ſight</hi> endeth in a ſweet
and glorious <hi>victorie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">21. Why God delayes to anſwer his ſaints.</note> the vehement tempeſt wherewith ſhe was
toſſed, endeth in a moſt pleaſant <hi>calme</hi> and <hi>tranquillitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we may perceive firſt, that God hides himſelf from
his own, though vehemently crying upon him, not for any want
of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>care,</hi> but for his greater <hi>Glory,</hi> and their greater
<hi>Good.</hi> Wherefore did he ſo much reſerve himſelf from this
<hi>woman,</hi> but that the Glory of his <hi>Grace</hi> wrought in her, might
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100463:61"/>
appeare the more, that he might draw forth the <hi>treaſure</hi> which
was hid in her heart, and that the triall of her <hi>faith</hi> being much
more precious then that of gold which periſheth, might be
found to <hi>Praiſe,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> both in this world, and
alſo at his appearing. Hence where ever the <hi>Goſpell</hi> hath been,
or ſhall be preached from the <hi>eaſt</hi> to the <hi>weſt,</hi> from the <hi>ſouth</hi> to
the <hi>north,</hi> this <hi>woman</hi> and her great <hi>faith</hi> ſhall be praiſed and
commended. So doeth he often with other his <hi>ſaints.</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth
them not, for a time, that their <hi>vertues</hi> being exerciſed,
may be tryed and perfected, and that they may rejoyce the
more and be the more thankfull for his <hi>Favours,</hi> when after
long delay they are obtained. With them that are weak, He
dealeth often as with them that are <hi>infants,</hi> giving them their
petitions at the firſt, whileas for the former reaſons he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
them long and hardly, who have greater Strength and
ſoliditie of <hi>Grace.</hi> Grudge not therefore at the <hi>delay</hi> of GOD his
gracious Anſwer, but be aſſured that his time is alwayes moſt
fit and moſt convenient.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">22. The power of Prayer.</note> We may perceive here the wonderfull power of
<hi>Prayer</hi> when it is rightly qualified. It obtaineth that from God
which for greater reaſons would ſeeme ſhould be denied. It ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
him in a manner to change his <hi>ſentence,</hi> and ſo wreſtleth
with him that is invincible, that it prevaileth with him. The
ſcripture is full of examples. MOSES <hi>had the Egyptians behind
him, and the red ſea before him: he cryed to GOD, and the ſea was
devyded, ſo that the children of Iſrael went through as if it had been
dry land. Hezik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ah</hi> ſpread the blaſphemous letter of <hi>Senacherib</hi>
before the LORD and prayed unto him, <hi>And the Angell of the
LORD ſmote 185000, of the enemies.</hi> Neither ſhould we thinke
but many wonderfull things are and ſhall be ſtill obtained by
<hi>Prayer.</hi> If we knew all the paſſages of GODS <hi>Providence</hi>
throughout the world, this would be evident unto us. I meane
not that men ſhould now expect <hi>miracles,</hi> but this I ſay, If it be
fit for us to obtaine the thing prayed for, GOD will give it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
miraculouſly, &amp; ſo hath he often alſo done. I ſhall give
you but one example which S. AUGUSTINE in the 22. of his
books of the City of God 8. chap. ſaieth, he was an eye witnes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100463:61"/>
of, and therefore we have no reaſon to diſtruſt it there he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,
<hi>That a man of good worth in</hi> Carthage <hi>having received him
into his houſe, being then but young and newly come from</hi> Millane, <hi>had
fallen into a grievous diſeaſe. Once he is cutted by the adviſe of the
Phyſitians, yet ſomthing eſcaped them, which againe renewed the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
The Phyſitians being againe conſulted, aſſure him he could not
live, unleſſe that part wer cutted anew. This bred an exceeding grief to
him, wiſhing rather to die then to endure ſuch an intollerable paine.
Alwayes in end he condeſcended to it, and the day is appointed. The
night preceeding it,</hi> AURELIAN <hi>Biſhop of Carthage and other paſtors
come to viſit him. They pray for him, who joyned with them in moſt
fervent and devote prayer. Therefore he intreateth them to returne to
morrow and to recommend him to GOD. Accordingly then they come
and pray. The Prayer being ended, the Phyſitians look to the
part being to uſe their cure, But there they found all to be whole and
ſound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ye will ſay to me,<note place="margin">23. how pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are not heard, for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſenſe of our miſery ſpirituall.</note> whence cometh it then to paſſe, that
our <hi>prayers</hi> have ſo ſmall effect? I anſwer, we pray not aright
and therefore find not the wiſhed <hi>fruite</hi> of our <hi>prayers.</hi> We fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
not this <hi>patron</hi> which is propoſed unto us. <hi>She</hi> cryed and
prayed fervently being ſenſible of her great <hi>diſtres,</hi> but our
<hi>prayers</hi> have no life in them, and that becauſe we have not a due
ſenſe and feeling of our <hi>miſery</hi> which is farre greater then <hi>hers.</hi>
But you will ſay to me, there is none of us (bleſſed be God) <hi>vëxed
with a devil,</hi> &amp; how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can we be in ſuch or a worſe eſtate then
<hi>ſhe</hi> was? The anſwer is eaſie, for firſt, the <hi>devil</hi> vexed but the
body of her <hi>daughter,</hi> and amongſt us many have their ſoules
fully ſubjected to his <hi>power</hi> through grievous ſinnes. <hi>Sinne is a
great devil</hi> ſayeth CHRISOST. writting upon this place, <hi>at leaſt
it is an argument of his preſence in a moſt wofull manner.</hi> The <hi>bodies</hi>
of good men and women may be vexed with Satan: and that
makes them to be but the objects of <hi>pittie,</hi> but when <hi>ſinne</hi> reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in the ſoul, men are wicked; and the objects of the <hi>wrath</hi>
and <hi>Hatred</hi> of GOD. Now how much the devil prevaileth by
<hi>ſinne,</hi> and holdeth men captive at his pleaſure, the great abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of this land and citie do plainly teſtifie, the Love and
Fear of God is not in the hearts of men, his <hi>Name</hi> is prophaned,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100463:62"/>
his <hi>Sabbaths</hi> are violated, <hi>Superioures</hi> are diſobeyed, the <hi>hearts</hi> of
men are full of <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> every place is polluted, with
<hi>whooredome, falſhood</hi> &amp; <hi>oppreſſion, lies</hi> &amp; <hi>ſlanders</hi> abound. What a
ſtrange power then hath Satan gotten over us? if there be any
<hi>ſenſe</hi> in us, how great reaſon have we to mourne and ſigh for al
our own <hi>ſinnes,</hi> and for all the ſinnes and abominations done in
the midſt of this land.</p>
            <p>Secondly we have great reaſon to fear that <hi>Satan</hi> and his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments</hi>
ſhall get power over our bodies and eſtates.<note place="margin">24. For want of the ſenſe of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly.</note> When I
pray you is the devil more looſed in this kinde then in the time
of warres? If at any time, his <hi>Throue</hi> is then ſet up: for then
the exerciſe of <hi>religion</hi> is baniſhed or much hindred, <hi>Juſtice</hi>
hath no place, the <hi>authoritie</hi> of lawes is contemned. Men give
themſelves to <hi>uncleannes,</hi> to <hi>drunkennes,</hi> to the <hi>oppreſſion</hi> of
the <hi>weak</hi> &amp; <hi>poore,</hi> The bodies of men are <hi>murthered,</hi> their <hi>meanes</hi>
are ſpoyled. This is one of the moſt terrible <hi>Plagues</hi> of GOD,
whereto David preferred the <hi>peſtilence.</hi> Now this we juſtly fear,
and have we not reaſon then out of the deep ſenſe of ſo great
an evil to cry unto God mightily; this <hi>woman</hi> cryed vehemently
for one, but among us many thouſands are in danger.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Her prayer proceeded from a true and lively <hi>faith,</hi>
whereby her heart was purged from her former <hi>ſinnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">25. For want of amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life.</note> and now
ſet wholly upon God. But alace we continue ſtill in our <hi>iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
and what wonder then that our <hi>prayers</hi> are not heard.
Would we have God to do our <hi>will,</hi> when we rebell againſt
his moſt Holy <hi>Will? Though ye multiply your prayers I will not
hear, ſaith the LORD, when ye ſpread out your hands, I will hide my
face, becauſe your hands are full of blood.</hi> And again, <hi>Is this the faſt
that I have required, for a man to hang down his head as a bulruſh?
is not this the fast that I have required to looſe the bands of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
to undo the heavie buedens, and to let the oppreſſed go free?</hi> Iſai.
58. Hence it is, that our manifold <hi>humiliations</hi> and <hi>prayers</hi> bring
not forth the deſired <hi>fruit.</hi> Some will acknowledge their <hi>ſinnes,</hi>
and promiſe to amend them, but in the meane time bring forth
no <hi>fruits</hi> worthie of amendement of <hi>life.</hi> Some will not ſo much
as acknowledge their own <hi>ſinnes,</hi> but ſtand ſtill in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
thereof. Wee reade <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the 42. and 43. that IOHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAN
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100463:62"/>
and the remnant of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were with him after the
deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> deſired IEREMIAH to pray to God for
them, and promiſed to obey the <hi>Word</hi> of the LORD whatſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it was. IEREMIAH did, ſo &amp; brought him back this anſwer,
<hi>That if they would ſtay in the land of Judea, it ſhould be wel with them</hi>
&amp; that they needed not fear the king of the Caldeans, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they were affraied for the ſlaughter of <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> for God would
incline his Heart to favour them. whereas if on the other part,
<hi>They would go down to Egypt</hi> as they intended, <hi>They ſhould periſh
by the famine, by the ſword, and by the peſtilonce.</hi> IOHANAN and the
reſt of the proud men having heard this which was contrary to
their humor replyed, <hi>That this which he ſaid was falſe, and that the
LORD had not spoken ſo, but that</hi> BARUCH <hi>the ſonne of</hi> NERIAH
<hi>did ſet him upon them, to perſwade them to ſtay in the land, that they
might be delivered into the hand of the Caldeans.</hi> Even ſo it fareth
with many: They promiſe indeed to obey the <hi>Word</hi> of the
LORD, but when the <hi>Word</hi> of the LORD is told them, if it
croſſe their <hi>intentions</hi> and <hi>deſires,</hi> they ſay it is not the <hi>Word</hi> of
the LORD, and ſo continue in their evil courſes. No wonder
then that GOD heare not their <hi>prayers,</hi> not the <hi>prayers</hi> of others
for them. If we would be heard, we muſt waſh our hearts from
<hi>wickednes,</hi> and put away our vaine thoughts from us, and as we
ſaid before, moſt ſtill continue knocking at the doore of Gods
<hi>Mercy.</hi> This if we do, we may be ſure God in end will give
us a comfortable anſwer; which the LORD grant, and that for
the Merits of Chriſt to whom &amp;c.</p>

confirmed and allowed by God in heaven. <hi>And he that will

the <hi>Judgement</hi> and <hi>Condemnation</hi> of GOD, for ſaieth our Saviour,
<hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, whatſoever yee ſhall binde on earth, ſhall be

            <p>The <hi>words</hi> ye ſee,<note place="margin">2 The pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſe made to all the Apoſtles.</note> containe a <hi>promiſe.</hi> Therefore we ſhall
ſhortly firſt conſider to whom this <hi>promiſe</hi> is made. Secondly,
we ſhall conſider the <hi>promiſe</hi> it ſelf. for the firſt, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that the <hi>promiſe</hi> is made not to one of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> but to
all, for it is ſaid in the plurall number, <hi>Whatſomever ye ſhall binde

<hi>S. Peter, to thee will I give the keyes of the kingdome of heaven, and
whatſomever thou ſhalt binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven.</hi> But
here that ſame <hi>power</hi> is expreſly promiſed to al the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;
was accordingly performed in the 20 of S. <hi>Joh.</hi> when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſaith to al the <hi>Apostles,</hi> &amp; not only to S. <hi>Peter; A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſent me, ſo ſend I you, receave the holy Ghoſt; whoſe ſins ye remitt, they
are remitted, and whoſe ſinnes ye retaine, they are retained.</hi> It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
therefore, that nothing more was promiſed or given to
S. <hi>Peter,</hi> then to the reſt of the <hi>Apostleis</hi> It is true, that ſome
do affirme that the <hi>keyes</hi> promiſed to S. <hi>Peter</hi> importeth a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>power,</hi> then is this of <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing:</hi> but Cardinall BEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAR,
in his firſt book of the biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and 12. chap. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100463:63"/>
this conceat as new and unheard of, and affirmeth that
the full and perfect effect of the <hi>keyes</hi> is to <hi>binde</hi> and <hi>looſe. The
power and authoritie promiſed,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>is expreſſed by the keyes, &amp;
the uſe thereof by binding</hi> &amp; <hi>looſing,</hi> which our Saviour ſetteth forth
in theſe termes, to ſhew that the <hi>power</hi> expreſſed by the <hi>keyes,</hi>
rather then by opening and ſhutting, is in borrowed tearmes: &amp;
that heaven is opened or ſhute, when men are looſed from
their <hi>ſinnes</hi> or bound therein. So the Ieſuet <hi>Maldonat</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the 16. of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſaieth, <hi>that the power of
opening and ſhutting heaven, is Mataphorically expreſſed by
the keyes, and the ſame power,</hi> ſaieth hee, <hi>is thereafter decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by another Metaphor of binding and looſing.</hi> Thus it is cleare,
that as all the reſt were equall unto S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the <hi>power</hi> of
<hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing.</hi> So were they equall to him in the <hi>power</hi>
of the <hi>keyes,</hi> and therfore S. <hi>Hilarie</hi> in the 6. book of the
Trinitie, ſaith of all, <hi>O holy and bleſſed men, who did obtaine the
keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, and power to binde both in heaven
and in earth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. And to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is to be obſerved, that this power of <hi>binding</hi> and
<hi>looſing,</hi> was promiſed to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> not as a perſonal priviledge
which was to die with them. It was appointed &amp; given by our
Saviour for the benefice of his Church unto the worlds end, and
without it his Church had not been ſufficiently provided of
helps neceſſary for the preſervation of it, as we ſhall ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
This <hi>power</hi> therfore was promiſed to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as they
were paſtors of the Church, &amp; to their ſucceſſors in that office,
even to them, to whom the Miniſtry of reconſiliation ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly
belongeth; whence this <hi>power</hi> hath ever been exerciſed
by them in the Church of Chriſt, as may appeare by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
examples, and canons of the chriſtian Church. But
we come now to the <hi>promiſe</hi> it ſelf.<note place="margin">4. What ſhuld bee bound.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatſoever</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>ye binde &amp;c.</hi> Firſt when he ſaies
that <hi>Whatſoever they binde ſhal be bound in heaven,</hi> he meaneth not
that he was to give the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or their ſucceſſors an abſolute
<hi>power</hi> to do in this whatſoever pleaſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. No he ſent them as
he was ſent, in his own <hi>vice,</hi> and <hi>ſtead,</hi> to <hi>bind</hi> ſuch as he will
have to be <hi>bound,</hi> and to <hi>looſe</hi> ſuch as he would have to be <hi>looſed.</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:100463:64"/>
In this he hath not left them to their own <hi>judgement,</hi> but will
have the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to follow his <hi>direction</hi> ſet down in his word, he will
have them rightly to uſe and governe the <hi>keyes,</hi> and if they do
that, his promiſe is, that <hi>whatſoever they binde on earth, ſhall be
bound in heaven. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">5. A man is bound by his own ſin.</note> The thing whereto the <hi>promiſe</hi> is made, is their
<hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing</hi> upon earth, <hi>Whatſoever yee bind</hi> &amp;c. For clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this conſider; that a <hi>ſinner</hi> is bound by his own <hi>ſinne,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any <hi>ſentence</hi> of the Church be pronounced againſt him. He
is bound firſt by it in ſo far as being overcome by his own <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi>
hee is made the ſervant thereof, unable to do good or
eſchew evill. Secondly, he is bound by his ſin with the guiltines
of eternal death and condemnation. Hence <hi>ſinners</hi> in ſcripture,
are ſo often compared to <hi>priſoners</hi> and <hi>captives,</hi> and the effect of
Chriſt his <hi>grace,</hi> is called a <hi>deleverance</hi> from this Captivitie. But
this is not the <hi>Bond</hi> that is meaned here, for it is not the <hi>Church</hi>
but the <hi>ſinner</hi> himſelf, that bindeth himſelf in this kinde.</p>
            <p>There are ſome who think that this <hi>looſing</hi> of the Church,<note place="margin">6. To looſe is not to preach.</note> is
nothing elſe, but the preaching of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and that the
power to <hi>looſe,</hi> is only a power to preach the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> This <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi>
cannot ſtand, for firſt the ſeaventie diſciples received a
power to teach the goſpell. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. but they had not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to <hi>binde</hi> and <hi>looſe,</hi> which was given to the Apoſtles, and not
to them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Apoſtles had the power of <hi>preaching</hi> given to
them long before this time, as we may ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. Thirdly,
A man may be well taught, and yet not looſed from his <hi>ſinnes,</hi>
and on the contrary, many are not bound in this manner that
our Saviour ſpeaketh of, who are not taught as all theſe who
are without the Church, to whom the power of the <hi>keyes</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
not.<note place="margin">7. The power of binding and looſing is not only declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There are others who think, that to <hi>binde</hi> and <hi>looſe</hi> here, is
nothing elſe, but to declare that a mans <hi>ſinnes</hi> are bound or loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by God. But firſt, this agreeth not with the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
who ſaieth not, <hi>Whoſe ſinnes yee declare to be bound, ſhall be
bound,</hi> but <hi>Whatſoever yee binde, ſhall be bound;</hi> ſo IOHN. 20. hee
ſaieth, <hi>Whoſe ſinnes yee retaine, are retained, and whoſe ſinnes ye
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100463:64"/>
forgive, they are forgiven,</hi> and in the 16 of S. <hi>Matth,</hi> he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
this <hi>Power</hi> under the name of the <hi>keyes,</hi> as we ſaid, now if a
man had only <hi>power</hi> to declare a doore to be opened that was
open before, or a man to be looſed that was looſe before, how
could he be ſaid truly to have the <hi>keyes</hi> of the houſe? or to have
the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing?</hi> ſuch a man certainly, if it were
thus, it ſhould not be ſo much <hi>paſtors</hi> as <hi>ſinners</hi> themſelves, who
ſhould have the <hi>keyes</hi> of heaven, and the <hi>power</hi> to <hi>binde</hi> and <hi>looſe.</hi>
Secondly, ſuppoſe it had been the minde of our Saviour, to give
a true and proper <hi>Power</hi> of opening and ſhutting heaven, of
<hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing</hi> ſinners, of retaining and forgiving <hi>ſinnes,</hi> how
could he have expreſſed it more fully then in the termes which
he hath uſed, <hi>To the will I give the keyes of the kingdom of heaven,
whatſoever ye binde on earth, it ſhall be bound in Heaven</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whoſe
ſinnes ſoever ye retaine, they ſhall be retained</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of our Saviours ſpeech, when he promiſed this <hi>Power,</hi> which
is with a ſerious and vehement atteſtation, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you,</hi>
and the ceremonie uſed at the performance of it, which was by
<hi>breathing on them,</hi> with theſe words, <hi>receive the holy Ghoſt,</hi> theſe
circumſtances I ſay do ſhew, that our Saviour intended to give,
and did actually give a greater <hi>power,</hi> then is that of declaring a
thing to be, which already is. beſide the <hi>Repentance</hi> of men is
a thing, which <hi>paſtors</hi> cannot perfectly know, and therefore
they cannot certainly declare a man to be looſed from <hi>ſinne.</hi> For
theſe and other reaſons I make no doubt, that the <hi>Power</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
here by our Saviour, is not barely a <hi>declarative,</hi> but alſo
an effectuall <hi>Power,</hi> which worketh ſome effect upon men.
So the holy <hi>Fathers</hi> have underſtood this. CHRISOST. in his 3.
book of the <hi>prieſthood</hi> ſaith <hi>that Christ hath given to men that are
upon earth a power to dispoſe of things that are in heaven. This Power</hi>
ſaieth he, <hi>he hath not given to the angels or A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>changels for to whom
of them hath he ſaid, to the will I give the keyes of the Kingdome of
heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt binde on earth &amp;c. Earthly kings.</hi>
ſayth he, <hi>have power to binde &amp; looſe alſo, but their power extendeth
to the bodies of men only, whereas this Power reacheth unto the ſoul
and unto heaven.</hi> That which the <hi>ſervant</hi> doth here beneath,
the <hi>LORD</hi> confirmeth above, and the <hi>LORD</hi> in a manner
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100463:65"/>
denizeth to follow the <hi>ſervant,</hi> the binding on earth, being
prior (at leaſt in order of nature) to the <hi>binding</hi> in heaven, and
the <hi>looſing</hi> on earth, being before the <hi>looſing</hi> in heaven. So writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the 20 of S. <hi>John,</hi> on theſe words, <hi>Whoſe ſinnes ſoever
ye retaine, they are retained;</hi> he ſayeth, that our Saviour indued
his Apoſtles with ſuch a <hi>Power,</hi> as a king giveth to <hi>governours</hi>
under him, when he giveth them power to caſt into <hi>priſon,</hi> and
to take out of it, and writting upon theſe words, <hi>To thee will I
give the keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> Matth. 16. he ſaieth
that Chriſt hath given to a mortall man the <hi>Power</hi> of all things
that are in heaven, for this cauſe our Saviour addeth here theſe
words, <hi>on earth whatſoever ye bind. (On earth)</hi> To what purpoſe
is this aded? but to ſignifie the amplitude and greatnes of his
<hi>Power,</hi> and that how ſoever it be done by earthly men, yet it
ſhall have an authoritie &amp; force of a <hi>ſentence</hi> and <hi>law</hi> in heaven,
as if a mighty <hi>Emperour</hi> would ſay to one whom he much truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and to whom he had given a moſt ample commiſſion,
<hi>Whatſoever thou wilt do in the remoteſt parts of my dominion. I ſhall
alow and ratifie it.</hi> The farrer that <hi>ſervants</hi> are from their Maſters
they uſe to take to themſelves the greater <hi>liberty,</hi> and it is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of great truſt in the maſter, when he committeth <hi>power</hi> to
them in ſuch a caſe. Thus we ſee that <hi>Paſtors</hi> have properly a
<hi>power</hi> to binde and looſe <hi>ſinners,</hi> let us now conſider more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in what manner they do <hi>binde</hi> and <hi>looſe,</hi> and how their
<hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing</hi> is accompanyed with <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing</hi> in
heaven.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bond</hi> wherewith <hi>Paſtors</hi> by vertue of the <hi>keyes</hi> do binde
<hi>ſinners,</hi> is directly and immediatly an eccleſiaſticall <hi>bond,</hi> exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
about <hi>ſinue,</hi> as it as an <hi>offence</hi> of the Church.<note place="margin">8. What is the binding &amp; looſing of the church</note> So their <hi>looſing</hi>
is directly and immediatly an <hi>untying</hi> and <hi>looſing</hi> of that eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
<hi>bond,</hi> wherwith they have bound a <hi>ſinner,</hi> whence of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
their <hi>binding</hi> moſt go before their <hi>looſing,</hi> in this kinde they
can <hi>looſe</hi> nothing this way, but that which before they have
bound. But how then yee will ſay doeth their <hi>binding</hi> or <hi>looſing</hi>
reach to a mans <hi>ſinne,</hi> as it is an <hi>offence</hi> of God? I Anſ. This is
not but mediatly and indirectly, in ſo farre as they do ſuch a
thing; upon the doing whereof, Chriſt hath promiſed to <hi>binde</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:100463:65"/>
or <hi>looſe</hi> the ſinnes of a man. The like we have in <hi>haptiſme,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>ſinne</hi> is taken away, if he that is baptiſed put no impediment,
all that the <hi>miniſter</hi> doth, is but a waſhing of the body, and an
incalling of the bleſſed Trinitie, yet this <hi>Action</hi> as an <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
or <hi>condition,</hi> carrieth with it the remiſſion of <hi>ſinne,</hi> and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the <hi>ſoul:</hi> So in the matter that we have in hand the
<hi>pastor</hi> bindeth the perſon guilty with an eccleſiaſticall <hi>bond,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
and againe looſeth that ſame <hi>bond</hi> by eccleſiaſticall <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi>
or <hi>reconciliation,</hi> yet by vertue of Chriſts <hi>promiſe</hi> ſet down
in theſe words, upon the doing of this, GOD in heaven doeth
<hi>binde</hi> or <hi>looſe</hi> the ſinnes of ſuch a man. Thus we ſee how God
not only principally, but alſo alone immediatly taketh away <hi>ſin,</hi>
for the <hi>miniſter</hi> only performeth an eccleſiaſticall <hi>action,</hi> upon
the doing whereof, GOD by vertue of his own <hi>Promiſe,</hi> taketh

grievous <hi>ſinners,</hi> who ſubmite themſelves to the direction
of the Church, and in the ancient Church, it was uſed with great
vigor and ſeveritie. In the firſt 300 years, when the <hi>devotion</hi> of
Chriſtians was fervent, and their <hi>puritie</hi> great, men were not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100463:66"/>
ordinarly admitted to this outward <hi>repentance,</hi> till for a long
time, with many teares, and with great tokens of unfeigned for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
they had earneſtly intreated to be admitted in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of publick <hi>penitents.</hi> when that was granted, then they were
not immediatly received to their publick <hi>repentance,</hi> but were
thruſt down, as it were, firſt to the degree of the <hi>catechumeny,</hi> or
thoſe who were yet <hi>unbaptiſed,</hi> and did but learne the <hi>mysteries</hi>
of the chriſtian <hi>religion,</hi> and in this degree they were called
<hi>hearers,</hi> becauſe of new they were againe inſtructed the <hi>myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
of chriſtian <hi>religion.</hi> For it was preſumed, that they who had
ſo grievouſly fallen, had never rightly learned theſe heavenly
<hi>myſteries,</hi> and therefore were taught againe, eſpecially concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>terrour</hi> of GODS Iudgements againſt <hi>ſinne,</hi> that they
might the more willingly undergo what was injoyned them.
This done they were received to their <hi>repentance,</hi> wherein for
diverſe years, ſomtimes for ſeven, more or leſſe according to
the greatnes of their <hi>offence,</hi> they were exerciſed with moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
works of <hi>humiliation and mortification.</hi> TERTUL. in the

themſelves in ſackcloth &amp; aſhes, they did lye proſtrat upon the ground,
they did nowriſh their prayers with faſting, they did weep &amp; mourne
and cry to GOD, and did humblie beſeech paſtors and all faithfull
people, to pray for them.</hi> S. CYPRIAN, ſpeaking of this ſame
matter, ſayeth to them that had fallen, <hi>That it behoved them to
pray earnestly, to paſſe over the day in ſorrow, to ſpend over the nights
in mourning and teares, to humble themſelves in ſackcloth aud aſhes,
to despiſe the garment of the body, ſince they had caſt away the garment
of Chriſt, and to deſpiſe the food of the body, ſince they had eaten at the
table of the devil,</hi> they thought not that ſuch works of <hi>humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
could merite any thing at the hand of GOD, but they were
injoyned as means appointed by GOD to promove unfeigned
ſorrow and deteſtation of their <hi>ſinne,</hi> which men after great
faults eſpecially, do not ordinarly attaine unto, without thoſe
exerciſes of <hi>faſting, prayer</hi> and <hi>humiliation.</hi> They were injoyned
as means of mortifying thoſe carnall <hi>luſts,</hi> whereby they had
been ſtirred up, or whereby thereafter they might be ſtirred up
to offend God, and as <hi>expreſſions</hi> of their ſorrow for their <hi>ſinnes,</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:100463:66"/>
and juſt <hi>indignation</hi> againſt themſelves becauſe of their <hi>ſinnes,</hi>
that ſo God through Chriſt might be moved to have pitty upon
them, that good chriſtians might be aſſured of their unfeigned
<hi>converſion,</hi> and that all who did behold might be edified by
their good example, as they had been before offended by their
fall. When all this was done, they were not yet admitted to the

by a raſh commandement of his, being come to <hi>Millane,</hi> wher
S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was biſhop, and intending to enter into the Church
and <hi>communicat,</hi> was encountred by S. <hi>Awbroſe</hi> without the
Church, who freely told him of the grievouſnes of his <hi>ſinne, and
that though he was an Emperour, yet was ſubject to him who is the
LORD of heaven and earth, and that thoſe whom he had killed were
partakers of that ſame nature with him, and made according to the
Image of GOD aſwel as he. With what eyes</hi> ſaith he <hi>can thou behold
this temple, or how can thou trade upon this holy ground? how can thou
ſtretch out theſe hands embrued with blood, or open that mouth, which
hath commanded ſo much innocent blood to be ſhed, to receive the ſacred
Body and Blood of Chriſt? depart therfore,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and adde not a
new ſinne unto thy former ſinne, but accept of theſe bonds, wherewith
he that is LORD over all hath commanded thee to be bound: for theſe
bonds have a power to put away the diſeaſe, and to reſtore health unto
thee againe.</hi> The good <hi>Emperour</hi> hearkned unto him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
did give himſelf to <hi>mourning</hi> and <hi>humiliation;</hi> after he
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100463:67"/>
had been excerciſed thus eight moneths, the feaſt of the <hi>nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
of our Saivour was come, in which he begane moſt grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>mourne</hi> and <hi>weep,</hi> being demanded of one of his chief cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teours
<hi>Ruffinus,</hi> why he did ſo, <hi>alace,</hi> ſaid he, you underſtand not
the evils wherein I am. <hi>Servants and beggers have acceſſe to the
Houſe of GOD, but I am debarred both from the Church &amp; Heaven.
For I remember that ſentence of our Saviour, Whatſoever ye ſhall
binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven.</hi> Afterward when he was
admitted by S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> the hiſtorian ſaieth, <hi>That when he entred
into the Church he did not ſtand nor kneel praying, but that he did fall
down upon the ground ſaying</hi> theſe words of DAVID, <hi>My ſoul
cleaveth unto the duſt, quicken thou me according unto thy word, and
began to ſtrick his face, and to rive his hair, and to water the ground
with his teares.</hi> If ſo great &amp; ſo glorious an Emperour diſdained
not in ſuch a manner to ſubmitt himſelf to eccleſiaſticall <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi>
is it not ſtrange, that every one almoſt now, who is any
thing in their own eyes, diſdaineth to embrace this <hi>remedie</hi>
which Chriſt hath appointed for grievous <hi>offenders.</hi> S. AUGUST.
ſpeaking of this purpoſe ſaieth in the 49. Sermon of his book
of fifty homiles, <hi>Let no man ſay, I will tranſact ſecretly betwixt God
and my ſelf, I ſhall have ſorrow in mine heart</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then</hi> ſaieth he,
<hi>The keyes of the kingdome of heaven were given in vaine, and in vaine
it was ſaid, whatſoever yee binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven.
Shal a Senator,</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>be aſhamed to do that, which the Emperour
Theodoſius did? ſhall a craftsman or a merchant be aſhamed to do
that, which ſo glorious an Emperour did?</hi> I come now to the other
ſort of <hi>excommunication</hi> whereby men are bound.</p>
            <p>This is the greater <hi>excommunication,</hi> which is a moſt fearfull
and dreadfull <hi>anathema</hi> &amp; <hi>eurſe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">12. The great excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</note> By it a man is wholly ſeparated
from the communion of the faithfull in <hi>meetings,</hi> in <hi>prayers,</hi> and
in all other ſacred <hi>fellowſhip.</hi> ſuch an one is fully caſt out of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and cut off from the body of Chriſt, as a rotten and
corrupt <hi>member,</hi> by reaſon wherof, he is ſubjected to unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>evils.</hi> For if he be ſo cut off from Chriſts Body. he can no
more be partaker (while he is in that eſtate) of the vitall and
ſaving influence which cometh from Chriſt the HEAD. Being
ſeparate from the Body of Chriſt, he can no more have his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100463:67"/>
Spirit, then a member of the body cut off from the reſt, can be
quickned with that ſoul, which giveth life to the reſt of the
body, and if a man have not the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, he is not his.
Such an one is no more <hi>partaker</hi> of the <hi>interceſſion</hi> and <hi>prayers</hi> of
the Church, and of the bleſſings, which thereby are plentifully
obtained to thoſe that are within it. In a word, ſuch an one is
left to himſelf as a wretched and forlorne creature, deſtitute of
the <hi>preſence, aſſiſtance,</hi> and <hi>protection,</hi> which God graciouſly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to his Church, and to the <hi>Members</hi> thereof; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he covereth it, as it were, as the cloud did the <hi>tabernacle,</hi>
and ſo is expoſed to the will &amp; the furie of the devil, as a ſheep

eſpecially without the Church of God; There <hi>he ruleth and rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth
in the children of diſobedience.</hi> Hence, according to the
judgement of many, ſuch are ſaid, 1. <hi>Cor. 5. To be delivered over
unto Satan;</hi> albeit, it be true alſo, that in the Primitive Church,
for the greater terrour of diſobedient <hi>perſons,</hi> who ſuffered

                  </gap>;</hi> Diverſe of them were given
over to <hi>Satan</hi> as to an <hi>Executioner,</hi> to have their bodies afflicted
by him. So ſome think that the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian 1. Cor.</hi>
5. was not only excommunicated, but alſo delivered to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
to be afflicted bodily, and ſo they think alſo of <hi>Alexander</hi> and
<hi>Hymeneus</hi> of whom S. PAUL ſaith, 1. <hi>Tim. 1. That he had delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them to Satan, that they might learne not to blaſpheme.</hi> This is
the moſt dreadfull <hi>ſentence</hi> of the Church, which Chriſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
here to ratifie and confirme in heaven. <hi>It were better for a
man,</hi> ſaieth <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his firſt book, againſt the Adverſaries
of the Law and Prophets and 17 Chapter, <hi>that he were ſtoned to
death, or killed with the ſword, or torne with the teeth of beaſts, then
to be ſtrucken with this ſentence. Hee that is bound this way,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>is bound with more grievous and terrible bonds, then if they were of
iron and adamant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The principall <hi>Intention</hi> of the Church, is not to reclaime the
perſon <hi>guilty</hi> in this <hi>Excommunication,</hi> for it is exerciſed againſt
ſuch,<note place="margin">13. Equity of it.</note> who are incorrigeable and refuſe to heare the <hi>voice</hi> of the
Church. It is true, the <hi>reclaiming</hi> of ſuch an one is ſecondarlie
intended, for he is ſeparate from the ſociety of good Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100463:68"/>
that he may be aſhamed: that ſo he may come in end to a ſenſe
of his own <hi>ſinne;</hi> but the maine <hi>intention</hi> of the Church is, to
purge it ſelf from ſuch rotten and infecting <hi>Members,</hi> which
obſtinatly go on in an evil courſe, and there is none but may ſee
that this proceeding is full of equity, if a <hi>member</hi> of the bodie
be corrupted, and the reſt of the bodie in danger to be infected
thereby, it muſt needs bee cut off. In all well governed Cities,
<hi>Leprous perſons</hi> &amp; thoſe that are infected with the <hi>Plague</hi> at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated

to the <hi>voice</hi> of the Church, who are ready to infect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
with an <hi>infection</hi> that tendeth to everlaſting <hi>death,</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
and debarred from the <hi>fellowſhip</hi> of the <hi>faithfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence yee may obſerve firſt,<note place="margin">14. A reaſon of delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence.</note> what is the <hi>reaſon</hi> that we ſo
ſlowly proceed to the pronouncing of this <hi>ſentence</hi> of <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi>
againſt thoſe that are diſobedient to the <hi>voice</hi> of the
Church. Some that have <hi>zeal</hi> but without ſufficient knowledge
accuſe us for this as negligent, or favouring the <hi>errours</hi> of thoſe
perſons. God knoweth we detaſte their <hi>errours,</hi> and that the
true cauſe of out leaſurlie proceeding is, that knowledge which
we have of the <hi>terrour</hi> and <hi>dreadfulneſſe</hi> of this <hi>ſentence.</hi> A <hi>phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
will uſe all means to cure a diſeaſed part of the body, before
he proceed to the cutting it off, and when he is forced to do
that, he will not do it but with <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>ſorrow.</hi> It is reported of
the Emperour <hi>Titus,</hi> who was called the delight of mankinde,
that even at the juſt executions of <hi>malefactors</hi> he uſed to <hi>ſigh</hi> and
<hi>monrue.</hi> Though <hi>Abſolom</hi> had rebelled againſt his father <hi>David,</hi>
and would have taken from him both his <hi>crown</hi> and his <hi>life,</hi> yet
when his army went out againſt him, he ſaid, <hi>Deale gently with
the young man,</hi> and when he heard that he was killed, he cryed
out, <hi>O Abſolom, Abſolom, my ſon, Abſolom, would God I had died
for thee, and yet the love of ſpiritual father ought to be greater toward
their children, then the love of any carnall father can be,</hi> as CHRIS.
obſerveth. Is it any wonder then that we are loath to cut any off
by the terrible and dreadfull <hi>ſentence</hi> of <hi>excommunication,</hi> and to
deliver them to Satan the enemie of mans <hi>ſalvation,</hi> eſpecially,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100463:68"/>
ſince we are taught by the Apoſtle 2. Tim. 2. <hi>That the ſervant of
the LORD ſhould he gentle, and patient in meeknes inſtructing them
that are contrarie minded, if GOD will give them repentance, to the
acknowledgement of the truth, that they may eſcape out of the ſnares
of the devil, who holdeth them captive at his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">15 Wofull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat.</note> Ye may perceive hence, how wofull and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
is the <hi>ſtate</hi> of thoſe perſons, who by their obſtinate diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the <hi>voice</hi> of the Church, draw upon themſelves this
fearfull and terrible <hi>ſentence.</hi> It is not without cauſe that ſuch are
compared by an ancient writter to thoſe that are <hi>mad.</hi> Mad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
though they be moſt ſtrongly bound, yet they eſteem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their <hi>bonds,</hi> for they are not ſenſible of their own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery:
ſo is it with thoſe of whom I ſpeak. They contemne all
that is done to them in this kinde, and yet in the meane time
they are bound both in earth and heaven, by GOD and by man.
Would God that their <hi>eyes</hi> were opened, that they might ſee
the miſerable <hi>eſtate</hi> of their own ſoules, which are fertered with
moſt ſtrong <hi>chains,</hi> that will draw them unto eternall <hi>condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Heaven and Earth may paſſe away, but this Word of our LORD
ſhall stand firme. Whatſoever ye binde on earth, ſhall be bound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
Let them not therefore flatter themſelves with this, that
they ſee not now the viſible <hi>judgements</hi> of God immediatly cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
upon men and women, that they ſee not their bodies affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

GOD, but in end recompenſeth the delay of <hi>puniſhment</hi>
with the weight of it, if we deſpiſe his <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> and by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100463:69"/>

<hi>the skin is plucked from the fleſh, and the fleſh from the bones of

beware of this weede of <hi>avarice,</hi> which of it own accord ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
up in our hearts. David was a man according to the heart
of GOD, and yet he prayes earneſtly, <hi>Incline mine heart to love thy

our Saviour plainly contradicts, ſtricking at the very root of

Mans <hi>life</hi> conſiſteth not &amp;c. The <hi>life</hi> of man, is neither the <hi>lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>

<hi>The loue of money,</hi> ſaieth S. PAUL, <hi>is the roote of all evill, which
while ſome have followed after, they have erred from the faith, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100463:71"/>

Let the <hi>abundance</hi> of the <hi>covetous</hi> be what it will, his <hi>covetouſnes</hi>
is a <hi>chaine</hi> whereby the Devill draggs him through the thornes
of piercing <hi>cares,</hi> through the <hi>ſnares</hi> of <hi>temptations,</hi> through

maketh a man to loſſe the <hi>joyes</hi> of heaven, and yet ſuffereth him
not to enjoy the <hi>good</hi> of the earth, &amp; ſo like <hi>Judas</hi> to be hanged,
as it were, betwixt heaven and earth. <hi>Achab</hi> &amp; <hi>Jezebel</hi> thought
that <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard would have made their life more happy,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The field of a certaine Rich-man brought forth plentifully.</hi>
               <note place="margin">10. God gives temporall good things to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
here <hi>abundance</hi> of outward meanes; The <hi>Field</hi> of this man
brought him forth plenty of <hi>fruits</hi> according to his hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
Was hee the <hi>better</hi> or the more <hi>happy</hi> for this? No, but
<hi>worſe</hi> and more <hi>miſerable,</hi> as ſhall appeare by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
It is demanded here by ſome of the <hi>Ancients</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this place. Why God giveth <hi>abundance</hi> to ſuch men, whom
he ſeeth will not uſe it aright, and to whom it will be occaſion
of greater condemnation? To this they anſwere firſt, God does
ſo out of his great <hi>goodneſſe</hi> and <hi>bounty,</hi> which is ſuch, <hi>That hee
maketh his ſun to ſhine upon the good and the bade, and his raine to
fall upon the juſt and the unjuſt.</hi> And this his <hi>goodneſſe</hi> doeth, that
he may draw them to <hi>repentance: For he delighteth not in the
death of a ſinner, but would have all to turne and live.</hi> 2. He doeth
this, that his <hi>Juſtice</hi> may appeare the more clearly in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
if they remaine obſtinate in their <hi>impiety:</hi> for in
that <hi>They have deſpiſed all his long ſuffering and goodneſſe, which
ſhould have lead them to repentance,</hi> appeareth that they are the
<hi>cauſe</hi> of their own <hi>perdition,</hi> and <hi>That they have treaſured up wrath
againſt themſelves, in the day of wrath, and of the revelation of his
righteous judgement. 3. Wicked men</hi> have ſomtimes ſome <hi>good,</hi>
which God out of the immenſitie of his <hi>equity,</hi> will reward
with temporall good <hi>things;</hi> As he afflicteth often his own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
for ſome <hi>evils</hi> that are in them, that being purged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
they may eſcape eternal <hi>puniſhment.</hi> 4. That wee may
know that theſe earthly <hi>things</hi> are not much to be eſteemed or
deſired, ſince God giveth them to his <hi>enemies,</hi> to them that hate
and blaſpheme him.<note place="margin">11. Gods Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour not to be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by earthlie things.</note> Hade they the <hi>worth</hi> which many appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
to be in them, he would not do ſo, He will not caſt <hi>pearles</hi>
before doggs and ſwine, which he hath forbidden us.</p>
            <p>Here, by the way, we may obſerve, that we cannot judge of
GODS <hi>Favour,</hi> or want of it, by the <hi>abundance</hi> or <hi>ſcarcity</hi> of
theſe earthly things. Many wicked abound in them; and many
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100463:72"/>
of Gods deare ſervants are pinched, yea often the wicked have
greateſt <hi>plenty,</hi> this way. It is well obſerved by <hi>Greg. That a
phyſitian when he ſeeth the ſtate of his patient to be deſperate, he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not what he take, he ſuffereth him to have whatſoever his heart
deſireth, but if he have good hope of a mans health he putteth him to a
dyet, and reſtraineth him from many things.</hi> So God careth not to
let the wicked whoſe <hi>amendement</hi> is deſperate, glute themſelves
with the things of this world: but to his own ſaints and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
he giveth no more, or permitteth them to have no more
nor he knoweth is convenient for their eternal <hi>health.</hi> I come
now to the <hi>dispoſition</hi> of this man his minde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he thought within himſelf</hi> &amp;c. I am <hi>richer</hi> now then before,<note place="margin">12. His pover<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty &amp; care.</note>
but never a white the better, yea by <hi>abundance</hi> he became worſe:
as ſhall appeare by his <hi>diſpoſition</hi> manifeſted here. This <hi>diſpoſition</hi>
of his heart our Saviour expreſſeth, firſt by his <hi>conſultation,</hi> next,
by his <hi>reſolution.</hi> His <hi>conſultation. And he thought within himſelf,
ſaying, what ſhall I do</hi> &amp;c. Where firſt obſerve the <hi>povertie</hi> of

of men that are in <hi>povertie</hi> &amp; <hi>diſtreſſe,</hi> as S. BASIL writing upon
theſe words marketh; and yet ſuch are the words of this <hi>wretch.</hi>
Thus you ſee, his <hi>povertie</hi> increaſed with his <hi>riches.</hi> Obſerve 2.
his <hi>anxietie</hi> and SOLICITUDE, <hi>For what ſhall I do?</hi> is the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>anxietie</hi> and <hi>care.</hi> His <hi>abundance</hi> giveth him not <hi>quietnes</hi>
&amp; <hi>tranquillity</hi> of minde, but maketh him more <hi>anxious</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed.
Who would not pittie ſuch a miſerable man,</hi> ſayth S. BASIL,
<hi>Miſerable was he in that which he had, and more miſerable in that
which he expected. The earth</hi> ſayeth he, <hi>hath not brought forth fruits
unto thee, but ſorrow, unxietie and cares to prick and ſting thy heart
like ſo many thornes.</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, Obſerve his <hi>wickednes</hi> and <hi>folly.</hi> That which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed

then he did. Hade he conſulted with <hi>love</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> it

would have told him, there was many empty <hi>houſe,</hi> and hungry

their wants; as GOD hath dealt with me liberally, ſo I will
make a magnificent PROCLAIMATION, <hi>Come unto me all yee

               <note place="margin">14. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſults not with spirituall prudence.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner had he conſulted with ſpirituall <hi>wiſdome,</hi> it
would have bidden him, if he had loved his <hi>riches,</hi> lay them up
in heaven, or at leaſt, a part of them: for they might have been
preſerved to <hi>eternitie.</hi> It would have ſaid unto him, now thou

Shut up <hi>almes</hi> in thy <hi>store-houſes,</hi> and it ſhall deliver thee from all

but with his own corrupt <hi>heart.</hi> He thought upon nothing
but this <hi>life,</hi> and thought all he had, was but for himſelf, and
therefore forgetting both the law of <hi>nature</hi> and of GOD, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth

This is the nature of <hi>covetouſneſſe,</hi> it can never be ſatisfied. The

Overthrow theſe houſes of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, bring forth to the Sun thy hote, and

Let us therefore, I beſeech you, beware of ſinning againſt God

<hi>Riches</hi> may be indeed uſed as means to propagate <hi>Religion,</hi> to

teacheth not to take more of the means then is convenient for

his <hi>riches</hi> bereaved him of <hi>ſleep</hi> and made him anxiouſly to be

one of the leaſt evils of <hi>riches,</hi> that the care to gather, preſerve
and imploy them, ſpend ſo much <hi>time</hi> unto us, which is a thing
moſt <hi>precious,</hi> ſo that often they give us no leaſure to naturall
<hi>refreſhment,</hi> and farreleſſe to do that which belongeth to the
<hi>Service</hi> of our GOD &amp; <hi>ſalvation</hi> of our ſouls. THEOPHYLAC ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<hi>That it was ſitly in the night, that he had ſuch thoughts, for the

of groſſe darknes,</hi> whence all his <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>conſultations</hi> were but
<hi>dreams</hi> of felicity.<note place="margin">17. Sudden death fear full.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve here, how dreadfull is the <hi>Sentence</hi> of GOD againſt
this man. 1. His <hi>death</hi> is ſudden, even that ſame night. <hi>It is a
fearfull and dangerous thing to be taken away in a moment.</hi> Iob 34.
20. To be ſnatched away ſuddenly, there is none, but would
ſhune this, and therefore it hath been one of the <hi>petitions</hi> of the
chriſtian Church in her ſervice; <hi>From ſudden death LORD de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us.</hi> To <hi>die</hi> leaſurely is more painfull indeed for the <hi>body</hi>
ſomtimes, then to be deſpatched ſuddenly, but very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
for the <hi>ſoul.</hi> It giveth a man time, to call himſelf to juſt
account of things paſt, it giveth him leaſure to cenſure unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,
the pleaſures of <hi>ſinne</hi> and <hi>vanities</hi> of this world, to detaſte
them, and to mourne for them, and ſo to perfect <hi>repentance.</hi> The
<hi>Joyes</hi> of heaven have leaſure alſo to preſent themſelves unto our
minde; and thus a man by means of departing at leaſure, may
exerciſe noble <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>faith, love, hope</hi> and <hi>patience.</hi> By means of
it, he may alſo do great good to others. It giveth him occaſion

If a man be in a right and wiſe <hi>courſe,</hi> though <hi>death</hi> come
ſuddenly, yet it cannot prejudge his <hi>ſalvation:</hi> but to be ſeized

alſo he confoteth their <hi>murmuring</hi> as if he would ſay, yee
murmure unjuſtly, there is no falſhood in my <hi>doctrine;</hi> but yee
do not underſtand nor beleeve it. becauſe none can do this, <hi>But
he which is drawn and enlightned by the Father that hath ſent me,</hi>
which yee are not, through your own <hi>default.</hi> Put the caſe a man
of great learning were teaching in ſchools, of high and ſublime
<hi>myſteries,</hi> which cannot be underſtood by them who are unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
if rude and unlettered men ſhould come in and heare him,
and condemne what he ſaid as falſe and untrue, he might juſtly
ſay to them, it is not the falſhood or abſurdity of my <hi>doctrine,</hi>
which maketh you to diſaſſent from it, but it is your want of
<hi>learning,</hi> without which this <hi>doctrine</hi> cannot be underſtood. So
our Saviour telleth theſe carnall <hi>hearers,</hi> that there was no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
in that which he had ſaid, but that they wanted that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
without which they could not embrace his <hi>Words.</hi> He
might have ſaid ye beleev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

neceſſity being <hi>drawn by the Father who ſent him,</hi> for this end
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100463:83"/>
that he might be underſtood and beleeved. This he doeth firſt
to ſhow that his <hi>doctrine</hi> was not falſe nor contrary to God, but
a true and divine <hi>doctrine</hi> to the <hi>beliefe</hi> wherof, the Father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
draweth 2. to ſhew that it is not in the power of man to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
and receive ſo high <hi>myſteries,</hi> but that the ſpeciall aide
and aſſiſtance of GOD is neceſſary thereunto. 3. He ſpeaketh
this to ſtrick them with a juſt <hi>terrour,</hi> by conſidering that they
were not enlightned and drawn by GOD, and to ſtirre them up
humbly to beg this heavenly <hi>Favour</hi> at the Hands of GOD.<note place="margin">4. Drawing is calling.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This much for theſe <hi>words</hi> in generall. For the more full un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of them, wee ſhall by GODS Grace open up more
particularly what this <hi>drawing</hi> of the Father is, <hi>Without which no

diſputed here-anent; but we ſhall of purpoſe forbeare them, and
inſiſt upon theſe <hi>things,</hi> which may ſerve more for your edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
firſt then yee are to underſtand, that this <hi>drawing</hi> of GOD
is the <hi>Calling</hi> of GOD, as our Saviour himſelf expoundeth it in
the verſes immediatly following. But every <hi>calling,</hi> is not this
<hi>Calling</hi> whereof chiefly he intendeth to ſpeak here.<note place="margin">5. Generall Calling.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There is a generall <hi>Calling</hi> of men by God, common both to
the <hi>reprobate</hi> and <hi>elect,</hi> and there is a <hi>calling</hi> peculiar to the Elect.
1. There is a <hi>calling</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to both, by which God calleth men
both outwardly and inwardly. He calleth all that are within the
Church by his <hi>Word</hi> heard and read, publickly and privatly. He
calleth by <hi>proſperity</hi> and <hi>adverſity,</hi> by <hi>allurements</hi> and by <hi>ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi>
Somtimes he hedgeth up the wayes of men with <hi>thornes</hi> of
<hi>affliction, That they may turne back from their evil way, to their God
whom they have forſaken.</hi> Hoſ. 2. 6. Somtimes <hi>He loadneth them
with bleſſings, that thereby he may draw them, as it were, with cords
and hands of love.</hi> Hoſ. 11. 4. So alſo inwardly his divine <hi>illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and <hi>inſpirations</hi> are in ſome meaſure communicated both to
the good and to the bade, <hi>They taſte of the good Word of GOD, &amp;
of the heavenly gift, and of the powers of the world to come.</hi> Heb. 6. 5.
They are brought to ſome beliefe and conſideration ſomtimes
of <hi>death</hi> and <hi>judgement,</hi> of the pains of <hi>hell</hi> and joyes of <hi>Heaven,</hi>
and by all theſe meanes GOD calleth and knocketh, as it were,
at their <hi>hearts</hi> that they may open, yea not once but often doeth
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100463:84"/>
he this,<note place="margin">6. Effectuall calling.</note> as all may find by their own <hi>experience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>calling</hi> in ſome ſort may be called a <hi>drawing</hi> &amp; it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
here, yet is it not that wherof our Saviour chiefly ſpeaks,
for he ſpeaketh of that <hi>calling</hi> which maketh men effectually
to follow it, as appeareth by the next verſes. Therefore I ſaid,
there is another <hi>calling</hi> proper to the <hi>Elect,</hi> whereby God ſo
concurreth with the means uſed by him, that he effectually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth
the minde, changeth the heart and draweth it after
him, by his Grace preveening, exciting, aſſiſting and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
them powerfully, till they attaine unto the end of their
<hi>faith,</hi> which is the ſalvation of their <hi>ſoules.</hi> Hence our Saviont
ſayeth, a little before, <hi>All that the Father giveth unto me, cometh
unto me, and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wayes caſt out.</hi> So
they that are thus <hi>drawn</hi> are given by the Father; <hi>Of him they
hear and learne,</hi> as he ſayeth in the next words, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
come to Chriſt, <hi>This is that Gift and Grace of effectuall
Calling, which overcometh the hardeſt heart that it meeteth with, and
is rejected by none,</hi> as holy AUGUSTINE ſpeaketh. This is that
which the devote ſoule deſireth in the firſt of the <hi>Canticles</hi> 4.
<hi>Draw me and wee will rune after thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this <hi>drawing</hi> chiefly,<note place="margin">7. this draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary.</note> as I ſaid, theſe <hi>words</hi> are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.
It hath ſundry excellent <hi>properties.</hi> whereof I ſhall touch
but ſome. 1. It is ſo <hi>neceſſar</hi> unto us, <hi>That without it none can come to
Chriſt,</hi> as our Saviour ſaith here; which he alſo mainly intends in
this place. If out Saviour had not called upon <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he
was in his <hi>grave</hi> with a mighty Voice ſaying, <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi>
he ſhould have remained there ſtill, untill he had returned into
the duſt. Even ſo except the <hi>Voice</hi> of GOD <hi>Call</hi> and <hi>Draw</hi> us out
of our <hi>corruption,</hi> we can never come out of it. <hi>Without me</hi> ſayeth
our LORD, <hi>Yee can do nothing. We are not ſufficient of our ſelves as
of our ſelves, to thinke a good thought, but all our ſufficiency is of
GOD.</hi> 2. Cor. 3. 5. Our <hi>minds</hi> are full of <hi>blindnes, vanity</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnes:</hi>
our <hi>wills</hi> are <hi>perverſe</hi> and bent to <hi>evil</hi> and our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<hi>enemies</hi> are mighty, Yea beſide that, theſe <hi>actions</hi> whereby
we muſt follow GOD are <hi>ſublime, heavenly</hi> and <hi>ſupernaturall,</hi>
which nature of it ſelf can never reach unto. If the <hi>body</hi> of a man
be able and found, he may indeed <hi>walke</hi> and <hi>rune;</hi> yet can he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100463:84"/>
not <hi>ſlie,</hi> becauſe that is above the reach and power of nature:
even ſo, although there were not that <hi>corruptions</hi> in us, which is
indeed in us, yet without the ſpeciall Aſſiſtance of GOD, we
could never mount up to theſe high &amp; heavenly <hi>actions,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we follow Chriſt, by believing his <hi>Truth,</hi> by loving his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and hoping in his <hi>Mercy.</hi> It is neceſſary therefore that we
be furniſhed by him with new <hi>Strength,</hi> whereby he draweth us,
and inableth us to follow after him. He giveth us the eye of
<hi>Faith,</hi> whereby we may beleeve, meditate &amp; contemplate theſe
<hi>myſteries</hi> which are neceſſary to be known for our <hi>ſalvation. God</hi>
ſaieth S. PAUL 2. Cor. 4. <hi>who commanded light to ſhine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
hath made his Light to ſhine in our hearts.</hi> He giveth to our
ſoules the ſpirituall <hi>feet,</hi> or rather wings of <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> by
which we may follow after him. <hi>They that wait upon the LORD</hi>
Iſa. 40. 31. <hi>ſhall renew their ſtrength: they ſhall mount up as the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>agels, they ſhall run and not be weary, they ſhall walk &amp; not be faine.
Love</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> which are the <hi>affections</hi> of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> are as it were,
the <hi>feet</hi> of it, whereby it moveth toward that, which it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
as <hi>Good. Love</hi> is the chief <hi>affection</hi> and, as it were, the
right <hi>foot.</hi> Thence ariſeth <hi>deſire</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> when it is abſent, <hi>joy</hi> of
<hi>Good</hi> when it is preſent: <hi>hatred</hi> of the contrary evill, <hi>feare</hi> of that
<hi>evil</hi> when it approacheth, and <hi>ſorrow</hi> for it when it ſeizeth on us.
<hi>Hope</hi> is, as it were, the leaſt <hi>foot</hi> of the <hi>ſoule,</hi> whereby we move
toward that <hi>Good</hi> which is hard to be obtained. From it ariſeth
<hi>boldnes, courage, magnanimity, conſtancie</hi> to endure travails and
troubles, <hi>anger</hi> &amp; <hi>zeale</hi> to reſiſt impediments. But this <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Hope</hi> ſimply conſidered will never leade us in the way to Chriſt,
and therefore as God giveth us <hi>Faith</hi> to be a ſpirituall <hi>eye,</hi> ſo he
giveth us ſupernaturall <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> to be the <hi>feet</hi> of our <hi>ſoule</hi>
whereby we may move and runne after Chriſt in the way of the
obedience of theſe commandements, which by the light of <hi>faith</hi>
are manifeſted to us, yet ſo as we chiefly leane to the Love of
GOD and our neighbour, which is, as I ſaid, the right and chief
<hi>foot,</hi> whereby our <hi>hope</hi> is ſtrengthened and confirmed, <hi>For hope
maketh us not aſhamed, becauſe the Love of GOD is ſhed abroad i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our hearts by the holy Ghoſt which is given us.</hi> Rom. 5. 5. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this point then. This <hi>drawing</hi> is ſo neceſſary, that without
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100463:85"/>
It noné did ever come or ſhall ever come to Chriſt. Of our ſelves
we can, with theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> murmure at his Words &amp; diſaſſent from
them, but cannot <hi>beleeve</hi> them, farreleſſe can we <hi>love</hi> him and
truſt in his <hi>mercy.</hi> Without common calling ſpoken of before,
none can come at all in any meaſure, and without this effectuall
<hi>drawing,</hi> none can come as he ought.<note place="margin">8. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This <hi>drawing</hi> of the Father is not neceſſary only for
one moment, but is a continued and perpetuall <hi>aſſistance.</hi> We
cannot begin without it, nor without it can wee end. <hi>It is GOD
that worketh in us both to will and to do.</hi> Some thought that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of our <hi>converſion</hi> is from our ſolves, but moſt falſly.
There is no good <hi>thought</hi> nor good <hi>affection</hi> in us but from God.
till he preveene and excite us, we can neither ſeek nor deſire as
we ought. The devote <hi>ſoule</hi> had never ſaid, <hi>Draw me and we will
ran after thee,</hi> except in ſome meaſure before ſhe had been <hi>drawn</hi>
and excited to ſeek and to deſire to run after Chriſt. Therefore
our LORD ſaieth; <hi>Behold I ſtand at the doore &amp; I knock.</hi> He knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
before we open, yea he ſoftneth &amp; he openeth it, as he did
the heart of <hi>Lydia. Our endevours are none at all</hi> ſaieth S. BER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARD
<hi>except they be excited.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Seek my Face,</hi> before we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<hi>Thy Face LORD I will ſeek, hide not thy Face from me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cast away thy ſervant in diſpleaſure.</hi> So on the other part our
<hi>endevours</hi> are but in vaine, if they be not ſtill aſſiſted &amp; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by the powerfull <hi>Grace</hi> of GOD. Hence David ſayeth in
that ſame place before cited, <hi>Thou haſt been my help, leave me not
neither forſake me O GOD of my ſalvation. I have laboured more
abundantly then all the Apoſtles</hi> ſayeth S. PAUL, <hi>yet not I but the
Grace of God that is within me.</hi> Albeit we be ſet in the right way,
yet can wee not go a <hi>foot</hi> except Chriſt bee with us. <hi>Except thy
Preſence go with us, take us not hence</hi> ſaid MOSES to the LORD,
Exod. 33. who anſwered him, <hi>My Preſence ſhall go before thee
and give thee reſt.</hi> Whence is it that Godly men do not only fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Chriſt, <hi>but think his yoake eaſie and his burden light?</hi> becauſe
Chriſt &amp; his <hi>Grace</hi> is alwayes with them, ſupporting, ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
&amp; comforting them. Hence the <hi>deniall</hi> of themſelves, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
eaſie, their <hi>patience</hi> ſweet, their <hi>humility</hi> glorious, their
<hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>devetion</hi> pleaſant and joyfull. Chriſt going before
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100463:85"/>
them alſo, as it were, from whoſe precious <hi>oyntments</hi> ſo ſweet
a ſmell proceedeth, as allureth and draweth after him thoſe
that do perceive them. His divine <hi>Perfections</hi> are, as it were,
theſe precious <hi>oyntments,</hi> eſpecally his <hi>Mercy, Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,</hi>
all which ſend forth a ſweet &amp; flagrant <hi>ſmell</hi> which is moſt
powerfull to draw after him: what are his gracious <hi>Promiſes</hi> and
manifold <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> his heavenly <hi>Illuſtrations;</hi> his divine <hi>Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and moſt ſweet <hi>affections</hi> of <hi>devotion?</hi> but, as it were, the
ſweet and flagrant ſmell of his <hi>Mercy.</hi> What is his word which
is the <hi>word</hi> of life? that diſcovereth to us the <hi>way</hi> of ſalvation,
but, as it were, the ſweet ſavour of his <hi>Wiſdome.</hi> So all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>vertues</hi> that were in him, were, as it were; the ſavour of
his <hi>Holines,</hi> whereby it diffuſeth it ſelf for alluring and drawing
men to him, and that ſtill nearer and nearer. Thus his <hi>drawing</hi>
of us, continueth ſtill while we are here, <hi>Nevertheleſſe, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually

            <p>Thirdly, This draught of us by God is in ſome ſort recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

We <hi>draw</hi> God to us by our <hi>prayers, ſighs</hi> and <hi>groans,</hi> yea by them
we hold and bind him in a manner. <hi>Let me go</hi> ſaid he to Iacob

draw him to us by <hi>love,</hi> which GOD himſelf who is <hi>Love</hi> doeth
alwayes accompany. <hi>He that abideth in love abideth in GOD, and
GOD abideth in him</hi> ſayeth S. IOHN. <hi>If any man love me,</hi> ſayeth
our LORD, <hi>I will love him, and my Father will love him; and my
Father and I will come and dwell with him.</hi> Thus being <hi>drawn</hi> by
God, we <hi>draw</hi> him to us in ſome manner: but yet abſolutly we
<hi>draw</hi> not him, but by him are <hi>drawn</hi> to himſelf; For it is he who
giveth us all that ſtrength of <hi>beauty, vertue</hi> and <hi>love</hi> which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
him, &amp; he giveth it for this effect, that we may be united
more and more to Him wherein our <hi>Happineſſe</hi> ſtandeth.</p>

Fourthly,<note place="margin">10. It is not violent.</note> This <hi>draught</hi> of GOD is not a violent <hi>draught,</hi> but
moſt ſweet <hi>motion</hi> of us, wherby we who were before <hi>unwilling,</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Manichees,</hi> as CHRIGOST. here reporteth affirmed, <hi>that

it ſignifieth a <hi>moving</hi> of any thing be way of <hi>force.</hi> I anſwer,
this <hi>word</hi> is uſed here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not without great <hi>reaſon.</hi> For firſt, That
<hi>Action</hi> of God wherby he bringeth us to himſelf, is like to <hi>draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
in this, that as when a thing is <hi>drawn</hi> the <hi>power</hi> is outward
by which the thing <hi>draws</hi> is moved, &amp; without which it ſhould
not be moved; even ſo in the firſt <hi>drawing</hi> of us to God, by his
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100463:86"/>
               <hi>illuſtrations</hi> and <hi>inſpirations,</hi> the <hi>power</hi> is without us, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
from the liberty of our <hi>will.</hi> This <hi>Calling</hi> of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veeneth
our <hi>will,</hi> yea we are ſo farre from willing it. that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we reſiſt and ſtrugle againſt it, and would be gladly quite
of theſe heavenly <hi>inſpirations,</hi> that we might the more freely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
our carnall <hi>joyes.</hi> In this reſpect this <hi>Calling</hi> of God, may
Juſtly be called a <hi>drawing,</hi> without which we can no more move
toward GOD then, a <hi>weight</hi> can move upward except it be
<hi>drawn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">13. Secondly why.</note> Our <hi>effectuall Calling</hi> is called a <hi>drawing,</hi> to ſignifie
the vehement and mighty <hi>power</hi> whereby GOD changeth the
heart of man, when it is his purpoſe to bring it home to himſelf.
<hi>drawing</hi> importeth <hi>vehemencie</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and what is ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and ſtrong, as this <hi>change</hi> of the right hand of the moſt high.
Thereby ſomtimes ſuddenly hee ſo worketh upon the <hi>ſoul</hi> of
man, that he who was before drowned in <hi>vice,</hi> and long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to it, beginneth now to abhore that which moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
before he loved, and on the contrary to deſire &amp; love
<hi>that</hi> which before he abhored. By this <hi>power</hi> he that before was
the <hi>enemie</hi> &amp; <hi>perſecutor,</hi> it may be of Chriſt, When the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Light</hi> had ſhined about S. PAUL: yea when it had ſhined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him, and when God had ſtretched out his Hand, and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
hold of his heart, he incontinent cryed out, <hi>LORD, what
will thou have me to do?</hi> Now he acknowledgeth him to he his
<hi>LORD</hi> and the <hi>Law-giver,</hi> whom before hee eſteemed a <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor</hi>
of the law. Now he offereth himſelf to do his <hi>Will,</hi> whom
before he perſecuted, although he himſelf ſhould therfore have
been perſecuted. This <hi>Calling</hi> indeed was extraordinary, yet
ſome thing like thereunto we may find in every one that is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
<hi>called.</hi> This is ſhadowed forth in the <hi>parable</hi> of calling
to the <hi>marriage.</hi> Luk. 14. All were <hi>called</hi> indeed, but ſome were
but ſimplie called, and after their refuſall no more urged, but
others were not left untill they were brought in; the king com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
to <hi>compell them to come in.</hi> So God dealeth with his <hi>elect.</hi>
he ſo calleth, that he leaveth them not till they anſwer, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him. Till then he ſtill urgeth, by <hi>perſwaſions, exhortations,
reprooffs, benefits, ſcourges, illuſtrations</hi> and <hi>inspirations,</hi> though
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100463:87"/>
they be <hi>blind;</hi> he by <hi>calling</hi> giveth them <hi>ſight</hi> to know the way to
the banqueting <hi>houſe,</hi> although they be <hi>halt</hi> and <hi>maimed,</hi> he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
them <hi>feet</hi> to walk unto it. And in a word no leſſe powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bringeth them unto himſelf, then if he did uſe <hi>violence</hi> unto
them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">14. Thirdly, why.</note> Albeit no <hi>violence</hi> be uſed to the <hi>ſoul</hi> of him that is
converted when he is called; yet there is <hi>violence</hi> uſed againſt
ſatan, from whoſe <hi>power</hi> he is drawn by the mighty <hi>Power</hi> of
God, that he may no more be the <hi>ſlave</hi> of ſatan, but the Servant
of GOD. There is alſo a kinde of <hi>violence</hi> inferred to our ſinful
<hi>corruption</hi> for ſo great is the <hi>Power</hi> of GOD given to us by his
<hi>Grace,</hi> that violently, as it were, we break the <hi>bands</hi> whereby
our naturall <hi>corruptions</hi> hath hitherto tyed us. <hi>The Kingdome of
heaven</hi> ſayeth our Saviour <hi>ſuffereth violence, and the violent entereth
by force.</hi> Thus we ſee our <hi>effectuall calling</hi> is not without cauſe
called a <hi>drawing of us by the Father</hi> who of his infinite <hi>Goodn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi>
&amp; by his almighty <hi>Power</hi> worketh ſo on our <hi>hearts,</hi> that of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing</hi>
he maketh us to be <hi>willing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">15. this ſhould teach us hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mility.</note> to go to Chriſt &amp; <hi>to run after
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>doctrine</hi> ſerveth firſt to teach us al <hi>humility.</hi> If thou have
any <hi>good,</hi> thou may perceive from this which hath been ſaid,
that it is not of thy ſelf but from God. <hi>O man who hath diſcerned
thee? what haſt thou, but that which thou haſt received? and of thou
hast received it, why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ousteſt thou as if thou hadeſt not received it?</hi>
No <hi>honour</hi> herein is due to us, but all the <hi>glory</hi> belongeth to him,
<hi>From whom every good gift and every perfect giving deſcendeth.</hi>
Againe, if as yet thou have nothing which is truly <hi>good,</hi> blame
not God, but thy ſelf; through whoſe <hi>default</hi> it is that thou art
not <hi>drawn</hi> by him. No man indeed can come to him except he
be <hi>drawn,</hi> but if any man be not <hi>drawn,</hi> this is to be imputed to
his own <hi>wickednes.</hi> As GOD draweth none but out of his free
<hi>Mercy,</hi> ſo he leaveth none but out of his uncontrollable <hi>juſtice.</hi>
Humble therfore thy ſelf, and acknowledge as the truth is, that
thou haſt not uſed the <hi>means</hi> a right which he hath given thee,
but on the contrary, hath abuſed his manifold <hi>Bleſſings.</hi> Laſtly,
This ſerveth alſo to work in us <hi>humility,</hi> while we conſider the
different <hi>dealing</hi> of God towards diverſe <hi>perſons,</hi> of whom ſome
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100463:87"/>
are <hi>drawn</hi> and ſome are not <hi>drawn</hi> by him. Go not to inquire cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly,
why this man is <hi>drawn,</hi> and that man is not <hi>drawn,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though,
it may be, that he that is <hi>drawn,</hi> is no leſſe if not more
unworthy, then he who is not <hi>drawn.</hi> If thou ſearch into this, it is
<hi>preſumption; humility</hi> contenteth it ſelf with this, that if any be
not <hi>drawn,</hi> it is through their own <hi>fault,</hi> &amp; if any be <hi>drawn,</hi> it is of
the <hi>bounty</hi> of God, who may do with his own what he will. <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi>
maketh us cover our faces with the <hi>Seraphims</hi> &amp; to adore
this great <hi>myſterie,</hi> &amp; to cry out with them <hi>Holy, holy, holy, is the
LORD GOD of Hoſts, Holy is be in all his wayes, Holy</hi> is he, both
when he <hi>draweth</hi> and when he <hi>draweth</hi> not, when he <hi>calleth</hi> men
to him, and when he rejecteth them. It maketh us to cry out
with S. PAUL, <hi>O the deepe of the riches,</hi> both of the Wiſdome and
Knowledge of GOD. how unſearchable are his judgements, and his
Wayes are paſt finding one.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">16. Invocation of GOD.</note> The conſideration of this <hi>doctrine</hi> ſhould ſtirre us
up to earneſt incalling on God for his <hi>Grace</hi> at all times. <hi>Inquire
not,</hi> ſayeth holy AUGUSTINE upon this place, <hi>Why GOD draweth
this man, and why he draweth not that man: but understand &amp; receive
this counſell, if thou thy ſelf be not drawn, pray to God that thou may

former <hi>words,</hi> wherein he ſaid, <hi>that men cannot come to him, except

of this, that he was inferiour to the Father: therefore he ſaieth,
<hi>That he ſhall raiſe him up at the laſt day;</hi> which importeth no leſſe
<hi>power</hi> then that is whereby men are <hi>drawn</hi> by the Father. 2.
Theſe <hi>words</hi> ar added to confirme that which he ſaid before;
namely, <hi>That he is the bread of life, and came down from heaven.</hi> To
confirme this, I ſay, eſpecially in the minds of <hi>beleevers.</hi> For if
he raiſe up men at the laſt day, undoubtedly he is not from the
earth: but from heaven and if he give <hi>life</hi> to them that are
dead, he may be juſtly called <hi>The bread of life.</hi> 3. He addeth
theſe <hi>words</hi> to comfort <hi>Beleevers,</hi> and to terrifie <hi>unbeleevers.</hi>
For no greater <hi>comfort</hi> can be to them that receive him by a true
and lively <hi>faith,</hi> then the aſſured <hi>hope,</hi> that they ſhall be raiſed
up by him from <hi>death,</hi> to a glorious and immortall <hi>life,</hi> and on

and therefore, it may be, we ſhall have <hi>occaſion</hi> to ſpeak of it
more fully. Only now conſider that this is a <hi>point</hi> which we

            <p>For clearing of this,<note place="margin">5. What to be taught of GOD.</note> yee are to underſtand that to be <hi>taught</hi>

teacheſt out of thy law;</hi> and when he ſaid againe, <hi>Teach me to do thy
Will O GOD for it is good.</hi> This our Saviour manifeſteth in the
next <hi>words,</hi> wherein he explaineth what it is, <hi>To be taught by
GOD,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That ſuch an one heareth and learneth of the Father
and cometh to him,</hi> that is, he that is ſo <hi>taught,</hi> underſtandeth and
beleeveth that which the Father revealeth, and embraceth it

<hi>hope,</hi> by <hi>love</hi> and <hi>obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence,<note place="margin">6. This fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained out of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine.</note> S. AUGUSTINE in his book of the <hi>Grace</hi> of Chriſt 12.
and 13. chapters inferreth <hi>That this doctrine of the Father, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, but his heavenly Grace communicated to us, whereby he
maketh us not only to know what we ſhould do, but alſo to do what we
know, whereby he maketh us not only to beleeve that which ſhould be
loved, but alſo to love that which we beleeve.</hi> This is the <hi>doctrine</hi> of
the Father, whereby from on hye, by his unſpeakable <hi>Power</hi>
inwardly he manifeſteth his <hi>truth,</hi> and communicateth to us the
<hi>love</hi> of himſelf. This alſo is manifeſt as S. AUGUSTINE obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
there from the 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 9. where S. PAUL ſayeth; <hi>As for
brotherly love yee have not need, that I ſhould write unto you, for yee
are taught of GOD to love one another.</hi> So the <hi>Teaching</hi> of GOD
maketh us not only to know what ſhould be done, but alſo to
do that which we know. And he that <hi>knowes</hi> and <hi>doeth not,</hi> is not
caught by God. He is not taught according to <hi>grace</hi> but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to the <hi>letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. Yee are to conſider that our Saviour by urging this
<hi>Teaching</hi> of GOD, this <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>learning</hi> of the Father doeth
not condemne the outward miniſtrie of <hi>preaching,</hi>

<hi>neceſſity</hi> of it ordinarly. For our Lord himſelf at this time was
preaching outwardly the <hi>word,</hi> and S. PAUL accordingly <hi>Rom.</hi>
10. 17. tels us; <hi>That faith is by hearing,</hi> for which effect <hi>preaching</hi>
is needfull, and therefore he with the Prophet ſayeth there, <hi>how
beautifull upon the mountaines, are the feet of them that bring glad
tydings, that bring glade tydings of good things?</hi> Hence we reade in
the 8. of the <hi>Acts</hi> that when it was the Will of God to convert
the Ethiopian <hi>Eunu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">8. Why this doctrine is is aſcrived to God.</note> but he would not convert him by the <hi>Angell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay, If man have any hand in this <hi>teaching,</hi> Why
is it called the <hi>teaching</hi> of God? I Anſ. It is called ſo juſtly;
Firſt, Becauſe the <hi>Word</hi> that is preached, is not the <hi>word</hi> of
man, but the <hi>Word</hi> of God. 2. Becauſe man concurreth onely
but outwardly as an <hi>inſtrument</hi> propoſing the <hi>Word,</hi> but it is
God who worketh inwardly upon the <hi>ſoule,</hi> he hath his <hi>Chayre</hi>
in heaven that teacheth the <hi>heart,</hi> without whoſe powerfull aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
<hi>all our words are but an empty ſound,</hi> as S. AUGUSTINE
ſpeaketh in his 3. <hi>Treatiſe</hi> upon the 1. Epiſt. of <hi>S. John,</hi> ſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on the ſame place, he ſaieth, <hi>God is the teacher of them that
learne, becauſe that which is given and revealed within, is from him.
Paul may plant, and Apollo may water, but it is God that giveth
the increaſe, ſo neither is he that planteth, nor he that watereth any
thing, but God who giveth the increaſe,</hi> 1. Cor. 3. 7. So then our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
by commending the <hi>teaching</hi> of God, the <hi>bearing</hi> &amp; <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
from the Father, doth not exclude the neceſſity of the out.
<hi>Miniſtry,</hi> but ſheweth the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>efficacie</hi> of God, Who is
the principall <hi>Agent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be ſome man will yet ſay; If no more be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
here,<note place="margin">9. Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie of the New Teſtament</note> by this <hi>teaching</hi> of God, then that which hath been
ſaid; it would ſeeme, that there ſhould be no <hi>difference</hi> in this,
betwixt them who lived under the Old Teſtament, and thoſe
who live now under the New; Which <hi>difference</hi> is plainly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
both by our Saviour &amp; by the Prophet. There would ſeem
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100463:90"/>
I ſay, to be no <hi>difference,</hi> becauſe God concurreth with his <hi>word</hi>
preached then alſo, and it was he that did work <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love</hi>
in the hearts of men, I Anſ. This is true, yet notwithſtanding,
there is a great <hi>difference,</hi> for the <hi>teaching</hi> of God then ordinarly
was limitate to one Nation: whereas now it is offered to all the
world, &amp; throughout al the world, al the <hi>Children</hi> of the church
of the <hi>Faithful</hi> are made really partakers of it. 2. The manner
of <hi>teaching</hi> now, is more excellent; becauſe the <hi>Revellation</hi> of
God is more cleare, and the <hi>Love</hi> of God more aboundantly
poured into the hearts of men; Whence the PROPHET <hi>Iſaiah;</hi>
Chap. 11. 7. ſpeaking of this time ſaith. <hi>That the whol earth ſhal be

Now, let us come to the <hi>Vſes</hi> of this <hi>Doctrin.</hi>
            </p>

by the <hi>Word</hi> of God, as if without the <hi>Meanes,</hi> we might be

in this laſt age, have gone exceeding farre this way: and by this
mad conceat, have ſtirred up horrible <hi>Confuſions</hi> and have
drawn many with themſelves into perdition. Farre be it from
us to imagine any ſuch thing. God hath ordained <hi>meanes,</hi>
whereinto although he hath not tyed himſelf, yet hath he tyed

theſe ar, as it were, the conduits of his <hi>grace,</hi> &amp; as it wer,

If thou neglect the <hi>meanes,</hi> thou but tempteſt God, &amp; deceiveſt

            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">11. Great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceatfulnes of our hearts.</note> Wee ſhould conſider, That our <hi>Heart</hi> is deceatful,

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100463:91"/>
not heed unto Gods <hi>word.</hi> Many are deceived in this kind, Some

So we ſee <hi>Nathan</hi> being conſulted by <hi>David</hi> concerning

in this kinde, that they think that to bee but a <hi>Fancie</hi> of
their own, which is indeed the <hi>motion</hi> of the Spirit of God, and
ſo alſo it pleaſed God, ſomtimes to exerciſe his own in time of

grow in <hi>humility</hi> and other <hi>vertues.</hi> Theſe are like to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>S. Mark,</hi> 6. 49. who in the <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> when they ſaw our

a <hi>Ghoſt.</hi> Thus ſomtimes we take <hi>evill</hi> for <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> for <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi>
and therefore we muſt not ſeperate the inward <hi>Word</hi> from
the outward; Wee muſt not beleeve every ſpirit, <hi>but wee must
try the ſpirits, if they be of God.</hi> Wee ought to try them by the

to whom the diſpenſation of the <hi>Word</hi> is committed, who
ſhould be more skillfull in diſcerning of the <hi>ſpirits,</hi> according

this <hi>point</hi> then we ought not to deſpiſe the outward <hi>meant,</hi> but
ſhould highly eſteeme of them, and ſhould greatly praiſe GOD
for the <hi>occaſion</hi> which we have of them. We have particular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>thankfullnes</hi> in this reſpect. There is no <hi>Nation</hi> under
heaven, with which GOD hath dealt more bountifully in this
kinde, then with us who live in theſe three NATION ES.
No <hi>Nation</hi> hath the <hi>Gospell</hi> in greater plenty and purity. No

albeit the outward <hi>means</hi> are much to be eſteemed, yet we are
to depend chiefly upon the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> of GOD. He is the chief

His <hi>Wiſdome</hi> is of himſelf, and in himſelf he ſeeth all <hi>things</hi> that
are to be done. Therefore his <hi>Knowledge</hi> is unbounded, and <hi>He
is only Wiſe,</hi> as the Apoſtle calleth him. All others of themſelves
are <hi>ignorant,</hi> their <hi>knowledge</hi> is from him &amp; hath narrow <hi>limites,</hi>
and hath much <hi>errour</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> joyned with it. Whence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the <hi>doctrine</hi> of others is pernicious to them that learne of
them, but that which GOD <hi>teacheth</hi> is alwayes <hi>true</hi> and <hi>ſaving</hi>
and ſuch as may leade us to deliverance from the greateſt <hi>evils,</hi>

is able to make the moſt <hi>rude</hi> to learne every <hi>truth</hi> that he

yet, it may be, we are not moved, not can be moved by the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>

               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:100463:94"/>
which is according to God, and the <hi>ſorrow</hi> of this world.
The <hi>ſorrow</hi> of the good <hi>Corinthians</hi> had this good in it, that it
was not a <hi>ſorrow</hi> of this world, which is no matter of <hi>joy,</hi> for it
worketh <hi>death.</hi> All <hi>ſorrow</hi> preſuppoſeth <hi>love,</hi> for no man ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
but for the loſſe or want of that which he loveth: therefore
where this worldly <hi>ſorrow</hi> is, there is alſo a <hi>love</hi> of this world.
Such is the <hi>ſorrow</hi> that men have for the loſſe of worldly things,
<hi>wealth, honours, delights</hi> or <hi>friends.</hi> If their <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>love</hi> be ſet
upon theſe things, they fooliſhly, and without the feare of God,
rejoyce in them when they have them, and being drunke with

when they loſſe or want them, their <hi>hearts</hi> are caſt down, and
they are preſſed down with <hi>Sorrow</hi> inordinatly. Such a <hi>Sorrow,</hi>
the Apoſtle recommendeth not, nay, he dehorteth from it, for
it worketh <hi>death.</hi> This <hi>Sorrow</hi> can do no <hi>good.</hi> When a man hath
loſt his <hi>riches,</hi> if he ſorrow for that, this <hi>ſorrow</hi> will not reſtore
his <hi>wealth</hi> to him againe. If a man hath loſt his <hi>honour,</hi> the <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
which hee hath for that, will not recover it againe. If hee
hath loſt his <hi>friends</hi> or <hi>children,</hi> ſhould he mourne never ſo much
for them, his <hi>ſorrow</hi> will not bring them to life againe. So this
<hi>ſorrow</hi> can do no good: yea on the contrary, it doth great <hi>harme,</hi>
it worketh <hi>death.</hi> It maketh the way to bodily <hi>death,</hi> eſpecially
when it is inordinate; <hi>The heavines of the ſpirit dryeth up the bones.</hi>
ſaieth SOLOMON Proverb. 17. 22. <hi>Sorrow hath killed many, and
there is no profite in it,</hi> ſaieth the WISE-MAN, <hi>Eccleſtaſt.</hi> Chap. 30.
23. And which is worſt of all, this <hi>ſorrow</hi> leadeth to eternall
<hi>death:</hi> For God is offended with it, it ſtirreth up a man to do
many things, wherat God is offended; and maketh a man guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

offendeth him but <hi>ſinne;</hi> and every <hi>ſinne</hi> offendeth him:
for all <hi>ſinne</hi> is done in <hi>Thought, word</hi> or <hi>deed</hi> againſt his eternall

which is nothing elſe but GOD himſelf, ſo that whoſoever ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,

            <p>But here, it is to be obſerved, that every <hi>Sorrow</hi> for <hi>ſinne</hi> is not
this godly <hi>ſorrow,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. every ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſin is not this Sorrow.</note> or <hi>ſorrow</hi> according to God. For firſt, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may

and <hi>filthines</hi> contrary to the <hi>honeſty</hi> &amp; <hi>beauty</hi> of humane reaſon,
Such a <hi>Sorrow</hi> a naturall man may have, but if he riſe not up
higher, he hath not come unto that <hi>Sorrow</hi> which is according
to GOD. 2. A man may be grieved for his <hi>ſinnes</hi> becauſe of
the <hi>harme</hi> and <hi>damnage</hi> that he hath thereby, becauſe thereby
he hath loſt his <hi>credit</hi> or good <hi>name,</hi> his <hi>means,</hi> his <hi>health,</hi> and
which is moſt of all, becauſe thereby he hath loſt eternall <hi>joyes,</hi>
and hath encurred endles and intollerable <hi>paines.</hi> If a man in
his <hi>Sorrow</hi> regard no more but this, he hath not yet attained to
that <hi>Sorrow</hi> which is according to GOD.</p>
            <p>If one man have offended another, ſuppoſe he be grieved for
that he hath done,<note place="margin">6. Sorrow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> yet if in this <hi>griefe</hi> he hath no reſpect to him
whom he hath offended; that his <hi>Sorrow</hi> availeth nothing for
obtaining reconciliation with the partie offended, even ſo
whatſoever he a mans <hi>griefe</hi> for his <hi>ſinnes,</hi> if he have not regard
to God in that his <hi>Sorrow,</hi> it availeth nothing, Therefore this
<hi>Sorrow</hi> which is according to God, is not only for our <hi>ſinnes,</hi> but
alſo and chiefly it is for this, that thereby we have offended
God, and have deprived our ſelves of his <hi>Favour.</hi> Such a <hi>Sorrow</hi>
is juſtly ſaid to be <hi>Godly</hi> or according to GOD, for the ground
of it is the <hi>Love</hi> of God, which maketh us when we have him
to <hi>rejoyce,</hi> and to acquieſce in him as our true and ſoveraigne
<hi>Good,</hi> which we declare by a contempt of the world, <hi>whileat we
uſe the good things of it as if we uſed them not, and rejoyce in the midſt
of the tribulations of it.</hi> According to that, <hi>In the world ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have trouble, but in me yee ſhall have joy:</hi> And on the contrary,
when we loſſe GOD, it maketh us grieved above all thing, that
we have offended him and are deprived of him. 2. This <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:100463:95"/>
is juſtly called a <hi>Godly Sorrow,</hi> for it is God that worketh it
in us. By nature we are blinde, and ſee not the <hi>Offence</hi> of GOD,
nor how great an evil it is, and we are ſo farre from being grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for theſe things which offend him, that on the contrary we
take delight therein. It is only God that openeth our <hi>eyes,</hi> and
taketh away the <hi>heart</hi> of <hi>ſtone,</hi> and molifieth our <hi>heares</hi> that they
may melt with <hi>Sorrow,</hi> for the offence of him. 3. This is a <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
according to God, becauſe we undertake this <hi>Sorrow</hi> that
we may reſtore to God his <hi>Honour,</hi> which by <hi>ſinning</hi> we have
impared, ſo much as was in us, and that we may pacifie him,
and by recovering his <hi>Favour</hi> againe may obtaine <hi>health</hi> and <hi>life</hi>
unto our wounded and dead <hi>ſouls,</hi> which life ſtandeth in the
<hi>Favour</hi> of God, and in our <hi>union</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>Thus yee ſee what is that <hi>Sorrow</hi> according to GOD,<note place="margin">7. how great reaſon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have to Sorrow thus.</note> here

            <p>Before we go hence,<note place="margin">9. Sorrow for the ſins of others.</note> it may be demanded, whether or not

            <p>Secondly, It may be asked, doeth this <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi> only reach

They ſay with David, <hi>Wo is me that I ſojourne in Meſech, and that

ſpoiled by the <hi>Babylonians</hi> of their <hi>goods,</hi> of their <hi>lands, honours,

that they wanted <hi>Sion,</hi> albeit that was but an earthly <hi>Sion,</hi> and
now ſpoiled, burnt and ſacked, how much more have we reaſon
that ſit by the waters of <hi>Babell,</hi> that is, of the tranſitory <hi>pleaſures</hi>
of the confuſion of this world, to weep when we remember
the permanent <hi>joyes</hi> of the heavenly <hi>Sion</hi> which cannot be ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?
and whereunto no dart or enemie can have acceſſe; but
the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here not of this <hi>Sorrow,</hi> but of the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
which is for our own <hi>ſinnes;</hi> and for the <hi>ſinnes</hi> of others, and
unto it he aſcriveth this bleſſed <hi>effect</hi> that followeth, which
is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To work repentance unto ſalvation not to be repented of.</hi>

demanded how this <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi> worketh <hi>repentance,</hi> ſince this
<hi>Godly Sorrow</hi> is a chiefe part of <hi>repentance,</hi> it is anſwered firſt. By

               </hi>
but that <hi>it worketh repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance unto ſalvation,</hi> that is, it maketh
our <hi>repentance</hi> true, profitable and ſaving: for it is as it were the
life of our <hi>repentance.</hi> So we ſay that a <hi>ſober-man</hi> maketh a <hi>health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full-man,</hi>
or that a man addicted to <hi>ſtudies</hi> maketh a <hi>learned-man.</hi>
2. This <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi> alſo worketh <hi>repentance</hi> it ſelf, in
reſpect of diverſe parts thereof. <hi>Repentance</hi> hath many things in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100463:97"/>
it, and ſome of them are wrought in us, or greatly promoved
by this <hi>Godly Sorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For clearing of this conſider, that <hi>repentance</hi> is wrought in us
after this manner.<note place="margin">12. Sight of our ſinnes 1, wrought in penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</note> 1. Our minde is enlightned, and the <hi>eyes</hi> of
it are opened, that we may ſee our <hi>ſinnes,</hi> the hynouſnes and the
deformity of them. Unleſſe we have this <hi>ſight,</hi> we will never be
grieved for them. Therefore David ſayeth Pſal. 51. <hi>I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
mine iniquity, &amp; my ſin is continually before mine eye.</hi> So it is
ſaid of the prodigall ſon Luk. 15. 17. <hi>That he came to himſelf.</hi>
His eyes were opened to ſee his own <hi>miſery,</hi> and his <hi>ſinne</hi> which
was the cauſe thereof. With this <hi>ſight</hi> is joyned a <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>ſenſe</hi>
of the <hi>Wrath</hi> of GOD kindled againſt us for our <hi>ſinnes.</hi> For no
man can rightly ſee his own <hi>ſinnes,</hi> but he muſt ſee that God is
offended therewith, whence <hi>anguiſh</hi> and <hi>terrour</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth
in the <hi>conſcience.</hi> Hence David in the 38. Pſal. ſayeth <hi>Lord
reprove me not in thy wrath, nor chastiſe me in thy hote diſpleaſure.
Thine arrows ſtick faſt in me, and thine hand preſſeth me ſore. There
is no ſoundnes in my fleſh becauſe of thy Wrath, and there is no rest in
my bones, becauſe of my ſin, my ſins are gone over mine head and they
are too heavy a burden for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly God worketh in the heart of a <hi>penitent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">13. Effects of Godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</note> ſome love
of himſelf, which maketh him to hate and detaſte his <hi>ſinnes,</hi>
whereby he offended God, and to have in him this <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi>
becauſe of them 3. This <hi>ſorrow</hi> promoves the work of our <hi>repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
It makes us to humble our ſelves under the mighty hand
of God. It ſtirreth us up to an holy <hi>indignation,</hi> and the taking
of a juſt <hi>revenge</hi> of our ſelves: becauſe we have offended God,
as the Apoſtle ſheweth in the next verſ. Hence <hi>the renting of our
hearts</hi> ſpoken of by IOEL, <hi>and the ſmiting of our breaſt,</hi> which we
find in the <hi>Publican.</hi> This <hi>ſorrow</hi> alſo venteth it ſelf by <hi>confeſſion</hi>
Pſal. 32. <hi>When I keped ſilence, my bones waxed old, through my roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all the day long. Day and night thy Hand was heavie upon me,
my moiſture was turned into the drought of ſummer.</hi> Then I ſaid,
<hi>I will confeſſe my ſinnes, and mine iniquity will I not hide: I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
my tranſgreſſions unto the LORD, and thou for gaveſt the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity

<hi>faſting,</hi> by <hi>ſack-cloath</hi> and <hi>aſhes,</hi> but which is moſt of all; This
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100463:97"/>
               <hi>Godly ſorrow</hi> ſtirreth us up to <hi>converſion,</hi> to turne from our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
evil <hi>wayes,</hi> and to walk in the way of <hi>righteouſnes.</hi> A ſtedfaſt
purpoſe of ſo doing, is the maine part of our <hi>repentance,</hi> and this
is wrought in us by this <hi>Godly ſorrow.</hi> For he that is truly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
&amp; diſpleaſed for that he hath offended God, will in time
coming eſchew that which may be offenſive to him, and will be
carefull to do that which may be pleaſant in his Sight.</p>
            <p>This is that which the LORD chiefly requireth,<note place="margin">14. Of turning to GOD.</note> 
               <hi>if the wicked
man ſhall turne from his evil wayes, and keep all my statutes, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
unrighteouſnes ſhall be no more remembred</hi> Ezek. 18. 21. 22.
<hi>Turne unto me</hi> ſayeth the LORD <hi>with all your hearts</hi> Ioel 2. 12.
our life is, as it wer, a <hi>journey,</hi> and the end of our way, is <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,</hi>
which is not to be found but in God, <hi>In whoſe preſence there
is fulnes of joy, and at whoſe right hand there are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
Therefore our <hi>steps</hi> or our <hi>eyes</hi> ſhould never be turned
from him, but alace ſuch is our <hi>corruption</hi> and ſuch is the power
of <hi>ſatan,</hi> that oftentimes he draweth us out of the way of Gods
commandements, which leade us to that end, by ſetting before
us ſome triffle of <hi>pleaſure</hi> or <hi>honour</hi> or <hi>commodity,</hi> and ſo brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
us in the way of <hi>ſinne</hi> and <hi>perdition.</hi> Therefore if we would
<hi>repent,</hi> wee muſt turne againe, &amp; turne againe to God, and that
with our <hi>heart,</hi> even with all our <hi>heart.</hi> It is not enough that the
<hi>minde</hi> be changed, farleſſe that we turn our face, that may be for
ſhame, or that wee turne our feete that may be for <hi>feare,</hi> but we
muſt turne our <hi>heart</hi> &amp; <hi>affections,</hi> &amp; that wholly, from al our <hi>ſins</hi>
and from all the occaſions thereof, ſo farre as lyeth in us, that
we may walk in <hi>newnes</hi> of life, even in the good <hi>way, wherein we
may find reſt unto our ſouls.</hi> So the <hi>prodigall ſon</hi> reſolved to go to
his father, and indeed went unto him, ſaying, <hi>Father I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
&amp;c. Thus Godly <hi>Sorrow</hi> worketh <hi>repentance,</hi> for it ſerveth
powerfully to put a holy <hi>indignation</hi> in our HEART, <hi>tears</hi> in our
EYES, <hi>words</hi> in our <hi>monuths,</hi> and in all our CONVERSATION,
<hi>fruits worthy of amendement of life.</hi> The Apoſtle addeth that this
<hi>repentance;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is to ſalvation not to be repented of.</hi>

that is in it, yet indeed it is ſuch, that no man will ever repent of

it. If we have not this <hi>repentance,</hi> we ſhall be forced to repent
for the <hi>want</hi> and <hi>neglect</hi> of it. What is the <hi>worme</hi> of conſcience
which tormenteth the <hi>demaned,</hi> but a continuall <hi>repentance,</hi> as it
were, whereby they accuſe and condemne themſelves, for not
uſing aright the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and repenting while they had
time? But this is unprofitable <hi>repentance</hi> though moſt <hi>painfull</hi>

from the <hi>evils</hi> threatned in this life, &amp; howſoever that be, we
ſhall be ſure to eſcape the <hi>wrath</hi> that is to come. <hi>If the wicked

by the <hi>tears</hi> of true and unfeigned <hi>repentance</hi> to blot out our

            </p>
            <p>Thus then we ſee how great <hi>motives</hi> we have to repent and
turne to God. Firſt, The <hi>Glory</hi> of God requireth this, by our <hi>ſins</hi>
we have diſhonoured him, and therefore ought by <hi>repentance</hi> to
reſtore to him his <hi>Honour</hi> againe. 2. The <hi>love</hi> which we ought
to our ſelves requireth this, ſince without <hi>repentance</hi> we cannot
be ſaved, but muſt needs <hi>periſh</hi> if we want it. Put the caſe a man
were walking in a way, wherin if he went on a little, he would
undoubtedly fall head-longs over a <hi>rock</hi> and daſh himſelf into
pieces. If that man would not do ſo much as turne back for the
ſafety of his <hi>life,</hi> ye may juſtly ſay, that he were a <hi>murtherer</hi> of

Alace how can we be without regard to this? S. AUGUSTINE

thence men running in fury each one againſt another, hearing the cryes

in this land, and that he would be avenged on ſuch a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
as this. Many and terrible <hi>examples</hi> alſo of the Iudgements
of GOD ye have had before your <hi>eyes,</hi> by which the Lord hath
been ſaying to you, <hi>Except yee repent ye ſhall all likewayes periſh.</hi>
But notwithſtanding of all this we have gone one ſecurely in
our <hi>ſins.</hi> How many thouſands in <hi>Germany</hi> and other parts, not
long ſince, have thought their <hi>feet</hi> as ſure from falling as yee
have thought yours? their <hi>eyes</hi> have been as dry, and their <hi>ſouls</hi>
ſeemed to be as ſure of life, &amp; yet their <hi>feet</hi> have ſlidden, their
<hi>eyes</hi> have been drowned with <hi>tears,</hi> &amp; their ſouls have taſted of

DEATH. <hi>The Sword of God hath devoured their fleſh, and is become
drunke with their blood.</hi> This ſame <hi>cup</hi> which the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them, he now preſenteth to us, and if we pacifie not his
<hi>Wrath,</hi> whether we will or not he ſhall force us to drinke it out.
Let us therefore follow the <hi>example</hi> of our Saviour. When the
bitter <hi>cup</hi> was preſented to him for our <hi>ſins,</hi> he fell down, and
with <hi>tears</hi> of blood ſaid, <hi>Father if it be poſſible let this cup paſſe
from me.</hi> Let us turne to God and do in like manner. Neither
ſhould we thinke it enough to mourne this day, but ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
our mourning in private, that if it be poſſible he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us and our <hi>land</hi> from this great <hi>Wrath,</hi> or if he have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
otherwayes, wee may at leaſt eſcape his eternall <hi>indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The Lord grant this unto us, and that for the merits of
Chriſt to whom &amp;c.</p>
