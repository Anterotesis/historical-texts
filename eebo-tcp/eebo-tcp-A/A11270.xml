            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>And herein dwelt a simple country swaine,</l>
               <l>Whose name was <hi>Thirsis,</hi> wondrous poore &amp; bare.</l>
               <l>He hyred was to keepe old <hi>Damons</hi> heards,</l>
               <l>And keeping them neer to this pleasant stream</l>
               <l>As all alone he walked by the banks,</l>
               <l>He heard the infant cry for want of food,</l>
               <l>He ran to it, supposing it had been</l>
               <l>One of his lambs, hang'd in the marshy reeds,</l>
               <l>And comming neere, he saw the skarlet robe</l>
               <l>Lie in the boat, at first he was affraid:</l>
               <l>And started backe, as when a country man</l>
               <l>Espies a snake, yet by and by he durst</l>
               <l>Goe neerer it, then touched he the robe,</l>
               <l>And seing it to be a verie childe,</l>
               <l>He tooke it vp, from it tooke vp, there fell</l>
               <l>A chaine of golde, he almost dead with ioy,</l>
               <l>Did snatch it vp, and sitting on the grasse,</l>
               <l>Did ope the mantle, there he found a ring,</l>
               <l>And massie purse, he tooke them in his armes,</l>
               <l>And couering them with his old ragged cloke</l>
               <l>To <hi>Mepsa</hi> came, and thus to her he said,</l>
               <l>Come hether <hi>Mepsa,</hi> look what I haue got,</l>
               <l>An infant faire, a sweet and seemly childe:</l>

               <l>Though <hi>Thirsis</hi> counts it credit them to get.</l>
               <l>As though we two had nought to doe but play</l>
               <l>With brawling infants. Out whoore-hunting scab:</l>
               <l>Depart (I say) or els I sweare by <hi>Ioue,</hi>

               <l>And ding the braines against the flinty stones.</l>
               <l>He fearing her, thus mildly did entreat:</l>
               <l>Peace <hi>Mepsa,</hi> peace, good <hi>Mepsa</hi> be content,</l>
               <l>Hold still thy rocke: for euer we are made,</l>

               <l>See here a ring, and purse repleat with golde.</l>
               <l>Shee seeing it, ran vnto <hi>Thirsis</hi> strait,</l>
               <l>And gaue to him an hundred hungrie smackes:</l>
               <l>He doubled them as greedily againe.</l>

               <l>So shall we poorer be then ere we were.</l>
               <l>And that we may more surely it conceale,</l>
               <l>Harke to me wife, I haue deuisde a shift:</l>
