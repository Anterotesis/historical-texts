         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to thoſe Fountaines:
whereunto many more patients would willingly
repaire, were they not letted, either by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
defect of health, or ordinarie want of
wealth, or ſuch other impeachments, as dayly
occurre in the courſe of this tranſitory life.</p>
            <p>In conſideration whereof, it hath ſeemed verie
expedient to ſome, who haue diſpoſed their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18244:3"/>
and labours, to the good of others; and
whoſe reſidences are not farre from thoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
nor themſelues eſtranged from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch
of naturall things, to deuiſe the meanes,
that ſuch as are abſent, may be made partakers
of thoſe Minerall waters; and conſequently, of
thoſe healthfull effects, that by the drinking of
them are produced.</p>
            <p>The accuſtomed courſe hitherto taken, hath
beene to fill numbers of Bottles with the water
of the vpper or the lower Fountaine, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh
thoſe Bottles (being cloſely ſtopped) vnto
their deſigned places; as to <hi>France, England, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Germany, Polonia, Moſcouia,</hi> and other farre
diſtant places. But this way is found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
no leſſe troubleſome, then chargeable in
the carriage; conſidering, that a huge quantity
of water, containeth but a very little of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
ſubſtance, wherein the vertue of the water
conſiſteth; and the ſaide ſubſtance being ſo thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diuided into a great quantity of water, looſeth
much of the force and vertue, before it can bee
brought into ſo farre diſtant places; the which
hath beene the cauſe, why the perſons before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated,
haue employed their ſtudye and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
to reduce the pure <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or ſubſtance
of the ſaide Minerals, into ſo little a quantitie, as
that one pot may ſupply for farre more then an
hundred pots; and withall, that no part of the
force or vertue of the ſaide Minerals ſhould bee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18244:3"/>
impaired.</p>
            <p>And to the end the Reader may receiue ſome
kinde of ſatisfaction, who perchance is curious
to looke into the practiſe heereof; or at leſt, into
the ſpeculation of this Maiſtry, three points hee
is then to obſerue.</p>
            <p>Firſt that the extraction of the ſaide Minerall
eſſence bee made in Sommer; in which ſeaſon,
thoſe Waters are of more efficacie: And if the
extracter bee himſelfe preſent at the Fountaines,
it is ſo much the better.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that he finde out the ſecret how to
part the Minerall ſubſtance from the VVater,
without diſtillation, (for that would not quite the
coſt) but by precipitation, whereby the Minerall
powder falleth downe, and ſetleth it ſelfe in the
bottome of the glaſſe, depriuing the VVater of
all Minerall taſte and operation; which ſecret, is
ſoone performed by a skilfull Artiſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when he hath a ſufficient quantity of
that precipitated powder, hee muſt not diſſolue
it with any coraſiue, but with a competent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of ſuch Liquors as are agreeable vnto the
health of man: and in theſe three obſeruations
the whole practiſe conſiſteth.</p>
            <p>It followeth now, to declare in what quantitie
this <hi>Hypostaſis</hi> or extraction diſſolued thus into a
liquor, is to bee taken; which muſt bee as follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth.</p>
            <p>Take a dram weight of this Liquor, which is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18244:4"/>
the eight part of an Ounce; and contayneth as
much in quantity, as will fill a great Thimble;
poure this into a glaſſe or ſtone Bottle, &amp; poure
thereunto fifty Ounces of the beſt and cleareſt
water that is to be had; whether it be Fountaine
water, Riuer water, or Well water: This water
is to be put vnto the dram weight of the other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
at the time that the Patient is ready to
drinke it, and not before; not that any inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
may enſue thereof, but becauſe the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher
the water is, the more grateful it is vnto the
taſte, and the Minerall ſubſtance in length of
time, will deſcend vnto the bottom of the glaſſe:
and albeit it may bee newly ſtirred and mingled
with the water, and ſo taken; yet will it notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
be more to the liking of the Patient, as
before is noted, to haue his water brought freſh
from the Spring, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This quantity of fiftie Ounces of Water to
a dram of the Minerall ſubſtance, is the ordinary
and beſt proportion, which hetherto by practiſe
hath beene tried, being alſo leſſe diſtaſtfull vnto
the drinke; yet, in ſome diſeaſes, as in retention
of Vrine, or in quenching the heats of Agues, it
will ſtand the Patient in better ſteede to followe
this proportion, then to take it in leſſer quantitie
of water. And this is ſpoken vpon proofe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience:
how be it, if the learned Phyſitian ſhall
thinke it expedient,<note place="margin">Vt in morbis in quibus humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas perualet.</note> that in ſome diſeaſes the
quantity of the water be diminiſhed, the matter
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18244:4"/>
is referred vnto his graue iudgement, conſenting
with the Philoſopher, that <hi>Fruſtra fit per plura,
quod poteſt fieri per punciora.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The water being in the former proportion
prepared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the patient may drinke thereof accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the quality of his diſeaſe;<note place="margin">Till the water is paſt by the belly, or by the Vrine Meatus: &amp; that the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack is empty</note> as for example.</p>
            <p>For the ſtone and grauell, or heate of the
raynes, he may take euery morning faſting fiftie
Ounces at ſeuerall times, and hee muſt abſtaine
from meate two houres after, and if within that
ſpace he be in plight to walke, or to vſe ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moderate exerciſe, it will worke the better.</p>
            <p>Heere is alſo to bee noted, that albeit ſuch as
drinke the <hi>Spaw</hi> water, to take 100. 200. or more
ounces in a morning. Yet this notwithſtanding,
theſe-fiftie-ounces will be of as great efficacie,
becauſe there is more pure ſubſtance conteyned
in thoſe fiftie ounces, then in a far greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of <hi>Spaw</hi> water.</p>
            <p>Thus much taken in a morning, will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
the firſt weeke for the whole day. The week
following, ſo much more may be drunken in the
afternoone, about three or foure of the clocke,
if it ſhall ſeeme good to the learned and expert
Phiſition, to whoſe diſcretion and direction are
referred, theſe and ſundry other particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
that may happen (which in ſchooles
are tearmed <hi>Hic &amp; nunc)</hi> in ſundry diſeaſes, and
in the diuers diſpoſitions of different patients:
in which occurrences all purgations and other
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18244:5"/>
preparations that mny be preſcribed, are to goe
before the taking of this water, as in like ſort the
preſcription of dyets, and the like heedfull and
healthfull obſeruations, as when or how often
the patient may drinke the water alone, or ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with wine, at meates or at other times. Theſe
and other circumſtances muſt in all reaſon be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the diſcretion of the learned Phiſition.</p>
            <p>In the retention of vrine it will be needfull to
take thoſe fifty ounces euery morning, and as
much more in the afternoone, vnleſſe the partie
finde amendment, and in that diſeaſe to walke,
and vſe ſome exerciſe, will bee of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>The ſame quantity may bee preſcribed in the
dropſie, morning and euening, eſpecially after
the firſt weeke, and if the diſeaſe haue not taken
very deepe roote, the patient will finde ſencible
amendment, and his ſtrength day by day verie
much to encreaſe.</p>
            <p>In Tertian and Quartaine Agues, the Patient
muſt drinke euery morning 50. Ounces on his
good dayes; but on the dayes of his fit, hee may
take before the acceſſe 20. Ounces, and in the
heate of the fit, thirty Ounces.</p>
            <p>The like obſeruations may bee vſed in Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Agues, to wit; that 20. ounces be taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fit, and <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o. in the heate thereof, if it ſhall
ſeeme good to the Phyſitian, whoſe iudgement
is alſo to be vſed concerning the time and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18244:5"/>
when and how much of this water may bee
vſed in continuall Agues.</p>
            <p>In peſtilentiall Agues, there hath not (as yet)
any aſſured triall bene made.</p>
            <p>In all Obſtructions, as the Greene ſicknes, and
the like,<note place="margin">For the paines of the Spleen, hardneſse and ſwellings ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> the Phyſitian may preſcribe it in place
of the powder of ſteele, it being vndoubtedly far
more ſecure, and of more effectuall operation.</p>
            <p>In the weakneſſe of the ſtomacke and heate of
the Liuer, it is a ſingular water, being dayly taken
in the aforeſaide quantity of 50. ounces.</p>
            <p>In the Flux, and in the abundance of VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Courſes it may alſo bee taken; and beeing
mingled now and then with red wine, it will bee
the better. In womens infirmities (as aforeſaid)
if this water bee mingled with diſtilled Plantine
water, it will worke the better. For other diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

Medicine which is auaileable to one, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
profitable to another, as reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
dayly ſheweth. Wherefore to conclude,
the ordinary proportion as before hath bin ſaid,
is to mingle fifty ounces of pure water to a dram
of this Mineral <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or ſubſtance of the <hi>Spaw</hi>
water; not that there is any danger if one ſhould
drinke one dram onely with an ounce of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
water, but for the more efficatious working:
this ordinary quantity is found to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient,
hauing therein ſome reſemblance with
the copious abundance of the <hi>Spaw</hi> water.</p>
            <p>Heere alſo the patient may obſerue, that it
ſhall not he needfull for him alwayes to weigh
the water; for hauing weighed it once, and put it
into a glaſſe of conuenient greatneſſe, hee may
ſee to what fulneſſe of the glaſſe his fifty Ounces
of water do reach, and ſo vſe that meaſure for the
ſaide weight. The Patient may moreouer min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
the water with wine, in all ſuch Diſeaſes as
are not hot.</p>
            <p>They do vſe at the <hi>Spaw</hi> to make Breweſſe or
ſops of that water, boyling it with Butter, which
they finde both toothſome and wholeſom; in al
which particularities it will alwayes be good (as
before is ſaide) to follow the aduice of a learned
expert and vnpaſsionate Phyſitian.</p>
            <p>Of ſundry diſeaſes, which principally are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the vſe of drinking the water of <hi>Spaw,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18244:6"/>
out of the treatiſe of the vertues therof, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by M. <hi>Gilbert Lembourgh,</hi> Doctor of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,
and conſequently of the <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of the
ſaide water being mingled with pure common
water, as in the precedent diſcourſe is declared.
The drinking of this water doth mightily quench
thirſt, and it bringeth the hot Liuer vnto a good
temper, as alſo the Kidneyes.</p>
            <p>It ſtrengthneth the ſtomacke, and giueth it
appetite thorough the aſtrictiue vertue that it
hath, but for an extreame cold ſtomacke it is not
ſo good.</p>
            <p>It is greatly profitable againſt all obſtructions,
and debility of the Milt, for it doth diſſolue and
cure the cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p>It deliuereth the Kidneyes and bladder from
Grauell, and is aidefull againſt all defluctions of
thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>It correcteth Rheumes and Cararrhes, in what
part of the body ſoeuer they deſcend; as in the
breaſt, the ſtomacke, the Kidneyes, Sinewes, on
Muſcles.</p>
            <p>It cureth Dropſies, how be it ſuch as in whom
this diſeaſe is confirmed by length of time, and
that the forces of the Patients are thereby much
weakened, are verie hardly cured. And ſo are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſuch Dropſies as proceede of a hardneſſe of
the Liuar, which <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, are incureable.</p>
            <p>Experience alſo ſheweth, that ſuch dropſies
as come of drineſſe of the ſtomacke, and of long
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18244:7"/>
reſolution and humidity of the inteſtine parts are
not eaſily cured.</p>
            <p>But among ſuch as the beginning of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
commeth of the ilneſſe of the Milt, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts not naturally well, many perſons haue
bin perfectly cured.</p>
            <p>It helpeth greatly the parts that are ſoftned &amp;
reſolued by defluctions, as the Sinews, Muſcles,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>It ſtrengtheneth the Matrix that i<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſubiect to
too much humidity, and diſpoſeth it in ſuch ſort
that it retaineth the conceiued fruite, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h
barrenneſſe.</p>
            <p>It aydeth againſt ſtrangulations and ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Matrix.</p>
            <p>As touching ſuch as are verie Leapers; if it
do not wholly cure them, yet doth the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
vſe thereof, impeach and hinder their diſeaſe
from any more increaſing.</p>
            <p>As for the curing of Agues, the Reader may
note what hath bin ſaide in the precedent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>The Reader is laſtly to be aduertiſed; That
whereas the moſt vſuall taking of the VVater of
<hi>Spaw</hi> is in Sommer, it is chiefly becauſe of the
abundance of Raine and Snow that falleth into
thoſe Fountaines in winter, which weakneth the
force of them; and ſo is the force alſo weakened
in Sommer in rainy weather; as contrary-wiſe in
winter, in froſty and dry weather, the water hath
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18244:7"/>
his perfect force. In which reſpect, this <hi>Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
thereof being mingled with pure VVater, in
ſuch quantity of the one and the other, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is mentioned, may aſwel be vſed in winter,
as in Sommer.</p>
