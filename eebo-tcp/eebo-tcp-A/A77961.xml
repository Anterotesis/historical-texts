         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And ſhall the Lord utterly lay you aſide, and never make more uſe of you? Is there no hope of your return to the <hi>Good Old Cauſe?</hi> When will you begin to appear for things for perfect freedome and liberty, and ceaſe to be for names and men, while the good Cauſe it ſelf is loſt, and the intereſt of oppreſſion ſeems to be promoted: Therefore conſider, Oh! what an excellent thing would it be, if you would ſincerely return to the <hi>Good Old Cauſe:</hi> and if you could agree among your ſelves, few or many of you, to ſtate the <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> once more in clear and plain principles, and poſitions; and if you could lay down right things worthy to be contended for; and upon which you could engage your lives, (<hi>viz.</hi>) even the perfect liberty of all people, and then ſay here is the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> and here is the freedome of the Nations laid down, and perfect liberty aſſerted unto all people whatſoever, both as men and as Chriſtians; and theſe things we will vindicate, theſe things we will have brought to paſs, and for theſe things we will only ſtand, that they may be accompliſhed, and neither for <hi>Old Parliament</hi> nor <hi>New,</hi> nor any other man nor men, but as they directly are for theſe things, even for the eſtabliſhing of Righteouſneſs, Mercy, and Truth in the earth, and taking off all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: and as they proceed upon, and forthwith endeavour the effecting theſe things; and whoever are for theſe things, we are for them, and they for us; and whoſoever are againſt the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> and perfect freedome, whether <hi>Old Parliament</hi> or <hi>New,</hi> or any others whatſoever, we are againſt them, and will ingage our lives againſt them.</p>
            <p>Oh! if it were in the heart of every <hi>Officer</hi> and private <hi>Souldier</hi> in truth of heart, thus to ſay, and do, and to proceed, you would doubtleſs be bleſſed, whether many or few, and receive Victory and Honor both, if that you aſſert and proſecute right things for the general good of all, that Peace and Righteouſneſs may be ſet up, and no longer ſerve the wills and pleaſures of men, nor reſpect them; no, nor give obedience to them, any further than they proſecute the juſt freedome of the Nations: for what is it worth to be for a <hi>Parliament, Old</hi> or <hi>New,</hi> a <hi>Protector,</hi> or any other ſort of men, when they do not proſecute the right Cauſe of freedome and liberty to the Nations? Therefore conſider in your ſelves, for if you ſerve your Nations treacherouſly, the Lord will meet with you one time or other in Judgement, and confound you one againſt another; and you ſhall fall, and never riſe. Therefore, were it not wiſdome for you once more to ſtate the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> and to go through with it; and them that are Enemies to it, be you Enemies to them, whether <hi>Old Parliament,</hi> or <hi>New,</hi> or <hi>whomſoever?</hi> and hereby ſhould you proſper, and the Lord ſhould be with you, when you truly appear in uprightneſs of heart on Gods behalf, and for the ends aforeſaid; then ſhould the preſence of the Lord be in your Councels, and your former valour and dread ſhould be with you, and the deſires of all good people ſhould be for you, and their Councel ſhould be extended forth on your behalf, and the ſervant of the Lord ſhould pray for you, and till then you can never proſper; and this ſhall you witneſs for ever.</p>
