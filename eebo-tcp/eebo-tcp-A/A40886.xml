         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the COUNTY of
BUCKS, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AMidſt that great Variety of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
wherewith Learned Men have
furniſhed the World, to the end
that each Perſon may be provided
of a Subject ſuitable to his Genius, there
is none ſo univerſally pleaſing, or, indeed,
<pb facs="tcp:54712:3"/>
more profitable than Hiſtory. It is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
ſort of Learning, fitted for all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities;
the Meaneſt are-not below, nor
the Greateſt above it, becauſe it contains
nothing ſo abſtruſe, that may not be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comprehended; nor any thing ſo tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial,
that may not be worth obſerving.
All Arts and Sciences are purchaſed by
much Study and Labour; and, even ſo,
they are not attained in any Perfection,
but by thoſe whom Nature has particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
moulded to receive ſuch an Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Hiſtory alone delights at once, and
inſtructs; it informs, without perplexing
the Underſtanding; it improves, without
burthening the Memory; it rectifies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thwarting the Will; and, in ſhort, it
leads away our Affections, without miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiding
them. The Advantages we reap
by it are ineſtimable, in regard we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a perfect Knowledge of what was
before us; and are thereby enabled to
make a Judgment of what will be after
us: For, as the Wiſe Man, ſo many Ages
ſince, ſaid, <hi>There was nothing new under
the Sun;</hi> ſo may we believe there neither
is in our Times, nor will be in thoſe to
come: For the Lives and Actions of
Men are only a continued Repetition of
thoſe that preceded them; becauſe all this
<pb facs="tcp:54712:3"/>
inferiour World is but a perpetual Conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenation
of the ſelf-ſame Revolutions, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſurprizingly diſguized in the Dreſs
and Methods. Now, to know what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſince the Creation, and thence judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
to inferr what is likely to enſue
till the final Conſummation; and this not
only in one City or Kingdom, but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the vaſt Circumference of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
is a ſort of Knowledge that appears
to be ſomewhat more than Humane; or
rather, not far removed from Divine. It
is a Knowledge ſo important, that God
himſelf did not diſdain, for our Benefit,
to fill up the greateſt part of his Sacred
Volume with Hiſtory, whereof he himſelf
was the Compiler. God himſelf it was,
that, through the Mouths of the Prophets,
tranſmitted down to us the Hiſtory of the
Creation, and Reſtauration of Mankind,
the Genealogy of the firſt Patriarchs, the
Acts of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Lives
of their Judges and Kings, and all that is
Hiſtorical in Holy Writ. Nay, to come
nearer; What are the Four <hi>Goſpels,</hi> and
the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> but the Hiſtory
of our Bleſſed Saviour, and thoſe his
glorious Followers. Thus the Prophets
and Evangeliſts ſeem to authorize and
recommend Hiſtory, they themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:54712:4"/>
Sacred Hiſtorians. Nor is it only on
this Religious Foundation, that its Credit
is ſupported: To omit many things that
might be urged to teſtifie its great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
let us only conſider whence it is
that we have the Knowledge of our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
and what it is that has eternized
the Memory of Great and Worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
and we ſhall find, it is all due to
Hiſtory alone. To this alſo muſt thoſe
who now live, and are ambitious of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating
their Memory, owe the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of their Names and Merits to
Poſterity. To this Kings and Princes are
beholding, for the rare Examples it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
them with of their Illuſtrious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors;
thereby ſtirring up their Minds
to imitate their Heroick Actions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Partakers of their laſting Praiſes.
To this, States-men are obliged, for the
politick Preſidents it affords them to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
themſelves by in all extraordinary
Exigencies of State. To this, all accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
Perſons ſtand indebted for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of their Diſcourſe, and for the
perfecting them in the true Knowledge of
the World. And, to conclude, From this,
the Generality of Mankind is furniſhed
with Variety of Inſtances exciting to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and deterring from Vice. But, though
<pb facs="tcp:54712:4"/>
too much cannot be ſaid upon ſo deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Subject, let this ſuffice, ſince
it is not to inform, but to obtain a
favourable Acceptance, that ſo much has
been ſaid.</p>
            <p>If then, Sir, the Dignity and Value
of Hiſtory be ſuch as I have repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
well may it merit an Honourable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
from Perſons of Worth. Empty
Titles are not the Worth I mean; thoſe
too often are beſtowed upon the vileſt of
Men, and even for ſubmitting to the
moſt infamous of Crimes. That is true
Worth, which, being derived from Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Anceſtors, though without the
Addition of gaudy Epithets, is preſerved
unblemiſhed, and without Stain. To aſcend
to thoſe the World calls Honours, ſuch as
Lordſhips, Earldoms and Dukedoms, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct,
ſcandalous and unjuſt Means, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her
to deſcend: To embrace them, offered
under thoſe Circumſtances, is the Act of an
abject, rather than a noble Spirit; and
to aim at, and aſpire to them through
thoſe Means, rather betokens a ſordid
Pride, than a generous Ambition. Such
Patrons are neither capable of Receiving
or Communicating Honour; their Names,
<pb facs="tcp:54712:5"/>
in Hiſtory, are branded with Infamy,
not to be covered by all the Sycophant
Addreſſes and Flatteries of a Dedication:
And even the Work which ſeeks Shelter
under them, ſucks in the Infection of
their poyſonous Shadow. Malice may,
perhaps, endeavour ſo to pervert my
Words, as if they implied a Reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Great and Honourable Perſons; but
it is plain, only Malice can ſo miſ-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
my Meaning, as to force it to ſuch
an invidious Senſe. Thoſe who are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Noble, cannot ſuffer in the Character
of ſuch as only mimick their Grandeur;
and they alone will find themſelves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
whoſe Conſciences ſhall accuſe
them of having aſpired to a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Nobility, through mean and ſordid
Practices.</p>
            <p>Theſe, Sir, are the Men, whoſe Names
I moſt abhor to prefix to my Labours;
from them I fly to your Protection, as
to one whom Envy it ſelf cannot aſperſe
with Want of real Honour, or with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
that which is not ſuch. If Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Birth and Parentage be Honour,
yours is too well known, to be capable
of receiving any Addition by any thing
my Pen can expreſs in its behalf. If a
<pb facs="tcp:54712:5"/>
plentiful Fortune be the Support and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of Honour, you have received it
from your Anceſtors, by a Legal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
when others, to raiſe their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
found Eſtates upon Extortion, Fraud and
Oppreſſion. But, above all, If Generous
Actions and Vertuous Principles be true
Honour, none that knows you, is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
how great a Share you poſſeſs.
Nor would I paſs by this ſo material a
Point, without enlarging upon it, but
that it will not ſuit with your Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
to hear your own, though juſt,
Commendations: Nor will the Malice
and Virulency of our Times bear with
the Mention of ſolid and real Praiſes.
What you are, and what you merit, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, nor will be unknown; it may
prove the Subject of an abler Pen, when
thoſe who know, ſhall ſee a fit Time
to recommend your Memory to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>All that remains, Sir, is, to beg a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Acceptance of the Tender I
make. It is the entire Hiſtory of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
from its firſt Plantation, to this
preſent Time. The Original was dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a King: The Tranſlation has not,
I hope, ſo much degenerated, but it may
<pb facs="tcp:54712:6"/>
be worthy of you. If you think it ſo, I
have gained my Point; and ſhall reap a
ſingular Satisfaction, if it gives you any.

            <p>
               <hi>POrtugal,</hi> though a Kingdom of but a ſmall
Extent, and which for theſe latter Years,
has not furniſhed us with any great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Hiſtory; yet in paſt Ages, it did ſo
largely extend its Dominions, and raiſed ſuch
admiration throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> by its wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Diſcoveries and ſtupendious Conqueſts, that
it is much to be admired, all its paſt Glories
ſhould be Buried under its preſent obſcurity.
Nor is it leſs to be wondred at, that <hi>England,</hi>
which ſo lately received from thence a Queen,
yet living, ſhould know ſo little either of her
Country, or Progenitors: This, I ſay, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
that till now there has not appeared abroad
in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue any Hiſtory of that once ſo
famous Kingdom, unleſs we will reckon as ſuch
ſome ſmall fragments which at ſeveral times
have crept into the World, and which ſeem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſtir up our curioſity to know, who thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:54712:7"/>
People were, than any ways to ſatisfy our deſire
of Knowledge. This fault I conceive muſt be
chiefly imputed to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> themſelves,
whoſe care it ought to have been to deliver to
Poſterity and Foreigners their own honourable
Actions, ſo methodized, that they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in ſeeing them together reduced into the
form of a compleat Hiſtory. But they, though
furniſhing ſo much matter for Authors to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their Pens, were yet ſupinely negligent in
duly recording and publiſhing of it. It is true,
they had many Writers, who ſnatched their
Actions from utter oblivion, by leaving that
piece-meal which ought to have been reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one Work; but this was a labour moſt Men
were averſe to, as believing it above their
ſtrength, becauſe thoſe Writings were partly ſo
voluminous, that it required almoſt a Man's
Age to reduce them to a leſs compaſs, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo ſcattered abroad in ſundry parts of the
Kingdom, that they deſpaired of ever being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to bring them together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Emanuel de Faria y Souſa,</hi> our Author,
was the firſt that I can find ever undertook to
digeſt and publiſh to the World, the compleat
Hiſtory of his Country, and give a perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Actions of his Countrymen in all
parts of the World. He not only undertook, but
performed it with general applauſe, not only of
the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> who are the ſubject of his
great Enterprize, but even of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
in whoſe Language he Wrote. This his labour
<pb facs="tcp:54712:7"/>
was not finiſhed till the Year 1640. and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not in publick till many Years after. He
has obſerved a ſtrict method of Hiſtory, without
running out into endleſs Digreſſions, which only
ſerve to ſwell Volumes, and are no way material
to the ſubject in hand. Being a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi>
I cannot affirm him to be altogether impartial,
for there is no Man whom the love of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country does not a little ſway, yet this
can be no exception againſt him, becauſe, if
ſuch, all Hiſtory would be lyable to the ſame
cenſure; and beſides he was a Man that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to himſelf no intereſt in flattering the
great ones, living always a private retired life,
which will plainly appear in that he ſpares not
often to expoſe the Vices and Enormities of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Perſons for the ſake of their Poſterity,
and no where extols any, though never ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for the hope of pleaſing their deſcendants.
But to be ſhort, let the Hiſtory ſpeak for it
ſelf, for my commendation, as being a party too
much concerned in it, cannot add much to its
Reputation, and yet this I muſt ſay, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
at all doubt of its meeting applauſe, becauſe
having run through the Kingdoms of <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>Portugal,</hi> with a general eſteem in its original
Language, I cannot be perſwaded that the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can have ſo much detracted from its firſt
value, as to render it unacceptable to the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
lovers of this ſort of Learning.</p>
            <p>Thus much may ſuffice as to the Hiſtory in
General, but to deſcend to particulars, The
<pb facs="tcp:54712:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
firſt Book contains all that hapned in <hi>Portugal,</hi>
from the time it was firſt peopled by <hi>Tubal,</hi>
the Grandſon of <hi>Noah,</hi> till the time of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Viriatus.</hi> The ſecond begins with <hi>Viriatus,</hi>
and ends at the Birth of Saviour. The third
reaches from the Birth of our Saviour till the
Conqueſt of <hi>Spain</hi> by the <hi>Moors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The fourth
from the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Conqueſt, till the erecting of
<hi>Portugal</hi> into a particular Kingdom, under its
firſt King, <hi>Alonſo</hi> the Firſt, or rather his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Count <hi>Henry.</hi> The fifth from the ſaid
Count <hi>Henry,</hi> till King <hi>Sancho</hi> the ſecond.
The ſixth from him till King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.
The ſeventh from King <hi>John</hi> the Firſt,
to King <hi>John</hi> the Second. The eighth from
King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> till <hi>Henry</hi> the King and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
and the Governours left by him at his
Death. The ninth Book has the lives of the
three <hi>Philips</hi> Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> till
the Year 1640. where the Author concludes,
and the Supplement begins.</p>
            <p>Having given this ſhort account of the main
Hiſtory, and named the Supplement, I muſt not
omit to ſay ſomewhat in relation to it. <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
de Faria</hi> having concluded, as has been
ſaid, juſt at the Year 1640. there enſued that
very Year the great Revolution, in which the
<hi>Portugueſe</hi> caſt off the Dominion of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
and ſet up a King of their own. This
mighty work was in a manner done in a day, all
places ſubmitting to the new King, and expell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with ſuch ſucceſs as is ſcarce
<pb facs="tcp:54712:8"/>
credible, but that the thing is ſtill freſh in the
memory of many perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> living. However,
though the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> in ſo ſhort a time had
aſſerted their Liberty, and caſt off the Foreign
Yoak; yet the conſequences of ſo great an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe,
were a continual War for the ſpace of
almoſt Twenty Eight Years. Now this War
is the principal ſubject of the Supplement, and
indeed a matter well worthy to be known, as a
moſt material Tranſaction of this Age. Being
a thing ſo remarkable and near our times, I
have been very particular in it, and therefore
given an exact account of the Tranſactions of
every Year apart. I have not been ſparing of
any labour in peruſing ſuch Authors as have
writ of it, and extracting from them as much
as my intended Brevity would permit, and tho'
I deſigned to have been much ſhorter, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of accidents is ſuch, that it has obliged
me to run it out to a much greater bulk than at
firſt I deſigned. Neither have I wanted infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in many particulars touched in this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
from Perſons who were preſent and Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes,
to the Actions therein related. Nay
one of my Authors, <hi>viz.</hi> the Count <hi>de Ericeyra,</hi>
who has handled this ſubject very largely, was
not only a Commander in the Army, but alſo a
Councellor of State, and therefore a moſt fit
Man to give an account as well of the Warlike
Exploits in the Field, as of the private Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
at Court. But now to come to the laſt
part of all, which I call the Concluſion of the
Hiſtory, it is ſo diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of
<pb facs="tcp:54712:9"/>
the Supplement, in regard that therein we look
back into ſeveral Years before treated of. This,
as is there ſaid, was ſo ordered to avoid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting
the ſeries of the War, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Factions and Animoſities at Court.
And the Councels and Practiſes which tended
to that extraordinary change, which was made
in the Government, in the impriſoning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
a King for many Years, being matters
meriting a ſpecial obſervation, I thought it
better to lay the whole ſeries of them together,
ſo that they may appear at one view, than to
interrupt them with other Narrations.</p>
            <p>Monarchies as all other wordly things have
their riſe and fall, and conſequently thoſe which
have once been glorious, ought to merit our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
for what they were, no leſs than thoſe
which are now great, are admired for what they
are. It is no diſgrace to a famous General,
that he is grown old and worn out with labours;
nor ought it to leſſen our eſteem for a Kingdom,
becauſe we ſee it ſunk under the too great Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of its undertakings. This has hapned to
<hi>Portugal,</hi> which being of its ſelf but a ſmall
ſpot of Ground, yet adventured, and that with
ſucceſs, to ſpread its Conqueſts into the four
parts of the World, to build Cities and Forts
among People before unknown to the <hi>Europeans,</hi>
to traffick among Rude and Barbarous Nations,
to engage Multitudes, not of naked <hi>Indians,</hi>
but ſuch as had the uſe of all ſorts of Fire-arms,
to Preach the Goſpel to inhuman Infidels, who
<pb facs="tcp:54712:9"/>
had never heard the ſacred Name of Chriſt, and
in fine, to People the vaſt Ocean, if I may ſo
call it, with their Fleets, to pierce through
dangers of unknown Seas, and to diſcover to us
the courſe of the Sun, by tracing his Carrier
round this Terreſtrial Globe. Theſe are the
mighty Actions, which gained <hi>Portugal</hi> that
renown it ſtood poſſeſſed of, and theſe very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
have helped to ſink it into that obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which now in a manner hides it from us.
The greatneſs of the attempts gained them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown,
but their own and their Neighbours
boundleſs avarice proved the bane of all their
Glories. Their own, becauſe being but ſo ſmall
a People, they yet ſet no limits to their deſires,
but rather ſtretched forth their greedy hands
to catch at all the Riches of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and turn
them to their peculiar uſe, without conſidering
how much eaſier it has always been found to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
much, than to preſerve what is ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
acquired. It was their Neighbours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice,
as I ſaid, that haſtned their ruin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there was ſcarce a nation of any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>Europe,</hi> which did not ſtrive to pluck a
Feather from them, and to gain footing, where
ſuch mighty proſpect of profit appeared; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, the <hi>Dutch</hi> have been the Cormorants
that have devoured their Lands, their Metals,
and their Spice. Such was the downfall of the
<hi>Portugueſe</hi> Nation, raiſed by their Ambition
and Valour to the higheſt pitch of Honour, and
caſt down by the Covetouſneſs and Envy of their
Neighbours. Nor has the late War, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
<pb facs="tcp:54712:10"/>
the greateſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi> contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
leſs to the obſcuring of their Name, for all
Mankind being wholly taken up with the thoughts
of thoſe that were active, had not l'eaſure to caſt
an Eye upon a People, that lay happily obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
under the Bleſſed cloud of Peace. Yet tho'
the calm they have of late enjoyed, may have
put them by the Honour of any freſh martial
Atchievments, an Honour it is their greateſt
felicity to want; nevertheleſs their more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
former Exploits are not worthy to be buried
in Oblivion. The Empires of the <hi>Aſſyrians,
Perſians, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> have long ſince
periſhed, and ſtill we read their Actions with
Delight and Admiration. The Kingdoms of
the <hi>Parthians,</hi> the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Huns,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
barbarous Nations, are now no more, and
ſtill the remembrance of their Valour, their
Victories, and their ſucceſs is the ſubject of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Volumes. <hi>Portugal</hi> ſtill ſtands an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Monarchy, and though but the skeleton of
what it was, ſtill its former Glories merit to
be Recorded, either for what that Kingdom
then was, or for what it may poſſibly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>But it is high time I look about for fear of
tranſgreſſing in too long a Preface. Hitherto
ſomething has been ſaid concerning the Author,
concerning his Works, and concerning the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
he treats of. What now remains is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
ſome objections which may be raiſed by
ſuch as would have all Hiſtories as infallible
<pb facs="tcp:54712:10"/>
as the Holy Scripture, both as to Time and
Actions: This is what all Men may wiſh, but
none ever yet could attain to. He that would
read no Hiſtory, in which there is a fault, may
reſolve to ſpare his Eyes, or apply them to ſome
other ſtudy. The firſt thing I find in this Book,
which may be carped at, is the account of the
firſt planting this Kingdom, and the ſucceeding
race of Kings, till the coming in of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi>
Nothing more can be ſaid in defence
hereof, but that all Antiquity at ſuch a diſtance
is obſcure, every Nation has laboured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it ſelf from the neareſt time to the Flood
it could; and what is moſt; even the Ancient <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi>
writes, that <hi>Jobel</hi> or <hi>Tubal,</hi> the
Grandſon of <hi>Noah,</hi> came into <hi>Spain,</hi> and other
Greek and Latin Authors make mention of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Kings here named; therefore in ſuch a
miſt of Antiquity, it may be reckoned a great
Happineſs, that ſuch lights as theſe can be
found to lead us to any part of it that we may
rely upon. The next objection will be againſt
many paſſages of ſomewhat a latter date; as
for example, the ſtrange life of <hi>Abidis,</hi> the coming
of <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things very incredible to thoſe who have
not heard of them before. The anſwer is,
That theſe things, though ſtrange to us are not
at all impoſſible, that they are left to us upon
credit of very Authentick Authors, and that if
in them there be any thing fabulous, yet that
muſt not blaſt the Reputation of this Hiſtory,
no more than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chronicle ought to be
<pb facs="tcp:54712:11"/>
wholly condemned for the far fetcht Hiſtory of
<hi>Brutus</hi> and his <hi>Trojans,</hi> or <hi>Livy</hi> for his Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Nourſery of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> by a
Wolf. What follows till the Birth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and ſome time after, will not be liable
to much cenſure, by reaſon there is little in it,
but what has been delivered by <hi>Roman</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who have for the moſt part paſſed current
in the World; or, if any of them have not, it
is no way the Buſineſs of this work to vindicate
them. After the firſt Preaching of the Goſpel,
we ſhall here and there meet with ſome account
of Miracles wrought, which perhaps, may not
ſute with all Palates. Moſt Chriſtians do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that the firſt ſpreading of Chriſtianity, was
wrought with the help of ſtupendious Wonders,
God ſo ordaining it for the convincing of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Painyms, who being carnally Educated,
could never be brought to comprehend the ſacred
Doctrine of Chriſt, unleſs they had been convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the working of ſome ſupernatural Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Moſt Chriſtians, I ſay, do allow of this
at leaſt in the Infancy of Chriſtianity, and theſe
I believe will not much reflect upon the credit
of ſuch as they ſhall here meet withal; and for
thoſe pretended Chriſtians, who cry down all
that is not ſuitable to their own Enthuſiaſtick
Notions, it is not material whether they give
credit to theſe things or not, ſince many of them
have had the prophane Impudence with ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Tongues and Pens, to endeavour to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the uſe of the Lord's Prayer and Creed; and
it is no diſcredit for a Chriſtian Author to be
<pb facs="tcp:54712:11"/>
diſeſteemed by thoſe who made ſo little account
of Chriſt himſelf, and his Apoſtles. However,
I do not urge this to oblige the believing of all
ſuch miraculous Relations, as ſhall occur in this
Hiſtory; it will appear, I am not over-fond of
them my ſelf. Doubtleſs in all parts of the
World, God permitted Miracles to be wrought
for his own Glory, and for the Salvation of
Souls, but whether the ſame, or in the ſame
manner, as they are here related, is left to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one to believe or diſ-believe at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
To proceed, there follows for ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of years, after the Redemption of Man,
a moſt obſcure and uncertain account of what
hapned not only in <hi>Portugal,</hi> but throughout
all <hi>Spain.</hi> From the total Conqueſt made by
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> till the coming of the Barbarous
<hi>Goths, Suevians, Vandals, Alans,</hi> and the
reſt, there was for the moſt part a continual
Peace throughout <hi>Spain,</hi> which being, during
that time, a Province ſubject to the Empire,
either yielded no matter worth the Writing, or
elſe wanted Writers to tranſmit it to Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The barbarous Nations above mentioned,
were ſo far from the thoughts of recording their
own Acts, that their greateſt care was to root
out and deſtroy all Learning and Civility; for
which reaſon, their Hiſtory is tranſmitted to
us ſo interrupted and imperfect, that ſcarce any
Connection can be found in it. But when
theſe Savage People by the receiving of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
had been ſomewhat Civilized, and it
might have been hoped the Clouds of ignorance
<pb facs="tcp:54712:12"/>
would have been diſperſed, then their griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sins called upon them a heavy Judgment
from <hi>Africk,</hi> which was an inundation of
<hi>Moors,</hi> who in the ſpace of eight Months, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verran
all <hi>Spain,</hi> deſtroying not only Books,
but all Monuments of Antiquity that were
then remaining, and driving the miſerable
Chriſtians into Dens and Caves upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
whence afterwards iſſuing out, they
had ſo much continual employment for the
Sword, that none had time to perpetuate with
the Pen, what the Sword performed. Hence
followed ſuch a profound ignorance in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the perpetual Wars ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away all thoughts of Learning, that for
many Years after it had Kings of its own,
yet it wanted Writers to perpetuate their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>Theſe are in ſhort the defects of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
if they may be termed ſuch, ſince as we
have ſaid before, there is none perfect in the
World, and thoſe I think are ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
to ſatisfy ſuch reaſonable perſons as will
not expect impoſſibilities. Of the Supplement
it will be needleſs to add more than has been
already ſaid, unleſs it be a word touching the
concluſion of it, and in relation to the account
there given, of the hard uſage of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
King <hi>Alphonſo.</hi> Yet becauſe I think,
as much has been ſaid there, as is requiſite
to juſtify what I have Written, I will not tire
the Reader's patience, only once for all, aſſure
<pb facs="tcp:54712:12"/>
him, that nothing has been there Writ by me
for Favour or Affection, ſince I may rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be condemned than rewarded for any
thing that ſeems to vindicate that unhapy
Prince. I muſt confeſs, I could not without
Concern, read a Book publiſhed here in the
Year 1677. and Entituled, <hi>The Portugal
Hiſtory: Or, a Relation of the Troubles
that hapned in the Court of</hi> Portugal <hi>in the
Years 1667. and</hi> 1668. For in that Treatiſe,
I find King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> treated in ſo cruel
a manner, that it would afflict the hardeſt
Heart that has any remorſe or conſideration
for the Majeſty of Kings. It was not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning
and dethroning of that poor Prince,
which was the hardeſt part of his Misfortunes;
this Book I mentioned, and others like it, have
yet gone farther, by blaſting his Memory to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
and repreſenting of him as a Monſter,
rather than a Man. Theſe enormities I have
laboured the beſt I could, to rectify by giving
the trueſt Character of that Prince I could,
and the moſt impartial account of his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
In this part I have made uſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impartial Authors, and alſo of authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
informations, from ſuch perſons as knew
that King, and were Witneſſes to the whole
contrivance of his Depoſition and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Thus much may ſuffice to inform, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs
the Reader. All Books that appear in
publick are expoſed to Cenſure, and few or
<pb facs="tcp:54712:13"/>
none eſcape it, even the beſt are not exempted,
and therefore I cannot hope this ſhould. But
let it take its Chance, there are ſundry ſorts
of taſts among Men, what one likes, another
loaths; and even ſo it falls out in Books, ſome
Men extoll, and others cry them down; this
cannot be ſo unfortunate, as not to pleaſe ſome
body. Thoſe who like it, will have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in pleaſing themſelves, and ſuch as are
diſguſted with it, will have no recompence for
their Diſſatisfaction.</p>

15. This was the End of <hi>Gerion,</hi> ſuch will that of all
Tyrants be. Some Authors are of Opinion he was
ſlain by <hi>Hercules</hi> the <hi>Grecian;</hi> and the reaſon of this
Miſtake is, that then the Name of <hi>Hercules</hi> was rather
titular to all Heroes, than peculiar to any one. <hi>Gerion</hi>
was the firſt in <hi>Spain</hi> that made Account of any Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
beſides Cattle, diſcovered Mines of Gold, and
taught the Value of it. From the Riches he thus ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
he got the Name of <hi>Chryſeus</hi> or <hi>Deabus,</hi> which, in
the <hi>Lybian</hi> Language ſignifies a Man of Gold, or Lord
of great Riches. This Humanity of <hi>Oſiris,</hi> in reſtoring
the Sons of <hi>Gerion</hi> to the Crown, ſo far gained upon the
<hi>Portugueſe,</hi> that in return they gave up their very Souls,
receiving the new VVorſhip which the Idolatrous <hi>Oſiris</hi>
brought among them. Of him they learnt to make
their Year but of Four Months, after the manner of
the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> which Cuſtom continued in <hi>Spain,</hi> till
the <hi>Romans,</hi> having ſubdued it, reduced the Account to
their own Form. <hi>Oſiris</hi> is allowed to have taught the
People an eaſier way of Tilling and Sowing than they
uſed before. <hi>Gerion</hi> reigned 34 years, and was the firſt
that oppreſſed and fleeced the People, the Property of
Uſurpers, who when they do beſt, treat their Subjects
with more Cruelty than Lawful Princes do at worſt.

built a magnificent Temple, wherein the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies

their King, who continued in <hi>Luſitania</hi> with many of
his <hi>Aegyptians.</hi>
                  </p>

The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in thoſe days held it a crime to
look upon the ſetting Sun, therefore thoſe that lived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Coaſt, uſed to turn their backs towards it; thoſe
who lived near the <hi>Promontorium Sacrum,</hi> retreated at
Night far off from it, believing the Gods ſpent the Night
there in Sport and Paſtimes, not to be ſeen by Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Eyes: Only the Prieſts and the King on the Night
of his inauguration, were permitted to ſtay on that
point of Land, and look towards the <hi>Weſt,</hi> but as ſoon

returned to the ſame place, and continued there till the
Sun again ſpread its Beams over all that part of the

offered Sacrifice, and was thence forward eſteemed

Opinion among the vulgar, that <hi>Hiſpalis</hi> now <hi>Sevil,</hi>

of one <hi>Baucius Capetus,</hi> (or, as others call him, <hi>Bachius

<hi>Mezerbal</hi> obſerving his Troops diſordered, and giving

Enemies to the <hi>Celtae</hi> of the Province of <hi>Alentejo,</hi> and to

the Wood, the Oxen being frighted, ran ſo furiouſly
with the Flaming Carts into the midſt of them that they
were put into Confuſion, notwithſtanding their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

gathering the Relicks of the Army, fell upon the

to their Relief, the two Generals were obliged to
raiſe a greater Power, with which they not only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
the <hi>Phocentians,</hi> but put all to the Sword that were
able to bear Arms. This done, he marched towards
the <hi>Vectones,</hi> who continued to inſult the <hi>Celtae,</hi> and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
revenged their Wrongs. But the <hi>Celtae</hi> not ſo
ſatisfied, ceaſed not to deſtroy the Enemies Country.
This obliged the <hi>Vectones</hi> to chooſe one <hi>Tagus</hi> for their
General, under whoſe Conduct, for ſome time, they
put <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> to his Shifts, till in one Battle he cut off
moſt of their Horſe. Thus <hi>Tagus</hi> was conſtrained to
make Overtures of Peace, which being admitted and
ſworn to, <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> contrary to his Oath, made <hi>Tagus,</hi>
and many of his principal Men, Priſoners. They, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
to ſell their Lives at a dear rate, put many of
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to the Sword; but, in Concluſion,
were all foully murdered by <hi>Aſdrubal.</hi> He remained
Governour in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Hanibal</hi> went over into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick.</hi>

where he found his Brother-in-law <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> was dead,<note place="margin">Hannibal <hi>ſettles in</hi> Spain.</note>
as he had deſerved. For a Slave to that <hi>Tagus,</hi> whom
he perfidiouſly ſlew, ſtabbed him as he was ſacrificing,
in revenge of his Maſters Death. Nor did he afterwards
endeavour to eſcape; but, being put upon the Wrack,
bore all his Torments with a Countenance unmoved,
<hi>Hanibal</hi> made it his Buſineſs to gain the Good Will not
only of the <hi>Africans,</hi> but of the Natives. To this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
he contracted Friendſhip with one <hi>Viriatus</hi> (not he
that held War ſo many Years againſt the <hi>Romans</hi>) who
was a principal Man, or little Prince among the <hi>Celtae,</hi>
of the Province of <hi>Alentejo.</hi> Next to bind the <hi>Andalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zians</hi>
faſter, he married a Wife among them, called <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milce,</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:54712:26"/>
born at <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> now a poor Village, known by
the Name of <hi>Carlona.</hi> By her he had his Son <hi>Aſpar.</hi>
Having thus ſecured his Intereſt, and gathered a mighty
Army from all parts, his next Thought was to break
the Peace made ſome Years before with the <hi>Romans.</hi> In
order to it he reſolved to invade <hi>Saguntum,</hi> a City in
League with them. By the way he ſubdued the <hi>Vocei,</hi>
and other Nations. From them he marched againſt the
<hi>Vectones,</hi> who had killed his Father, and laying Siege
to <hi>Salamanca,</hi> ſo diſtreſſed it, that the Inhabitants were
forced to buy their Peace. This Accord was broke by
the <hi>Luſitanians,</hi> who getting into the City, violated the
Conditions; whereupon the Siege was again continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
At length the Beſieged capitulated to depart with
only their Apparel, and unarmed. They marched out,
but the Women carrying the Weapons under their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and delivering them to the Men, they made
ſuch uſe of them, that had not <hi>Hanibal</hi>'s Army been ſo
numerous, it had been dubious which ſide ſhould have
been victorious; but the Multitude overcame Valour,

Night coming on hindred any further Action,

put them to flight, 35000 of them being killed this
and the day before.</p>
                  <p>6. The Fortune of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Luſitania</hi> continued

them. Having ſubdued all the open Country, they

ordering the Prey, with ſome Troops of Light-Horſe,

ſuch Gallantry that they were drove back to their

taking Heart, and again gathering Strength, aſſaulted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54712:29"/>
their Trenches, and beat them thence, killing 5000

Eminence, ſtrong by Nature. Thence his Men came
down, and defeated ſome Parties of <hi>Luſitanians,</hi> who
dragged the Colours they had taken in their ſight; and
ſeveral Colours, and part of the Booty was recovered.
<hi>Caeſaro</hi> returned, and though he met with great Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,

laid Siege to them, and they began to be pinched with

ſuch Fury, that they broke through the <hi>Roman</hi> Army,

to make an equal Diſtribution of Lands among them:
To which purpoſe they were all appointed three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Places where to meet him, that each Man might

                  <p>1. THE Renowned <hi>Viriatus,</hi> who as has been ſaid,
eſcap'd from the Maſſacre, committed by
<hi>Galba</hi> in the three Vallies, was a <hi>Luſitanian</hi> without
the mixture of any other Nation. Some Authors ſay,
he was a common Robber,<note place="margin">

others a Sheperd, and laſtly, others ſay, he went
through all theſe mean Employments. Whatſoever
he was before, at the time that <hi>Galba</hi> offered Peace to
the <hi>Luſitanians,</hi> and Murdered ſo many in Cold Blood,
he was one of them that were willing to hearken to his
Propoſals, and made his eſcape from the Slaughter. His
mind burning with deſire of Revenge, as ſoon as he
heard that <hi>Galba</hi> was departed, he returned to the place
of the Maſſacre, where cauſing his Companions to
thruſt their Hands into the yet freſh wounds of ſome
Maidens, they ſwore by their Souls, not to deſiſt from
ſeeking Revenge as long as they were able to bear
Arms. This done, <hi>Viriatus</hi> ranging throughout <hi>Luſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania,</hi>
ſtirred up the People, raiſed a good Body of Men,
and breaking into <hi>Carpertania</hi> deſtroy'd all as he went,
and returned home with a rich Booty. Then he cauſed
his followers to reiterate the Oath they had taken, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
one of their Priſoners, and a Horſe; and ſo
every Man paſſing by, thruſt his Hand into the Belly
of each Sacrifice, vowing to do the like to the <hi>Roman</hi>
Army.</p>
                  <p>2. It was now the beginning of the Year, 148 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the coming of Chriſt, 3114 from the Creation,
and 2281 from the Deluge, when the Pretor <hi>Marcus
Vetilius,</hi> a Man of known Valour, came to ſuppreſs the
Tumults in <hi>Luſitania. Viriatus</hi> with 10000 Fighting
Men was entring <hi>Andaluzia</hi> rather as every Mans Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
than Commander, as not daring to chaſtiſe
them; with his Example and good Words, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to draw back thoſe that ſcattered to Plunder; but
his Men not ſubject to Command, could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54712:31"/>

                     </note> and having killed a great number,
eaſily put the reſt to flight. <hi>Viriatus</hi> gathering the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of his ſcattered Forces, fled to a City near, and
there provided to oppoſe the Enemy: It was not long
before the <hi>Romans</hi> came and aſſaulted the City, but
finding they had ſuſtained great loſs, the Pretor reſolved
to carry it by a long Siege: So far had he prevailed, that
ſome principal Men among the Beſieged began to treat
of a Surrender, without conſulting <hi>Viriatus,</hi> for as yet,
they owned him not for their Superiour. <hi>Viri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atus</hi>
underſtanding there was ſuch a deſign, but not
who were the Managers of it, having in a raging Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
ran about, and in that manner gathered the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to him, ſo efficaciouſly perſwaded them to
ſtand upon their Defence, and to have no Faith in
the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they lifted him upon their Shoulders,
and carrying him about the Walls, with loud crys,
Proclaimed him their General.</p>
                  <p>3. The next day after he was proclaimed General,
<hi>Viriatus</hi> drew out 1000 Horſe, which was all he had,
and facing the <hi>Romans</hi> made ſhow as if he deſigned
to break through them, which <hi>Vetilius</hi> the Pretor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
he kept his Men in a readineſs to receive him.
But <hi>Viriatus</hi>'s deſign being only to amuze the Enemy,
whilſt his Foot eſcaped out of the City, he continued
in the ſame Poſture the greateſt part of the day. At
length underſtanding there was no Man left in the
City, all his Foot being got into the Mountains, he
ſtood the Enemies Charge, and kept them in play
till Night, when through by-ways he haſted to the
City <hi>Tribola,</hi> whether he had ſent his Foot. This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſtood upon the Coaſt between the Mouth of <hi>Guadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
and <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> whence may be inferred that the
other whence he came, was not far off. <hi>Vetilius</hi> in the
Morning followed <hi>Viriatus,</hi> who having by the way
increaſed his Forces, lay in wait on the Mountains that
hung over a Valley, into which there were two nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Paſſes, capable of only <hi>three</hi> Horſemen go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

took themſelves to their reſt. <hi>Viriatus</hi> giving
the Sign to his Men to fall on, the <hi>Romans</hi> on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

eſcaped the Slaughter, and ſome <hi>Andaluzians,</hi> thinking

                     <note place="margin">147.</note> without
meeting any Oppoſition. Thus was he employed
when <hi>Caius Plaucius</hi> the Roman General, who came
to Command in <hi>Luſitania</hi> with 10000 Foot, and
1300 Horſe, thought to have ſurprized him and his
Men, being now moſtly diſperſed about in burning the
Country. <hi>Viriatus</hi> tho weak, kept the <hi>Romans</hi> in play

them all off before the Pretor could Relieve them, and
having gained the Ford of <hi>Tagus,</hi> ſpeedily paſſed over
it, and returned into <hi>Luſitania. Viriatus</hi> having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

how little confidence was to be placed in a Heartleſs
Multitude, for in the Field of <hi>Ourique</hi> he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,

1000 of thoſe that fled, gathering together, began to
plunder the Villages, as they paſſed; and meeting 300
<hi>Luſitanians,</hi> laden with Booty, fell upon them; But
they were ſo hotly received, that having loſt 300 of
their Men, and killed but 70 of the Enemy, they were
glad to ſuffer the reſt to march off with their Plunder.
Another Body of the <hi>Romans,</hi> having taken a rich Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
led 500 Captives away, the one half whereof were
Women, who obſerving that no great Regard was had
of them, only their Hands bound behind, in the dead

the Men; then ſeizing the Arms of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
buried in Sleep, put moſt of them to the Sword
before they waked; only a few eſcaped by the Favour
of the Night. Next Morning the Victors put the
Armour of the <hi>Romans</hi> upon their Women. <hi>Ormia,</hi> a

being delighted, he put himſelf into her Power; ſo
that ſhe waiting her Opportunity, when he ſlept, with
his own Sword cut off his Head, and carried away both

his coming into <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> broke into the <hi>Roman</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
doing greater Harm than before, and took two
Cities, into which he put Garriſons. <hi>Fabius,</hi> that the
Gods might be favourable to his Undertakings, went to
offer Sacrifice in the Temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi> at <hi>Cadiz;</hi>
ſtrictly charging his Officers, upon no Account to ſtir

<hi>Viriatus</hi> appeared before the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, at ſuch time

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54712:32"/>
drove back the <hi>Luſitanians</hi> to their Main Body;

Here he gathered new Strength; and encouraging the

Shelter in their Trenches, leaving behind them 27 En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,

purſuing a <hi>Luſitanian</hi> Robber, called <hi>Corroba,</hi> beſieged
him in a ſtrong Place, where Hunger forced him to
ſurrender, upon Promiſe not only of Life, but that his

But the Conſul, unmindful of his Promiſe, when he

                  <p>8. Spring coming on, all <hi>Luſitania</hi> was full of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

                  <p>9. In the Morning, the <hi>Luſitanians</hi> miſſing their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,

the whole Camp was filled with Lamentation; and in

other Trophies of Arms. Then their Idolatrous Prieſt
going up to the Top, called upon the Ghoſt of <hi>Viria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi>

then to ſue for Peace. It was granted upon tolerable
Conditions, one whereof was, that he ſhould aſſign

till he came to <hi>Eburobricium,</hi> a City ſeated
on the Sea-coaſt near to which now ſtands the Town
of <hi>Alfazeyran;</hi> the Inhabitants of this place adventured
to come out a League from their Walls, and give the

the Victory; and having without much difficulty
overthrown his Enemy, performed his Vow: He laid
Siege to the City, and ſoon was Maſter of it.</p>

Thence in Parties they came down, and cut off
many of his Men, nay, the very Women ſhowed ſuch
Valour, that the Conſul was obliged to kill a great
number of them; but perceiving the harm was done
him from the Mountains, he fell to Burning all the
plain Country, with ſuch Fury, that People were
glad to beg a Peace, which was eaſily granted: Thus

ſent from <hi>Luſitania</hi> found him, and in the Name

which he immediately accepted, and came over with
the Ambaſſadors. At his firſt Arrival, he gained the
good will of all Men,<note place="margin">He comes into <hi>Luſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania.</hi>
                     </note> by his Affability and Bounty,
and choſe <hi>Evora</hi> for a place of Arms; when he had taken
an Oath of Fidelity of the <hi>Luſitanians,</hi> he viſited the
Province, accompanied with 700 Horſe and 4000
Foot, and with all poſſible Diligence, provided all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
for War: The Neighbouring People perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, offered him their Service, as did others farther
off, moved by their Example. Among them the City
<hi>Oſca,</hi> which Tradition will have to be that in <hi>Aragon,</hi>
a ſtrong Place, where <hi>Sertorius</hi> ſettled an Univerſity:
This he did for his own Security rather than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the People, that he might there have the
principal Youth of the Country together as Hoſtages;<note place="margin">His Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes.</note>
for the fixing of this Univerſity Profeſſors of all Sciences,
came from ſeveral Countries. To ſtrenghten his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
the more, he made uſe of another practice, which
is, that having a Hind brought him, he made her ſo
tame, that ſhe followed him in the Army, amidſt the
Noiſe of Arms, and the People admiring thereat, he
gave out, it was ſent him by the Goddeſs <hi>Diana,</hi> to
give him advice how to behave himſelf in the War.
When he underſtood that any of his Captains had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Victory, he cauſed the Hind to be Crown'd with
Flowers by him, he entruſted with the Secret, and as
ſoon as let looſe, ſhe would run to him, and he putting
his Ear to her Mouth, would diſcover what he had
been told before, ſaying, <hi>Diana</hi> gave him that intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
by the Mouth of the Hind: This Fraud made
the People follow him, as if he were ſomewhat more
than Man.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Sertorius</hi> having thus gained the Affections of the
<hi>Luſitanians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits.</note> and ſecured their Children, as Hoſtages,
at <hi>Oſca,</hi> ventured to take the Field, againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi>
with only 8000 Men, whereof 5000 were <hi>Luſitanians,</hi>
the reſt <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Africans.</hi> Nine Years he maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
War againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> and againſt four of its beſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
who brought over 7000 Horſe, and 122000
Foot, beſides the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Auxiliaries. His firſt Exploit,
was, the ſubduing moſt part of the Province of <hi>Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania;</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:54712:37"/>
where he found little or no Reſiſtance. Next,
he defeated <hi>Cota,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Admiral, who kept the
<hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and hinder'd Supplies from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him out of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> Sailing victorious up
the River <hi>Guadalquiver,</hi> he ſurprized, at Break of Day,
the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, under the Command of <hi>Didius,</hi> who
lay encamped upon the Banks of the River, and put
the greateſt part of it to the Sword. <hi>Herculeus,</hi> one of
his Captains, was ſent out by him, againſt <hi>Lucius Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius,</hi>
who, by Order of the Conſul, <hi>Quintus Metellus
Pius,</hi> deſtroyed all the Country between <hi>Andaluzia</hi> and
the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains. <hi>Herculeus</hi> purſuing, overtook
him in <hi>Aragon,</hi> where he overthrew his Army, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him. The Fame of this Defeat moved <hi>Manilius,</hi>
Proconſul of <hi>Gallia Norbonenſis,</hi> to paſs the Mountains
with a mighty Army of <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> in hopes to
gather together the few ſcatter'd Remnants of <hi>Domitius</hi>'s
Army. But the Victor, fluſhed with his late Succeſs,
met him near <hi>Lerida,</hi> where a moſt bloody Battel was
fought, and <hi>Manilius</hi> routed, with a terrible Slaughter
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions; but, above all, of the <hi>French</hi>
Horſe. In the mean while, <hi>Sertorius</hi> ſtuck cloſe to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus;</hi>
who perceiving himſelf to be ſtill upon the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Hand, reſolved to alter his Method of Carrying on
the War, and laid Seige to <hi>Lacobriga,</hi> now called <hi>Lagos,</hi>
in the Kingdom of <hi>Algarve.</hi> Want of Water preſſed
the Beſieged; but <hi>Sertorius,</hi> with great Rewards, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with 2000 Soldiers to break through the <hi>Roman</hi>
Camp, with each of them a Skin-full of Water. This
Supply encouraged the <hi>Lacobrigenſes,</hi> till <hi>Sertorius</hi> could
come to raiſe the Seige: But <hi>Metellus,</hi> hearing of his
Preparations, marched away, and left it. Want of
Proviſions forced him to depart; for <hi>Sertorius</hi> had cut
off a Legion that was coming to him, with a Convoy.
<hi>Metellus</hi> marched into <hi>Andaluzia, Sertorius</hi> keeping cloſe
at his Heels, and came to <hi>Oſca,</hi> where the <hi>Luſitanian</hi>
Youths were, deſigning to take that Place; but it was
well provided: Beſides, the <hi>Luſitanian</hi> Army being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Back, he marched away to <hi>Cartagena;</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius</hi>
returned to <hi>Evora.</hi> Thus it appears, that <hi>Oſca,</hi>
where the Univerſity was erected, was not in <hi>Arragon,</hi>
as ſome will have it; but in <hi>Andaluzia.</hi> At <hi>Evora, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius</hi>
received Ambaſſadors from <hi>Mithridates,</hi> King of
<hi>Pontus:</hi> He propoſed to ſettle Amity, for the ſubduing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54712:38"/>
of <hi>Italy;</hi> offered Ships, and asked ſome <hi>Luſitanian</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:
Beſides, he offered to <hi>Sertorius</hi> the whole Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Aſia. Sertorius</hi> received the Ambaſſadors with
Majeſty, promiſed the Supply of Soldiers, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſent it. The Ambaſſadors being diſmiſſed, <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius</hi>
employed himſelf in making Proviſion for the
next Campaign, and exerciſing his Men; knowing he
could not expect long to enjoy Peace.</p>
                  <p>9. In the mean time came <hi>Pompey</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> from
<hi>Rome,</hi> and was joined by <hi>Metellus. Marcus Perpenna</hi>
came alſo from <hi>Sardinia,</hi> with 30 <hi>Veterane</hi> Troops, to
the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Sertorius.</hi> The <hi>Luſitanians,</hi> encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with this Aid, and lying now in ſight of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
preſſed their General to lead them out to Battel:
But he weighing the mighty Power of the Enemy, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
how to gain ſome Advantage by Policy. Part
of his Army, carried away with Heat, and forgetful of
good Diſcipline, adventured, contrary to his Orders,
to charge the <hi>Romans,</hi> but came off with Diſhonour;
which nothing diſpleaſed <hi>Sertorius.</hi> Here it was, that
he convinced his Men, by the Example of two Horſes;
One, very lean and poor, he gave to a luſty Young
Man, ordering him to pull out the Hair of his Main
and Tail; which he attempting to draw out by Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls,
laboured much, but profited little. The other,
being a beautiful, ſtrong Horſe, he gave to an ancient
Man, for the ſame purpoſe; and he plucking Hair by
Hair, did that with Eaſe, which the other could not
do with great Pains. Thus, he ſaid, they were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom it was impoſſible at one
Stroke to overthrow; but eaſie to compaſs at many.
<hi>Sertorius</hi> laid Seige to <hi>Laurona,</hi> (now <hi>Leiria,</hi>) 4 Leagues
from <hi>Valencia,</hi> on the Banks of the River <hi>Xucar. Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
and <hi>Metellus</hi> came to raiſe the Seige, but loſt 10000
Men in the Attempt; and endeavouring to gain a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Ground, which lay opportunely for putting of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
in the Town, they found <hi>Sertorius</hi> had prevented
them. Next <hi>Pompey</hi> deſigned to beſiege the <hi>Luſitanian</hi>
Army, hemming it in between his own and the Town,
but <hi>Sertorius</hi> having left 6000 Men in Ambuſh, they
attacked him in his approach; ſo that he was glad to
return to his Camp, and look on whilſt the City was
taken and Burnt. The <hi>Roman</hi> Army conſiſted of 1000
Horſe and 30000 Foot, but the <hi>Luſitanians</hi> were 70000
ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:54712:38"/>
This done, <hi>Sertorius</hi> returned victorious to <hi>Evora,</hi> which
Place he fortified with ſtrong Walls, and brought Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to it from ſeveral Springs, through a ſtately Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
His whole Family, at this time, conſiſted of an
old Nurſe, and three Slaves: And though he was So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
in <hi>Portugal</hi> for ſome Years, he had no Houſe
of his own. Now it was, he built one ſo ſmall, that it
would not contain an ordinary Gentleman of our
Times. He married at <hi>Evora</hi> the Daughter of a Noble
Citizen, called <hi>Firmius Liberius;</hi> by whom he had no
Children.</p>
                  <p>10. Spring coming on,<note place="margin">72.</note> 
                     <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Metellus</hi> drew
out of their Winter-Quarters; and marching through
<hi>Andaluzia,</hi> ſeparately ſtrove to recover thoſe Places
which <hi>Sertorius</hi> had Garriſon'd. But he, loſing no
Time, advanced againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> and met him on the
Banks of the River <hi>Xucar. Pompey</hi> reſolved to fight,
that <hi>Metellus</hi> might have no Share in the Honour of the
Action: And <hi>Sertorius</hi> thought beſt to have to do with
them apart.<note place="margin">Sertorius <hi>worſted by</hi> Pompey <hi>and</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus.</note> Thus agreed, they drew out; <hi>Sertorius</hi>
facing <hi>Afranius,</hi> and <hi>Perpenna, Pompey.</hi> The Charge
being given, <hi>Sertorius</hi> began to gain upon <hi>Afranius;</hi>
when underſtanding that <hi>Perpenna</hi> gave way to <hi>Pompey,</hi>
he haſted thither, and preſently put the Enemy to
flight. In the mean while, <hi>Afranius,</hi> encouraging his
Men, had almoſt routed that Wing which <hi>Sertorius</hi> left
near poſſeſſed of Victory; but he returning thither,
ſoon reſtored the Battel. Now had <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army
been entirely cut off, but that <hi>Metellus</hi> appearing, <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius</hi>
ſtayed his Soldiers from the Purſuit, and ſaid,
<hi>Halt, halt; for I would have ſent this Boy to</hi> Rome, <hi>well
ſcourged, had not that old Woman ſnatched him out of my
Hands.</hi> However, <hi>Metellus</hi> did not attempt any thing
upon the Victors; contenting himſelf to have ſaved
the flying Army. <hi>Sertorius</hi> returning to his Camp,
miſſed his Hind, loſt in the Hurrey of the Battel,
which made him extreamly melancholy: But ſome time
after, certain Country-men bringing him Tidings of
her, he ordered them to conceal the Matter; and, at a
certain Time appointed, to turn her looſe: Then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
together his Chief Officers, he told them, <hi>The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs
of the Woods had appeared to him, aſſuring him, that
the Hind ſhould return, with Inſtructions how he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
himſelf.</hi> Whilſt he was yet talking, the Hind, ſet
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54712:39"/>
looſe, came running to him; and laying her Head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
his Knees, licked his Hands.</p>
                  <p>11. It is incredible, how much the whole Army
rejoiced at the Return of the Hind: And <hi>Sertorius,</hi> to
make uſe of that Heat, marched towards <hi>Valencia,</hi>
where <hi>Metellus</hi> was, waſting the Country. He ſo hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
him up in a Plain, that he muſt either periſh, or
fight. However, he ſent <hi>Mummius,</hi> with a Party of
Horſe, to conduct a Convoy of Proviſions to him.
<hi>Sertorius</hi> having Notice thereof, marched out by
Night; and in the Morning, putting the Guard to the
Sword, he took the whole Convoy. <hi>Metellus</hi> contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Sertorius,</hi> marched to ſeek him; and <hi>Perpenna,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him. Thus they were ſoon engaged, with ſuch ill
Succeſs on the <hi>Romans</hi> ſide, that they began to fly.
The old <hi>Metellus,</hi> diſdaining to be thus diſgraced, did
Wonders exceeding his Age, till he fell wounded with
a Dart:<note place="margin">Sertorius <hi>routed by</hi> Metellus.</note> And the Shame of loſing their General bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back his Men, they ſo fiercely charged the <hi>Luſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
diſorder'd in the Purſuit, that they recovered
the Day; putting them to the Rout, with great Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<hi>Sertorius</hi> did all that <hi>Metellus</hi> had done before,
to ſtay his Men; but could only ſtop the victorious
<hi>Romans,</hi> till his Army eſcaped: Which done, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
after, to a ſtrong City, ſtanding on an Hill.
<hi>Metellus</hi> encompaſſed the Place, thinking to ſtarve it;
but <hi>Sertorius</hi> had before laid in ſufficient Stores. A few
Days after, with a Party of Light Horſe, he made his
Eſcape, deceiving the <hi>Roman</hi> Guards, and returned ſafe
into <hi>Luſitania,</hi> where he was received with unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Joy.</p>

                  <p>1. THE following Year <hi>Sertorius</hi> put to Sea with a
Fleet,<note place="margin">70.</note> reſolving to deſtroy all the Ships he
found in the <hi>Roman</hi> Harbours;<note place="margin">The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great Loſſes by <hi>Sertorius.</hi>
                     </note> and in a ſhort time,
ſcouring the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> he did great Harm. This
was a great Loſs to <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Metellus;</hi> but a greater
they ſuſtained by the Means of <hi>Herculeius,</hi> a <hi>Luſitanian</hi>
Captain, who cut off ſix Troops of Horſe and a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which, under the Command of <hi>Probus Emilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
were conducting a great Convoy of Proviſions.
This put the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals upon taking new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods;
<hi>Pompey</hi> went away to <hi>Navarre,</hi> whilſt <hi>Metellus</hi>
gave an Account of his Loſſes to the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and preſſed for conſiderable Supplies.<note place="margin">69.</note> They came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly;
and the two Generals took the Field again.
<hi>Metellus</hi> marching apart from <hi>Pompey,</hi> near <hi>Italica,</hi>
(which was not far from <hi>Sevil,</hi>) was met by <hi>Herculeius,</hi>
and ſo preſſed, that he betook himſelf to a Mountain.
The <hi>Luſitanian</hi> Army lay at the Foot of the Hill, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the <hi>Romans</hi> to give Battel. <hi>Metellus</hi> waiting an
Opportunity, took it ſo aptly, that he killed and made
Priſoners 20000 of <hi>Herculeius</hi>'s Army, driving the reſt
out of the Field; and was ſo delighted with this great
Succeſs, that he cauſed Images of Victory, as he came
into every Town, to be let down artificially, with
Garlands of Flowers to crown himſelf; as alſo, his
Praiſes to be publickly ſung. <hi>Sertorius</hi> immediately
marched to ſeek the Victor, who was on his Way to
<hi>Catalonia:</hi> He did not overtake him, but cut off a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Horſe that was carrying the News of the Victory,
and ſome of the Priſoners, to <hi>Pompey. Herculeius</hi> was
ſo much aſhamed of his Defeat, that he abſconded, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54712:40"/>
would not be ſeen; but <hi>Sertorius</hi> comforted him, and,
with much Difficulty, prevailed with him to appear
again.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Sertorius</hi> leading a mighty Army againſt <hi>Metellus,</hi>
who was in the Kingdom of <hi>Murcia,</hi> by the Way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
all the Province of <hi>Andaluzia; Metellus</hi> retiring
to <hi>Valencia,</hi> where <hi>Pompey</hi> then was; who ſent a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Light-Horſe, to diſcover the Strength of <hi>Serto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
and found his Army numerous, and in good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
He paſſed the River <hi>Guadalaviar,</hi> near whoſe
Banks the two <hi>Roman</hi> Generals lay encamped, on an
advantageous high Ground. Both Armies being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to give Battel, and being drawn out in order to
it, they ſtopped to ſee the Event of a ſingle Combat
between two Soldiers, who had challenged one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s Soldier having killed him of <hi>Sertorius,</hi>
taking off his Helmet to cut off his Head, he found it
was his own Brother; whereupon, he immediately kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himſelf. This ſtrange Accident put off the Battel
for that Day; but the next Day after, they engaged with
great Reſolution;<note place="margin">Metellus <hi>and</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey <hi>again overthrow</hi> Sertorius.</note> when, in the Heat of the Action, a
Soldier telling <hi>Sertorius</hi> that the General of the Horſe
was killed, he ſtruck him through the Body, that he
might not terrifie others with that News: Yet neither
this, nor all he could do, was enough to prevent his
being put to the Rout, with the Loſs of 6000 of his
Men. It was no leſs Grief to <hi>Sertorius,</hi> than the Loſs of
the Battel, that the City <hi>Valencia</hi> ſubmitted to the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Romans;</hi> and much more, when other Places fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Example of it; amongſt which was <hi>Guada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxara.</hi>
Hither he marched with Speed; but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
being fled to a Place almoſt inacceſſible, full
of many great Caves, they ſcoffed at him, asking whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had Wings to come at them. He tried all Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems
to reduce them, but nothing ſucceeded. At
length he raiſed great Heaps of Sand and Duſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the Mouths of the Caves; and waiting till a
ſtrong North Wind blew directly in upon them, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Men, with Shovels, to caſt up the Sand; which
being ſo ſhaken, was by the Wind carried into the
Caves ſo violently, that thoſe within, being almoſt ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled,
were glad to cry for Mercy. <hi>Sertorius</hi> forgave
them all, and took nothing from them, but ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Proviſions for his Army.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:54712:40"/>
3. This laſt Action gained <hi>Sertorius</hi> great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as well of Policy to overcome, as of Clemency
towards the vanquiſhed; but his Forces being very
much broken, ſome of the principal <hi>Romans</hi> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him, propoſed to come to an accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with <hi>Pompey. Sertorius</hi> utterly rejected their Advice,
ſaying, <hi>Since the Romans would not treat with him in his
Proſperity, he would never condeſcend to fue to them in his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.</hi>
And that his Actions might ſute with his Words,
tho' then weak and lately overthrown, hearing that
<hi>Pompey</hi> had diſtreſſed <hi>Palencia,</hi> he haſted to the relief
of the Beſieged, and without looſing time, he Aſſaults
the <hi>Romans,</hi> and his Men being much diſordered in the
Confuſion, he was got ſo far among his Enemies, that
his Horſe being killed, he had inevitably periſhed, had
not a Body of <hi>Luſitanians</hi> offered to Sacrifice their own
lives for the defence of his. They deſperately forced
their way to the place where he was Fighting, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him into the midſt of them, carried him off in
ſafety. He thus brought back to his Men, ſo encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
them with his preſence,<note place="margin">He recovers and worſts the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                     </note> that they obliged <hi>Pompey</hi>
to quit his Camp, and with it his Tents and Engines:
Had not the Night been ſo near, few <hi>Romans</hi> had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
but they under the ſhelter of it, got away to places
of ſafety. In the mean while <hi>Metellus</hi> laid hard Siege to
<hi>Calahorra,</hi> but the victorious <hi>Sertorius</hi> drove him thence
by main force, with the Slaughter of 3000 of his Men,
and entring the Town, Commended the Fidelity of
the Inhabitants. Here he was informed, that <hi>Metellus</hi>
and <hi>Pompey</hi> joyning their Forces, lay before <hi>Oſca</hi> or
<hi>Hueſca</hi> his Univerſity; thither he haſted and Encamped
at a ſmall diſtance from them, ſo careleſly, that <hi>Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
forced him to take ſhelter in the Beſieged City in
great Confuſion, leaving behind him many Armes and
Horſes, and much Ammunition: This frown of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
moved the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had hitherto followed
<hi>Sertorius,</hi> to conſpire againſt him. Here by the way,
it is to be obſerved, That doubtleſs there were two <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca's,</hi>
ſince we Read, that before this time, they Fought
in <hi>Andaluzia</hi> near <hi>Oſca,</hi> and now again being in the
Territories of <hi>Aragon, Sertorius</hi> fled to <hi>Oſca.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Perpenna,</hi> that <hi>Roman</hi> who had hitherto ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſerved <hi>Sertorius,</hi> now tempted by the promiſed
rewards, undertook to kill him: <hi>Sertorius</hi> himſelf in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54712:41"/>
ſome meaſure forwarded his Deſign, by putting to death
the Sons of many <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had revolted from
him to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which rendred him odious to the
People, and miniſtred an opportunity to <hi>Perpenna</hi> to
compaſs his intended Treachery. <hi>Sertorius</hi> underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
there was a Conſpiracy againſt him,<note place="margin">Sertorius <hi>Murthered.</hi>
                     </note> gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
thereof to the <hi>Luſitanians,</hi> who were his Guard,
and they immediately put to Death Ten of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators.
None ſeemed more to commend this Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
than <hi>Perpenna,</hi> who as it were, to divert <hi>Serto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
invited him to a Supper, whither he, ſuſpecting
nothing, went; and; in the height of his Mirth, was
killed with 21 Wounds. The firſt that ſtruck him
was a <hi>Roman,</hi> called <hi>Antony:</hi> There was no leſs mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at his Death among the <hi>Luſitanians,</hi> than had been
for <hi>Viriatus,</hi> and many killed themſelves at his Funeral.
The Hind that had always followed <hi>Sertorius,</hi> ſeeing
him Dead, ſmelling to him, and heavily Groaning, at
length forbearing all Suſtenance, fell down Dead by his
ſide. The <hi>Luſitanians</hi> gathering his Aſhes into an Urne,
returned to <hi>Evora,</hi> where they were Honourably En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed.
The Magiſtrates of <hi>Evora,</hi> then the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Luſitania,</hi> conſulting how to ſecure the
Common-wealth, reſolved not to alter any thing, till
they ſaw what was done by <hi>Perpenna,</hi> with whom was
the greateſt part of <hi>Sertorius</hi> his Army, tho' many had
forſaken him, ſeeing <hi>Pompey</hi> preſſing upon them with
a mighty Power.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Perpenna</hi> failing of the promiſed Reward of his
Treachery from <hi>Metellus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">68.</note> was not content to have
Murdered his General, unleſs he alſo uſurped his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
Therefore calling together the Heads of the
Army, after inveighing againſt the Cruelty and Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs
of <hi>Sertorius,</hi> he offered himſelf for their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
Many of them before bribed by him, eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
and others ſeeing <hi>Pompey</hi> ſo near, complied with
neceſſity leaſt they ſhould want a Head in that time of
Danger. <hi>Pompey</hi> reſolving the firſt thing he did to make
an end of <hi>Perpenna,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Perpenna</hi> choſen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>Luſitani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                     </note> accordingly marched haſtily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, and he nothing Daunted, advanced to
meet him: Both Armies being in ſight of one another,
fell to Fortifying their Camps. The Work ended,
they ſpent the time in Skirmiſhes before they would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
a pitched Battle; but <hi>Perpenna</hi>'s Forces decreaſed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54712:41"/>
much, many by night Deſerting, which obliged him to
offer the Enemy Battle before he was quite forſaken:
Tho' <hi>Pompey</hi> doubted not of the Victory, yet to make
it ſecure, he laid an Ambuſh, and retiring, drew <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penna</hi>
into the Danger of it. Thus when he thought
himſelf Victorious, he was fallen into the Snare, and
immediately put to the Rout; he himſelf fled, and was

<hi>Perpenna</hi> among the Shrubs and Bryars. He falling
down, begged his Life, aſſuring them, He would
make great Diſcoveries of principal Men in <hi>Rome,</hi> who
kept Correſpondence with <hi>Sertorius,</hi> which he could
prove under their hands. The Captain of thoſe Horſe
acquainted <hi>Pompey</hi> therewith, who ordered his Head to
be immediately ſtruck off, and thoſe Papers to be
brought to him: The being accordingly performed,
Men of Note, whom their Conſcience accuſed, were
in a great Conſternation in <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army, for that they

offered to embrace the Friendſhip of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but

whilſt they could agree upon Articles, his ſick Men

he ſent in a Number of his beſt Soldiers privately Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who being let in, poſſeſſed themſelves of the

and pay a Sum of Money: With ſuch like Arts,
<hi>Pompey</hi> gained admittance into many Towns of <hi>Luſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:</hi>
Both <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Afranius</hi> laid Siege to <hi>Oxama</hi> (now
<hi>Oſma</hi>) where no fair means prevailing, the place was
furiouſly Battered, then Undermined, and a ſufficient
Breach being made, it was pertinaciouſly defended as
long as any of the Inhabitants were left alive. They all
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54712:42"/>
died to the laſt Man, and <hi>Pompey</hi> having none left to

the place in a confuſed heap of Rubbiſh; then the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
marched to <hi>Calahorra,</hi> but whilſt they lay before it,
<hi>Metellus</hi> ſent to Adviſe <hi>Pompey,</hi> it concerned him more
to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> than linger the time there: He lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Afranius</hi> to continue the Siege, in his way, laid the
Foundation of <hi>Pamplona,</hi> in <hi>Navar,</hi> and ſo went away to
<hi>Rome,</hi> where it was allowed him to Triumph, as he had
well deſerved. <hi>Afranius</hi> left at <hi>Calahorra,</hi> tho' he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
much by the Weather, it being then Winter, and
alſo for want of Proviſions, yet he reduced the Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

interpreted to Denote his becoming Sovereign of <hi>Rome,</hi>

they broke into <hi>Caſtile</hi> with a great Power,
putting all the Country to Fire and Sword. The
chief among theſe People were the <hi>Herminii,</hi> inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the deep Valley and high tops of the Mountain
<hi>Herminius,</hi> now called <hi>Serra de Eſtrella,</hi> which croſſeth
the greateſt part of the Kindom of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar <hi>comes into</hi> Luſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania.</note> The next

<hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> but put all to the Sword, which
made thoſe that eſcaped home, give the Alarm to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the People for the Storm that threatned them.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> over-running all the Province of <hi>Alenteio,</hi> with

of the Mountain <hi>Herminius</hi> perplexed <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
Tho' this Mountain, as was ſaid, runs almoſt through
the Kingdom, the chief habitation of thoſe People was
about the place where now ſtands <hi>Haramenha,</hi> which is
near <hi>Portalegre</hi> and <hi>Marvan.</hi> The place of it ſelf was
inacceſſible, and the People reſolute, therefore <hi>Caeſar</hi>
ſent Ambaſſadors to perſwade them to come down and
inhabit the plain: they kept theſe Ambaſſadors till
they had ſhown them their Weapons, the ſtrength of
the Place, and number of the Defendants, and then
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54712:43"/>
diſmiſſed them, with aſſurance that they would truſt
only to their Weapons and Courage. <hi>Caeſar</hi> diſdaining
to be Braved by thoſe Mountaineers, to appeaſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Luſitanians,</hi> much offended for that his Soldiers
had plundered the Temple of the God <hi>Endovelicus,</hi>
cauſed all that had been taken thence to be reſtored.</p>
                  <p>9. This done, he marched againſt the <hi>Herminii,</hi> who
were in a readineſs to receive him, and found the place
much more difficult than it had been repreſented to him.<note place="margin">He ſubdues the <hi>Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii.</hi>
                     </note>
Underſtanding that the <hi>Herminii</hi> had placed their Wives,
Children and weak People in a remote place of ſafety,
he with great Gifts perſwaded certain <hi>Luſitanians</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the <hi>Herminii,</hi> to lead a number of Men thro'
a private path to that place. Whilſt they upon Hands
and feet climbed the rough Rocks, he drew out his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and began to aſcend ſo as to divert the Defendants
from minding thoſe that were ſent about. An advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
party was ſo hotly received by the Mountaineers,
that they were forced to quit the attempt, and fly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
back to the Camp, <hi>Caeſar</hi> never offering to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them for fear of running more Men into the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
The Mountaineers, proud of this ſucceſs, braved
the <hi>Romans;</hi> but <hi>Caeſar</hi> truſting to thoſe he had ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
regarded them not: The third Night after they ſet
forward, the Party that was ſent to climb the Hill, fell
in upon the Old Men, Women and Children, putting
many to the Sword. But day appearing, and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how few had done that harm, the Women fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and their Husbands taking the Alarm, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Paſs they defended to protect their Wives and
Children. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſeeing the Paſs clear, mounted the
Hill till he came to a plain on the ſide of it, whilſt
the <hi>Herminii</hi> put all thoſe <hi>Romans</hi> that had climbed the
other ſide to the Sword. When they thought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the place they had quitted, they found <hi>Caeſar</hi>
poſſeſſed of it, wherewith they were ſo terrified, that
tho' they were above him, and might well have defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themſelves, they ſued for Peace; thereupon he
commanded them to go down and inhabit the Plain,
keeping 200 of their Women as Hoſtages.</p>
                  <p>10. The Fame of this unexpected Conqueſt made
many of the Neighbouring People reſolve to quit their
Dwellings,<note place="margin">And routs a vaſt Multitude.</note> and paſſing the River <hi>Duero,</hi> ſeek out new
places to inhabit, if not more fruitful than their own,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54712:43"/>
at leaſt more remote from the Enemy. This they did
in ſuch numbers, that the Province was almoſt unpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled;

<hi>Caeſar</hi> gave them not leaſure to follow their Families,
but falling upon them, was ſo hotly received, that his
Army began to give way, till a <hi>Veteran</hi> Legion coming

<hi>Luſitanian</hi> Armies meeting, ſtood a while looking upon

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54712:44"/>
gave the Signal of Battle, and both ſides gave the

made them deliver themſelves to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> barely upon
Diſcretion: He not only forbid any Wrong to be done
them in their Perſons or Goods, but ſupplied them
with all they wanted, and ſo diſmiſſed them wholly

                     <hi>Pompey</hi> aſſaulted them three times, and was as often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed:
At laſt he underſtood they ſtole away by Night,

and that <hi>Andaluzia</hi> began to mutiny. Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Caeſar</hi> marched towards <hi>Cordova,</hi> he directed his

would have delivered the Place to him; but the Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy

was Garriſon'd by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and in it conſiſted all his
Hopes; wherefore he lay to ſecure it with 60000
Men. Hither <hi>Caeſar</hi> came, to engage <hi>Pompey;</hi> and the
Battel began moſt furiouſly: <hi>Pompey</hi> behaved himſelf
ſo gallantly, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was once in doubt whether he
ſhould not kill himſelf, as deſpairing of the Victory:
But conſidering better, he lighted off his Horſe; and,
ſnatching a Buckler from a Soldier, ran deſperately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<hi>This Day will I end my Life; and you, the War: Thus
lay your Arms acroſs, ſince you have lost all Senſe of Shame,

of the Battel, to oppoſe <hi>Rogud,</hi> the whole Army of

at this Sight, the <hi>Bracarenſes</hi> ſent certain Troops
to take Revenge on them; but they being either killed
or taken Priſoners, ſerved only to revive their Sorrow.
Among theſe were a Son and a Father-in-Law, whoſe
Death ſo troubled the Wife of the one, and Daughter
of the other, that aſſociating her ſelf with ſome deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Women, and a good Number of Soldiers, ſhe, in

Triumph to <hi>Braga,</hi> and there, on the Walls, made
them ſuffer the ſame Death which their Country-men
had inflicted on her Friends. This done, ſhe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
buried her Father and Husband, and then
killed her ſelf. Now the Citizens of <hi>Porto,</hi> finding

with whoſe Aſſiſtance they twice overthrew their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

favourably heard, and brought back an Anſwer, ſuch as
they could have wiſhed, that <hi>Caius Antiſtius</hi> and <hi>Marcus

This ſo encouraged the Inhabitants of <hi>Porto,</hi> that before

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54712:49"/>
encamped about the City, when they perceived the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
upon them, ſo numerous, that they were forced to
fly with all ſpeed, and take the Shelter of their own
Walls, providing for a dangerous Siege. Before the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
could take their Poſts about the City, the <hi>Bracaren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
ſallied out, and much Harm was done on both ſides.
Among the Priſoners taken by the <hi>Romans,</hi> was a young
Maid, who had acted like a Virago: She was taken by
a Trooper; and the <hi>Roman</hi> General, by her Beauty;
who would have ſet her at liberty, promiſing to pay
her Ranſom: The Trooper preſſed, he might either
have the Money, or Liberty to make uſe of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
She ſnatching a Ponyard out of his Hand, ran to
kill him; but miſſing her Stroke, ſtab'd her ſelf. The
<hi>Bracarenſes</hi> retiring, the <hi>Romans</hi> took their Poſts; and
many Skirmiſhes paſſing between them, it happen'd
that <hi>Antiſtius,</hi> one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals, was taken,
and fell into the Hands of the Father of that Maid
above-mentioned; who, for that he had honourably
buried his Daughter, ſent him away free, and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably

Favours of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> for the City; perſwading him,
that thoſe of <hi>Porto</hi> were in the wrong. Thenceforth it

<hi>Auguſtus</hi> had divided the Kingdom into four Provinces,

a Temple to him and his Mother <hi>Druſilla,</hi> which he,

deſirous of their Gold, than of their Adoration. To

<hi>Titus Livius;</hi> with them went Ambaſſadors from

was a perfect Man coming out of the Sea, who ſitting
upon the Rocks, ſounded a great Shell as if it had been
a Horn, ſo loud and ſhrill, that it drew the People
thither to ſee who it was. Admiring the ſight of that
Creature, they ſent that Embaſſage, which is a token
no ſuch Creature had been ſeen before; tho' Authors
affirm that ſeveral have appeared ſince. The <hi>Roman</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Caius Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula.</note> the Imperial Crown was put upon
the Head of <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> whoſe horrid courſe of Life
made the wickedneſs of his Predeceſſor be looked upon
as innocence. <hi>Caligula</hi> in the 4th. Year of his Reign
was Murthered,<note place="margin">St. <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle in <hi>Spain.</hi>

he Preached the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and converted many by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54712:51"/>
of the mighty Miracles he Wrought. Among the

<hi>Malachias</hi> the Elder Son, to the Prophet <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rias,</hi> who
had been Buried near 600 Years; him he called <hi>Peter,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">44.</note> This Biſhop ſuffered Martyrdom at <hi>Rates,</hi>

<hi>Braga</hi> and <hi>Guimaraens</hi> upon the River <hi>Ave.</hi> In
this ſame place he was Martyred by the Neighbouring
People, in memory whereof, they to this day as it were
acknowledging the crime, reſort to his Church bare-footed,
and with Cords about them. The Martyrs
name was <hi>Torquatus,</hi> now corruptly called <hi>Torcade;</hi>
St. <hi>James</hi> embarking at <hi>Corunna,</hi> ſailed into <hi>England,</hi> in

of a little King's Son were Celebrating on the ſhoar
of <hi>Bouzas,</hi> not far from <hi>Porto,</hi> the Bride-groom being
on Horſe-back among many others, ſuddenly there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
a Ship at Sea; When it drew near, the Bride-groom
was carried away by his Horſe through the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and ſuddenly appeared upon the Ship covered with
Croſſes and Shells: Wondring what this ſhould mean,
he asked of thoſe in the Ship, who told him, They
brought the Body of St. <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle, who had
wrought that Miracle to convert him and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
People; and a voice from Heaven ſaid, it was
the Will of God, that all thoſe who went to viſit the
Apoſtle's Sepulcher, ſhould be ſo adorned with Croſſes.
The Bridegroom returned aſhoar, his Horſe treading
the Water, as if it had been firm Land, whereupon he
and all preſent were Baptized: Thus much may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

broke out into open Rebellion, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
many Inſolencies. For the ſuppreſſing of whom,
<hi>Trajan</hi> ſent 14 Legions, which utterly deſtroyed many
populous Towns and Cities. One of theſe Cities was
<hi>Lamego,</hi> which now ſtands not far from its antient Seat,
on the South ſide of the River <hi>Duero;</hi> and is one of the
beſt Biſhopricks in the Kingdom. In the 14 Legions
were many <hi>Luſitanians,</hi> who, in that common Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
helped much to the preſerving their Country from
utter Extirpation. <hi>Trajan</hi> died a natural Death; which
was then looked upon as no ſmall Rarity. His Fleets
had before ſailed down the Rivers <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulph, and thence into the <hi>Indian</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean;

thinking it impoſſible to maintain all the Conqueſts of
the Empire, he wholly abandoned them. To ſecure
the reſt of that vaſt Monarchy, he placed Foreign Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
over all the Provinces. Over the <hi>Luſitanians,</hi>
he placed <hi>Andaluzians;</hi> and over them, <hi>Luſitanians:</hi>
Theſe governed ſo well, that two of them had Statues
erected to their Memory. <hi>Quintus Pontius Severus,</hi> one
of the two, was born at <hi>Braga:</hi> And <hi>Caius Caretius Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi>
the other, at <hi>Chaves.</hi> Other Monuments there are

into the In-land. <hi>Portugal</hi> was ſo involved in this Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
that it came near to utter Deſolation: All that
lay along the Coaſt, from the Cape of St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> to
the Mouth of the River <hi>Duero,</hi> was conſumed with Fire
and Sword: <hi>Lisbon</hi> held out ſeveral furious Aſſaults, by
the Strength of its Situation: <hi>Porto,</hi> after a vigorous

For, though there are ſome old Inſcriptions extant,

<hi>Galienus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Galienus.</note> a Plague came out of the <hi>East,</hi> bearing down
all to the <hi>West;</hi> and raged ſo violently in <hi>Luſitania,</hi>
that the Cities were almoſt left deſolate, and the Fields
untilled. <hi>Galienus,</hi> awaken'd at this Scourge, ordered
the Perſecution againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which had been
continued ever ſince the Time of <hi>Decius,</hi> to ceaſe. This
Perſecution had filled Heaven with Martyrs;<note place="margin">Perſecution under him.</note> and alſo
terrified others in ſuch a manner, that they renounced
the Faith. Among the latter, were, <hi>Marcialis,</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Merida;</hi> and <hi>Baſilides,</hi> of <hi>Aſtorga. Elianus,</hi> or <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
Deacon of <hi>Merida,</hi> a Man of great Learning and
Vertue, aſſembled a National Council in that City;
where the two Idolatrous Biſhops were depoſed. They,
to recover their Honour, feigned Repentance: And
St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> then Pope, believing the Fiction, ordered
them to be reſtored; but his Command was not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54712:54"/>
by the Council, who therein took the Advice of
St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
was held at <hi>Braga,</hi> to decide whether the Baptiſm of
Hereticks, done with an Intention, was valid: And
it paſſed in the Affirmative. After the Plague, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
a no leſs Evil; which was, an Inundation of
<hi>Germans,</hi> over all the Provinces of the Empire. Moſt
Places now known in <hi>Portugal</hi> only by their Ruins,
were by them overthrown, and not by the <hi>Goths:</hi> For,
the <hi>Germans</hi> deſigning to return home, ſpoiled all they
could not carry away; whereas the <hi>Goths,</hi> coming to
ſettle, ſpared much, for their own Uſe. Thus ended
the Empire of <hi>Galienus.</hi>

<hi>Hermenericus</hi> carried the Bride to the new City <hi>Coim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra,</hi>

he asked, one Day, which had been the Religion of
St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours;</hi> this Saint being then famous for
Miracles: It was told him, he had been a <hi>Catholick.</hi>
Immediately four Gentlemen were ſent, with as much
Gold and Silver as the ſick Perſon weighed, beſides
other Gifts, to offer at the Shrine; with a Promiſe,
That if the Prince recovered, he ſhould embrace the
<hi>Catholick</hi> Religion. The Sickneſs hereupon decreaſed,
yet the Prince recovered not perfect Health: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
the King begged ſome Relick of the Saint; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing

the Ambaſſadors; and they, at Night, ſpreading a

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54712:62"/>
found it as heavy as if it had been made of ſome weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

them; and the ſame Day they landed, the Prince per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
recovered. The King performed his Promiſe,
embracing the Faith; and by his Example, and the
Preaching of another St. <hi>Martin,</hi> who then came out
of <hi>France,</hi> according to ſome Authors; or, as others
will have it, out of <hi>Greece,</hi> moſt of the People were
converted. <hi>Theodemirus</hi> had before erected a Church,

Wives; The firſt, before he came to the Crown, was
<hi>Balda,</hi> Daughter to the famous King <hi>Arthur,</hi> or to

By his firſt Wife (though ſome will have him to be
Illegitimate) he had <hi>Liuva,</hi> who ſucceeded him in

Robes, retired to an Amphitheater, a ſtrong <hi>Roman</hi>
Work, where he ſtayed two days, the Victors only
keeping Guard leaſt he ſhould eſcape thence. The
King coming to the City, <hi>Argebatus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi>
one of the followers of <hi>Paul,</hi> came out to meet
him in his Pontifical Robes, and caſting himſelf at his
Feet, begged Pardon for himſelf and all the reſt. This
action ſomewhat appeaſeth <hi>Wamba,</hi> who Pardoned
him and promiſed to moderate his anger towards the
reſt. He entred the City in Triumph, where <hi>Paul</hi> was
brought Priſoner and fell down proſtrate before him,
as others did; their lives were granted, but they were
committed to cuſtody till it were reſolved what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

and the City ordered to be repaired. It was voted,
that <hi>Paul</hi> and his Aſſociates ſhould have their Eyes put
out, their lives being before granted them, but <hi>Wamba</hi>
was content they ſhould only remain perpetual Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.
When he entred <hi>Toledo</hi> in Triumph, they were
all carried before him upon Camels, and <hi>Paul</hi> in the

Penalties uſually inflicted on Traitors at that time, and

Forces againſt them, by whom they were overthrown,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54712:67"/>
their Fleet burnt, and all their power both by Sea and

                     </note> or <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and
the miſerable Ends of Count <hi>Julian,</hi> his Wife, and
Daughter, the principal Actors in this Tragedy, are
treated of in the Chronicles of thoſe Kingdoms to
which they appertain. <hi>Pelagius,</hi> during the 19 Years
he reigned, had no Command in <hi>Portugal,</hi> where the
<hi>Moors</hi> were ſo predominant, that there were as many
Kings as Cities. But becauſe the Actions of <hi>Pelagius</hi>
were ſo great in themſelves, and in the Conſequence of
them, we will give ſome Hints of what others write at
large. <hi>Pelagius</hi> was in the great Battel, with his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin-German
King <hi>Roderick:</hi> After which, he fled, with
1000 <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to <hi>Aſturias de Oviedo,</hi> where he took
Shelter in a vaſt Cave, now called <hi>Covadonga,</hi> among
the Mountains of <hi>Auſeva;</hi> and was, in that miſerable
Condition, by his Men proclaimed King of <hi>Spain;</hi> a
mighty Title, for ſo poor a Beginning; and yet here
began thoſe Victories, which, in the Space of 800
Years, recovered all <hi>Spain. Pelagius</hi> had a Siſter,
whoſe Name is not known; but <hi>Muza,</hi> Governor of
<hi>Gijon,</hi> in <hi>Aſturias,</hi> being taken with her Beauty, enjoy'd
her, upon Promiſe of Marriage. The Deſire of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
this Wrong firſt moved <hi>Pelagius</hi> to appear in
Arms: Thus it fell out, that as one Lady was the
Cauſe of the Deſtruction of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo another was the
Motive of its Reſtauration. <hi>Pelagius</hi> was the Son of
<hi>Favila</hi> Duke of <hi>Cantabria,</hi> Third Son of King <hi>Chinda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuindus,</hi>
and of his Wife D. <hi>Luz,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dofredus</hi>
Duke of <hi>Cordova,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Favila.</hi> He
was born at <hi>Toledo,</hi> and bred at <hi>Alcantara,</hi> by <hi>Grafes,</hi>
Brother to the Lady <hi>Luz,</hi> his Mother. This was the
firſt King that we find had the Title of <hi>Don</hi> annexed to
his Name. His Wife was, <hi>Gaudioſa,</hi> of <hi>Cantabria;</hi>
Fourth Grandchild to <hi>Ofilon,</hi> Brother to <hi>Stephen,</hi> the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54712:72"/>
happy Father of the Archbiſhop St. <hi>Ildefonſus.</hi> By her
he had <hi>Favila</hi> and <hi>Ermeſenda,</hi> who ſucceeded him in

And hence came the Title of Kings of <hi>Leon,</hi> and the

at the Foot of the Mountain <hi>Auſeva,</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> 737;
and lies buried in the Church of <hi>Covadonga,</hi> built by
himſelf, and his Wife, and dedicated to the Virgin
<hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>

not Time to perform any great Actions, being killed
in the Second Year of his Reign, by a Bear, as he was

and either had no Sons, or, at leaſt, they came

him, and took to Husband, and King, D. <hi>Alonſo,</hi> Son
to D. <hi>Peter,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cantabria,</hi> deſcended from <hi>Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redus</hi>
J. During the foregoing Years, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in
<hi>Portugal</hi> enjoyed full Liberty of Conſcience. Several
<hi>Mooriſh</hi> Great Men ruled over them: <hi>Aliboacen,</hi> Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to the General <hi>Tarif,</hi> was Lord of the City <hi>Coim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra,</hi>
and all the Territories betwixt the Rivers <hi>Alva-Mondego</hi>
and <hi>Agueda;</hi> governing with Tyrannical
Power. Thus the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> lived in Subjection,
when Heaven gave them Hopes of recovering their
Liberty. Happy was the Kingdom in falling to <hi>Erme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenda,</hi>
for that ſhe was the Mother of the Victorious

                     </hi>
and <hi>Tuy:</hi> Then paſſing over the River <hi>Minho,</hi> he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran
all the Country, as far as <hi>Duero;</hi> entring the Cities
and Towns of <hi>Braga, Porto, Agueda, Viſeo,</hi> and <hi>Chaves;</hi>
beſides other Places of Importance: No Quarter was
given to the <hi>Moors;</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were carried
away to <hi>Aſturias,</hi> he not deſigning to keep all he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This was the firſt King, after the Deſtruction of
<hi>Spain,</hi> that had any Juriſdiction in <hi>Portugal.</hi> Thus he
reigned,<note place="margin">757.</note> with great Honour, 17 Years; and died at
the Age of 64. His and his Wife's Bodies were buried
in the Church of <hi>Covadonga.</hi> He had Iſſue, <hi>Fruela,</hi> who
ſucceeded him; <hi>Wimaranus, Aurelius,</hi> and <hi>Adoſinda.</hi>
By a Slave he had <hi>Mauregatus,</hi> who proved more like

King Beſieged, and Hunger forced him to come out

Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the III. aboliſhed this Cuſtom,

                  <p>5. King <hi>Bermudo</hi> by an incomparable Act of Juſtice,
had taken the Crown from his own Children, to give

God to reward this rare Equity, ordained that <hi>Alonſo</hi>

when Count <hi>Nepocianus</hi> rebelled in <hi>Auſturias,</hi> and uſurped
the regal Title: The New King with all the ſpeed he
could, marched againſt him, and having defeated and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
him Priſoner, put out his Eyes and thruſt him into a
Monaſtery. Soon after he overthrew the <hi>Normans,</hi>
who deſtroyed the Coaſt of <hi>Galicia,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
who had laid Siege to <hi>Lisbon:</hi> Returning to the River
<hi>Duero,</hi> he vanquiſhed <hi>Mahomet Cid Atauf,</hi> Lord of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54712:75"/>
Fort and Town of <hi>Gaya,</hi> and alſo <hi>Muley Achim</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueda</hi>
more to the Southward. <hi>Zuleyma Ibon Muza,</hi> the
tributary King of <hi>Lamego,</hi> and <hi>Tarif Iben Rages</hi> of <hi>Viſeo</hi>
were admitted to grace upon their ſubmiſſion. <hi>Alha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
King of <hi>Coimbra,</hi> boldly ſtanding upon his Defence,
was overthrown, and all the Country reduced, which
done, <hi>Ramiro</hi> leaving good Garriſons in his Conqueſts,
returned to <hi>Oviedo;</hi> in his way, he viſited <hi>John</hi> the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of the Monaſtery of <hi>Lorvan,</hi> and beſtowed Lands
upon the Monaſtery. The principal part of the Gift
was the Town of <hi>Montemayor</hi> the Old, a ſtrong place,
the Garriſon whereof the Abbot was obliged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
In this Town was one <hi>Garcia Yannez,</hi> a foundling
brought up by the Abbot, and by him preferred for his
Valour. This Fellow envying the Honour of D. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudo</hi>
the Abbot's Nephew, and Governour of that Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory,
fled to <hi>Abderramen</hi> King of <hi>Cordova,</hi> offering
not only to renounce the Faith, but alſo to put into his
hands <hi>Montemayor,</hi> and the other Conqueſts of King
<hi>Ramiro.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Whilſt <hi>Garcia Yannez</hi> was with the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> King,
the Abbot and his Nephew <hi>Bermudo,</hi> took the two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
Counts <hi>Alderedus,</hi> whoſe Eyes he put out, and <hi>Pinelus</hi>
whom with his Seven Sons, he put to Death, as being
more obſtinate in their Crime. Knowing that <hi>Rages</hi>
of <hi>Viſeo</hi> was joyning in League with other <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
he aſſaulted his City, and raſed it to the
Ground. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> with the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot's
Conſent, afterwards repairing of it, is ſaid to have
found there the Tomb of <hi>Roderick,</hi> the laſt King of the
<hi>Goths. Garcia Yannez</hi> having renounced the Faith,
and calling himſelf <hi>Zulema,</hi> had the Command of an
Army given him to execute what he had propoſed.
He entred <hi>Portugal,</hi> committing greater <hi>Barbarites</hi> than
the Infidels, and laid Siege to <hi>Montemayor</hi> which
was bravely defended by the Abbot and his Men.
Hunger beginning to pinch, they thought of an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
more to be wondered at than imitated, which
was, that they ſlew all their Women and Children, the
Abbot beginning with his Siſter and Nephews. This
done, they ſallied out upon the Enemy with ſuch Fury,
that they ſoon put them to flight: The Rebel <hi>Zulema</hi>
was killed by the Abbot, many of his Men were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the River <hi>Mondego,</hi> and moſt of them periſhed by
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54712:75"/>
ſeveral means, ſo that few returned Home; 76000
were deſtroyed, and Night ſtopped the purſuit of the
Victors. Morning diſcovered the Fields covered not
only with dead Carcaſſes, but with plenty of rich Booty:
This was a ſmall comfort to them that had imbrued
their hands in the Blood of their Wives,<note place="margin">An incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble relation</note> Children and
Relations, but ſome that had haſted to the Town after
the Victory, brought back the News, that all thoſe
they had killed, were miraculouſly reſtored to life, and
ſo all returned joyful with the Victory and Recovery
of their Friends. The Abbot ſtayed in the place where
he obtained the Victory, and there Built a ſmall Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage,
and ended his days in Sanctity. His Monks
endeavoured it, but could not remove his Body, and
our firſt King <hi>D. Alonſo Enriquez</hi> Founded a Monaſtery
in that place, which was finiſhed by his Son and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
D. <hi>Sancho,</hi> and given to the <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> Order.
This is what related to <hi>Portugal</hi> in the Reign of King
<hi>Ramiro;</hi> he obtained many other Victories, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the memorable one, called of <hi>Clavijo,</hi> in which St.
<hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle is ſaid to have been ſeen fighting for
the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and was thence called the Patron of
<hi>Spain.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">850.</note> The King Married <hi>Paterna,</hi> whoſe extraction
is not known; he left the Crown to his Son <hi>Ordonno,</hi>
and died at <hi>Oviedo,</hi> where he lies Buried.</p>
                  <p>7. D. <hi>Ordono</hi> was no way inferior to his Father for
Valour,<note place="margin">King <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dono</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>builds ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Towns.</note> and being at full Age when he died, was very

the Cities of <hi>Leon, Aſtorga, Tuy, Amaya</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">855.</note>
almoſt left deſolate in the late Invaſions; this
done, he obtained two notable Victories, one over the
rebellious <hi>Vaſcones,</hi> and the other over <hi>Muza</hi> by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
a <hi>Goth,</hi> but turned <hi>Mahometan.</hi> This <hi>Muza</hi> had
poſſeſſed himſelf of the greateſt part of <hi>Spain,</hi> but was
entirely defeated by our King in the Plains of <hi>Alvelda</hi>
or <hi>Albayda,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">857.</note> two Leagues from <hi>Logronno.</hi> Many <hi>Moors</hi>

others ſtood to ſee the Conſequences of it. <hi>Mahomet</hi>
King of <hi>Cordova,</hi> alarmed at this ſucceſs of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
drew mighty ſuccours out of <hi>Africk,</hi> and with a
formidable Army began to conquer the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories.
<hi>Ordonno</hi> met him in <hi>Eſtremadura,</hi> near the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Tagus,</hi> and though he killed double the number
that he loſt, was forced to leave the Victory to the

                     <hi>Barbarian,</hi> who recovered much of what the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
had before taken. He took <hi>Santarem, Irena</hi> and <hi>Rotas;</hi>
then returning towards <hi>Cordova,</hi> he took and Fortified
many Towns betwixt the Rivers <hi>Guadiana</hi> and <hi>Tagus;</hi>
the next Year was not ſo favourable to him, for the beſt

after his Acceſſion to the Crown; his Valour
and other Vertues purchaſed him the Sir-name of <hi>the
Great,</hi> only attributed to him among all the Kings of
<hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon. Fruela Bermudez</hi> a great Man in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia</hi>
rebelled and came down ſo ſuddenly to <hi>Oviedo,</hi> that
the young King was forced to fly to <hi>Alava,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gathered his Forces, the Rebels put to death their
Leader, and ſubmitted themſelves to him: Then he
repaired the Cities of <hi>Oviedo</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> and built many
Caſtles. In the mean while Count <hi>Eylon</hi> rebelled in <hi>Alava,</hi>
but was oppreſſed by the King's Celerity: During this

of <hi>Cordova,</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> or <hi>Lope</hi> the Son of <hi>Muza</hi> King

and <hi>Alemandarin</hi> his Generals, the one into <hi>Biſcay,</hi>
the other into <hi>Galicia,</hi> where they made great havock,

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54712:76"/>
that he oppreſſed them both, before they
thought he had been moving towards them; this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
produced Peace, which he employed in rebuilding
ruined places, among which were <hi>Braga, Porto, Chaves</hi>
and <hi>Viſeo,</hi> all in <hi>Portugal.</hi> The King of <hi>Cordova</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>Viſeo,</hi> and had <hi>Coimbra</hi> yielded to him.</p>
                  <p>9. It appears, by a Grant of his to <hi>Siſenandus</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Compoſtela,</hi> that the Territories betwixt <hi>Duero</hi> and
<hi>Minho,</hi> and that called <hi>Tras os Montes,</hi> or <hi>Beyond the
Mountains,</hi> were Deſart, from the firſt coming of the

that <hi>Alboazar,</hi> a powerful <hi>Moor,</hi> had a moſt

his Galleys with the choiceſt of his Men; and running
up a River, near which ſhe was kept, he planted the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
all covered with Green, cloſe under certain Trees
that over-ſhaded the River: Then having laid an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh,
and ordered them to lie cloſe till he ſounded a
Cornet he carried with him, he in Diſguize approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Caſtle where the Queen was kept: There he
met a Maid belonging to the Queen, carrying a Pitcher
of Water for her; whereof, with the Maid's Conſent,
he drank, and dropped a Jewel into it well known to
the Queen. She ſeeing the Jewel, cauſed him to be
brought up to her; and having yielded her ſelf up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the Luſt of <hi>Alboazar,</hi> ſhe now betrayed the King

Leave only to ſound his Cornet; which being granted,
his Men that lay in Ambuſh broke into the Caſtle, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Alboazar,</hi> and carried away the Queen, whom the
King cauſed to be caſt into the Sea, with a Stone about
her Neck; becauſe, asking of her why ſhe looked ſo

preſerve in the Kingdom,<note place="margin">Count <hi>Froila</hi> a <hi>Portugues</hi> Rebels.</note> during his Minority, was
diſturbed by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Count <hi>Froila Vermuiz,</hi> who
took up Arms againſt the King. They came to a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in the Territory of <hi>Mafra,</hi> betwixt <hi>Villanueva</hi> and
<hi>Betancos,</hi> where <hi>Froila</hi> got the Victory. The King now
grown bigger, was much incenſed againſt Count <hi>Froila,</hi>
and his anger was increaſed by the inſinuations of Q.
<hi>Elvira,</hi> his Wife and Daughter to Count <hi>Mendo Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalez.
Froila</hi> being in diſgrace, had again recourſe to
Arms, which not a little troubled the King, and the
more for that at the ſame time, he received the News,
that another had rebelled in the City <hi>Oviedo.</hi> Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King haſted, leaving <hi>Froila</hi> till he was more at
leaſure: But he marched directly after the King, and
overtook him at ſuch time as he was ready to Aſſault
the City. The King was adviſed to forbear the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault,
leaſt in the heat of it, <hi>Froila</hi> ſhould fall upon him
behind,<note place="margin">His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</note> but he Anſwered, <hi>Let the Aſſault be carried on,
for the Count is ſo much a Gentleman, that he will not fall
upon the backs of his Enemies.</hi> As he ſaid, it fell out,
for <hi>Froila</hi> overcome by that Generoſity, joyned his
Forces to the King's, and ſo forwarded the attack that
the City was immediately carried. In this Action the
Count behaved himſelf ſo bravely, that he loſt both his
Eyes, at which the King was exceedingly grieved, and
beſtowed large poſſeſſions on him, in ſome meaſure to
recompenſe his loſs: About this time, Count <hi>Garcia Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez</hi>
of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> was killed in a Battle betwixt <hi>Alcozar</hi>
and <hi>Langra,</hi> having behaved himſelf with great Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54712:84"/>
he being one of the moſt notable Commanders
of that Age. His Son <hi>Sancho</hi> ſucceeded him as well in
his Courage, as Dominions, and often revenged his
Death upon the <hi>Moores.</hi> There being ſeveral preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to the Kingdom of <hi>Cordova,</hi> he ſeemingly ſided
with each of them to have the better opportunity to
ruin them all. The fugitive Count <hi>Vela,</hi> who uſed to
ſtir up the <hi>Moores</hi> againſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> was now dead,
and his Sons <hi>Roderick, James</hi> and <hi>Innigo</hi> were reſtored
to their Eſtates, and ſerved the Count as their natural
Lord. He the more to Honour them, made the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
God-father to his own Eldeſt Son D. <hi>Garcia,</hi> and
yet he afterwards behaved himſelf like a Traitor, as
his Father had done before.</p>
                  <p>6. The Diviſions among the <hi>Moores</hi> at <hi>Cordova,</hi> were
very advantagious to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Leon, Caſtile</hi> and
<hi>Portugal.</hi> Thoſe that had eſcaped the deſolation made
by <hi>Almanzor</hi> about <hi>Coimbra,</hi> dealt with the Infidels, and
bought Lands of them at a very low rate; it appears
by the original Deeds ſtill extant, that <hi>Oborez</hi> a <hi>Moore,</hi>
ſold the Town of <hi>Botam</hi> to <hi>Arias Prior</hi> of the Convent
of <hi>Botam</hi> for a Mare and her Fole;<note place="margin">1012.</note> either the Mare was
worth much, or the Town very little. Till the Year
1020,<note place="margin">1020.</note> we have no account of any thing remarkable in
<hi>Portugal.</hi> Out of it the King repaired the City <hi>Leon,</hi>
and gave it a Charter, and great Priviledges to all that
would come and inhabit there.<note place="margin">1026.</note> Six years after was
Born the renowned Captain <hi>Roderick de Bivar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Roderick de Bivar, <hi>commonly called</hi> Cid, <hi>his Birth.</hi>

whom mention will be made hereafter. The <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
affairs throughout <hi>Spain</hi> were in a flouriſhing condition;
the King entred <hi>Portugal,</hi> recovering many Towns in

there preſently, others that he was carried to <hi>Porto.</hi> His
death we ſhall hereafter ſee revenged as far as it could
be. His body was laid in a ſtately Tomb at <hi>Leon;</hi> he
lived Thirty Two Years, and Reigned Twenty Eight;
being bred in <hi>Galicia</hi> by Count <hi>Mendo Gonzalez,</hi> Lord
of <hi>Vierzo,</hi> he married his Daughter: By her he had
<hi>Bermudo</hi> his Succeſſor, and <hi>Sancha</hi> who afterwards came
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54712:85"/>
to be Queen; he had alſo a Baſtard Son, called <hi>Nunno
Alvarez de Amaya,</hi> or <hi>Roderick Anzures,</hi> Lieutenant of
<hi>Aſturias,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Gijon.</hi>

Years might produce ſome notable Diſorders in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
His extraordinary Abilities far above his
Years, ſoon dried up the Tears his ſubjects ſhed for his
Father, and made them rejoice in ſo unexpected a
Bleſſing. He was extreamly Religious and Devout,
and therefore applied himſelf to the re-eſtabliſhing of
many ruined Churches. Being of Age to Marry, he
took to Wife the Lady <hi>Ximena</hi> or <hi>Tereſa,</hi> younger
Daughter to Count <hi>Sancho,</hi> Lord of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> by whom
he had D. <hi>Alonſo,</hi> who lived but a few days. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
a match between his Siſter the Lady <hi>Sancha</hi> and

bore him Company to <hi>Leon</hi> to honour his Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
The next day after their Arrival, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
went out with the Biſhop to hear Maſs; in the
way, he was aſſaulted by the Sons of the traitor D. <hi>Vela,</hi>
before ſpoke of, and by them ſtabbed in ſeveral places,
his own God-father being the firſt that wounded him.
This News being carried to Court, the Bride forgetting
her Grandeur, ran out to the place, and pittifully la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
her loſs, it was thought ſhe would have given
up the Ghoſt upon the dead Body. She railed at the
Murderers, which Count <hi>Fernan Flavino</hi> hearing, had
the impudence to ſtrike her on the Face. The Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers

afterwards getting them into his power, burnt them
alive, declaring all their progeny for ever infamous.</p>

to a Battel in the Valley of <hi>Tamara,</hi> near <hi>Fromiſta,</hi>
where, after a bloody Fight, King <hi>Bermudo</hi> was killed,

                  <p>9. What I am about to relate, happen'd in the Reign
of King <hi>Bermudo;</hi> but in what Year, is not certain:
Two Grandſons of Prince <hi>Alboazar Ramirez,</hi> Son to
King <hi>Ramiro</hi> III, called <hi>Tedon</hi> and <hi>Roſendo,</hi> with a Body
of reſolute Men, broke into that part of the Country
that lies betwixt the Rivers <hi>Tavora</hi> and <hi>Duero.</hi> Having
drove the <hi>Moors</hi> thence,<note place="margin">A Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> againſt the <hi>Moors.</hi>
                     </note> they began to Till the Land;
and knowing well that the <hi>Infidels</hi> would not ſuffer
them quietly to reſt there, they fortified themſelves on
a Rock, over the River <hi>Tavora;</hi> which running round
great part of it, makes it a ſort of <hi>Peninſula;</hi> which,
with the Steepneſs of the Rock it ſelf, renders it inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
any Way but one. Here they built their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and hence infeſted the Country of the <hi>Moors.</hi> At
length, on <hi>Midſummer-Day,</hi> which is much reverenced
even by thoſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> in Honour of St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi>
the <hi>Moors</hi> of the Town of <hi>Paredes</hi> reſorted, in great
Numbers, to ſport and divert themſelves on the Banks
of the River, and to bathe themſelves in it. D. <hi>Roſendo</hi>
cloathing his Men in <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Apparel, paſſed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
out of ſight, and lay cloſe in Ambuſh till he ſaw
all the Banks covered with the <hi>Barbarians:</hi> Then, by
degrees, coming out, as if he had been ſome of their
own Company, he ſuffered his Men to mix with the
Enemy, who took them for Friends. Being all mixed,
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> fell upon them, and turned their Pleaſure
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54712:86"/>
into Sorrow: However, many ſtood, and made a good
Defence; and others coming to their Aid, the Succeſs
was doubtful, till D. <hi>Tedon,</hi> fording the River, with his
Men, ended the Diſpute, with the Slaughter of moſt of
the <hi>Moors.</hi> This, and other Victories, put the two
Brothers in Poſſeſſion of many Lands in that Country:
And in Memory of the Action, they took to themſelves
the Name of the River, which ſtill continues in the
Family of the <hi>Tavora's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. The Fame of the Exploits of D. <hi>Tedon,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
that upon the River, together with that of the
Comlineſs of his Perſon, reaching the Ears of <hi>Ardinga,</hi>
the beautiful Daughter of <hi>Aliboazen</hi> King of <hi>Lamego,</hi>
ſhe fell in Love with him by Hear-ſay.<note place="margin">The Effects of Love.</note> Love perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her to quit her Father's Palace, and, diſguiſed in
the Habit of a Man, through bye Ways, ſhe found out
the Abbot <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> a ſolitary Hermit. She told him
who ſhe was, and the Cauſe of her Coming; and he
baptized her, promiſing to perſwade D. <hi>Tedon</hi> to take
her to Wife. This took not effect, for her Father
cloſely purſuing her, overtook, and put her to death.
<hi>Tedon</hi> hearing of her Love, had promiſed to marry her,
and ſhe being dead, would take no other Wife; but
was afterwards killed by the <hi>Moors,</hi> near a ſmall Brook,
which, of him, was called <hi>Tedo:</hi> So he took his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
from one River, and gave his Name to another.
There being nothing elſe remarkable, recorded in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
during the Reign of King <hi>Bermudo,</hi> and he being
the laſt King thereof of that Name, I muſt not omit to
remark, that <hi>Bermudo</hi> is the ſame Name with <hi>Veremun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Veremundo;</hi> ſo that, to
make it <hi>Bermudo,</hi> there is, corruptly, an <hi>e</hi> and an <hi>n</hi>
omitted; and to uſe <hi>B</hi> for <hi>V,</hi> is common in <hi>Spaniſh.</hi>
Thus <hi>Bermudo</hi> and <hi>Veremundus</hi> appear to be the ſame
Name.</p>

offered the Monks to take what they pleaſed, in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
for their Intelligence and Supplies; but they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly
begged only a Church in the City: However,
he gave them many rich Gifts, and confirmed all the
former Grants made by his Anceſtors. In token of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
the Monks preſented the King with a Golden
Crown, which Count <hi>Gonzalo Moniz,</hi> Governor of the
Province between <hi>Duero</hi> and <hi>Minho,</hi> had offered to their
Church: The King reſtored it, with 10 Marks of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
to make a Croſs. <hi>Roderick de Bivar,</hi> Surnamed <hi>Cid,</hi>
that famous Captain, was at this Siege, and Knighted
by the King, in this City. Here was alſo the renowned
<hi>Portugueſe, Roderick Frojas,</hi> Contemporary, and not much
inferiour to the other for Warlike Exploits.</p>
                  <p>3. The King returning to <hi>Leon,</hi> left <hi>Siſnandus,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

War upon <hi>Abudad,</hi> a reſolute and powerful <hi>Moor,</hi> who

None of them was ſatisfied. <hi>Sancho,</hi> the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,

<hi>Sancho</hi> ſhould think he had Right to his Dominions.
<hi>Garcia</hi> was the youngeſt, and therefore the laſt in the
Diſtribution: But he proved the firſt that took up Arms

others along the River <hi>Duero,</hi> which he would have to

in taking the Field, not to defend his Siſters, but
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54712:88"/>
to ſtrip them all. King <hi>Sancho,</hi> before he undertook
this Enterprize, asked the Advice of all his Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
who unanimouſly diſſwaded him from the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
for fear of incurring his Father's Curſes.
However, finding him not to be moved, they counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him to continue in Amity with King <hi>Alonſo,</hi> and
ask Leave of him to paſs through the Kingdom of <hi>Leon,</hi>
into <hi>Portugal.</hi> To this purpoſe he met his Brother <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonſo,</hi>
at the Monaſtery of <hi>Sahagun;</hi> but could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail

Our King <hi>Garcia,</hi> taken up with his own ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

of his Brothers. What was yet worſe, his Subjects
were diſcontented, for that he made Account of none
but his Favourite <hi>Verna,</hi> by whoſe Advice he began the
War of <hi>Toro</hi> unſucceſsfully.</p>
                  <p>5. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Nobility and Gentry conſulted

and it was reſolved, that D. <hi>Roderick Frojas,</hi> a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Man in thoſe Days, ſhould diſcourſe the King upon
that Matter. When he had made a long Harangue
upon the Subject, all the Anſwer the King made, was,
to turn his Back upon him, and go away. D. <hi>Roderick</hi>
ſeeing how little his Words had prevailed, ſoon after
killed <hi>Verna</hi> in the Palace. The Death of <hi>Verna</hi> troubled
not the King ſo much, as the News that King <hi>Sancho</hi>
was marching againſt him, and the ſmall Confidence
he had in his Subjects, eſpecially for the Brothers of that
D. <hi>Roderick</hi> conſpired together to oppoſe his puniſhing
the ſaid D. <hi>Roderick.</hi> Neceſſity obliged the King to
wink at Offences, and ſend for D. <hi>Roderick,</hi> who was

                     </note> but D. <hi>Roderick

them, killing 600, among whom were many

received many Wounds.</p>
                  <p>6. King <hi>Garcia</hi> was gone to <hi>Santarem,</hi> when King
<hi>Sancho,</hi> to revenge the former Loſs, pierced through
<hi>Portugal,</hi> with a numerous Army. Some adviſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract

Frojaz,</hi> now recovered of his Wounds, was poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
for Fighting. A Plain, not far from <hi>Santarem,</hi>
was choſe for that Purpoſe; where was fought as bloody
a Battel as has been ſeen in any Age. The greateſt Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was,<note place="margin">King <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws his Brother <hi>Garcia</hi> and takes him Priſoner.</note> when the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſtrove to gain the Standard

to defend it; and being unhorſed by D. <hi>Egas Gomez de
Souſa,</hi> was taken Priſoner by D. <hi>Roderick Frojaz,</hi> who
delivered him up to King <hi>Garcia.</hi> No ſooner had he
delivered his Priſoner, but he fell down dead of the
Wounds he had before received. King <hi>Garcia</hi> put his
Brother into the Cuſtody of certain Gentlemen, whilſt
he purſued the flying Enemy: But King <hi>Sancho</hi> making
his Eſcape from them, made his Way to join <hi>Roderick
Diaz de Bivar,</hi> called <hi>Cid,</hi> who was then coming up
with freſh Troops, that had not been engaged: Theſe
charging the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> before tired, and now diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Purſuit, changed the Fortune of the Day:
However, the Fight, thus renewed, laſted till Night.
D. <hi>Peter</hi> and D. <hi>Vermui,</hi> Brothers to D. <hi>Roderick Frojas,</hi>
were killed, and King <hi>Garcia</hi> was taken by his Brother,
who not long before had been his Priſoner, and who
now knew better how to ſecure him than he had been
kept himſelf. Thus the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> recovered the Day,
and the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> before victorious, were put to the
Rout. King <hi>Garcia</hi> continued in Priſon 10 Years,
when he was releaſed by Death. There are Authors
who write, that King <hi>Sancho</hi> enlarged his Brother <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
contenting himſelf that he ſhould be Tributary to
him; and that D. <hi>Alonſo,</hi> Brother to both, returned
him to Priſon, in the Caſtle of <hi>Luna,</hi> where he died,
with Irons on his Legs: With thoſe very Fetters, at his
own Requeſt, he was buried in the Church of St. <hi>Iſido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>

                  </p>

for ſome time, with various Succeſs, till at length
King <hi>Alonſo,</hi> overthrown, was taken Priſoner. To
deliver himſelf from that Miſery, he retired to <hi>Sahagun,</hi>
pretending to become a Religious Man. Soon after,
finding a fit Opportunity,<note place="margin">1072.</note> by the Advice of Count <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>1. <hi>HEnry</hi> the firſt Founder of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
is by all Men allowed to have been of
noble Extraction; but others very much differ both as
to his Country and Family. As to his Family, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
D. <hi>Roderick Sanchez,</hi> and D. <hi>Alonſo de Cartagena</hi>
ſay, he was of the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> but do not name
his Parents. <hi>Duarte Galvan,</hi> our Antient Chronologer,
affirms, He was ſecond Son to a King of <hi>Hungary,</hi>
which Opinion the famous Poet <hi>Camoens,</hi> in his <hi>Luſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads</hi>
follows: <hi>Damianus de Goes,</hi> in the life of King <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>
ſays, he was Son to <hi>William</hi> Baron of <hi>Joinville,</hi>
and Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and <hi>Abida</hi> of <hi>Champagne. James
de Valera,</hi> and <hi>Antony Beuter,</hi> bring him from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:54712:91"/>
grounding their Opinion upon the Hiſtory of
<hi>Spain,</hi> writ by King <hi>Alonſo,</hi> miſtaking a Quotation of
the Archbiſhop D. <hi>Roderick,</hi> who Writes that he was
of the <hi>Biſontine</hi> Province, meaning <hi>Beſancon,</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
of the Dukedom of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which they take
for <hi>Biſantium</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople. Wolfangus Lazius</hi> writes
he was of <hi>Limburg; Duarte Nunnez de Leon</hi> endeavours
to prove he was Grandſon to <hi>Reginald</hi> Earl of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
by his Son <hi>Guido</hi> Earl of <hi>Verneuille</hi> in <hi>Normandy. Lewis
Gollut</hi> in his Hiſtory of that Earldom, ſays, he was Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Raimund,</hi> both Sons to Earl <hi>William:</hi> All theſe
doubts are cleared by the Antient Manuſcript of <hi>Fleury,</hi>
which being a fragment of <hi>French</hi> Hiſtory, was writ in
the time of our Count <hi>Henry,</hi> for the Author of it brings
himſelf as an Eye Witneſs of the three Suns that were
ſeen at the Town of <hi>Scyrs,</hi> on the Banks of the River
<hi>Garonne,</hi> in the Year 1108. It was writ by a famous
Benedictin Monk of that Convent, and reaches from
the Year 897, till the Year 1110. <hi>Petrus Piteus</hi> a
learned Man, publiſhed it with other like Manuſcripts,
and it was Printed at <hi>Francfort</hi> in the Year 1596. By
this Antient Manuſcript it appears, that <hi>Robert</hi> the firſt
Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> younger Brother to King <hi>Henry</hi> I. of
<hi>France,</hi> had by his Wife <hi>Hermengarda,</hi> one onely Son
called <hi>Henry,</hi> who died before his Father, leaving five
Sons by his Wife <hi>Sibila,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Reginald</hi> Earl of
<hi>Burgundy:</hi> Theſe were <hi>Hugo,</hi> who was heir to his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
but being left a Widdower without Children,
became a Monk of <hi>Cluni,</hi> and ſo died in the Year
1092. <hi>Eudo</hi> or <hi>Odoa,</hi> who ſucceeded his Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Robert Biſhop of <hi>Langres, Henry</hi> our Earl, and
<hi>Reginald</hi> an Abbot; many other Authors too long to
inſert, have hinted that he was of the Houſe of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
tho' perhaps none ſpecified it ſo particularly. His
Family once allowed to be that of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> it will need
no further proofs to ſhew his Country; beſides, that it
is more likely he ſhould come out of <hi>France,</hi> which
joyns with <hi>Spain,</hi> than from <hi>Hungary</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
ſo remote. It is alſo a ſufficient proof of his Country,
that all his followers were <hi>French,</hi> which could not have
been, were he a ſtranger to them.</p>
                  <p>2. <q>The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſtrive to clear two points for their
Honour,<note place="margin">A remark upon ſome Conceits of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Authors.</note> in which there is great difficulty, or rather
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54712:91"/>
an impoſibility, for that all arguments are againſt
them; the one is to make out, that the Sovereignty of
<hi>Portugal</hi> was granted to Count <hi>Henry</hi> without any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
to <hi>Caſtile;</hi> the other that <hi>Tereſa</hi> was
lawful Daughter to King <hi>Alonſo.</hi> The Arguments for
the firſt, are, That no Records are to be found in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi>
or <hi>Leon,</hi> to prove the Title to ſuch acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that their King <hi>Alonſo</hi> the firſt, was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
King by Chriſt himſelf, and therefore owed his
Crown to him. Theſe proofs are meerly Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
for as to the firſt, whether ſuch Record remains
or not, it is not credible that a King would alienate a
Kingdom to a Baſtard Daughter, ſo as to reſerve no
Sovereignty to himſelf, nor if he had, is it in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of a Prince to give away the right of a Legitimate
Succeſſor to one Illegitimate? The ſecond inſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Chriſt giving a right to the Crown, ſeems ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
a Notion, that as it carries no proof, it
needs no Confutation. The other point inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is the Legitimacy of <hi>Tereſa</hi> the Counts Wife, but
that has been ſpoke of already; no Author of Note has
named her otherwiſe than an unlawfully begotten,
and the computation of the time her Father was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to, and lived with his ſix Wives, makes it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to allow of a Seventh. There is another
doubt about Earl <hi>Henry</hi>'s going to the Holy Land,
which ſome <hi>Pertugueſe</hi> Authors inſiſt upon without any
ſufficient Grounds, or rather without any probability;
but whether he did or not, is not eaſy to decide, nor
worth the diſcuſſing; let us go on to his Life, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the ſmall fragments that remain of it, as of all
other things before his time, but we begin now by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to come into days of more light.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. By what has been ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Count</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>of</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy.</note> it appears that Earl <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
was a <hi>Burgundian,</hi> the Son of <hi>Henry,</hi> Son to <hi>Robert</hi> the
firſt Duke of that Country, and <hi>Hermengarda</hi> Daughter
to Count <hi>Reinald</hi> of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> There he was Born in
the Year 1035. being deſcended by the Fathers ſide of
the Royal Family of <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> and by his Mother
from the Earls of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> The cauſe that moved
<hi>Henry</hi> to paſs over into <hi>Spain,</hi> was the deſire of Glory
to be purchaſed in the continual Wars, betwixt the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> and the <hi>Moors.</hi> Authors do not agree about
the time of his coming, but it appears by Ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54712:92"/>
that he Governed <hi>Portugal</hi> in the Year 1073,<note place="margin">His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </note>
ſo that he muſt have been in <hi>Caſtile</hi> when King <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
died, and when the fame of <hi>Roderick de Bivar</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits,<note place="margin">1067.</note>
incited ſtrangers to come from Foreign Parts to
imitate his Actions. <hi>Roderick</hi> was then near Fifty Years
of Age, and <hi>Henry</hi> about Forty: The Author of the
Manuſcript above mentioned, ſays, That ſuccours
were ſent out of <hi>France</hi> to King <hi>Alonſo,</hi> at his requeſt to
King <hi>Philip</hi> I. being then preſſed with the War made
by the <hi>Almoravides.</hi> It is likely that <hi>Henry</hi> came with
the Command of theſe Troops, and having gained
eſteem, had the Government of the Province between
the Rivers <hi>Duero</hi> and <hi>Minho</hi> committed to him, other
great Men governing the others at the ſame time. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the death of King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who divided his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
among his three Sons, <hi>Sancho</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken <hi>Portugal</hi> from his Brother <hi>Garcia,</hi> and <hi>Leon</hi>
from <hi>Alonſo</hi> his other Brother, obliged him to fly for
ſafety to the <hi>Moors.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1071.</note> 
                     <hi>Henry</hi> accompanied him in all
misfortunes, till <hi>Sancho</hi> being killed, <hi>Alonſo</hi> was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſtored to his own, but ſeated in the Thrones of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi>
and <hi>Portugal.</hi>

more than Man, concluded that <hi>Henry</hi> was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy
among mortals, and therefore from that time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſuit his reward to his Fidelity.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Beatrix</hi> the ſecond Wife of King <hi>Alonſo</hi> dying,<note place="margin">1076.</note>
a match was agreed for him with the Lady <hi>Conſtance,</hi>

Aunt to Earl <hi>Henry,</hi> and he was ſent to <hi>France</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
her into <hi>Spain.</hi> With him went <hi>Raymund</hi> Earl of
<hi>Toulouſe,</hi> and with them both came <hi>Raymund</hi> Earl of
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> which is the reaſon ſome Authors write they
came all together; whereas the other two had been long
before in <hi>Spain.</hi> Thus <hi>Henry</hi> became great at Court,
the King being his Friend, and the Queen his Aunt,
which his power he uſed with ſuch moderation, that he
was beloved by all Men.<note place="margin">1081.</note> He accompanied King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonſo</hi>
at the memorable Seige, and taking of <hi>Toledo,</hi> as
alſo at the Battle of <hi>Sagulias</hi> near <hi>Badajoz,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1087.</note> where the
King was overthrown.<note place="margin">1090.</note> To reward all theſe Services,
the King at laſt gave him to Wife his Baſtard Daughter
<hi>Tereſa,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He takes to Wife <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Daughter to <hi>Alonſo,</hi> and has in Dower the City <hi>Porto</hi> and its Territory.</note> whom he had by the Lady <hi>Ximena Nunnez de

then the beſt part of what was gained in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
giving him leave to retire thither, and live with
his Wife: His Age was the cauſe that he died, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Tereſa</hi> young to marry a ſecond Husband, which
much diſturbed the publick Peace. Soon after the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes joining in League to conquer the
Holy Land, Earl <hi>Henry</hi> was choſen General of the
Forces ſent by King <hi>Alonſo,</hi> in which employ he gained
great Honour. He returned from this Expedition to
<hi>Toledo,</hi> where the Court of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was then kept in the
Year 1099. King <hi>Alonſo</hi> at this time being of a great
Age, ſent his Son Prince <hi>Sancho,</hi> being but Twelve
Years of Age, under the direction of D. <hi>Garcia</hi> Count of
<hi>Cabra,</hi> with an Army to oppoſe <hi>Almanzor</hi> the <hi>Moor.</hi>
With them went many Perſons of Quality, among
which the chief was Earl <hi>Henry;</hi> they came to a Battle
in the Plains of <hi>Veles,</hi> where the Prince was unhorſed
and killed,<note place="margin">1100.</note> though <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Garcia</hi> expoſed themſelves
to ſave him.<note place="margin">Overthrows the Infidels and takes <hi>Almanzor</hi> priſoner.</note> Earl <hi>Henry</hi> meditating Revenge, met <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor</hi>
again in the Field, whom he diſmounted and
took Priſoner, delivering him to <hi>James Ordonnez</hi> for
to carry him to the King; this done, <hi>Henry</hi> broke
through the Infidels, putting them to flight, with a
mighty ſlaughter.</p>
                  <p>5. As it is doubtful whether <hi>Henry</hi> went to <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
with the other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, ſo is it alſo, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was preſent at the taking of <hi>Lisbon, Santarem,
Sintra,</hi> and other ſtrong places by King <hi>Alonſo,</hi> but that
he was at theſe latter Expeditions as moſt properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to him is moſt likely.<note place="margin">For his good ſervices he receives o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonſo.</hi>
                     </note> But his great Age re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
ſome reſt, the King at laſt gave him leave to
retire to <hi>Portugal,</hi> giving to him for himſelf and his
Heirs, all that was conquered there, which was the
Cities <hi>Coimbra</hi> and <hi>Viſeo,</hi> and the three Provinces; that
betwixt the Rivers <hi>Duero</hi> and <hi>Minho, Beira,</hi> and <hi>Tras
os Montes,</hi> with that part of <hi>Galicia</hi> as far as the Caſtle
<hi>Lobeira,</hi> and leave to conquer as far as <hi>Algarve.</hi> Earl
<hi>Henry</hi> ſettled his reſidence at <hi>Guimaraens,</hi> taking the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Earl of <hi>Portugal;</hi> The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> encouraged by
the preſence of a Prince of their own, did much upon
the borders of the Province betwixt the Rivers <hi>Duero</hi>
and <hi>Minho,</hi> till then not entirely ſubdued, but we have
no particular account of their Actions. <hi>Hecha Martin</hi>
King of <hi>Lamego,</hi> being a tributary to <hi>Henry</hi> rebelled;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54712:93"/>
and drawing together a powerful Army, did much
hurt in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Territories. The Earl with <hi>Egas
Moniz,</hi> a Gentleman then famous, and afterward Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to King <hi>Alonſo,</hi> marched to recover the Booty he
had taken, and overtook him in a Valley near the
Monaſtery of <hi>Arouca.</hi> The <hi>Moor</hi> for greater ſecurity,
in caſe of any misfortune, placed his Wife Queen <hi>Axa
Anzures,</hi> and all the Prey on the top of a Mountain
he thought unacceſſible, called <hi>Sierra Seca.</hi> The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>

in Execution, and after a bloody Fight, the Queen was

<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the Earl beſtowed the City <hi>Lamego</hi> upon
them, they paying tribute for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>6. The <hi>Moores</hi> rebelling againſt their King for chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Earl <hi>Henry</hi> marched to their relief, and coming to a
Battle, overthrew the Infidels with a great Slaughter.
<hi>Cintra</hi> and other places revolted and were overcome,
but riſing again, they could not eaſily be ſubdued:
Whilſt our Earl was diverted in the Wars of <hi>Galicia</hi> and
<hi>Leon,</hi> where he took ſome Towns, <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of the
<hi>Arabs</hi> taking the opportunity, laid Siege to <hi>Santarem,</hi>
whither our Forces haſting to relieve the place, were

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54712:93"/>
that King <hi>Alonſo</hi> was glad to abandon that City upon
promiſe to relieve it in four Months. He overthrew

with all its Territory was loſt: The death of Earl
<hi>Henry</hi> was much lamented of his Subjects, for that he
was a Prince of extraordinary Piety, Valour, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity.
He overthrew the <hi>Moors</hi> in Seventeen ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Here Prince <hi>Alonſo</hi> viſiting them, enlarged the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture

and reduced ſeveral who lived an Eremitical Life in the

Monks thus increaſing, he founded another Monaſtery
called St. <hi>Chriſtopher de Lafoens.</hi> Both theſe Churches
were afterwards Conſecrated, and great Gifts offered in

                  <p>2. Prince <hi>Alonſo</hi> having now weilded a Sword long

thinking there was none about him great enough to
Confer that Honour on him, by putting on his Armour,
and girding on his Sword, as was then the Cuſtom; he
laid the Arms upon an Altar, and taking them thence,
put them on himſelf, ſo taking the Honour at his own
hands. Prince <hi>Alonſo</hi>'s Mother being about to marry
the ſecond time, it bred ſuch Animoſities betwixt them,
that they finally came to Battle near the Town of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maraens;</hi>

the Mother overthrown, fled to the Caſtle of

                     <note place="margin">He beſieges his Mother, takes and puts her into Irons.</note> which is hard by, and was there Beſieged by

to her relief with a powerful Army. The <hi>Portugueſe

This done, the young Prince returns to the Siege of the

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54712:95"/>
into Irons. She provoked at this diſ-reſpect, as her
Bolts were put on, prayed to God that his Legs might
be broke, and her Prayers were heard as will appear
hereafter.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Alonſo</hi> now grown abſolute,<note place="margin">Being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by King <hi>Alonſo</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> he Articles for his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and breaks his Faith.</note> and having provoked
the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> by the late overthrow given him, to
revenge the Affront, that King marched with a Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Army, and beſieged Prince <hi>Alonſo</hi> in the Town of
<hi>Guimaraens.</hi> There being no hope of relief, nor poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of holding out, <hi>Egas Muniz</hi> was ſent out by the
Prince to treat of ſome accommodation with the King,
which Buſineſs he managed ſo Dexterouſly, that the
King upon Promiſe and Articles, that Prince <hi>Alonſo</hi>
ſhould hold that Country of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and do him homage
for the ſame in a certain time prefixed, raiſed his Siege
and departed. Prince <hi>Alonſo</hi> delivered of that danger,
thought of nothing leſs than performing the Articles
agreed upon. <hi>Portegueſe</hi> Authors will have it, that <hi>Egas
Muniz,</hi> who managed this Treaty, becauſe it was not
performed, preſented himſelf to the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
with a Halter about his Neck, for him to puniſh that
breach of Faith, and was pardoned by the King. But
this is as Romantick as what our Authors writes, that
the whole treaty was concluded without the privity of
Prince <hi>Alonſo,</hi> as if the King could be ſo infatuated to
treat with a private Man ſtolen out of a Town, where
his Prince was cloſely Beſieged, without ſeeing his
Commiſſion, or to conclude Articles, and depart upon
his bare word without the Ratification of the principal
Points. Theſe Chimerical Notions are better paſſed

have covered all the plains about the City, with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

raging among his Troops, forced him to break up and
depart much weaker than he came. Our Prince thus
delivered, entred the Territory of <hi>Leyria,</hi> which place,
tho' ſtrong, he took by Eſcalade, putting moſt of the
Defendants to the Sword. This being the firſt of his

Our Prince paſſed that River, and made great
Havock in the Territories of thoſe Infidels; <hi>Iſmael</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
twenty petty Princes, ſubject to five little Kings
who were all under his Dominion. Each of thoſe Kings
led 80000 Men, wherewith they covered all the plains.
With our Authors leave it is wholly incredible, <q>That
ſuch inconſiderable Princes, as they muſt be, whoſe
Dominions extended not to above half the limits of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> ſhould raiſe ſo prodigious a Multitude, for
it amounts to no leſs than 480000. This may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be added to gain the greater Reputation to thoſe
ſtrange miracles he talks of in the Sequel.</q> The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
were not above 13000, and thoſe wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed
(as well they might) at the ſight of ſuch an
Army as they could not be capable to number. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
Prince <hi>Alonſo</hi> repoſing his confidence in God,
ceaſed not to encourage and animate his fainting Forces.
They encouraged with his undaunted Contenance, and
reſolute Expreſſions, took heart and offered their ready
ſervice: It was then Night when the Prince retiring to
reſt, read the Hiſtory of <hi>Gideon</hi> and fell aſleep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a
Dream there appeared to him a venerable Old Man,
promiſing him Victory, and being awakened, was told
there was ſuch an one preſſed to ſpeak with him; being
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54712:96"/>
admitted, he found it was the ſame Man he ſaw in his
Dream, and that he came to give him the ſame aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.
At break of day he went out of his Tent, and
looking towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> ſaw a mighty Brightneſs, in
the midſt of which appeared our Saviour on the Croſs
ſurrounded with Angels, who promiſed him Victory
over the Infidels, and commanded him to accept the
Title of King, if offered to him by his Army. Soon
after the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> flocked about him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Alonſo</hi> ſaluted King.</note> demanding the
ſignal of Battle, and unanimouſly ſaluted him King.
He at firſt ſeemed to refuſe that Title, but it being the
conſequence of the Viſion he had ſeen, ſoon admitted it:
<q>Let every one give that credit to this ſtrange relation
he ſhall think fit, I have briefly ſet it down, that I
might not wholly cut off ſo extraordinary a paſſage in
my Author; yet would I not extend it to that length
as he has done, becauſe I believe moſt Men will give
as little credit to it as I do.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Alonſo</hi> thus encouraged, drew up his Army into
four Bodies, the Enemy making twelve: The charge was
ſeconded by a moſt hideous cry raiſed by both Armies,<note place="margin">The Battle of <hi>Ouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que.</hi>
                     </note>
an incredible clattering of Weapons, and ſuch ſhowers
of Darts and Arrows, as ſeemed to darken the light of
the Sun. No <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſought to ſave himſelf, all their
ſtudy was to kill; the King encouraged all Men by his
example, and every Man ſought to out-do another.
Six hours the fight laſted, in which time the plain of
<hi>Ourique,</hi> where they engaged was all covered with dead
Bodies, which almoſt floated in a Pool of Blood. At
length the Victory fell to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and was one of
the greateſt ever obtained againſt Infidels.<note place="margin">Reflections vpon this Battle.</note> 
                     <q>It is very
hard to reconcile the account of this Battle to any
thing of probability; for whereas the Author ſays but
a little before, there were five leſſer Kings and one So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
of them all, with each 80000 Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to 480000; now he ſays, they were above
600000. Doubtleſs there muſt be willful miſtakes
in theſe Numbers to magnifie the Action, which would
ſeem great if not rendred incredible; Beſides he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
ſix Kings which are thoſe of <hi>Silves, Merida, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
Badajoz, Lisbon,</hi> and <hi>Algezira,</hi> whereas all other
Authors agree they were but five, and give that for
the reaſon that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Arms contain five ſmall
Scutcheons within the great one; nor is it any excuſe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54712:96"/>
to ſay, there were five Kings ſubject to one that was
ſupream over them, for the principal could not be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Number, and if he was not, than the others
muſt be but four. Another reaſon makes me incline
not to credit this Story, which is, that we ſee the King's
of <hi>Caſtile, Aragon,</hi> and <hi>Navarre</hi> have often joyned
their Forces to oppoſe a much leſs power than is here
ſpoke of, and it is not credible that ſuch a Multitude
could be now amaſſed on a ſudden without their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or much leſs that they knowing of it, ſhould
make no proviſion to oppoſe that Torrent. Nor was
there ever ſuch a number of <hi>Moors</hi> in one body heard
of from their firſt invading <hi>Spain,</hi> till their laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion.
In fine, I cannot be reconciled to this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
Story, and could ſhow many other reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, but look upon it as needleſs, this being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a project to gain credit to the Miracles pretended
for the founding of that Kingdom, which ſerve only
to cover its revolt at that time from the Crown of
<hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon.</hi> I will inſiſt no more upon it, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the courſe of the Hiſtory.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Iſmael</hi> provoked with this loſs, and deſiring revenge,
battered the City <hi>Leyria,</hi> which he took, putting all
the Defendants to the Sword, except D. <hi>Pelayo Guter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi>
the Governor, whom he kept Priſoner. He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
this place to ſtrongly, that King <hi>Alonſo</hi> found
much difficulty to recover it, but at length drove the
<hi>Moors</hi> out of all that Territory. King <hi>Alonſo</hi> VII. of
<hi>Caſtile</hi> ſeeing that erected into a Monarchy, which but
a little before was only the Portion of his predeceſſors
Baſtard Daughter, thought it convenient in time to pull
down that riſing greatneſs before it was too powerfully

<hi>Santarem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1144.</note> with his often Excurſions, had highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
King <hi>Alonſo,</hi> who long meditated how to ſurprize
that place. At length being at <hi>Coimbra,</hi> he took only
four men of Quality with him into a Field, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conſulted with them of the method of putting their
deſign in Execution,<note place="margin">The taking of <hi>Santa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</hi>
                     </note> he charged them upon pain of
death, not to reveal to any Man what they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
about. As they returned home along the
Banks of the River <hi>Mondego,</hi> an Old Woman ſaid to
others that were with her ſo loud, that the King and his
company heard it; <q>Do you know what the King and
Noblemen have been about? They are conſulting how

                     </q> the King hearing this, ſaid to thoſe
Gentlemen, if any one of you had gone a ſtep from me
before I heard that Old Woman, I would have cut of
his head. So hard a matter is it for a Secret to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.
The King being reſolved to gain that ſtrong
Town,<note place="margin">1145.</note> made a vow if he ſucceeded to build a ſtately
Monaſtery at <hi>Alcobaza,</hi> and endow it with all the Land
he could ſee at the time of making the Vow. At the

Scaled the Walls before they were diſcovered, and then

was. During 6 or 7 days, he inceſſantly Battered the
Town, and gave ſeveral aſſaults to it, ſo that many of
the Defendants were killed, the Prince wounded, and
the Walls ſhaken. At this time King <hi>Alonſo</hi> being 91
years of Age, came to relieve the Town, but ſcarce
had the occaſion to draw his Sword, the Infidels flying
precipitouſly at the very ſight of him. Both the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>9. The moſt glorious King <hi>Alonſo</hi> having Governed
17 Years without the Title of King, and 46 with it,

that advanced to the Walls of <hi>Sevil.</hi> His Father King

followed by a multitude of People; in this manner
they proceed to the great Church, where the Sheriff
having made a ſhort Speech, declaring the King's death,
and their great loſs, he lets fall the Buckler from his
head upon the Stones, and breaks it to pieces, at which
the People raiſe a hideous lamentation. Then they go
to the Mint, and ſo to the great Hoſpital, at both which

they return to the great Church and hear Maſs. The

Our King returning with ſpeed, utterly diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted
thoſe Barbarians, ſo that they never again at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
any thing there. Nor did he deſiſt till he
had <hi>Juremenha,</hi>

                     <hi>Serpa,</hi> and other Caſtles, which had
often been gained, and again fallen into the Enemies
hands. For four Years there was nothing of Action,
but in the Year 1230,<note place="margin">1230.</note> he made War on the <hi>Moors,</hi> in
the Province of <hi>Alentejo.</hi> The following year he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
into <hi>Algarve,</hi> to recover what his Grand-father
had conquered there, and was now again fallen into the
hands of the Infidels.<note place="margin">1232.</note> Some places he re-took, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
the Churches, and placed therein Evangelical
Paſtors.<note place="margin">1235.</note> After this, by his Commanders, the chief
whereof was <hi>Payo Perez Correa,</hi> he took <hi>Aljuſtrel</hi> which
he gave to the Military Order of <hi>Santiago;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1239.</note> then the
Towns of <hi>Mergola,</hi> and <hi>Alfajar de Penna,</hi> which alſo
he beſtowed on the ſame Order. Of late Years the
inſolencies of Favourites were grown inſupportable,
they abuſing the King and their Kindred and friends
them.<note place="margin">Common complaints when ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will rebell.</note> The Subjects were treated worſe than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
<hi>Moors,</hi> their Perſons Impriſoned, their Eſtates

any refuge, for even in thoſe Holy Places, all Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies
were committed: The King knew nothing,
but what his Favourites told him, and it was their
ſtudy to keep him in ignorance, and hence proceeded
the ruin of this unhappy Prince.</p>
                  <p>3. In the Year 1240. <hi>Cacela</hi> and <hi>Ayamonte</hi> were
taken by Aſſault,<note place="margin">1240.</note> in which Actions D. <hi>Payo Perez Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi>
particularly ſignalized himſelf,<note place="margin">Complaints made to the Pope and all things adjuſted.</note> wherefore the King
gave thoſe places to the Military Order of <hi>Santiago,</hi>
whereof he was Commendary. During this current
of Affairs, the King was highly commended, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Spiritual Favours from Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> IX. The
Spiritual Graces were for ſuch as died in the War,
and for the King himſelf, who lay under Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Cenſures, for having proceeded unjuſtly againſt
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54712:108"/>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Porto,</hi> who carried his complaints to
<hi>Rome.</hi> Beſides, he ſeized the Eccleſiaſtical revenues
on pretence of urgent neceſſities, and of puniſhing
Clergy Men who kept Women in their Houſes. <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter,</hi>
Archbiſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi> had hereupon made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to the Pope, who therefore wrote to the
King, and recommended the charge of reducing him
to certain Biſhops. But he prevented them by ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelf, and ſo all differences were adjuſted. The
King conſidering the great merit of D. <hi>Payo Correa,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſpoken of, made him General for the conqueſt of
<hi>Algarve.</hi> He acted therein with the ſucceſs that was
hoped of his conduct taking ſeveral ſtrong holds, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
which were <hi>Eſtombar</hi> and <hi>Alvor. Garcia Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi>
who had travelled that Country as a Merchant,
was his principal Guide, having forſaken the purſuit
after Riches, to purchaſe Honour with his Sword.
<hi>Paderne</hi> was alſo taken, but coſt dear, the ſucceſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
a long time dubious. The Enemy having
propoſed a Ceſſation of Arms it was granted, becauſe
our forces fatigued with ſo many expeditions required
ſome time of refreſhment. During this Truce, the
Commendary <hi>Peter Perez</hi> with five Gentlemen went
out to hunt in the Mountains of the Village of <hi>Antas.</hi>
In their paſſage by <hi>Tavira,</hi> a City belonging to the
<hi>Moors,</hi> they were ſet upon by a greater number of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.
<hi>Garcia Rodriguez,</hi> the Merchant above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
paſſing that way, haſted to their ſuccour, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a brave reſiſtance, they were all killed upon the
place. D. <hi>Payo Correa</hi> could not come time enough
to ſave their lives, though upon the firſt advice of the
accident he haſted thither. Seeing his Friends could
not be ſaved, he fell upon the Enemy for revenge,
and they flying to the City, he entred it together with
them, and though he met with a vigorous reſiſtance,
made himſelf Maſter of it. King <hi>Sancho</hi> hearing of
the taking of <hi>Tavira,</hi> gave it to the Knights of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiago.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. The conqueſt of <hi>Silves</hi> only was wanting to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat

brought it about, the Enemy offering him a favourable
opportunity: The Inhabitants of that place went out
to aſſiſt King <hi>Aben Afan</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Eſtombar,</hi> D.
<hi>Payo</hi> inſtead of relieving the Beſieged, attacked <hi>Silves</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:54712:109"/>
then forſaken of its Defendants, and eaſily made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Maſter of it. The <hi>Mooriſh</hi> King haſting to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
the City, came late for his deſign, but in time
for D. <hi>Payo,</hi> who ruſhing out of the City, put him
to flight, ſo precipitately, that he was drowned on the
Coaſt, which in memory of him is to this day called
the Sea of <hi>Abenafan.</hi> Thus all <hi>Algarve</hi> was brought
under the power of King <hi>Sancho:</hi> The Pope about this
time having invited all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes to joyn their
Forces againſt the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1244.</note> King <hi>Sancho</hi> provided a
Gallant Army for that Expedition, but all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
were diſappointed, for he went not as he
had deſigned. <hi>Roderick Sanchez,</hi> Son to King <hi>Sancho</hi> I.
having been long at variance with <hi>Giles de Soveroſa,</hi>
a powerful Man in thoſe days, they met with armed
Troops near the City <hi>Porto,</hi> and after a ſharp En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
the diſpute ended with the life of <hi>Roderick
Sanchez,</hi> who was there ſlain. In this Encounter, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick
Fafes,</hi> a Man of Note, having loſt his Horſe,
asked <hi>Gonzalo Rodriguez de Abreu</hi> to give him his; he
gave it upon condition the other ſhould give him his
Daughter <hi>Mencia</hi> in Marriage, which according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<hi>Fafes</hi> afterwards performed.</p>
                  <p>5. The King continued to beſtow liberally moſt

Malice againſt him, nor was the fault in his
Government, or in chooſing ſuch Miniſters, but that
all who aſpired to it, could not be Favourites. There
never is wanting a pretence to ſubjects diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell.
The King eaſing himſelf on his Favourites,

hereupon, having fixed upon the King's Brother <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonſo</hi>
to fill that place and ſucceed him. It was want
of Loyalty in them, and not of capacity in him that
produced this Reſolution. One objection raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

him as great as he of <hi>Portugal.</hi> It is true, the
Queen favouring thoſe who had been inſtrumental
in advancing her to the Crown, hid ſome miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
from the King, which gave occaſion to the
multitude to commit ſeveral inſolencies, and the King
not puniſhing them whilſt he could, had not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the power to do it when he would. Some
would have it that the Queen had given her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
a Potion, the more to ſecure his love to her,
and to divert him wholly from the care of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

<hi>Denis</hi> being then wholly unprovided for War, ſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors

Enemy's Country. <hi>Sancho</hi> deſigned to anſwer the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,

ſent his Embaſſadors to demand the Reſtitution of the
Towns taken by his Predeceſſor, and in caſe of Refuſal,

Both thoſe Princes endeavoured to poſſeſs themſelves of

                     <q>This Sentence of King

right.</q> Judgment being given, they went away to
<hi>Agreda,</hi> where King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was with his Mother.
There Kings dined at one Table, and Three
Queens at another, which were thoſe of <hi>Caſtile, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>

To this effect he craved Succours of King <hi>Denis,</hi>

him Seventeen thouſand Marks of Silver, for which <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dajoz,
Alconchel,</hi> and <hi>Burguillos,</hi> were given in pawn.
This expedition was well begun by the taking of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar,</hi>
but its Progreſs was ſtopped; Firſt, by want of
Proviſions, and next, by the Death of King <hi>Ferdinand.
Phillip</hi> the Fair King of <hi>France,</hi> placed <hi>Clement</hi> V. (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Church Revenues,<note place="margin">The cruel ſuppreſſion of the Knights Templars.</note> for Five Years, and ſuppreſs the
Order of the Knights Templars, that he might ſeize
their Revenues. This Pope not willing to perform that
part touching the burning of his Predeceſſor, thought
to make the King amends, by falling the heavier on the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54712:118"/>
Knights Templars. To this purpoſe, at the inſtigation
of the King, thoſe Knights were charged with moſt
heinous Crimes, and their great Maſter with Sixty
Knights were publickly burnt at <hi>Paris,</hi> to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the World. The Pope had ſent Orders to
all Parts, that theſe Knights ſhould every where be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
on the ſame Day, but the Kings of <hi>Caſtile,
Aragon,</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> obeyed not, eſteeming the merits
of that Noble Order, above the unjuſt Commands of
a Byaſſed Pope. Yet after much Debate, the Order
was wholly ſuppreſſed, their greateſt Crime being their
Riches, which nevertheleſs, in <hi>Spain</hi> were for the moſt

now called the Knights of <hi>Malta.</hi> But King <hi>Denis,</hi>

Baſtard Brother to his Party, the Prince pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to ask of the King, to reſign to him the Power
of the Adminiſtration of Juſtice. Being juſtly denied
ſo unreaſonable a Demand, he drew over his Mother-in-Law,
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> to aſſiſt him towards obtaining
his deſires by Force, to which purpoſe ſhe asked leave
of his Father for him, to come to her into <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and

what he had before refuſed to his Son; and now again
denied to her. This Project failing, the Prince contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by his Servants, an Information to be drawn, as if
left by a Man that died at <hi>Magaula:</hi> containing a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign

to Poyſon the Prince. A Copy of the falſe Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<hi>Alonſo Sanchez,</hi> ſaying his Father negotiated with
the Pope, to exclude him the lawful Heir, and leave the
Crown to a Baſtard; but he in this did not ſucceed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
All theſe practices failing, the Prince betook himſelf
to open Hoſtility, robbing the King's Loyal Subjects, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing
Women, ſacrilegiouſly ranſacking Monaſteries,

him to deſiſt from force, and ſubmit to his Father;
but all to no effect. For he gathering a number of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals,
and Out-laws, pretended to go in Pilgrimage
to the Church of St. <hi>Vincent</hi> without <hi>Lisbon,</hi> deſigning
to ſurprize that City. The King having timely Advice of
it, haſted thither to prevent him, and the Queen after him
to Mediate betwixt the Father and the Son. The Prince
thus prevented, turned away towards <hi>Sintra,</hi> and his
Father after him. Both Bodies ſtood as if they deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to give Battle, but on a ſudden the Son marched off;
and tho' the King might have overtaken him, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
not. Being come to <hi>Coimbra,</hi> the Prince ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his Princeſs to <hi>Alcanizes</hi> in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and then gave
out that his Father intended to kill him. After diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing
the World of the falſehood of that Report, his
Father declared all ſuch as ſhould adhere to the Son,
Traitors; and knowing that the Inhabitants of <hi>Leyria</hi>
had entertained him, he haſted thither, where Nine of
the chief, as Rebels, had their Hands and Feet cut off,
and were afterwards burnt. The Prince went away to

poſſeſſed himſelf of the Caſtle of <hi>Coimbra,</hi> of <hi>Monte-Mayor</hi>

Cities of <hi>Porto,</hi> and <hi>Coimbra,</hi> and the Old Town of

was given on both ſides, and the Prince took an
Oath to be Obedient to his Father for the future. But
notwithſtanding this reconciliation, the Prince preſſed
his Father to call the Cortes, or Parliament, and yet
would not be preſent at it, but went from <hi>Santarem,</hi>
towards <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with armed Troops. The King came
out in the like manner, commanding him to return,
which he refuſing,<note place="margin">1324.</note> the Trumpets ſounded, and both
Parties Engaged. Yet the Queen ruſhing through all
dangers came to her Son, and upbraiding him with
breach of Faith, and Obſtinacy, at length the Battle
was parted, and the Father and Son once more were
Reconciled. That this agreement might be the more
laſting, D. <hi>Alonſo Sanchez,</hi> the King's Baſtard-Son,
was ſent out of the Kingdom, and went to the Town of
<hi>Albuquerque,</hi> which he poſſeſſed in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> by that
means becoming a Subject to that Crown.</p>

He was addicted to Learning, eſpecially to Poetry,
and it was he that firſt erected the Univerſity at <hi>Coimbra.</hi>
His Liberality was ſuch that it became a Proverb, <hi>As

Queens, and Nobility, when he went to compoſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs

After that, a Gentleman of <hi>Caſtile</hi> telling him that none
but himſelf had fallen ſhort of his Bounty, he gave
him the Silver Table whereon he dined. To reckon up
the particular acts of his Generoſity were too tedious,
it may ſuffice to ſay, this above the reſt was his peculiar
Vertue, in which he exceeded moſt Princes. He knew
all the Product of his Kingdom, and valued it ſo much,
that he never deſired to be ſupplied from abroad, with
any thing that he could have at home. Of the Gold
gathered in <hi>Tagus,</hi> he made a rich Crown and Scepter.
But notwithſtanding his prodigious Liberality he never
oppreſſed his Subjects with heavy Taxes. He was of
a middle Stature, his Hair black, full Faced, not ſo
Beautiful as Majeſtick. He died at <hi>Santarem,</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi>
of <hi>January,</hi> 1325. at the Age of 64 Years,<note place="margin">1325.</note> having
Reigned 46. It became a Proverb, <hi>That</hi> Denis <hi>could do
all he would.</hi> His ſtately Tomb, built by himſelf, is in

<hi>Lisbon,</hi> of the Invocation of St. <hi>Denis.</hi>

                  <p>1. THE Favour that King <hi>Denis</hi> ſhewed to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made him reſide where he had cauſed it to
flouriſh.<note place="margin">King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonſo</hi> the 4th. wholly addicted to his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> Having therefore reſettled the Court at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbra,</hi>
on the Eighth of <hi>February,</hi> 1290. was Born to
him in that City, of his Wife the holy Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
his Son <hi>Alonſo 4th.</hi> of the Name, and the Seventh
King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1290.</note> who for his forward and fiery ſpirit,
was called the <hi>Fierce.</hi> He, who as we have ſeen, was
ſo eager to Rule whilſt his Father lived, after his
Death caſt off all the care of Government; giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
wholly up to his Pleaſure, and particularly to
Hunting. Upon his Acceſſion to the Crown, inſtead of
ſettling the Affairs of the Kingdom, he went away to
the Forreſt of <hi>Sintra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1325.</note> where he ſpent a whole Month
among the wild Beaſts. Returning to Court, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
at the Council-Board, inſtead of the Buſineſs
of that Place, he gave them an Account of his Sport.
Hereupon, one of the Counſellors took the Boldneſs to
reprove him with threatning Expreſſions, which the King
being offended at, all the Council ſtood up and ſaid
they would chooſe another King, if he did not alter his
Courſe of Life. The King, tho he then went out in
a Paſſion, being grown cool, thought good to curb his
Inclination. Our Author here extols the Bravery of
thoſe Counſellors. <q>I find nothing to admire in the
matter, but the Inſolency of wicked and haughty
Subjects, and the want of Reſolution in him, he
ſtiles a Magnanimous Prince.</q> The King, not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with having, during his Father's Life, unjuſtly
Perſecuted his Baſtard-Brother, and Expelled him the

him of his Fortune and Honour. D. <hi>Alonſo
Sanchez,</hi> modeſtly ſued for Redreſs, but none was to be
had from a byaſſed Judge. He was now powerful, and
beloved in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> and therefore raiſing a
good Force, entred the Territory of <hi>Bragança,</hi> with
Fire and Sword, whilſt others of his Troops did the like
from <hi>Medellin,</hi> and <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> in the Country about
<hi>Guadiana.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1326.</note> This done, he returned to his Town of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buquerque,</hi>
where he Fortified himſelf, and made prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
for open War. D. <hi>Gonzalo Vaz,</hi> Maſter of
the Knights of <hi>Avis,</hi> being ſent againſt him by the King,
was put to the rout; and Duke <hi>Alonſo,</hi> falling Sick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Medellin.</hi> In the mean time the King Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
the Caſtle of <hi>Codeſſeyra,</hi> near <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> which
being baſely delivered to him by the Governour, was
raſed to the Ground.</p>
                  <p>2. The King propoſed a Match betwixt his Son Prince
<hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1327.</note> and <hi>Conſtance</hi> the Daughter of D. <hi>John Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>
who was of the Blood Royal of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and his
Wife of that of <hi>Aragon.</hi> King <hi>Alonſo</hi> IX. of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> broke
off this Match, contracting himſelf to her, for ſhe was
under age, and yet afterwards he contemned her, and
was Married to <hi>Mary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Marries his Daughter to the King of <hi>Caſtile.</hi>
                     </note> Daughter to King <hi>Alonſo</hi> of
<hi>Portugal.</hi> To that effect he came into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Princeſs at the Town of <hi>Alfayates,</hi> whither
her Father had Conducted her. At this Place a Match
was concluded betwixt <hi>Henry,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1328.</note> Prince of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and
the Princeſs <hi>Blanch,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Portugal,</hi> marries <hi>Blanch,</hi> Aunt to the King of <hi>Caſtile.</hi>
                     </note> Aunt to the King of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> The
following Year, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> received her at <hi>Fuente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinaldo,</hi>
where he again met with her Father Prince
<hi>Peter,</hi> about ſome alterations to be made in the Hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
given for exchange of the Ratifications. Two Years
after the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was Married to our Princeſs,
he became ſo intangled in the Love of the Lady <hi>Ellenor
Nunnez de Guzman,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1330.</note> that he treated her as Queen; and
the Queen as if ſhe had been but a Concubine. Our
holy Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> met him at <hi>Xerez de Badajoz,</hi>
to endeavour to reclaim him, but could obtain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but promiſes; for he continued obſtinate in his
Amours.<note place="margin">1332.</note> D. <hi>John Emanuel</hi> deſiring to be revenged
of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> for that giving his Daughter
to the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> in Marriage, he had cauſed his
Daughter <hi>Conſtance</hi> to be put by, made his intereſt with
the Lady <hi>Ellenor</hi> the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi>'s Miſtreſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54712:121"/>
her to prevail with the King to marry her; for
his Marriage with the Princeſs of <hi>Portugal</hi> was void, by
reaſon of Conſanguinity. But that Lady conſidering
the danger of aſpiring, to riſe from a Miſtreſs to a
Queen, ſlighted his Advice.</p>
                  <p>3. It was now found in <hi>Portugal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Blanch</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced from the Prince.</note> that the Princeſs
<hi>Blanch,</hi> by reaſon of the Tiſſick, was unfit for Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
and the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> having ſent his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
to examine into it, they agreed in the Point.
This Prince being on this ſcore diſengaged from that
Bride,<note place="margin">1334.</note> it was propoſed he ſhould marry the Lady <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts with the Lady <hi>Conſtance</hi> Daughter to D. <hi>John Emanuel.</hi>
                     </note>
Daughter to D. <hi>John Emanuel,</hi> whom the King
of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had before put away. This King was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
with thereupon, but he adviſed the contrary, yet
ſeemed to allow of whatſoever ours ſhould do. The
<hi>Portugueſe</hi> took this for Conſent, whilſt the <hi>Caſtilian</hi>
uſed all poſſible means to obſtruct the Match; telling
her Father he deſigned her for the Prince of <hi>Navarre.</hi>
Both ſeemed to mean as they ſpoke, and each deſigned
to deceive the other. D. <hi>Gonzalo Vaz,</hi> Maſter of the
Order of <hi>Avis,</hi> and Embaſſador from <hi>Portugal,</hi> came
to D. <hi>John,</hi> to conclude the Match. The King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi>
ſent D. <hi>John</hi> Orders, to apprehend the Embaſſador,
as coming without his leave with armed Men, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
committed Extortion on his way. D. <hi>John</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Embaſſador adviſed him to conclude their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
and he would go deliver up himſelf to the King at
<hi>Burgos.</hi> They agreed, D. <hi>John</hi> offered with his Daug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
300000 Doubles. The Articles were, That the
Lady <hi>Conſtance</hi> ſhould be abſolute over the Lands
aſſigned her in Dower: That the Prince ſhould keep no
Miſtreſs whilſt his Wife was of Age to bear Children, or
did not appear to be Barren: That there ſhould be a
League Defenſive betwixt the Father, and Son-in-Law,
that he might go viſit his Daughter, whenſoever he
pleaſed, and that the Second Son ſhould inherit D. <hi>John</hi>'s
Poſſeſſions in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> or elſe the Firſt ſhould inherit,
in caſe ſhe had but one.</p>
                  <p>4. The Embaſſador went immediately away to <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1335.</note>
and preſenting himſelf before the King, was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with feigned excuſes. At this time came one <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Catina,</hi> craving leave of the King,<note place="margin">A ſingle Combat.</note> to Combat with
<hi>Gonzalo Rodriguez Ribeiro,</hi> one who followeth the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,
and had killed his Brother. The King would
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54712:122"/>
have made them Friends, but <hi>Ribeiro</hi> oppoſing it, they
were allowed to enter the Liſts according to the Cuſtome
of thoſe Days; where <hi>Catina</hi> had his Head clove aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by his Adverſary. Many other notable Acts were
performed by this <hi>Ribeiro,</hi> and Two of his Companions,
in a ſolemn Tilting, wherein they gained much Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Nation. But the King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi>
ceaſed not all this while, underhand, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to break off the Match, writing to the King
of <hi>Portugal</hi> by way of Advice, That he ſhould not be
too haſty herein;<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> obſtructs the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Lady <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
                     </note> for that D. <hi>John</hi> was rich, and would
increaſe the Portion if he was backward. At the ſame
time, he blamed D. <hi>John</hi> for offering ſo much, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with his own Hand he wrote a Letter to the Lady
<hi>Conſtance,</hi> aſſuring her of his ſincere Affection to her,
and declaring he had been ill adviſed in marrying the
Princeſs of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but that by Reaſon of Conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that Marriage was void, and he would not fail to
be always hers. The Lady ſent the Letter to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who dictated an Anſwer, to this effect. That he
had much wronged her Innocence, having by falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations
gained her Love. That his ill Inclinations,
did appear by his unjuſt proceedings towards Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> his preſent Wife. That ſhe had ſo often found
him falſe, that ſhe could now find no Reaſon to give
any Credit to his Words; and that ſhe gave Thanks to
Almighty God, who had delivered her from being his
Wife, that ſhe might not ſuffer as the Queen did, by
his inordinate Affection, to the Lady <hi>Elenor Nunez
de Guzman,</hi> who had entertained other Lovers before
him.</p>
                  <p>5. It was agreed betwixt the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and
D. <hi>John Emanuel,</hi> that the Lady <hi>Conſtance</hi> ſhould be
brought into <hi>Portugal,</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> and the Bride and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
were contracted by Proxy. Embaſſadors were
ſent to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> where the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was to be
acquainted with the Concluſion of the Match. He, tho
much Diſpleaſed, expreſſed great Satisfaction, ſent
Preſents to the Embaſſadors, and ordered publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of Joy to be made. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſent
<hi>Martin Lopez Machado,</hi> his Embaſſador, to return
thanks for thoſe Courteſies; But ſtill the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to hinder the Bride's Journey into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and
to that purpoſe guarded the Roads, always pretending
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54712:122"/>
other Reaſons for ſo doing. The King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to
remove this Obſtacle, ſent another Embaſſador, who
being killed about Play at <hi>Valladolid,</hi> his Tutor, for he
was a Young Man, continued his Journey to the Court
of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> where he delivered to that King his Maſter's
Letter, containing how evidently he was convinced of
his ill Intentions, and made great Threats, in caſe he
perſiſted to obſtruct the Lady <hi>Conſtance</hi>'s Journey into
<hi>Portugal.</hi> The <hi>Caſtilian</hi> ſhewed that Letter to the Lady
<hi>Ellinor</hi> his Miſtreſs, who, with that Liberty that is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to ſuch Women, ſpared not to blame his unjuſt
Proceedings in that Particular; yet he forbore not to
ſtop the Princeſs, tho' he excuſed himſelf to the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe.</hi>
Our King, already diſguſted at this ill Uſage,
was yet farther provoked, for his Admiral, <hi>Stephen Vaz
de Barbuda,</hi> purſuing certain Pirates with five Ships, and
three Galleys, was driven by ſtreſs of Weather to <hi>Cadiz,</hi>
where, inſtead of a kind Reception, his Veſſels were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the Fleet of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Peter
Ponce de Marchena.</hi> Our King gave Advice hereof to
D. <hi>John Emanuel,</hi> and he making ſuit to his King, that
he would ſuffer his Daughter to depart, received no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
whereupon he openly declared againſt his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.
The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> demanded of the Governours of
the Cautionary Towns, for Performance of Articles, that
they ſhould deliver them up to him, ſince the fault lay
on the ſide of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> They conſulting together, ſent
one of their number to the King, to repreſent to him
how unjuſtly he dealt with the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
That if they delivered the Towns, they would
incur an infamous breach of Fealty, and that he would
not depart from the Siege he had laid to D. <hi>John Nunnez
de Lara</hi>'s Garriſon, till he had his Head. Yet conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Difficulty of that Deſign, he intimated he would
deſiſt, if the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhould requeſt it of him.
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> advertiſed her Father hereof, and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
wrote to the <hi>Caſtilian,</hi> deſiring him to raiſe
the Siege, and promiſing to make D. <hi>John Nunnez</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himſelf as ſoon as the Princeſs was ſent into <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi>
The Queen her ſelf carried the Letter to the
King, and he anſwered angrily, that he would raiſe the
Siege for no Man. Which made her return diſconſolate
to <hi>Burgos.</hi> But tho ſome of the Nobles contrived that
D. <hi>John</hi> might eſcape, yet the King was ſo watchful,
they were diſappointed.</p>

                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:54712:123"/>
6. The King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </note> impatient of longer Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,
ſent a Challenge to him of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon theſe Reaſons: That he treated ill the Queen
his Wife, that he gave out, he would be divorced from
her, and Marry the Lady <hi>Ellenor de Guzman,</hi> that he
deſigned to declare <hi>Peter</hi> her Son his Heir, and that he
hindred the Princeſs <hi>Conſtance</hi> from going into <hi>Portugal.</hi>
While his Embaſſador executed his Commiſſion, he
made all manner of Warlike Preparations both by Sea
and Land. He laid Siege to <hi>Badajoz,</hi> and at the ſame
time his Parties ravaged all the Country about <hi>Arauna,
Aroncha,</hi> and <hi>Cortegana.</hi> The Siege being tedious, the
King left ſufficient Forces to continue it, and he with
the reſt of the Army over-ran a great part of <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luzia</hi>
as far as <hi>Sevil,</hi> which done, he returned to the
Siege. His Brother, Count <hi>Peter,</hi> did the like in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,</hi>
the Archbiſhop, and other Commanders in vain
endeavouring to oppoſe him. Numerous Forces were
raiſing in <hi>Caſtile</hi> to relieve <hi>Badajoz,</hi> when the King,
conſidering the difficulty of the Enterprize, and that
<hi>Peter Alonſo,</hi> one of his Officers, had been defeated,
raiſed the Siege, and returned diſſatisfied to <hi>Portugal.</hi>
But whilſt he prepared to return thither ſtronger than
before, the Queen, without his knowledge, went away
to <hi>Badajoz,</hi> where the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> her Son-in-law,
then was, thinking her Prayers might prevail with him
to deſiſt from War, and comply with her Husband. The
King received her with Reſpect, but demanded ſuch
Conditions as he knew could not be granted. Scarce
was ſhe gone from <hi>Badajoz,</hi> when the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> followed
as far as <hi>Elvas,</hi> ravaging all the Country. Two days
he ſpent Plundering that Territory, and then laid Siege
to <hi>Aronchez,</hi> but underſtanding that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
infeſted the Neighbourhood of <hi>Xerez, Badajoz, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guillos,</hi>
and <hi>Alconchel,</hi> he removed to meet them. Not
meeting with them, he beſieged <hi>Olivenca,</hi> and being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with an Ague, was forced to depart, and return to
<hi>Sevil,</hi> leaving his Forces to do all the harm they could.
Some Troops, under the Command of the Brothers,
<hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>John Roiz de Caſtro,</hi> pillaged all the
Country betwixt the Rivers <hi>Duero</hi> and <hi>Minho,</hi> till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
met by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Braga</hi> with 1400 <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes,</hi>
D. <hi>John de Caſtro</hi> was killed, with 300 of his
Men, and a great Booty recovered. At Sea, 20 Galleys,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54712:123"/>
carrying 2000 Men, put into <hi>Lepte</hi> in <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> where
they landed, Plundering the Country, and being met
by D. <hi>Nunno Portocarrero,</hi> there enſued a hot Fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, in which 26 <hi>Portugueſes</hi> and 80 <hi>Caſtilians</hi>
were killed. <hi>Camello,</hi> the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> General, was taken;
and by the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> two <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Commanders, for
whom he was exchanged. The <hi>Caſtilians</hi> ſet out 40
Sail to Revenge this Affront, but a Storm diſperſed and
wrecked both Fleets. Another <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Squadron,
commanded by <hi>Miſſer Emanuel Piſſano,</hi> a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> had
ſpoiled the Coaſt of <hi>Galicia,</hi> and was now again ſent
againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, that did no leſs harm in the
Kingdom of <hi>Algarve.</hi> They met about Cape S. <hi>Vincent,</hi>
and fought with extraordinary Reſolution, till the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi>
Admiral, and many more, were taken, and the
<hi>Caſtilian</hi> returned Victorious to <hi>Sevil.</hi> At the ſame time,

which began by the opening of the Earth after a

dying after ſhe had brought forth three Children,
our King found that Diſcord at home, which had before

to ſtrengthen the Succeſſion to the Crown, but found
he was in Love with the Lady <hi>Agnes de Caſtro,</hi> a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
and one of the Ladies to the late Princeſs, and
that enjoying her Perſon, he refuſed a ſecond Wife; and
enquiring farther into it,<note place="margin">K. <hi>Alonſo</hi> his Eldeſt Son pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately Marries the Lady <hi>Agnes de Caſtro.</hi>

Princeſs. The Nobility envying the Lady <hi>Agnes</hi> her
Happineſs, perſwaded the King to oblige his Son to
Marry another Wife, or elſe to kill her; alledging, that

one of their Nephews might Inherit the Crown. They
alſo ſaid, the Lady <hi>Agnes</hi> was not of ſufficient Quality
to be a Queen; but in this they wronged her, for ſhe
was of Royal Blood, and her Siſter came to be Queen
of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> Upon theſe Pretences her Death was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
and tho' the Prince had notice given him hereof
by the Queen his Mother, and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi>
yet he thought none durſt attempt ſuch an Action whilſt
he was in the way. The King, overcome by Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
ſet out from <hi>Monte-Mayor,</hi> and went to <hi>Coimbra</hi>
with a great number of armed Men, at ſuch time as
the Prince was gone out a Hunting. The Lady <hi>Agnes</hi>
was in the Palace called S. <hi>Clare,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Lady <hi>Agnes</hi> cruelly murdered.</note> and underſtanding the
King came to kill her, went out to receive him, and
falling at his Feet with the three Children ſhe had, bathed
them with her Tears. This ſad Spectacle moved the King,
and he turned back to depart. But thoſe who had
perſwaded him to this Action, the chief whereof were
<hi>Alvaro Gonçalez, James Lopez Pacheco,</hi> and <hi>Peter Coello,</hi>
blamed the King's Remiſsneſs, and ſo earneſtly preſſed
him to give them leave to execute what they came about,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54712:125"/>
that he condeſcended, and they immediately, with more
than barbarous Inhumanity, ſtruck off her Head.</p>
                  <p>11. The Prince returning from Hunting,<note place="margin">The Prince begins his Revenge.</note> for ſome
time was almoſt diſtracted with Rage. Being come to
himſelf, he began to execute his Revenge, deſtroying all
the Country betwixt <hi>Duero</hi> and <hi>Minho,</hi> where thoſe
Cruel Executioners had their Eſtates, with Fire and
Sword. The City <hi>Porto</hi> he ſpared, for the ſake of the
Archbiſhop, who had given him notice of the Deſign.
Thus King <hi>Alonſo</hi>'s Diſobedience towards his Father,
was now with more Reaſon puniſhed by his own Son.
The Prince marched to the Town of <hi>Canaveſes,</hi> where
the Queen his Mother, and the Archbiſhop met, and
reduced him to ſubmit to his Father, and disband his
Followers, conditioning that both Parties ſhould Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
all Offences, and that in all Places where the Prince
was, all Acts of Juſtice ſhould be performed in his
Name. It was viſible enough, that the Prince would ſome
time or other be revenged on the Murderers of the Lady,<note place="margin">The Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers fly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Caſtile.</hi>

Crowned, and Cloathed in Royal Robes, placed it on a

<hi>Beatrix,</hi> was Travelling another way, to be Married to
the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Prince, her Father not having any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
of what hapned to him. This Accident much

were for more ſafe than honourable Courſes, not to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil

failing of this Refuge, withdrew to <hi>Albuquerque;</hi> but
neither was he to be admitted there. He ſent to ask a Paſs

before the Death of our King, was ſeen a prodigious Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
or rather Confuſion in the heavenly Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
On the <hi>27th.</hi> Day at Midnight, all the Stars in a
Body began to run from Eaſt to Weſt; then ſuddenly
diſperſing, they wandred through ſeveral parts of the
Sphere; next, falling nearer to the Region of the Air,
the nearneſs made them appear like vaſt Globes of Fire;
ſo that the whole Heaven ſeemed to be in a Flame, and
the Earth threatned to be reduced to Aſhes. The Sky
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54712:128"/>
in many places ſeemed to gape, the Stars being removed.
This Spectacle laſting a conſiderable time, Men ſtood
amazed, expecting the Diſſolution of the Univerſe.
Three Months after this Prodigy,<note place="margin">King <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Death</note> our King died. It
will not be amiſs, to give ſome Inſtances of his Juſtice
and Magnificence.<note place="margin">His Juſtice and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence.</note> He was not, as ſome have called
him, Cruel; but a zealous lover of Juſtice, puniſhing
Crimes with the utmoſt Severity, and rewarding Vertue
with Liberality. The Puniſhments he inflicted, tho' in
appearance terrible, were neceſſary, and well applyed.
A Young Man having ſtruck his ſuppoſed Father, and
the King hearing thereof, called the Mother, and preſſed
her to tell him who was the Youth's Father; for it was
impoſſible it ſhould be her Husband. She confeſſed, in
ſome time, a Fryar had got him. Thereupon the King
went in Perſon to the Monaſtery, and putting the Fryar
into a Caſe of Cork, ſawed him in two. One of his
Favourites lived in Adultery with a Judge's Wife, for
which the King cauſed his Privities to be cut off. A
Prieſt being ſuſpended for killing a Man, he cauſed him
to be put to Death by a Maſon; ſaying, That the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Judges condemned a Prieſt, for killing a Man,
to be ſuſpended from his Office; but he, in his Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
would ſuſpend the Maſon from Working, for kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Prieſt. The Biſhop of <hi>Porto</hi> he ſcourged, for
having to do with a Citizen's Wife. He cauſed a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to be beheaded, for ſtaving a Country-man's Cask,
that was full. A Clerk of the Treaſury was hanged, for
receiving a ſmall Bribe. Hearing a Woman upbraid
another with being forced, he asked the cauſe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
told, her Husband raviſhed her before they were
marryed, he cauſed him to be hanged. Knowing that a
Merchant's Wife cuckolded him, one day, when the
Merchant was at ſome Publick Feaſt, he ſurprized his
Wife, with her Gallant, and burnt them, and then
congratulated the Merchant, that he was revenged. A
Bawd having procured a Young Woman for the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<hi>Lancelote Peſſana,</hi> the Bawd was burnt, and the
Admiral hardly obtained Pardon, after ſeveral Years
abſence. A Country-man complaining, that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
to whom he had lent certain Silver Cups, would
not reſtore them; the King kept him in hand a Year,
and then cauſed the Gentleman to pay him Nine times
the value, which was then the Penalty of Thieves; and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54712:128"/>
farther told him, he ſhould be always anſwerable for the
Country-man's Life. A Purſivant complaining, that in
the Execution of his Office, a Gentleman had ſtruck
him, and torn his Beard, the Gentleman was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
beheaded.</p>
                  <p>6. The Laws he inſtituted,<note place="margin">Laws eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by him.</note> were religiouſly obſerved.
One of them condemned Judges, who received Bribes,
to Death. To avoid delays in Suits, he eſtabliſhed,
there ſhould be no Counſellors, Sollicitors, nor Attorneys.
He went about the Kingdom in Perſon, to adminiſter
Juſtice impartially to all Men. Tho' ſo much ſubdued
himſelf by the Love of the Lady <hi>Agnes de Caſtro,</hi> he
ſuffered no Crime of Incontinency to paſs unpuniſhed.
Several new Pieces were coined by him, on the one ſide
whereof, was his Effigies ſitting in a Chair, holding a
naked Sword; on the reverſe, the Royal Arms, with
theſe Inſcriptions, Peter, <hi>King of</hi> Portugal <hi>and</hi> Algarve.
<hi>God aſſiſt me, and make me Victorious over my Enemies.</hi>
He was ſo Bountiful, that, like the Emperor <hi>Titus,</hi> he
thought himſelf not a King the day he gave nothing:
To this purpoſe, he kept always much Plate. He was
much addicted to Muſick, and uſed to go abroad at
Nights, and dance to the ſound of Trumpets. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his great Liberality, he left a conſiderable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to his Succeſſor, which he gathered without the
leaſt diſſatisfaction to his Subjects. In fine, ſuch was
his Life, that his Death was generally lamented; and it
was in all mens Mouths, <hi>That ſuch Ten Years Government
never were, nor would again be ſeen in this Kingdom.</hi>
Others ſaid, <hi>That either he ſhould never have been born,
or never have died.</hi>
                  </p>

his Forehead large, his Eyes black and beautiful,
his Hair reddiſh, which he wore long, his Mouth ſmall,
his Viſage long. He ſomewhat ſtammered in his Speech,
was addicted to Poetry, and ſome Verſes of his are ſtill

declared for our King, where he immediately coined
Money, bearing the Arms and Titles of both Kingdoms.
Our King, in outward appearance, pretended more Zeal
to Revenge the Murder of King <hi>Peter,</hi> than Ambition
to joyn that Kingdom to his own. To inculcate this
Opinion, he ſent Embaſſadors to the Pope, the King of

in his Father-in-law's Service. Some Places in <hi>Caſtile</hi>

were fitted out, whereof that which was to carry her,
had her Sails of Silk, wrought with Gold, and all that
was above Water was gilt. The Rowers were cloathed
in the King's Livery, and many gallant Gentlemen went

Burnt it, and removed to <hi>Guemaraens,</hi> which being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

coming out of <hi>Sevil,</hi> took a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ship that had
Money and Proviſions on Board, and then ſhut up our
Admiral <hi>Peſſano</hi> in the River, to oblige him to Fight in

Succour, according to his promiſe. This being refuſed,
the Town was obliged to Surrender. There was in it a
conſiderable Treaſure of King <hi>Peter</hi>'s, and Two of his
Baſtard-Sons who were caſt into Priſon. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>
the 11th. ſent Two Nuncio's to Mediate a Peace betwixt
the Two Kings, which was concluded at <hi>Alcoutin</hi> in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garve,</hi>
upon theſe Conditions,<note place="margin">Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Pope.</note> That they ſhould be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to aſſiſt one another; That the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſhould

have with her <hi>Cuidad Rodrigo, Valencia de Alcantara,
Monte-Mayor, Alhariz,</hi> and a Summ of Money; That
a general Pardon ſhould be granted on both ſides. Thus
our King broke his Word with him of <hi>Aragon,</hi> who in
revenge kept all the Treaſure that had been ſent to his
Daughter. King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> finding his Treaſures exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
called in the Old Money, and enhanced the Value
of the New, which did great Harm, and much more
when he endeavoured afterwards to rectifie that Error.
The Five Months allowed for the Princeſs <hi>Ellenor</hi> to
come out of <hi>Caſtile</hi> were now expiring, when the King
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54712:131"/>
falling in Love with the Lady <hi>Ellenor Tellez de Meneſes,</hi>
forgot his Bride. This Lady <hi>Ellenor Tellez</hi> was Wife to
<hi>John Lorenço de Cunha</hi> Lord of <hi>Pombeyro.</hi> He fell in
Love with her at his Siſter's, the Princeſs <hi>Beatrix,</hi> where
he was always ſo aſſiduous, as gave occaſion to ſuſpect
him guilty of a more than Brotherly Affection. This
Lady being about to return into the Country, whence ſhe
came, the King ordered her Siſter who attended the
Princeſs, to ſtay her in Town, for he would marry no
other Woman. The Siſter objected, that he was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and her Siſter Married.
The Firſt, he replyed, might be eaſily put by; and as
for the latter, he ſaid, ſhe being Married to a Kinſman
without Diſpenſation, the Marriage was void. All which
gave the Lady <hi>Ellenor</hi> to underſtand the King's Affection
was not at all Nice.</p>
                  <p>7. Scarce had ſhe conſented when her Marriage being
called in queſtion,<note place="margin">The Lady <hi>Ellenor</hi> being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced from her Firſt Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the King mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries her.</note> and the Husband not oppoſing it,
Judgment was eaſily obtained for the K. Hereupon her
Husband went away to <hi>Caſtile</hi> and there publickly wore
a pair of Golden Horns. In fine, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Married the
Lady <hi>Ellenor.</hi> The whole Kingdom was aſtoniſhed at
this Action, but <hi>Lisbon</hi> ſhewed it ſelf above all other
Places. Here a Taylor, called <hi>Ferdinand Vaſquez,</hi> a bold
well-ſpoken Fellow, gathered 3000 of the People, and
with them went to the Pallace, nothing being heard
but Reproaches againſt the New Queen.<note place="margin">A great meeting at <hi>Lisbon</hi> on account of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> To appeaſe
them, the King proteſted he was not Married to her,
and promiſed the next Day to hear them, when they
were Calmer, at the Church of S. <hi>Dominick.</hi> By Day,
the Multitude was in the broad Place before that Church;
but the King fearing the popular Fury, was already gone
away to <hi>Santarem.</hi> When the People underſtood it, they
vented their Malice in Reproaches, and this made the
Queen ſtir up the King to Revenge. The Taylor was
apprehended, and many of his Followers; ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
had their Hands, others their Feet cut off; many
more fled, now too late underſtanding, that Subjects
ought to have no other Redreſs againſt the Miſcarrages
of their Sovereigns, than by their Prayers to God. In the
mean while, the King traverſed the Kingdom with his
beloved Conſort, till being come to the pleaſant Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtery
of <hi>Leça,</hi> Two Leagues from <hi>Porto,</hi> he then decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
what he denied at <hi>Lisbon;</hi> to wit, That he was
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54712:132"/>
Married to the Lady <hi>Ellenor,</hi> and aſſigned her a greater
Joynture than any Queen before her ever had.</p>
                  <p>8. All the Nobility kiſſing the Queen's Hand, only
Prince <hi>Denis</hi> Son to the late King, by the Lady <hi>Agnes de
Caſtro</hi> refuſed it, for which the King offered to Stab him,
but was prevented, and the Prince fled to <hi>Coimbra.</hi> Tho
many of the Multitude were puniſhed, the clamours
of the People againſt the King's Marriage ceaſed not,
nor were they continued without reaſon, for that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was in reality unlawful; ſhe being the true Wife
of <hi>John Lorenço. Ferdinand</hi> at laſt remembring he was
contracted to the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> ſent to inform her
Father, That tho he could not perform that Article, he
would fulfil all the reſt. That Prince did not ſeem at
all to be concerned, but Embaſſadors were ſent on both
ſides to Ratifie the Peace.<note place="margin">The New Queen gains Friends by her Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</note> The New Queen having

                     <hi>Santarem,</hi> and here <hi>Henry</hi> quartered in the Suburbs. Our

The King, and thoſe that were with him, could from

<hi>Lisbon</hi> being ſurprized, <hi>Henry</hi> entred at S. <hi>Antony</hi>'s Gate,
and took up his Quarters in the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Francis;</hi>
the People retired to the ſtronger parts of the Town.
Our Fleet had been ſent to hinder the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Squadron
from entring the Port, but our Ships were taken by them,
and only 4 of our Galleys eſcaped, ſaving themſelves in
the Creeks. The People of <hi>Lisbon</hi> underſtanding there
was a deſign to betray the City; dragged one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators
about the Streets, and then cut him in pieces; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

into the River. The <hi>Franciſcan Friars,</hi> where the King
quartered, thought to have expelled him thence; but
their deſign being diſcovered, he put them into Boats,
without Sails or Oars, and expoſed them to the mercy
of the Sea; yet they got a Shoar. The <hi>Caſtilians</hi> poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Skirts of the Town, and many Skirmiſhed dayly
hapned. In the mean while, the Earl of <hi>Gijon,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>'s

receive the new Gueſts, who were lodged in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> where Rich Preſents were beſtowed
upon them, and they were ſumptuouſly entertained.
The King was by the Treaty obliged to furniſh the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>

Horſes, for there were ſcarce any in the Kingdom, and
he gave ſuch as could be had. The Duke of <hi>York</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed

<hi>Elvas</hi> was at that time beſieged by the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> who
hearing of the Arrival of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> raiſed the Siege,
and departed. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> committed many Outrages
in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and being ordered to March againſt <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
did no leſs harm in the Country as they went, which

lay in Ambuſh with 24 Horſe, and 30 Foot, near the

Enemy, who fled to the Shoar. The Enemy increaſing
to about 250, his Men refuſed to Engage at ſuch odds,
and he, to draw them on, run upon them alone, where
his Horſe fell upon him, but his Men coming to his

retiring to their Veſſels. The Queen having in Publick
rent a Veil in two, and given one half to her Gallant,

on the Walls with the Bleſſed Sacrament, the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
put all to the Sword, in Revenge of one of theirs that

now at the Head of their Armies, the former at <hi>Badajoz,</hi>
the latter at <hi>Elvas,</hi> ready to decide their Quarrel by
Battle. King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Knighted 24 of his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

and then repeated the Ceremony to thoſe 24 Knights.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:54712:135"/>
The whole Day was ſpent by both Armies looking upon
each other, and at laſt, the one drew back to <hi>Badajoz,</hi>
and the other to <hi>Elvas.</hi> What the cauſe of parting ſo
ſhould be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot certainly be aſſigned; but ſome ſaid,
The <hi>Caſtilian</hi> feared the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who had been before
victorious in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> to which the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi>
had a good Title, and had been once proclaimed by part
of the Army. Whatever it was, a Treaty of Peace was
immediately ſet a foot, none knowing who had firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for it. Embaſſadors being ſent on both Sides, the
Articles were at length agreed upon, without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi>

of <hi>York,</hi> ſhould marry Prince <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King <hi>John</hi>'s
ſecond Son, having before been promiſed to the eldeſt.
But this Match was better liked, to prevent the Union of
the Two Crowns. Secondly, That the Twenty two Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
taken by the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> ſhould be reſtored. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That a general Pardon ſhould be granted on both
ſides. Fourthly, That the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> ſhould fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Ships to carry the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Home, as if he had ſent
for them. When theſe Articles were to have been rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> demurred, as to reſtoring the Gallies,
and ſending Home the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> The Embaſſadors here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
challenged him, in their Maſter's Name; and he
ſcornfully anſwered, <hi>I did not think he had ſo much Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</hi>
Nevertheleſs, through the Perſwaſion of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Knights of <hi>Santiago,</hi> he ratify'd the Peace.</p>

for her Husband dying whilſt ſhe was yet very
young, and being courted by ſeveral Princes, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
That Women of Honour did not marry twice.
The Archbiſhop of <hi>Santiago</hi> came to <hi>Portugal</hi> to receive
the Bride, the King being then at <hi>Salvatierra,</hi> upon the
River <hi>Tagus.</hi> It was agreed, That in caſe King <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
died without Heirs, his Daughter ſhould inherit,
and after her her Iſſue; but if ſhe had none, then King
<hi>John</hi> ſhould ſucceed; and that if King <hi>John,</hi> his new
Queen, and the Princeſs <hi>Ellenor,</hi> Wife to the Prince of
<hi>Navar,</hi> died without Heirs, before King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> then
he ſhould inherit the Crown of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> That till the
new Queen of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had a Son Fourteen Years of Age,
Queen <hi>Ellenor</hi> her Mother ſhould govern <hi>Portugal.</hi> Thus
it appears, the future Pretenſions of the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi>
to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> were juſt, as were Queen <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenor</hi>'s
to the Government; and that the ſucceeding King
<hi>John</hi> was an Uſurper, having no lawful Title to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>8. King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being Sick,<note place="margin">King <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> falls ſick.</note> his Queen <hi>Ellenor</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
the Princeſs, then not full Thirteen Years of

of Articles, the King and his Bride met, in
Tents near that City. Such was Queen <hi>Ellenor</hi>'s Beauty,
that the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> ſeeing her ſaid, King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> were
much to blame, had he not loved her, having ſeen her; or
if, having loved her, he had not made her a Queen. Here
the Cardinal of <hi>Luna</hi> produced a Diſpenſation for them
to marry, they being within the prohibited Degrees of
Conſanguinity; after which there was a moſt ſplendid
Entertainment. Then they returned to <hi>Elvas,</hi> where the
nuptial Rites were ſolemnly performed with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Pomp; and after all publick Teſtimonies of Joy, and
Demonſtrations of Grandeur were over, the King of
<hi>Caſtile</hi> gave rich Preſents to all the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Gentry.
Queen <hi>Ellenor</hi> returning to <hi>Almada,</hi> where King <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
lay ſick, and intimating, That ſhe liked not the
King of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> The Maſter of the Order of <hi>Avis,</hi>
commended his Senſe and Modeſty; to which ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>That is true, but I would have a Man be more a
Man.</hi> At laſt, King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being convinc'd of the
extravagant Familiarity that was betwixt the Queen, and

Count <hi>John Fernandez Andeyro,</hi> and being unwilling
by puniſhing to expoſe her Weakneſs, or to loſe her he

performed not at this time what was enjoyned him, yet

and his Eyes ſparkling.<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> The great Expence of his Wars

the Univerſity, erected by King <hi>Denis</hi> at <hi>Coimbra,</hi>
to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> but it afterwards returned to the ſame Place
from whence he brought it. He was rather Prodigal
than Liberal, which may appear by the many Towns
we have mentioned he gave to the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> that came
over to him. As to his other Gifts, one Inſtance will
ſerve to demonſtrate the reſt. To <hi>John Alonſo de Moxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
one of the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Gentlemen that came over to

de Avelar.</hi> This was the firſt time his Father ſaw
him, and having Knighted him, gave him that Honour.

He was ſent to receive it at <hi>Avis,</hi> a Convent of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and was there educated, till of Age to bear Arms.
His Actions till the Death of King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> have
been related; it now remains to recount what he did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
The late King, in his Will, left the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the Government to his Wife Queen <hi>Ellenor,</hi>
in purſuance of what had been Stipulated with King
<hi>John</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> upon his marrying the Lady <hi>Beatrix,</hi>
lawful Daughter to King <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> tho the unbridled
Malice of the Multitude Defamed her with the Name of
Count <hi>John Fernandez Andeyro</hi> his Daughter. Queen
<hi>Ellenor</hi> entred upon the Government with Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
tokens of Grief for the Death of the King her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
The Council of the City of <hi>Lisbon</hi> adviſed her
not to be ſo negligent in the Government as her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
had been; and ſhe anſwered them ſo graciouſly,
that they went away well ſatisfied. The King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi>
immediately ſent Embaſſadors to condole her Loſs,
and at the ſame time to require himſelf to be proclaimed
King in the Right of his Wife, and in purſuance of the
late Capitulations. Scarce was this mentioned throughout
the Kingdom, when a general reluctancy appeared in the
Countenances of all Men. D. <hi>Henry Manuel de Villena,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Sea,</hi> and Unkle to the King <hi>Caſtile,</hi> was ordered
to Proclaim him in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> but was oppoſed by D. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vare
Perez de Caſtro,</hi> in behalf of King <hi>Peter</hi>'s lawful
Iſſue by the Lady <hi>Agnes de Caſtro.</hi> The ſame happened
at <hi>Santarem, Elvas,</hi> and in moſt Places of the Kingdom.
King <hi>John</hi> propoſed his Title, by his Embaſſador, to the
City of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> but it was not favourably received.</p>
                  <p>2. The Firſt contrivance of the Maſter of <hi>Avis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Before his Aſſuming the Crown, he Murders Count <hi>John Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyro.</hi>
                     </note> with
ſome others, was to Murder the Count <hi>John Fernandez,</hi>
the Queen's Favourite; and the ſaid Maſter being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
General of the Country, betwixt the Rivers <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>

whence ſuddenly returning with armed Men, he
ruſhed into the Place, and there Murdered the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Count. The Queen, when ſhe heard it, ſaid, <hi>He
has died a Martyr, and I will to Morrow, in proof of it,
undergo the Trial of</hi> Ordeal. Next, ſhe went to know of
the Maſter, whether ſhe alſo muſt die; and a civil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was returned, to quiet her. The Rabble, raiſed by
the clamours of one of the Maſter's Pages, who cryed
he would be killed in the Palace, flocked thither, and

would certainly have deſtroyed the Queen, had not

was conſenting to the Murder. The Biſhop of <hi>Lisbon</hi>

Prior of <hi>Guimaraens,</hi> and a Notary of <hi>Silves.</hi> They
hearing the Tumult, got up into the Belfrey, where the
People ſeeing them, called out to have the Bells ring.
They not regarding to obey theſe Tumultuary Shouts,
the Rabble broke in, and caſt them headlong from the
Tower, then dragged them to the Market called <hi>Recio,</hi>
where they lay naked and expoſed to the Dogs, till the
next Day. D. <hi>John,</hi> after Dinner, went to Court, to
beg the Queen's Pardon for murdering the Count. She
took little Notice of him, but threatned the Kingdom
with the Power of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> yet fearing the Rabble, ſhe
went away from <hi>Lisbon</hi> to <hi>Alenquer,</hi> praying to God, at
her departure, that ſhe might ſee the City burnt.</p>
                  <p>3. Don <hi>John</hi> fearing the Power of the Queen, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to go away into <hi>England;</hi> but the more this was
rumoured, the more the Multitude preſſed him to ſtay,
and protect them againſt <hi>Caſtile.</hi> He made ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
oppoſition, but was ſoon brought to comply. A
Council was named, where it was reſolved that D. <hi>John</hi>
ſhould marry Queen <hi>Ellenor,</hi> for defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and that if the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had ever a Son

ceaſed all the Reproaches that had been caſt upon the
Queen, who when this Overture was made to her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
it with Scorn. Nevertheleſs he was declared Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector

what to do, one <hi>Alonſo Jannez,</hi> a Cooper, ſtept into the

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54712:138"/>
him Reputation, was the Prudent Choice he made of
Counſellors, not according to Men's Quality, but their
Ability. Next, to ſecure many of his Party, he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
a conſiderable Treaſure belonging to thoſe that

Engage. There was a great diſproportion in Numbers,
for the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> are reported to have been 33000 ſtrong,
and the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> but 6500; beſides which Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
they had the Sun and Duſt in their Eyes. The
Sun was going down when theſe two unequal Armies
engaged. The <hi>Caſtilians</hi> at the firſt Charge broke through
our Vanguard, but the new King then coming up, not
only with Words, but with his Example, ſo animated
his Men, that in leſs than an hour that multitude of
Enemies was put to the rout. The King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who
began the Fight on a Mule, being then troubled with an
Ague, was forced to take a Horſe to ſave himſelf. Moſt
of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> who ſided with <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and were in
the Front of the Army, were put to the Sword, for no
Quarter was given to them. The Royal Standard of
<hi>Caſtile</hi> was taken, but many pretending to the Honour,
it could not be decided by whom. The full Number of
the ſlain is not known, but it was very great on the part
of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> of whom about 3000 Horſe are reckoned to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:54712:143"/>
have periſhed, and very many Men of great Account.
This is the Famous Battle of <hi>Aljubarrota,</hi> ſo called, for
that it was fought near the Village of that Name. The
Booty was vaſtly Rich.</p>
                  <p>5. The Victorious King continued three days in the
Field of Battle, erecting Trophies, it being then the
Cuſtom ſo long to expect the return of the Enemy.
The King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> fled with ſpeed from <hi>Aljubarrota</hi> to
<hi>Santarem,</hi> which is Twelve Leagues, and having reſted
there a ſhort time, went down the River to his Fleet,
then Riding before <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where he continued two days,
and on the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> left that Port, attended by
Seventeen Galleys. He arrived at <hi>Sevil,</hi> and tired there
with the Clamours of the People, went away to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona.</hi>
                     <q>Now we have heard what the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
write of this Battle,<note place="margin">The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given of this Battle by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</note> which ſeems altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible;
but let us give an hint of what thoſe of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi>
write, which is much more probable. They ſay,
the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> advancing towards his Enemy,
found him poſted in an Advantageous Ground betwixt
two Moraſſes, out of which Place he could not be
drawn, becauſe much inferiour in Number; That he
was above 12000 ſtrong, and before the Engagement
made Overtures of Peace: That the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> would
not be diſſwaded from giving Battle in that Place, ſo
diſadvantageous to them, becauſe they exceeded their
Enemies in Number; and in fine, that they loſt the
Day through their own Pride and Raſhneſs, in aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Enemy ſo well poſted, when they might have
ranged all the Country at their own pleaſure. This,
I believe, to all Impartial Men, will appear nearer to
the Truth, for we muſt allow all Authors to magnifie
the Exploits of their own Country, and ſo let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to our Hiſtory.</q> The new King coming to <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarem,</hi>
had it delivered to him, and finding there many
Ladies, whoſe Husbands were in the Service of <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
he gave them all Liberty to go to them, which they
gladly embraced.</p>
                  <p>6. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> King's next care was to Reward
thoſe who had ſignalized themſelves in the Battle,<note place="margin">The Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Caſtile.</hi>
                     </note> the
chief whereof was the Conſtable, to whom he gave
large Poſſeſſions, and the Title of Count of <hi>Ourem.</hi>
He, encouraged by this Honour, reſolved to invade <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile.</hi>
Having gathered 4000 Men, he met and defeated
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54712:143"/>
the Maſter of <hi>Calatrava,</hi> D. <hi>Martin Yanez de Barbuda,</hi>
who had entred <hi>Portugal</hi> with a ſtrong Party; and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
his Succeſs, took the ſtrong Town of <hi>Villa Garcia.</hi>
Thence he marched to the Plain betwixt <hi>Magaçela</hi> and
<hi>Villa Nueva de la Serena,</hi> where he had a terrible and long,
as well as doubtful Battle with D. <hi>Peter Moniz,</hi> Maſter
of the Order of <hi>Santiago.</hi> Three ſeveral times the Fight
was renewed, and laſted almoſt two days with incredible
Obſtinacy, but in the Concluſion, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a moſt Glorious Victory. This done, he went
away to aid the King, then lying at the Siege of <hi>Chaves,</hi>
which was ſurrendred to him. Moving thence, they
laid Siege to <hi>Coria,</hi> but after having battered it ſome
days with great Fury, were forced to riſe and depart,
the Conſtable to the Province of <hi>Alentejo,</hi> and the King
on foot in Pilgrimage to Our Lady's Church at <hi>Guima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raens,</hi>
as he had promiſed before the Battle of <hi>Aljubar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rota.</hi>
Moſt of them that held any Fortreſſes for <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
ſurrendred themſelves now to the new King. He laid
Siege to the Town of <hi>Chaves,</hi> whereof <hi>Martin Gonzalez
de Atayde</hi> was Governour, who held it out till he had no
Water left,<note place="margin">1386.</note> and then articled to Surrender in Forty days,
if not relieved from <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and by conſent of that
King he at length delivered up the Place.</p>
                  <p>7. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Embaſſadors in <hi>England</hi> ſtirred up

the Crown, ſhould marry <hi>Katherine</hi> the Duke's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that ſo all Pretenſions to the Kingdom might ceaſe.
The Duke aſſented, and Articles being agreed upon and
performed, the War betwixt him and <hi>Caſtile</hi> ended. He
being with the King at <hi>Coimbra,</hi> a <hi>Caſtilian</hi> was there
burnt, for contriving to Poyſon him. Soon after, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>

then delivered up, the Defendants having only leave to
depart without Arms. It was remarkable at this Siege,
that Two Women,<note place="margin">A combat betwixt two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> one of the Town, and the other of
the Camp, challenged each other, and fought; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was Victorious. Hence the King marched to <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
and in <hi>September,</hi> to the Province of <hi>Alentejo;</hi> where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the middle of <hi>October,</hi> after a ſtout Defence, the
Town and Caſtle of <hi>Campo-Major</hi> were taken by force.
At the beginning of the following Year,<note place="margin">1389.</note> the King being
at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> one of the Queens Ladies, called <hi>Beatrix,</hi> was
found to have admitted <hi>Ferdinand Alonſo,</hi> one of the
King's Bed-Chamber, and his Favourite, to her Bed. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he was apprehended, and having made his Eſcape
from the Officer, took Sanctuary in the Church. Thence
the King himſelf went to drag him, and tho' he urged he
was married, cauſed him to be burnt. The Lady went
away to <hi>Caſtile</hi> to her Mother. Embaſſadors came to the
King, being then in the Province between the Rivers
<hi>Duero</hi> and <hi>Minho,</hi> propoſing a Truce for ſome Months,
and ſo Commiſſioners were appointed to treat with him;
and in the mean while, the King, to loſe no time, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged

Nevertheleſs, the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> ceaſed not to make
mighty preparations for War; but his Deſigns were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by Death, which happened to him by a fall from

and two <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ships laden with Warlike Stores, were
taken off of Cape S. <hi>Vincent.</hi> At the ſame time, the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilians</hi>
made Incurſions, waſting all the open Country;
But the Conſtable defeated a Party of 400 of them that
was returning home with a rich Booty. <hi>Campo-Mayor</hi>
was ſoon after taken by the King. Having thus ſecured
themſelves againſt their Enemy, the King and Conſtable
gave themſelves ſome Repoſe. The latter diſtributed
moſt of what the King had beſtowed on him for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
on ſuch Gentlemen as had always adhered to him.
On the contrary, the King now eſtabliſhed on the
Throne, took back to himſelf much of what he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on many great Men for their good Service in the
War. As the Conſtable had received moſt, this fell
heavieſt upon him; and therefore he reſolved to depart
the Kingdom; but the King returning part of what he
had taken from him, with difficulty perſwaded him to
ſtay. The taking of <hi>Badajoz,</hi> and <hi>Albuquerque</hi> before
mentioned, had renewed the War, and the Country was
now again in Hoſtile manner waſted on both ſides, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

Truce, a perpetual Peace began to be diſcourſed of. King

be Knighted in the Field,<note place="margin">1412.</note> than in the Court. The Deſign
they fixed upon, was the taking of <hi>Ceuta</hi> on the Coaſt
of <hi>Africk,</hi> which they acquainted the King withal, and
he approving thereof, enjoyned them to keep it ſecret.
To this end, Two Gallyes were ſent to view the Place,

They blamed the King for committing the care of the
Realm to a Woman, ſhe a Forreigner, and what they
moſt reſented, a <hi>Caſtilian,</hi> as they termed her, tho' ſhe
was Daughter to the King of <hi>Aragon.</hi> The Princes, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to the late King, were the Heads of theſe Factions,
and particularly Prince <hi>Peter,</hi> who was always an Enemy
to the Queen. Prince <hi>Alonſo</hi> being proclaimed King, in the
Sixth Year of his Age, on the Tenth of <hi>September,</hi> in the
Town of <hi>Tomar,</hi> the Second Day after his Father's Death,
Queen <hi>Ellenor</hi> took upon her the Government, as had
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:54712:151"/>
been ordained by her Husband's Will, and ſo far laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
all former Animoſity with Prince <hi>Peter,</hi> that they
did nothing without his Advice, and deſired him joyntly
with her to Sign the Writs of Summons for the <hi>Cortes</hi> or
Parliament. Before the <hi>Cortes</hi> could meet, Prince <hi>Peter,</hi>
upon pretence of Zeal to ſecure the Succeſſion, in Caſe the
Young King ſhould die before he was Marriageable, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his younger Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to be Sworn Heir to
the Crown conditionally, if the other died without Iſſue.
The Queen pleaſed with theſe outward ſhows of Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Prince <hi>Peter,</hi> diſcovered to him, That the King her
Husband had declared to his Confeſſor, it was his Will,
that the preſent King <hi>Alonſo</hi> ſhould marry <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
Daughter of the ſaid Prince <hi>Peter;</hi> to which ſhe willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſented, and deſired it might be immediatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
The Prince, tho' aſtoniſhed at ſo great a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
accepted the offer. No ſooner was this noiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
but <hi>Alonſo,</hi> Earl of <hi>Barcelos,</hi> Baſtard-Brother to

The Nobility envying Prince <hi>Peter</hi> the Honour of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
his Daughter to the King, Conſpired againſt him.
However, it was carried in this Parliament, That the
Queen ſhould have the Education of the King, and Prince
<hi>Peter</hi> the Power of the Government. She was content;
but his Adverſaries ſtickled againſt this Reſolution, ſo
that they came to be divided; the Nobility affirming the
Queen ought to Govern, and the Commons aſſerting it
was their Right to nominate the Prince a Protector.
Prince <hi>Henry</hi> mediated between them, allotting the Queen
the Charge of the King and the Revenue, appointing the
Prince to Defend the Kingdom, and allowing Earl <hi>Alonſo</hi>
to take Charge of the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, with the
Advice of the Council, and Approbation of the Queen
and Prince, directing the <hi>Cortes</hi> to meet Yearly to ſettle
all greater Matters. Prince <hi>Peter,</hi> tho' nothing was left
him but the bare Title of Protector, ſubmitted rather
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:54712:151"/>
than embroil the Kingdom. Earl <hi>Alonſo,</hi> tho' he had
more than he could have demanded, was diſſatisfied;
and the Queen, puſhed on by the Prince's Adverſaries,
would part with nothing. The mutinous People obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Queen to accept of what was allotted her. Earl
<hi>Alonſo</hi> ſent his Son to demand of Prince <hi>Peter</hi> the Note
the Queen had given him, for Security of the King's
Marrying his Daughter; he, in ſcorn, tore it in pieces,
and ſo returned it.</p>
                  <p>3. Embaſſadors from <hi>Caſtile</hi> had been ſome time in
<hi>Portugal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> ſent away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> and could not be heard by reaſon of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Diſorders. At length they had Audience of the
Queen at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where they propoſed, in the Name of
King <hi>John</hi> the Second of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> That the Biſhops, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
during the Schiſm, ſhould be reſtored; That the

ſubmit themſelves, as they had been before, to thoſe of
<hi>Calatrava</hi> and <hi>Avis</hi> in <hi>Caſtile;</hi> That ſome <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
Biſhopricks, formerly ſubject to the Archiepiſcopal See
of <hi>Sevil,</hi> ſhould return to its Obedience. After ſome
Debate, they were ſent away without any Anſwer, which
was to be given by <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Embaſſadors appointed to
follow them. The People were not at all pleaſed with
the Queen's Adminiſtration, and preſſed Prince <hi>Peter</hi> to
take it upon himſelf. She flying from the Plague, then
in the City, retired to Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> where ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
of the Princeſs <hi>Joanna,</hi> afterwards Queen of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi>
and received Letters from the Pope, condoling the
Death of the King, and adviſing her not to deliver <hi>Ceuta</hi>
for Prince <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> Prince <hi>Peter,</hi> ſtirred up by the
People to take upon him the Government, and adviſed
to it by his Brother, Prince <hi>John,</hi> to prevent a Civil War,
delayed the time. At length, the People, wholly averſe

enter upon the Adminiſtration of the Publick Affairs,
and he, tho' diſpleaſed with the Queen, pacified the
Multitude, perſwading them to put off that Deſign till
the Meeting of the <hi>Cortes</hi> or Parliament.</p>
                  <p>4. The Queen privately writ to all the Members of
Parliament to come armed,<note place="margin">Tumults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Queen.</note> that they might ſuppreſs
the Rabble. But Prince <hi>Peter</hi> underſtanding it, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
charged them to be ready to obey his Orders.
This done, he took leave of the Queen in a courſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which Preſident made her the more ſlighted,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:54712:152"/>
ſhe being ſenſible of it, ſpeedily removed to <hi>Alenquer.</hi>
The Citizens of <hi>Lisbon</hi> elected a Standard-bearer, and
held Seditious Meetings, in contempt of the Queen's
Letters. The Archbiſhop fortified himſelf againſt the
Citizens, they ſtopped his Revenue, ſent Complaints
againſt him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and he was forced to fly to <hi>Caſtile.</hi>
The Multitude, headed by a Cooper, declared Prince
<hi>Peter</hi> ſhould Govern, and a Taylor ratify'd this Decree.
Thus the Kingdom was diſpoſed of by a Cooper and a
Taylor. The Governour of the Caſtle of <hi>Lisbon</hi> held
for the Queen, but being ſore preſſed by the People, was
forced to ſurrender it to Prince <hi>John.</hi> Prince <hi>Peter</hi> ſent
to Summons the Queen to the Parliament; ſhe replyed,
ſhe would not go, unleſs he reſigned all Claim to the
Government; but he rather choſe to ſtand to the Election
made of him by the Cooper and the Taylor.<note place="margin">Prince <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> made Regent by a Cooper and a Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, Heads of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> The Prince

confirmed to him by the <hi>Cortes</hi> or Parliament, to
which the Young King was brought, after ſufficient Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
given his Mother that he ſhould be reſtored to
her. Nevertheleſs, he was forcibly taken from her, and
ſhe retired to <hi>Sintra.</hi> Thence ſhe craved Aſſiſtance of
her Brothers, the Princes of <hi>Aragon,</hi> who ſent Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
to intercede for her, but they were diſmiſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Anſwer. She ceaſed not to make Friends in
<hi>Navarre</hi> and <hi>Aragon,</hi> and the Prince ſecured <hi>Caſtile</hi> to
his Party. The Queen, in order to make her Eſcape,
ſent away her Plate and Jewels, which were of a great
Value, to be kept in the Caſtle of <hi>Albuquerque.</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
came from <hi>Caſtile</hi> to require ſhe might either
be reſtored to the Government, or have leave to depart
the Kingdom. But no ſatisfactory Anſwer being given
them, ſhe hereupon made her Eſcape, with her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Joanna,</hi> born after the Death of the King.</p>
                  <p>5. The Queen being miſſing,<note place="margin">Civil War in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi>
                     </note> all was in Confuſion.
<hi>Crato,</hi> and all the Caſtles ſubject to that Priory, held
for her, and thus the Civil War commenced. Some
Places were taken by the Prince, and he reſolved to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege
the Queen in the Town of <hi>Crato,</hi> but ſhe having
called ſome <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Troops to her Aſſiſtance, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
much havock, withdrew into <hi>Caſtile. Alonſo,</hi> Earl
of <hi>Barcelos,</hi> ſtill held out for the Queen, but his Son
following the Prince, brought him over to that Party,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54712:152"/>
tho' not without difficulty. Thus, for ſome time, all
Storms ſeemed to be blown over. About this time was
brought from <hi>Rome</hi> a Diſpenſation for the Young King
to Marry Prince <hi>Peter</hi>'s Eldeſt Daughter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as
alſo the Orders of <hi>Santiago</hi> and <hi>Avis</hi> in <hi>Portugal</hi> were
exempted from any Subjection to the Orders in <hi>Castile.</hi>
The Diſpenſation being come, the King was marryed by
the Conſent of the <hi>Cortes,</hi> then ſitting, to the Regent's
Daughter,<note place="margin">1441.</note> at <hi>Obidos</hi> on the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1441. The
Bridegroom was then Ten Years of Age,<note place="margin">The Young King mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Regent's Daughter.</note> and the Bride
Seven or Eight. The Queen Dowager ſtill preſſed to
be reſtored to the Government, and the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi>
ſent ſeveral Embaſſages in her behalf, which nothing
availing, it was feared a War would enſue; but that
King dying, all that Negotiation fell to nothing. Thus
the Queen Dowager being forſaken on all hands, and
having ſpent her Treaſure in ſolliciting to make War
upon <hi>Portugal,</hi> went away at laſt to <hi>Toledo,</hi> where ſhe
lived upon Charity, and there died, as was ſuſpected,
poiſoned by the Regent, tho others ſay, by D. <hi>Alvaro de

                  </p>
                  <p>6. The King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> being jealous of the <hi>Aragonian,</hi>
asked ſome Supplies of Men out of <hi>Portugal.</hi> They were
accordingly ſent him, under the Command of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
<hi>Peter,</hi> Son to the Regent; but there being no

in it till he were of riper Years. Next, he ratified
his Marriage with that Prince's Daughter, and then went
away to <hi>Alcaçaras,</hi> where the Embaſſador of <hi>Caſtile</hi>
was Proxy for his Maſter in the Ceremony of Contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Daughter to Prince <hi>John,</hi> to that
King. There alſo the Lady <hi>Beatrix,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
was contracted to Prince <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Brother to that
King. Prince <hi>Peter</hi> by this time thought he had wholly
gained over all his Enemies that oppoſed his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Government, but now it appeared it was
but a counterfeit Reconciliation. The Duke of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza,</hi>
                     <pb n="284" facs="tcp:54712:153"/>
the Earl of <hi>Ourem,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lisbon</hi>
prevailed with the King to remove him from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
laying Diſloyalty to his Charge, and they at
the ſame time diſplaced all Officers, as well Civil as
Military, that had been preferred by him. Not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
they accuſed him of aſpiring to the Crown, and ſo
far prevailed, as to have him baniſhed the Court; which
done, ſeveral Libels were diſperſed abroad, fraught with
nothing but Reflections upon him, and many Articles
laid to his charge, were Judicially examined. Prince
<hi>Henry</hi> came from <hi>Algarve</hi> to Court, to vindicate his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Honour, but to little purpoſe, becauſe he was
look'd upon to be no leſs guilty than the other, and both
of them were charged with poiſoning King <hi>Edward,</hi>
Queen <hi>Ellenor,</hi> and Prince <hi>John.</hi> D. <hi>Alvaro de Almada,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Abranchez,</hi> in the King's Preſence challenged
any Man that ſhould lay blemiſh on the Prince's Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
but the King was carryed away to <hi>Sintra</hi> by his
Favourites, that he might not give ear to thoſe that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
Prince <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. The King from <hi>Sintra</hi> iſſued out his Orders,<note place="margin">Prince <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, in Arms, and declared Rebel.</note> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
all Perſons to Converſe and hold Correſpondence
with the Prince; alſo Summoning all the Queen his
Mother's Servants, who had been diſcarded, to appear,
and put in their Claims; and Commanding the Prince
not to depart from his own Lands without the King's
leave. He was alſo commanded to deliver up all the
Arms that were in <hi>Coimbra,</hi> which he refuſed to do. The
Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> being called to Court, was to paſs
through the Prince's Lands, and therefore intended to
Travel well attended; but the Prince marched out with
Forces to oppoſe him, and tho' ſeveral times Orders were
brought him from the King, to return to <hi>Coimbra,</hi> he
ſtill advanced towards the Duke, who was forced
privately to fly,<note place="margin">1449.</note> and make his eſcape to <hi>Santarem,</hi> where
the Court then was. Hereupon he was declared a Rebel
and Traytor, and Forces were raiſed with Expedition
againſt him. D. <hi>Sancho de Noronha,</hi> Earl of <hi>Odemira,</hi>
was ſent with Forces againſt the Conſtable, Prince <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Son, who fled to <hi>Caſtile,</hi> where he found not ſuch kind
Entertainment as he expected. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being
the Prince's Daughter, ſtudied how to ſave her Father,
and gave him Advice, that the Fifth of <hi>May</hi> was the
day appointed to Beſiege him. Then ſhe went to the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54712:153"/>
King to beg Pardon for him, which the King ſaid he
would grant, provided the Prince himſelf would beg it,
acknowledging his Faults. He did ſo in a Letter to the
King, but the Queen ſhewing him her Letter, wherein
the Prince vindicated himſelf, and ſaid, he complyed ſo
far only to ſatisfie her; the King ſaid, ſince he did not
really acknowledge his faults, he merited no Pardon.
The Prince's Enemies, to prevent the Queen's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
for him, kept him as much from her as they
could, and impriſoned D. <hi>Alvaro de Caſtro,</hi> a Man of a
moſt beautiful Perſon, and excellent Behaviour, as ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accuſed of too much Familiarity with the Queen, but
the King knowing well her Vertue, cauſed D. <hi>Alvaro</hi> to
be ſet at Liberty, and did him great Honour.</p>
                  <p>8. The King had now gathered a numerous Army,
but could not ſet forward for want of Proviſions and
Carriages.<note place="margin">The King comes to a Battle with the Rebels.</note> But the Prince on his part ſet forward from
<hi>Coimbra</hi> with 1000 Horſe, and 5000 Foot, and came
within five Leagues of <hi>Santarem</hi> without meeting any
Oppoſition. There he was adviſed to return to <hi>Coimbra,</hi>
but he choſe to advance towards <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and by the way
put to Death about fifty Horſe of the King's, that at a

called <hi>Alfarreveira,</hi> he there choſe a convenient Ground
for a ſmall Body to oppoſe a greater, for he had not yet
8000 Men, and the King's Army conſiſted of above 30000.
By that Multitude he found himſelf encompaſſed on the
<hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>May.</hi> Proclamation was made, declaring all
Traytors that ſhould thenceforth adhere to the Prince;
yet none forſook him, but ſome of the King's Army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
to him. Some Shot of Muſquets and Croſs-bows
flying from the King's Camp to the Prince's, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
with ſome Cannon, one of the Bullets whereof
falling near the King's Tent, ſo enraged his Army, that
they immediately, without Orders, fell on, and in a
moment broke and put to flight the Prince's Forces. He
himſelf fighting reſolutely,<note place="margin">Prince <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> killed.</note> was ſhot through with an
Arrow, and died. His inſeparable Friend, the Earl of
<hi>Abranchez,</hi> having ſworn not to forſake him in Death,
after having performed incredible Acts of Bravery, was
there alſo ſlain. Moſt of the Prince's followers were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
taken or killed. His Body was left three days in
the Field, and then being laid upon a Ladder, four
Country men carryed it to the poor Church of <hi>Alverca,</hi>
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:54712:154"/>
where it was buried. The King was received at <hi>Lisbon</hi>
in Triumphant manner. Many Perſons were executed
on Account of theſe Troubles, and their Heirs, to the
Fourth Generation, declared Infamous. The Prince's
Enemies fearing the Queen might ſome time or other
Revenge the Death of her Father, adviſed the King to
be divorced from her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he received her with all the
marks of True Love and Affection. They begged of
him ſome Towns that had belonged to the Prince, which
he freely gave them; but the Cities of <hi>Porto</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talegre</hi>
would not ſubmit to be given away to any Body,
and were therefore annexed to the Crown.</p>

Pope <hi>Calixtus</hi> ſtirred up the Chriſtian Princes to
unite their Forces againſt the Common Enemy. Our
King offered to ſerve in Perſon one Year with 12000
Men, but all theſe Projects fell to nothing. Our Queen

ſhe had to that Name. He was ſworn Prince,
being but a Month old, with great Solemnity. The
Queen upon this Occaſion obtained leave of the King,
that the Body of her Father, Prince <hi>Peter,</hi> might be

The Town of <hi>Azamor</hi> in <hi>Africk</hi> ſent this

them; but the particulars of thoſe Actions belong to

firſt entertained them; but afterwards being ſenſible of
their wicked Practices, for that pretending to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
they ceaſed not to Judaize, he ſent out his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
who burnt ſome, chaſtiſed others, and filled all the
Priſons with them. This made many of them fly over
into <hi>Africk,</hi> where they profeſſed themſelves openly
<hi>Jews;</hi> whereupon the King forbid any more paſſing over
thither, upon pain of Death; giving them Liberty, at
the ſame time, to remove to any Chriſtian Country. But
tho' it happened ſome Years latter, let us here relate what
was done in this caſe. In the Year 1492. vaſt multitudes
of <hi>Jews</hi> came out of <hi>Caſtile</hi> into <hi>Portugal,</hi> engaging to
pay the King a certain number of Ducats for each Head,
and only deſiring to be permitted to paſs through the
Kingdom. Eight Months were allotted them to ſtay,
and certain Ports aſſigned them to Embark. The Term
expiring, many went over to the Coaſt of <hi>Fez,</hi> where
they were plundered and abuſed by the <hi>Moors,</hi> having
been little better treated by the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> Many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Caſtile,</hi> pretending they were converted, and
many ſtay'd in <hi>Portugal</hi> under the ſame colour. The
King, the following Year, finding them obſtinate in their
wicked Practices, made all that could be found Slaves;
and taking their Children away, ſent them to the Iſland
of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> to be there brought up Chriſtians. Thus
the <hi>Jews</hi> came firſt to mix their Race with that of the
Ancient <hi>Portugueſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. The King, notwithſtanding it was a time of Peace,
ceaſed not to lay up Magazines in all his Garriſons,<note place="margin">1488.</note> and
fortified the Town of <hi>Olivença,</hi> which alarmed the King
and Queen of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> but he ſatisfied them, and went
on with what he had begun. In <hi>Africk,</hi> D. <hi>Vaſco Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinho,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Borba,</hi> with only 70 Horſe, defeated 450
<hi>Moors,</hi> and took their Commander, who lay in wait to

the King ſent over 150 Horſe, and ſome Foot, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage

Church of <hi>Belem,</hi> where his Son built him a ſtately

King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> as to Stature, was tall, ſomewhat lean,
his Hair dark-brown, his Forehead high, his Eyes green

down, his Fingers reached below his knees. He was
much addicted to all Sports, as Riding, Dancing, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,

and the Firſt, by his Second Wife, born
at <hi>Lisbon</hi> on the 6th. of <hi>June,</hi> 1502, about Two in the
Morning. It was obſervable, that this being the midſt of
Summer, when the Weather is uſually ſettled fair, juſt
at that time, there aroſe ſuch a terrible Storm of Wind,
Rain, Thunder and Lightning, that none living had ever
ſeen the like. Whilſt this Prince was Baptizing, there
broke out ſuch a Fire in the Palace, as alarmed the
whole Court, and gave occaſion to various Conjectures
on what it might Prognoſticate.<note place="margin">150<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Year old, when his Father Aſſembling the <hi>Cortes,</hi> or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> cauſed him to be ſworn Heir to the
Crown. At three Years of Age he was weaned. Being
come out of his Infancy, he was given in charge to
<hi>Gonzalo Figueyra,</hi> a Noble Citizen of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the Queen
his Mother ſtill overſeeing his Education. The Biſhop
of <hi>Tangier</hi> taught him his Grammar, and <hi>Lewis Teyxeyra</hi>
inſtructed him in the Laws, yet he profited little in
either, never thoroughly underſtanding any Book that
belonged to them. Nor was he more ſucceſsful in Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
taught him by <hi>Thomas de Torres,</hi> then Famous in
that Science and Phyſick. In ſhort, at the end of his
Studies, the Prince was found very ignorant; for tho'
he had an excellent Memory, he never applyed himſelf
to Learning, and his Maſters feared diſobliging him. In
the Year 1512. the Prince fell down from a Gallery in
the Palace,<note place="margin">1512.</note> ſo that for 24 hours the Doctors deſpaired
of his Life. After that, he came to himſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
a ſmall ſcar of a hurt received in the fall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
on his forehead. Next, he had a violent Fit of
Sickneſs, which once paſſed, he continued healthy all
the remaining part of his Life. At this Age the King
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:54712:176"/>
began to make himſelf acquainted with Buſineſs, to
which he applyed himſelf better than to his Book.</p>
                  <p>2. The King,<note place="margin">1515.</note> later than had been expected, ſettled
the Prince's Family, and appointed all the Officers of
his Houſhold, among which, his principal Favourites
were D. <hi>Lewis de Silveyra,</hi> and D. <hi>Antony de Ataide.</hi> D.
<hi>Lewis de Silveyra</hi> was ſuſpected to incenſe the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Father, after his marrying Queen <hi>Ellenor,</hi> Siſter
to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, once deſigned for the Prince, as was
ſaid in the forgoing Chapter.<note place="margin">1519.</note> Hereupon D. <hi>Lewis</hi> was
baniſhed the Court, but as ſoon as ever King <hi>John</hi> came
to the Crown, he was recalled. It being the Cuſtom to
Proclaim the new King the third day after the Death of
his Predeceſſor,<note place="margin">1521.</note> this Solemnity was, for ſeveral urgent
Reaſons,<note place="margin">King <hi>John</hi> proclaim'd.</note> deferred till the ſixth day, when it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

that a Fleet was fitting in <hi>France,</hi> in order
to make new Diſcoveries in <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Braſil,</hi> and that
ſeveral <hi>French</hi> Pirates infeſted the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Seas, ſent
D. <hi>John de Silveyra</hi> to put that King in mind of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Friendſhip betwixt thoſe two Crowns, and require

<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, to offer him <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the King's
Eldeſt Siſter, in Marriage. Yet of a ſudden his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
were altered, and he ordered only to Complement
that Prince upon his happy Arrival in <hi>Spain.</hi> The cauſe
of this ſudden change was this: The Ship, called the
<hi>Victory,</hi> the firſt that ſailed round the World, and the
only one that eſcaped of thoſe that diſcovered the

leaving behind their long Boat, with thirteen Men, who
were ſent away Priſoners to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> whilſt the Ship made
her Voyage, and arrived ſafe at <hi>Sevil.</hi> The Emperor
complained hereof to the King, and he again that the
Emperor's Ships invaded his Conqueſts, demanding the
Lading of the Ship <hi>Victory.</hi> D. <hi>Lewis de Silveyra</hi> ſpent

Eight Months in his Embaſſy at the Emperor's Court,
without diſpatching any Buſineſs, and then returning to
<hi>Portugal,</hi> found the King at <hi>Almeirin,</hi> where at his firſt
acceſs, forgetting or neglecting to kiſs his Hand, he found
himſelf quite out of favour; for D. <hi>Antony de Atayde,</hi>
making his Advantage of the others abſence, had quite
worked him out of his Maſter's Affections. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
D. <hi>Lewis</hi> continued at Court, without ever expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the leaſt Reſentment for his Fall.</p>
                  <p>3. D. <hi>Antony de Atayde,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of D. <hi>Antony de Atayde</hi> the King's Favourite.</note> now the only Favourite, was
a Perſon well deſerving that high Honour for his ſingular
Prudence and Moderation. There are ſufficient Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the former, and I will bring one that may
fully evince the latter. The Lord of <hi>Azambuja,</hi> Head
of one of the ancienteſt Families in <hi>Portugal,</hi> deſigned
to ſell that Town to ſupply his preſent wants. The King
told D. <hi>Antony,</hi> it would be proper for him to buy it,
becauſe it joyned to his Eſtate. He anſwered, It was
more for his Highneſs's Reputation, to ſupply the wants
of ſo Ancient and Honourable a Family, than to ſuffer
it to fall to nothing, by ſelling an Eſtate of that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
The King took his Advice, and ſo generouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that Gentleman, that he was enabled to preſerve
his Patrimony. This is a good Remark for thoſe, who,
to advance their own Fortunes, are ſo far from regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Private Perſon, that they ſtick not to ruin Kings,
and overturn Kingdoms. It was now thought time that
the King ſhould Marry, and <hi>James,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bragança,</hi>
propoſed to him Queen <hi>Ellenor,</hi> his Mother-in-law, as
Wife to the late King, who was vaſtly Rich. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
being noiſed abroad, was ſo well liked, that the
Council of <hi>Lisbon</hi> addreſſed him, in behalf of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and the whole Kingdom, praying he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend
to it. The King could not approve of Marrying
his Father's Wife, and was freed from their Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by the Emperor's deſiring he would ſuffer his Siſter
to return to <hi>Caſtile,</hi> which was accordingly performed.</p>

and other Neceſſaries. That the third part ſhould be
given to her at her Marriage, and that her Joynture
ſhould be 10000 Ducats a Year, with all the Lands and
Towns the Queens uſed to poſſeſs. The former Peace
was confirmed, and Supplies promiſed reciprocally in
caſe of need. About the end of the Year ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to the Borders by the Biſhop of <hi>Siguença,</hi> and
Duke of <hi>Vejar,</hi> and there delivered to the Princes <hi>Lewis</hi>
and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſent to attend her. The King received
her at <hi>Crato,</hi> and ſhe proved one of the beſt Queens in
the World. She was happy in bringing forth many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but unfortunate in the ſhortneſs of their Lives,
which gave occaſion to the Multitude to ſay, It was a
Judgment of God on the King, for the Familiarity he
was ſuſpected to have with the Queen his Mother-in-law.<note place="margin">1525.</note>
At the beginning of the Year a motion was made
of a Match betwixt the Emperor and our King's Siſter,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth Marries <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Siſter to King <hi>John.</hi>

of the Diſpenſation, and the King defray the
Charge of her Journey, as had been done in the Marriage
of the Emperor's Siſter; but the Portion now given
with this Princeſs, far exceeded that, for it amounted
almoſt to a Million of Crowns. In <hi>November</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
Embaſſador was contracted for the Emperor to
the Princeſs, and the day after they ſet forward with
the King and Princes.</p>
                  <p>5. The Empreſs's Journey into <hi>Spain</hi> was delayed till
the Diſpenſation came from <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1526.</note> and then being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to the Frontiers by many of the Nobility, ſhe
was there delivered to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Noblemen ſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

with the Affair, ſo mitigated that King, and ſoothed him
with ſuch convincing Reaſons, that he appeared wholly
ſatisfied, and by his Prudence, a Breach that might have
happened between the two Crowns, ſo ſtrictly allied
for many Years, was prevented. In <hi>August, Edward,</hi>
the King's Baſtard-Son came to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and was received

amazed. From Cape S. <hi>Vincent</hi> the King ſent Meſſengers

<hi>Africk</hi> with great Joy by his Subjects; but not with much
Terror of his Enemies, for they perceived his Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were not ſuitable to the Undertaking. He hunted
there as if he had been at home, and made ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads
into the Country, which provoked the <hi>Moors</hi> in
great numbers, under the Command of the <hi>Alcayde Cid

Enemy return upon them, they renewed the Fight with

Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third ſent him the Cardinal's Cap, and

Act as a Prelate; and tho' a Prince of the Church, he
performed all the Duties of a private Prieſt. He was

Conſideration that the Inheritance of the Crown ſhould

the Duke of <hi>Bragança,</hi> and other Perſons of Knowledge

Account of his Nephew's being dead or alive, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and a number of able Lawyers were ordered to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
what was to be done in that Caſe. They agreed,
the Cardinal, tho' a Prieſt, was capable of Inheriting
the Crown;<note place="margin">Cardinal <hi>Henry</hi> firſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</note> but it being yet doubtful what was become

                  </p>

                     </note> the
News of the King's Death was brought, and his Funeral
Obſequies were performed with general Lamentation.
On the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> after having ſaid Maſs, the
new King and Biſhop, <hi>Henry,</hi> proceeded to the Church
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54712:186"/>
of <hi>All-Saints</hi> Hoſpital, where he had before received the
Mitre, now to put on a Crown. He was the ſecond
<hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> for ſince the firſt, till him, none ever was
at once both Prieſt and King. The Ceremony of his
Inauguration was performed with no leſs Lamentation
than Pomp, and he returned from the Church to the
Palace a Temporal as well as Spiritual Prince. A few
days after his Exaltation, came the News, that <hi>Antony,</hi>
Baſtard-Son to Prince <hi>Lewis,</hi> having eſcaped out of Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
was at <hi>Arzila,</hi> and tho' much offended at him
before, he extreamly rejoyced to hear of his Safety.
<hi>Antony</hi> by his Affability had gained the Affections of all
Men, and the People looked upon him to have as good
a Title to the Crown as King <hi>John</hi> the Firſt had almoſt
two Ages before; and in Truth, the Right was the ſame,
for they were both Baſtards. <hi>Antony</hi> had fallen into the
Hands of a poor <hi>Moor,</hi> who ranſomed him for a ſmall
matter, being told, he was a Prieſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if not preſently
redeemed, would loſe his Benefice, and thereby become
incapable of paying his Ranſom. About 16000 Perſons
remained in Captivity, to Redeem whom, 20 <hi>Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>

but Pearls. F. <hi>Amador Rebelo,</hi> a Jeſuit, was ſent to
<hi>Argiers,</hi> to Ranſom thoſe that had been ſold thither.
King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> obtained of the <hi>Moors</hi> the Body of
King <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> which he afterwards brought into <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi>
He alſo redeemed the Duke of <hi>Barcelos,</hi> Son to

                  </p>
                  <p>3. No ſooner was the new King enthroned,<note place="margin">Several Pretenders to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Crown,</note> but all
thoſe who pretended a Right, began to put in their
Claims to the Inheritance of the Crown. <hi>Philip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of <hi>Spain,</hi> afterwards the Firſt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſent
D. <hi>Chriſtopher de Moura</hi> to condole with King <hi>Henry</hi> for
the late Loſs, and to Congratulate his Acceſſion to the
Crown, without mentioning his Title to the Succeſſion,
but with private Inſtructions to advance his Intereſt.
The Candidates were, Firſt, King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> as
Son to the Empreſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Daughter to King <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi>
                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:54712:186"/>
Secondly, the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Bragança,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> who was Brother to the Empreſs.
The difference betwixt theſe two Pretenders was, that
the Lady, tho' a Female, claimed the Crown, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
of the Male; and the King, as being himſelf
the Male, tho' deſcended of a Female. Of theſe the
former was the better Title without diſpute, but neither
ſo good as that of <hi>Alexander,</hi> Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> in the
Right of his Mother, who was elder Siſter to the Lady
<hi>Katherine.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had a Title, but not ſo
good, by his Wife, the Princeſs <hi>Beatrix,</hi> Daughter to
King <hi>Emanuel. Antony,</hi> Prior of <hi>Crato,</hi> pretended to be
Lawful Son to Prince <hi>Lewis,</hi> Brother to Prince <hi>Edward,</hi>
the Empreſs, and Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy;</hi> but having never
been owned as ſuch by his Father, or any other Perſon,
that was meer Pretence. The People pleaded, the Right
of Election was in them, and ſhewed Preſcription, as
in the caſe of their firſt King, of King <hi>Alonſo</hi> the Third,
and King <hi>John</hi> the Firſt, all which in reality were but
Fortunate Uſurpers. The Pope alſo would Inherit this
Crown, as being now devolved to the Church, being in
the Hands of a Cardinal, and urged, that it had been
Tributary to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> which was true, but a
poor Title for Inheritance. <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> Queen
of <hi>France,</hi> alledged, ſhe was deſcended of King <hi>Alonſo</hi>
the Third, by his firſt Wife <hi>Maud,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Bologne,</hi>
on whom he had a Son; but her Title was rejected, as
over antiquated, being above 330 Years ſtanding. <hi>Savoy</hi>
and <hi>Parma</hi> were ſoon thrown out, becauſe too weak to
carry on their Pretences, not becauſe they wanted a
Title. The People attempted to carry it by Election,
but miſcarried. The Diſpute reſted betwixt <hi>Philip</hi> of
<hi>Spain, Katherine</hi> of <hi>Bragança,</hi> and <hi>Antony,</hi> Prior of <hi>Crato,</hi>
we ſhall ſoon ſee where the Controverſie ended.</p>
                  <p>4. Several Methods were propoſed to determine theſe
Differences.<note place="margin">Means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sons Marry the Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Bragança.</hi>
Others, more inclined to <hi>Antony,</hi> would have that Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
given to him. Others there were, who adviſed the
Cardinal, tho' old, and a Prieſt, ſhould Marry. Many
Pamphlets were ſpread abroad, ſome of them againſt
King <hi>Philip,</hi> and others for him, which laſt were ſo well
penned, that they ſeem to have inclined King <hi>Henry</hi> to
his Intereſt, as they did many others throughout the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:54712:187"/>
Kingdom. But the City of <hi>Lisbon</hi> openly declared its
averſion to him, offering to raiſe 20000 Men, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to burn the Houſes of thoſe that favoured him.
<hi>Antony,</hi> Grand Prior of <hi>Crato,</hi> that is, of the Knights
of <hi>Malta</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> laboured in vain to prove himſelf
Legitimate, and King <hi>Henry</hi> ſeeing him perſiſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
in that Deſign, baniſhed him the Court. The
City of <hi>Lisbon</hi> now again preſſed King <hi>Henry</hi> to obtain
a Diſpenſation of the Pope to Marry; he excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
on account of his Eccleſiaſtical Dignity, rather than
his Age or Infirmities. No Excuſes availing, D. <hi>Duarte
de Caſtello-Branco,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ruy de Caſtanheda</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to go Embaſſadors to <hi>Rome;</hi> but they went not,
for the King ſtill urging his Inability, and his Infirmities
being apparent, his Excuſes were at laſt received.</p>
                  <p>5. Since there were no hopes of Iſſue in King <hi>Henry,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Five Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Govern after the King's Death.</note>
he was preſſed to declare who ought to Succeed him,
which he refuſed, leaving it to Governours and Judges
to determine after his Death. For appointing of them,
he preſently ſummoned the <hi>Cortes</hi> or Parliament, who
named Fifteen Perſons for Governours, of whom the
King choſe five, which were D. <hi>George de Almeyda,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> D. <hi>John Maſcarenhas, Francis de Sa,
James Lopez de Souſa,</hi> and D. <hi>John Tello de Meneſes.</hi>
Alſo 24 Lawyers were nominated, and of them 11
elected to be Judges; and the Names of them all to be
kept cloſe, till the Death of the King. All ſwore to
ſtand by theſe Decrees. The ſubſtance of the Oath
was,<note place="margin">The ſame appointed to decide the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Succeſſion.</note> That the King dying, they would obey the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
appointed, and would acknowledge him for
their Lawful Sovereign, that ſhould be declared ſuch by
them. The Duke of <hi>Bragança,</hi> as one of the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,
ſwore to ſtand to their Determination; the ſame
did <hi>Antony,</hi> the Grand Prior, yet afterwards he recanted
before the Pope's Nuncio, alledging, he had ſworn for
fear of his Unkle. King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Embaſſadors refuſed
to take the Oath for their Maſter, pleading, he was Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Heir of the Crown, and therefore not obliged to
allow of that Deciſion. The <hi>Cortes</hi> being broke up, each
of the Candidates, which were now but three, <hi>viz.</hi> King
<hi>Philip,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bragança,</hi> and the Grand Prior,
began to ſpeak their Thoughts more boldly. The two
latter were ſoon baniſhed the Court by King <hi>Henry;</hi>
who perceiving that <hi>Antony</hi> grew haughty, having
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:54712:187"/>
obtained a ſurreptitious Judgment of his Legitimacy,
got leave of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. to inſpect into and
determine that Affair. After ſome time ſpent in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
into it, he at length poſitively declared him Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legitimate.
The Grand Prior, diſmayed at this Sentence,
and the great Power of his Adverſary, propoſed to King
<hi>Philip</hi>'s Embaſſadors, that he would be content with the
Kingdom of <hi>Algarve,</hi> and Title of King, or elſe that
he might have the Government of the Kingdom for
Life, with a Revenue of 300000 Ducats, half of them
to remain to his Heirs. King <hi>Philip</hi> anſwered, That
Kingdom was too ſmall for ſo many Kings.</p>
                  <p>6. King <hi>Henry</hi> ceaſed not to proſecute the Grand
Prior, and ſent Orders to Apprehend him at <hi>Coimbra,</hi>
where he then was, but he made his Eſcape, and lurked
about in the Province between the Rivers <hi>Duero</hi> and
<hi>Minho.</hi> Next, he iſſued out his Proclamation, Summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to Surrender himſelf, but he obeyed not. The

Principal Members of the <hi>Cortes</hi> or Parliament, and the
Embaſſadors, before whom he declared himſelf for King

Lords Spiritual and Temporal were eaſily brought to

oppoſed it. Soon after, the King Aſſembles the <hi>Cortes,</hi>

Qualities, he was a better Prieſt than King. His firſt
Spiritual Promotion was to the Priorſhip of <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi>

the Counterfeit <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> after having been ſhewed at

the Son of a Maſon, who, like the other, became
an Eremite, and did much ſeeming Penance, laſhing
himſelf, and then crying out, where he might be heard,
<hi>O unhappy</hi> Sebaſtian, <hi>all thy Penance is but little, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of thy Crimes.</hi> A Rich Farmer, called <hi>Peter Alfonſo,</hi>
joyned with him, and concealed him, giving out Orders
in his Name. At length he gathered 800 Men, calling

the Daughter of the falſe Earl, ſhe being deſigned
Queen, and alſo the Wife of <hi>Antony Simoens,</hi> a Rich
Man. Whenſoever this Pageant King was forced to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
abroad, he wore a great pair of Spectacles, which
covered moſt part of his Face. He ſent a Son of <hi>Simoens</hi>
to the Governour <hi>Albertus,</hi> to Order him to quit the
Palace, for that he was coming to undeceive the People.
This Meſſenger being taken, and then let go, increaſed
the Opinion of the People, that it was King <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi>
becauſe <hi>Antony Simoens</hi> having known him, would not
otherwiſe have ſuffered his Son to go on that Meſſage.
The Judge of <hi>Torreſvedras</hi> was ordered to Apprehend
them, but he attempting it, was, together with his Clerk,
caſt headlong from a High Place, and killed: <hi>Gaſper

the Stile to be uſed in Letters, which till then cauſed
much Confuſion, every one aſpiring to greater Titles
than belonged to them. King <hi>Philip,</hi> provoked by the
many Wrongs done him by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> reſolved
upon the Conqueſt of <hi>England,</hi> and to that purpoſe
gathered a Mighty Fleet in the vaſt Port of <hi>Lisbon.</hi> It
contained 130 Sail, moſt of them very large, under the
Command of D. <hi>Alonſo Perez de Guzman,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> and Generaliſſimo. The Land Forces
amounted to 20000,<note place="margin">1588.</note> the Mariners above 11000. They

Sailing thence, the greateſt part of this Mighty Fleet

carryed it off, but was diſappointed by her being fired.
This done, he ſailed from the Iſlands. Prince <hi>Charles,</hi>
Son to King <hi>Philip,</hi> was naturally of a turbulent Spirit,
and is ſaid to have held Correſpondence with his Father's
Enemies, and to have practiſed againſt him. Hereupon
he was caſt into Priſon, and Judges appointed to inſpect
into the Cauſe, who paſſed Sentence of Death againſt
him. His Father allowed him no other Favour, than
to chooſe what Death he would die; and he ſaid, they
might kill him as they pleaſed. Being prepared for it,
four Slaves ſtrangled him with a Silken Rope. D. <hi>John</hi>
of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> tho' a Baſtard, was no leſs haughty, and
aſpired firſt, to the Kingdom of <hi>Tunis,</hi> then, to that of
<hi>England;</hi> but the King lowered all his haughty thoughts,

<hi>Philip</hi> having been ſome time ſick, at laſt was confined
to his Bed, as well by reaſon of Weakneſs, as that the
Gout was broke out in Sores upon his Hand, Foot, and
Knee. Fifty three days he lay in ſuch condition, that
his Bed could not be made, and on the laſt of them he
died. His Patience in his Sufferings was wonderful, for
he pityed thoſe that attended him more than he did
himſelf. Having performed all Offices of a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,

Inconveniences that attended it, ſtill deterred them.
400000 of theſe baſe People were diſperſed throughout
the Kingdom, who all upon the King's Edict departed the
Kingdom, having liberty to carry away with them all
they were worth. Upon the Birth-day of this King, a
Preacher Prophetically foretold the Baniſhment of the
<hi>Moriſcoes,</hi> threatning them with the New-born Prince.</p>
                  <p>2. Often did this King promiſe to Viſit his Realm of
<hi>Portugal</hi> in Perſon, but ſtill failed, being put by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
by his Favourites, who for their private Ends
diſſwaded this Journey, not regarding how much a King
loſs the Affections of his People, who never ſuffers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be ſeen by them.<note place="margin">1619.</note> At length, when leaſt expected,
he ſuddenly ſet out in <hi>April,</hi> 1619. bringing with him
Prince <hi>Philip,</hi>

(as his Father had done) he made his Publick Entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Lisbon</hi> on S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Day. His Reception was the greateſt
that ever till then had been heard of; for the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi>
raviſhed with Affection and Joy to ſee their Prince among
them, erected ſuch Fabricks on the Land, and made ſuch
mighty Works on the River, as ſeemed to fill, up both
thoſe Elements of Land and Water, and ſcarce left room
for the admiring Multitude to behold him that all thoſe
Expences were made for.<note place="margin">His Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> It is impoſſible to deſcribe the
particulars of this moſt Glorious Entry. The River <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
was covered with an innumerable multitude of Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
built in the ſhape of ſeveral Fiſhes and Sea-Monſters.
The King was brought in a Galley (attended by many
others) built with ſuch admirable Workmanſhip, that
the like was never before ſeen, and it obliterated the
Memory of the Famous one made by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> King of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:54712:197"/>
                     <hi>Egypt,</hi> which at that time was the Wonder of the World.
Whilſt this multitude of Veſſels rowed down the River,
the thundring of the Cannon from the Veſſels themſelves,
and from the Caſtle, ſhook the Earth, and rent the Air.
Being come on ſhoar, the King proceeded to the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral,
and thence to the Palace, entertaining his Lyes with
ſuch prodigious Sights of Gold and Silver, that the time
falling ſhort to view all, he returned the next day to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the lofty Fabricks, which expreſſed the greatneſs of
their Affection who received him. Such was the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
of the Piles erected, ſuch the Coſt beſtowed on
them, and ſuch the ſolid Strength of them, that they
ſeemed as if deſigned for many Ages, not for the uſe of
one only day, which was too ſhort a ſpace even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh
them.</p>
                  <p>3. The Majeſty of theſe Works was ſo amazing, that
the King, tho' uſed to Regal Entertainments, ſaid. He
never till that day thought himſelf a great King. Hereby
ſeeming to call <hi>Lisbon, Felicitas Philippica,</hi> as once <hi>Julius
Caeſar</hi> gave it the Name of <hi>Felicitas Julia.</hi> In the Palace
he performed the two Solemn Acts of Swearing the Prince
and holding the <hi>Cortes</hi> or Parliament,<note place="margin">He holds Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> which met with

                     </gap> the
end diſappointed them of their hopes. Firſt, for that the
King was ſcarce ſeen by his Subjects, and next, for the
unſatisfactory Anſwer he gave to their Demands. The
Reaſon of it was, that his coming to the Kingdom, and
calling the Parliament, were Actions proceeding from his
own Inclination; but the diſobliging of them, was wholly
the product of the ill Advice of his Miniſters. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
fearing he ſhould take an Affection to the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe,</hi>
and perhaps continue among them, were uneaſie
at the Splendor of his Entertainment, and ſo much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
had they over him, that he gave more Credit to
their Words, than to thoſe marks of Reſpect and Loyalty
he ſaw with his Eyes. This is the greateſt Misfortune can
befal a Prince, to be ſo led away and infatuated by the
Flatteries of Favourites, who only attend their private
Intereſt, as to forfeit the Affections of their People.
This is the height of Tyranny in Miniſters, to covet all
for themſelves, and allow nothing to others.</p>
                  <p>4. Seven Months the King ſpent in his Journey to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>

his Robes, with the Collar of the Golden Fleece, and the
Steptre in his Hand, repreſents him of a pleaſing Aſpect,
yet full of Majeſty. Of Stature, he was rather little, but
proportionable; his Forehead high, his Eyes blue, his Lips
thick, his Complexion fair, with a freſh Colour, his Hair
yellow, his whole Countenance beautiful, and repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much Grandeur. He was a moſt Holy Prince, and
at his Death ſeemed to have only one thing to lament,
which was, that he fulfilled what his Father had Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically
foretold, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſuffered his Favourites
to have ſo much the Aſcendant over him. Had he given
leſs Ear to his Miniſters (who always mind their own
Advantage, tho' with the loſs of their Maſter's) and been
more abſolute in taking his own meaſure, he had proved
one of the greateſt and moſt ſucceſsful Princes in the

Conqueſts to his Dominions, both in <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Africk.</hi>

again; and it is generally believed he never had to do
with any Woman but his Queen. His Iſſue was, Firſt,

                     <note place="margin">Prodigies.</note> was obſerved to ceaſe immediately after the
Image of the glorious Martyr S. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> had been

Journey to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> two Comets of a wonderful Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>2. The Arms of <hi>Spain</hi> were at this time employed in

to attempt the Conqueſt of that Country, and to that
effect, moved ſeveral of the Northern Princes, grown

They fitted out a Fleet in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi>

having paſſed the Line in 6 Degrees of South Latitude,
according to the Orders given, the Admiral opened his
Inſtructions, and found he was commanded to invade
<hi>Baya de Todos Santos,</hi> or the Bay of <hi>All-Saints.</hi> This Bay
is thought to be the greateſt in the World, and is the

along that Mountainous Shoar, extending out in length

had once a Court of Chancery, which has been taken

Night came on, and all the Inhabitants fled out of the

of <hi>Spain,</hi> without any appearance that the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi>
could ever be able to withdraw themſelves from
that Foreign Subjection. The Nobility of the Kingdom
durſt not appear in that Splendor which became their
Quality, or claim all the Priviledges due to their Birth,
for fear of raiſing a Jealouſie in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, at
a time when Riches, Birth, or Merit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>were thought ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to render a Man ſuſpicious, and cauſe him to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted.
The Gentry were in a manner baniſhed to their
Country Houſes, and the Commonalty groaned under
the heavy Burthen of the Taxes. The Count Duke <hi>de
Olivares,</hi> Prime Miniſter of State to <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth of
<hi>Spain,</hi> thought a new Conqueſt could never be too much
weakned. He knew that the Natural Antipathy which
was betwixt the two Nations could not but render the
Sovereignty of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> odious to the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi>
That it muſt be ever offenſive to them to ſee all Places
of Truſt filled by Strangers, or elſe by Men of no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
who were wholly devoted to the Intereſt of
<hi>Spain.</hi> Therefore he thought to ſecure his Maſters Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
by keeping the Nobility out of Employ, the
Gentry remote from Buſineſs, and the Commonalty ſo
poor, that they could not have the heart to aſpire to any
change. Beſides, he drew out of the Kingdom all the
Young Men that were fit to bear Arms, employing them
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:54712:202"/>
in Foreign Wars, leſt thoſe turbulent Spirits ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
the Peace of the Government. Yet this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which might have ſucceeded, if not puſhed on too
far, had a far different conſequence than was expected,
both by reaſon of the ill Circumſtances the Court of <hi>Spain</hi>
then lay under, as alſo becauſe of the Prime Miniſter's
Character, who was naturally moroſe and inflexible.
No pleaſing Methods were now uſed in raiſing of Taxes,
but they were rather collected as if they had been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions
gathered in an Enemy's Country. The <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi>
having now nothing more to loſe, and as little to
hope for, thought of caſting off that Subjection, which
they always believed unjuſt, and was now become inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
able.</p>

<hi>Portugal</hi> with the Title of Vice-Queen, yet ſhe bore only
the Title circumſcribed within a limited Power. The
whole Intrigue of the Government, and all the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was in the Hands of <hi>Michael de Vaſconcellos,</hi> a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe,</hi>
who, under the Character of Secretary of State,
was the abſolute Miniſter in the Kingdom. He received
his Orders immediately from the Count Duke, whoſe
Creature he was, and became moſt acceptable to him by
finding Methods to draw great Sums of Money out of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> and by ſowing the Seeds of Sedition among the
Nobility, favouring ſome, and depreſſing others, which
raiſed implacable Enmity betwixt them. This Diſcord
was the Miniſter's Security, he believing they could never
Plot againſt the Government, who meditated how to
exerciſe their Revenge upon one another.</p>
               <p>3. In all <hi>Portugal</hi> there was none but the Duke of
<hi>Bragança</hi> who could give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> any Diſturbance.<note place="margin">Only the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> could give the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie.</note>
That Prince was of a ſoft and agreeable Temper, much
given to his Eaſe, his Judgment rather ſound than
piercing; in Buſineſs he aimed at the main Point, and
could eaſily dive into ſuch Matters as he applyed himſelf
to, but loved not application. His Father, Duke <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius,</hi>
who was of a fiery Temper, had laboured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft
in him his Natural Hatred to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that
he might regard them as Uſurpers of his Right, and had
done all that in him was, to inſpire into him Ambition
and Reſolution enough to attempt the Recovery of a
Crown which was due to him. D. <hi>John</hi> had imbibed his
Father's Sentiments, but that in ſuch meaſure as was
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:54712:202"/>
moſt ſuitable to his Peaceable Temper. He hated the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> but not ſo as to ſeek Revenge with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of his Quiet. He was ambitious, and did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of aſcending the Throne of his Anceſtors, but was
not ſo impatient as his Father had been. He thought it
enough to keep within Proſpect of his Hopes, without
hazarding an eaſie Life, and more than Private Fortune
in Poſſeſſion, for a Crown that was very uncertain.
Doubtleſs, had he been the Man Duke <hi>Theodoſius</hi> would
have had him, he could never have compaſſed what he
aimed at. His Actions were ſo narrowly looked into
by the Count Duke's Order, that if he had not been ſo
entirely given up to his Eaſe and Pleaſure, he muſt of
neceſſity have been diſcovered; and if once diſcovered,
his Repoſe and Fortune had both been ſacrificed. The
Court of <hi>Spain</hi> would never have put ſuch Power into
his hands, and ſuffered him to live in the midſt of his
Country. Nature made him more Politick than Art
could have done. His Birth, Eſtate, and Right to the
Crown, were no Crimes, but his being Formidable, was
Crime enough, according to the Laws of true Policy.
He was not ignorant of it, and found there was no way
to wipe off that Guilt, but by rendring himſelf leſs to
be feared, and appearing wholly devoted to his Pleaſure.
Nothing was to be ſeen at <hi>Villavicioſa,</hi> the ordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence
of the Dukes of <hi>Bragança,</hi> but Hunting, Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſuch-like Country Divertiſements, as if Nature
and Fortune had conſpired to qualifie him for thoſe
Times. In ſhort, ſuch was his courſe of Life, as gave
not the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the leaſt Umbrage of his aſpiring to
the Crown, and yet it furniſhed the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> with
aſſured hopes of a wiſe and mild Government, if they
themſelves would attempt to Enthrone him.</p>
               <p>4. His Conduct could breed no Suſpicion,<note place="margin">The People of <hi>Evora</hi> Mutiny.</note> but an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
that happened ſome time before, in which he had
no hand, had begun to raiſe a Jealouſie in the Prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.
The People of <hi>Evora,</hi> provoked by certain new
Taxes, had mutinied, and in the heat of that Fury,
amidſt their Complaints againſt the Tyranny of the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> ſome Acclamations had been heard for the
Houſe of <hi>Bragança.</hi> Here it firſt appeared how much
<hi>Philip</hi> the Second erred in leaving within the Kingdom
a Family ſo Powerful, and that had ſo good a Title to
the Crown. Hereupon, the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> reſolved
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:54712:203"/>
to ſecure the Duke of <hi>Bragança,</hi> or at leaſt, to remove
him out of <hi>Portugal.</hi> Immediately the Government of
<hi>Milan</hi> was offered him, which he refuſed, pleading want
of Health, and Knowledge in the Affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi> The
Prime Miniſter ſeemingly approved of his Reaſons, but
found out another Method to draw him to Court. The
King being about to March to the Frontiers of <hi>Aragon,</hi>
to puniſh the Rebellion of the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> he wrote to
the Duke, exhorting him to be preſent in that Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at the Head of the Nobility of his Country. The
Duke,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> refuſes to go into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile.</hi>
                  </note> who was upon his Guard againſt all Artifices of
the Court, anſwered, He was not in a Condition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray
the Expence he muſt be at in that Expedition, to
ſupport the Grandeur of his Family. Theſe repeated
Denyals gave the Prime Miniſter ground to fear the
Duke, notwithſtanding his Natural Propenſion to Eaſe,
had ſtill ſome thoughts of a Crown. Conſidering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of what Importance it was to the King his Maſter,
to ſecure his Perſon, he omitted nothing that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the compaſſing his Deſign. But it being dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to uſe Force, becauſe of the great Affection the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi>
always bore to the Houſe of <hi>Bragança,</hi> he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to bring him to his beck by all imaginable exterior
marks of Affection, and of an entire Confidence in him.</p>
               <p>5. There was War at that time betwixt <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Duke made Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</note> and the <hi>French</hi> Fleet having appeared on the Coaſt
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> furniſhed the Prime Miniſter with a fair
Pretence for carrying on his Deſigns. It was requiſite
there ſhould be a General to Command the Forces that
were to Guard the Coaſt. This Commiſſion was ſent to
the Duke with ſuch an Abſolute Power, as ſeemed to
put the whole Kingdom into his hands: Yet this ſerved
only the better to hide the Bait. For at the ſame time,
D. <hi>Lope de Oſſorio,</hi> Admiral of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, had
Orders to put into the neareſt Port to the Duke, as if
he were drove in by ſtreſs of Weather, or on ſome other
Pretence, and having drawn him aboard, as to an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
to carry him away to <hi>Spain.</hi> But Fortune
ordered it otherwiſe, for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Admiral loſt ſeveral
Ships in a Storm, and the reſt being diſperſed, he could
not gain the Coaſt of <hi>Portugal.</hi> This no way diſcouraged
the Count Duke, who looked upon the Diſappointment
as meerly accidental, and therefore he laid his Project
another away, writing to D. <hi>John</hi> in ſuch terms, as
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:54712:203"/>
expreſſed the greateſt Confidence, lamenting the loſs of
the Fleet, which left the Coaſt open to be inſulted by
the Enemy, and adviſing him to viſit and ſtrengthen
thoſe Places that were moſt expoſed. At the ſame time
he ſent him 40000 Ducats to raiſe new Forces, if requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
and to defray the Charge of his Progreſs. In the mean
while, the Governours of all Strong Holds being for the
moſt part <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had private Inſtructions to ſecure
him, if a favourable Opportunity were offered, and ſend
him into <hi>Spain.</hi> D. <hi>John</hi> ſuſpecting theſe extraordinary
marks of Kindneſs, made the Miniſter fall into the Snare
he had laid for him. Tho' he returned Thanks for the
Truſt repoſed in him, and gave ſpecial Aſſurances of
Fidelity; yet he made uſe of this Opportunity to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his Friends to ſuch Poſts as might be moſt for his
own Intereſt. He made uſe of the Money to Purchaſe
new Creatures, and always viſited the Forts ſo well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that there was no hopes of ſeizing his Perſon.</p>
               <p>6. All the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi>

                  </gap> the King liked the Project

it. Thus the Duke of <hi>Bragança,</hi> under colour of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
his Employment, freely traverſed all <hi>Portugal,</hi>
laying at the ſame time the Foundation of his future
Greatneſs. He had a Magnificent Retinue, which drew

charmed the Nobility, for he received them with
obliging marks of Diſtinction, according to every Man's
Merit and Quality. To be ſhort, he beſtowed Favours
where-ever he came, and yet gained more Friends upon
the hopes of what they might promiſe themſelves from
him, than what at preſent they received. So that thoſe
who ſaw him, thought they prayed for their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
when they offered up their Vows for his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Throne. His Partiſans did not neglect at

moſt to reduce to an exact Method the hopes of his

Maſter's Exaltation, which were yet but in Proſpect.
This was a vigilant active Man, expert in Buſineſs, and
paſſionately zealous for his Maſter's Promotion, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to have no ſmall hand in the Government, if the
Duke aſcended the Throne. His Maſter had owned to
him, that he would willingly embrace a fair Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of ſeizing the Crown, but would not do it like one
who had nothing to loſe; that therefore he gave him
leave to manage that Affair, yet ſo, as it ſhould never

Among the Merchants and Shop-keepers he
complained of the loſs of their Trade, diſcourſed of the
Tyranny they lay under, and extolled the <hi>Dutch</hi> and
<hi>Catalonians,</hi> who had aſſerted their Liberties. The Clergy
he ſtirred up, by ſhewing how the Priviledges of the
Church were infringed, and benefices given to Strangers,
which ought to be the Reward of Merit and Learning
among the Natives. Such as he knew to be Malecontents,
he diſcourſed about his Maſter's Qualities, to ſound their
Inclinations. So cunningly did he manage their ſeveral
Humours, that after having ſecured many in private, he

Court for Summoning the <hi>Arrier-Ban,</hi> ſerved only to
draw away all the Nobility, that they might end their
days in Exile, whilſt their Eſtates were given away to
Strangers. In fine, that he would rather wiſh to die,
than ſurvive the utter Ruin of his Country, and hoped
ſo many Worthy Perſons were not met there to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>8. This Diſcourſe renewed the Memory of every man's

for <hi>Catalonia,</hi> as deſigned for their utter Ruin.
Theſe Conſiderations, and the deſire of Revenge, made
them reſolve to take the neceſſary Meaſures for ſhaking
off ſo heavy a Yoke. They blamed themſelves for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſuffered patiently ſo long, and concluded it was
abſolutely neceſſary to expel the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but were
divided upon what Form of Government to chooſe.
Some were for a Commonwealth, like that of <hi>Holland.</hi>
The others were for a King, but differed about the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;

all three Princes of the Blood-Royal of <hi>Portugal;</hi> every
Man ſpeaking according to his private Affection, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Advantage. The Archbiſhop, who was entirely
devoted to the Houſe or <hi>Bragança,</hi> making uſe of the
Authority of his Character, declared to them, that the
choice of a Governour was not Arbitrary, ſince they
could not in Conſcience break the Oath of Fidelity they
had taken to <hi>Spain,</hi> unleſs it were to enthrone the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Heir to the Crown, which was the Duke of <hi>Bragança.</hi>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:54712:205"/>
Beſides that, his Power and Intereſt was ſuch, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, they could hope for no Succeſs, tho' he were
not, as indeed he was, the firſt Prince of the Blood.
Then he deſcanted upon the Duke's good Qualities, and
ſo managed the Aſſembly, that they all reſolved to make
him their King, and that every Man ſhould uſe the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of his Endeavours for carrying on that Deſign.
Thus the Aſſembly broke up, having firſt fixed the Time
and Place for another Meeting, wherein they ſhould take
the neceſſary Meaſures to ſecure a ſpeedy and happy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
to their Enterprize. <hi>Pinto</hi> ſeeing all well diſpoſed
in favour of his Maſter, writ privately to him, to draw
near to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> as well to encourage the Conſpirators by
his Preſence, as to take Order with them about putting
the Deſign in execution. Upon this Advice, the Duke
ſome days after ſet forward from <hi>Villavicioſa,</hi> and came
to <hi>Almada,</hi> a Village oppoſite to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> on the other
ſide the River, as if he had fallen in there accidentally
in his Progreſs through the Kingdom. He had ſo ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
an Equipage, and was followed by ſuch a Numerous
Train of Perſons of Quality and Officers, that he looked
more like a King going to take Poſſeſſion of his Crown,
than a General that was viſiting the Poſts under his
Charge.<note place="margin">The Duke viſits the Vice-Queen</note> Being ſo near <hi>Lisbon,</hi> he could not omit paying
his Reſpects to the Vice-Queen. When he entred the
Great Court before the Palace, all the Avenues were
thronged with People flocking to ſee him, and all the
Nobility came to Conduct him before the Vice-Queen.
Such was the Joy throughout the City at the firſt ſight
of him, that he ſeemed either to want only a Herald to
Proclaim his King then, or elſe courage to ſeize the
Crown. But he was too wiſe, to commit his Fortune
to the wild Sallies of the giddy Multitude; and therefore
having viſited the Vice-Queen, he inſtantly retired to
<hi>Almada,</hi> without ſo much as entring the Houſe of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gança,</hi>
for fear of heightning the Jealouſie of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
who were already too much alarmed.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Pinto</hi> having made the Conſpirators obſerve his
Maſter's fearful Cautiouſneſs,<note place="margin">The Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with the Duke at <hi>Almada</hi>
                  </note> ſaid, they muſt make their
Advantage of his ſtay at <hi>Almada,</hi> and uſe a ſort of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to oblige him to accept of the Crown. His Advice
being approved of, they gave him in charge to know of
his Maſter, when they might wait upon him with their
Propoſals; which he did, upon Condition only three of
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:54712:205"/>
the Conſpirators ſhould come to him. <hi>Michael de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meida,
Antony de Almada,</hi> and <hi>Mendoza,</hi> were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
privately conducted into the Duke's Cloſet at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada.
Antony de Almada</hi> repreſented to him the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſtate of the Kingdom, the little Security any Man
had of his Life or Eſtate, and that even he himſelf had
no other Refuge to fly to but the Crown. He ſhewed
him the low Condition the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were reduced to,
the Aſſiſtance he might expect from Foreign Princes
who were Enemies to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
from <hi>France,</hi> the Conveniency of the Sea for
bringing of Succours; and laſtly, the ſmall Number of
<hi>Spaniards</hi> that were left in <hi>Portugal,</hi> the Garriſons being
drained to ſupply the Army in <hi>Catalonia.</hi> This Diſcourſe
was pleaſing enough to the Duke, yet nevertheleſs keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf within the Bounds of his Natural Timidity,
he anſwered ſo as they might not have cauſe to deſpair
of him, nor to hope much more than they did before;
telling them, He was ſenſible of the deplorable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Kingdom, and of his own Danger; that he
commended their Zeal for their Country, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to them for their good Wiſhes towards him;
but that it was not as yet time to think of applying ſuch
violent Remedies, which might prove of Fatal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
To this dubious Anſwer, he added ſuch Careſſes
and particular Thanks, that they could no longer doubt
but that their Propoſals were acceptable, and yet they
found he would make no advances till the Succeſs of their
Enterprize was paſt all danger. After ſome private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with <hi>Pinto,</hi> he returned to <hi>Villavicioſa,</hi> but not
with that inward quiet which he uſed to enjoy as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Man, and therefore immediately communicated
the whole Affair to the Dutcheſs. This Lady was by
Birth a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and Siſter to the Duke of <hi>Medina Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi>
a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Governour of <hi>Andaluzia.</hi>
She was naturally ambitious, and her Father had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to improve that Inclination in her. Beſides her
Knowledge in other Languages, ſhe was ſo perfect in
her own, and had ſuch an inſinuating way, that ſhe drew
all mens hearts. All the Cuſtoms of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhe had
made Natural to her ſelf, and had by her extraordinary
Application and Carriage gained an abſolute Aſcendant
over her Husband, who never undertook any thing of
moment without her Advice, and therefore could not
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:54712:206"/>
proceed farther in this Affair without conſulting her.
To her he revealed the whole Conſpiracy, the Parties
concerned, their Zeal in carrying it on, and all that had
happened to him at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and at <hi>Almada</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
He told her how much the Nobility were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at the Expedition againſt <hi>Catalonia.</hi> That never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
the greatneſs of the Danger diſcouraged him, as
did the fear that the Great Ones, out of Envy, would
oppoſe him; that the Power of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was
formidable, and little Confidence to be repoſed in Foreign
Princes. Theſe Conſiderations weighed more with the
Duke, than the deſire he had of a Crown. But the
Dutches, whoſe A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ion was more rooted, preſently

                  </gap>, and never openly eſpouſe the Cauſe,
till the moment it ſhould be put in execution.</p>
               <p>10. The Court at this time was not free from Care.<note place="margin">The Prime Miniſter of <hi>Spain</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to draw the Duke out of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                  </note>
The extraordinary Joy the People expreſs'd at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> at
the ſight of the Duke, alarmed the Prime Miniſter. He
ſuſpected there were Private Cabals held at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and
certain groundleſs Reports, which are commonly the
fore-runners of great Revolutions, increaſed his Jealouſie.
Several Councils were held hereupon, and it was finally
reſolved to call the Duke of <hi>Bragança</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> that
ſo the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> wanting a Head, might have no hopes
left of ſucceeding in their intended Revolt. On the
<hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1640. the Count Duke <hi>de Olivares</hi> ſent
an Expreſs to the Duke of <hi>Bragança,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1640.</note> to acquaint him,
the King expected him at Court, to be informed by him
of the Poſture of Affairs in <hi>Portugal,</hi> aſſuring him he
ſhould receive all marks of Honour that were due to his
Birth and Quality. This Poſitive Command ſtrangly
ſurprized him, as knowing, ſhould he refuſe to Obey,
the next Orders would be, for carrying him away by
force; and thinking he was betrayed, concluded himſelf
fallen into the depth of all Misfortunes.<note place="margin">The Duke's Arts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing.</note> Nevertheleſs,
that he might gain time, and advertiſe the Conſpirators
of his Danger, by the Advice of his Dutcheſs, he ſent a
Gentleman to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to aſſure the Prime Miniſter of
his Reſolution to appear ſuddenly before the King. This
Gentleman had private Inſtructions to find ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Excuſes for his delay from time to time. Being
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:54712:206"/>
come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> he aſſured the King that his Maſter
followed him. He hired a great Houſe, bought Rich
Furniture, hired Servants, and lay'd out much Money,
as if he daily expected his Maſter. Soon after, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
he had received Advice, that his Maſter was ſick;
and finding this Fraud would not laſt long, preſented a
Memorial to the Prime Miniſter, deſiring that the King
would aſcertain in what manner his Maſter ſhould be
received at Court. This was done, in hopes that the
Grandees oppoſing him, the Diſpute might be held on
foot ſome conſiderable time. But the Count Duke, to
avoid all delays, perſwaded the King to decide the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie in favour of the Duke of <hi>Bragança;</hi> ſo that
he could <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> himſelf deſire.</p>
               <p>11. As ſoon as the Conſpirators underſtood what Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Duke had received from Court, they ſent <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza</hi>
to aſſure him of their ſtedfaſtneſs, and to perſwade
him openly to joyn with them. They met a Hunting,
and being withdrawn into a Wood, <hi>Mendoza</hi> made uſe
of the moſt pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing Arguments to engage him to eſpouſe
his own Quarrel. The Duke anſwered, He approved of
their Proceedings, and was fully reſolved to Head them.
<hi>Mendoza</hi> returning to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> informed the Conſpirators
how he had ſped, and that the Duke would have <hi>Pinto</hi>
repair to him. He was ſent, and with him the whole
Scheme of their intended Proceedings. <hi>Pinto</hi> acquainted
his Maſter, how great a Miſunderſtanding there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Vice-Queen and the Secretary <hi>Vaſconcellos,</hi> and
withal told him, nothing could have fallen out more
advantageouſly for advancing his Affairs. The Duke,
who was fully convinced of the force of his Reaſons,
found himſelf more preſſed forward by the Gentleman
he had ſent to <hi>Madrid,</hi> for he writ, that the Prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
would admit of no longer delays. This made
him reſolve to loſe no time. However, he writ to that
Gentleman, that he ſhould acquaint the Count Duke
<hi>de Olivares,</hi> that he would have been at <hi>Madrid</hi> long
ſince, but for want of Money to ſupport his Dignity<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
which as ſoon as it could be raiſed, he would ſet out
towards the Court. The Duke carryed <hi>Pinto</hi> to the
Dutcheſs's Apartment, where ſeveral Methods were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
about the Execution of their Deſign. At length
the Duke concluded that <hi>Lisbon</hi> ſhould be ſecured, for
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:54712:207"/>
that being the Capital City, would ſhake the whole
Kingdom, and that the ſame day it was done, he would
cauſe himſelf to be proclaimed King in all the Towns
that depended on him. That ſuch of his Friends as were
Governours of Towns ſhould do the like where they
commanded; and that the People ſhould be made to
riſe, even in the Villages that were ſubject to any of the
Conſpirators; to the end that the Conflagration being
general throughout the Kingdom, thoſe few <hi>Spaniards</hi>
that were in it might not know which part to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to firſt. That he would march his own Regiment
into <hi>Elvas,</hi> the Governour of which Place was wholly at
his Devotion. That as to the ſecuring of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> he muſt
leave it to them to Act as Opportunity ſhould offer.
Nevertheleſs, his Advice was, that their firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>rts ſhould
be made againſt the Palace, that having ſeized the Vice-Queen,
and all the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they might ſerve as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages
to oblige the Citadel to Surrender, which might
otherwiſe incommode the City. He gave <hi>Pinto</hi> two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Credence, directed to <hi>Almeida</hi> and <hi>Mendoza,</hi> only
requiring them to give entire Credit to the Bearer, and
to be faithful and couragious in putting what they had
promiſed in execution.</p>
               <p>12. Being come to <hi>Lisbon, Pinto</hi> delivered his Credentials
to <hi>Almeida</hi> and <hi>Mendoza.</hi> Then they ſent for <hi>Lemos</hi> and
<hi>Correa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive how to incenſe the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Lisbon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </note> two Citizens of the Duke's Faction, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
many Workmen, and having gone through all
the Offices of the City, were in great Reputation among
the People. They had before made it their buſineſs to
incenſe the Citizens againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by ſpreading
Reports of new Taxes to be raiſed, and had deſignedly
diſcharged many of their Workmen, pretending that the
Trade being loſt, they had no Buſineſs for them; but in
truth, that Want might make them the readier to riſe;
and yet from time to time they relieved them, that they
might be entirely at their Devotion. Beſides, they held
Intelligence with the chief Men of every Quarter, ſo that
they aſſured the Conſpirators, that having but one day's
Warning, they could raiſe the greateſt part of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at an hour appointed. Having made ſure of the
Tradeſmen, <hi>Pinto</hi> admoniſhed the other Conſpirators to
be ready upon the firſt Notice given them, and to ſecure
as many Friends as they could, as it were upon ſome
Private Deſign, without entruſting them with the Secret.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:54712:207"/>
All things being diſpoſed as they could deſire, <hi>Almeida, Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza,
Almada, Melo,</hi> and <hi>Pinto</hi> met, and fixed <hi>Saturday,</hi> the
firſt of <hi>December,</hi> for putting their Enterprize in execution.
Advice was immediately ſent to the Duke, that he might the
ſame day cauſe himſelf to be proclaimed King throughout
the Province of <hi>Alentejo,</hi> which for the moſt part held of
him; and it was agreed, they ſhould have one Meeting more,
to fix their ultimate Reſolutions. On the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
they met at Night, as had been agreed, in the Palace of
<hi>Bragança.</hi> They found they could make up near 150 Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
moſt of them Chiefs of Families, with all their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and about 200 Citizens and Tradeſmen, who by their
Reputation could eaſily draw the greateſt part of the People
after them. It was reſolved <hi>Vaſconçellos</hi> ſhould fall a Victim
to the Reſentments of <hi>Portugal.</hi> Some there were who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Braga</hi> ſhould undergo the
ſame Fate, as being a great Friend to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
for his great Parts. But D. <hi>Michael de Almeida</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
it, repreſenting how odious the Murder of a Perſon
of ſuch Dignity would render them to the whole World, and
that it would draw the Indignation of all the Clergy upon the
Duke of <hi>Bragança.</hi> Nothing remained now but to order the
manner of their Rendevouz, and giving the Attack. It was
agreed, that they ſhould divide themſelves into four Bodies,
which at one and the ſame time ſhould ruſh into the Palace,
that having poſſeſſed all the Avenues, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might be
kept aſunder, and ſo diſabled from relieving one another.
That D. <hi>Michael de Almeida</hi> ſhould Attack the <hi>German</hi> Guard
at the Palace Gate. <hi>Melo,</hi> the Great Maſter of the Game, his
Brother, and D. <hi>Stephen da Cunha,</hi> at the Head of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
were to Attack a Company of <hi>Spaniards</hi> that mounted
daily at a Place, called <hi>The Fort. Tello de Meneſes, Emanuel de
Saa,</hi> the Great Chamberlain, and <hi>Pinto,</hi> were to ſecure the
Apartment of <hi>Vaſconcellos,</hi> and to make him away imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.
D. <hi>Antony de Almada, Mendoza,</hi> D. <hi>Charles de No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronha,</hi>
and <hi>Antony de Saldanha</hi> had it in Charge to ſeize the
Vice-Queen, and all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were in the Palace,
to be kept as Hoſtages, in caſe of need. That whilſt they
were buſie in making themſelves Maſters of their ſeveral
Poſts, ſome Horſemen ſhould be detached to Proclaim <hi>John,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Bragança,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> about the City. That
having gathered the Multitude into the Streets, they might
make uſe of them as there ſhould be occaſion. The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
broke up, having agreed to meet on <hi>Saturday</hi> the
firſt of <hi>December,</hi> ſome at <hi>Almeida</hi>'s Houſe, and others at
thoſe of <hi>Almada</hi> and <hi>Mendoza,</hi> where the Conſpirators were

               <p>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:54712:208"/>
13. Whilſt the Duke of <hi>Bragança</hi> and his Friends thus
purſued their Ends, the Prime Miniſter, alarmed at his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,
ſent away an Expreſs to him, with poſitive Orders for
him to come away inſtantly; and that he might have no
Excuſe, ſent him a Bill upon the Treaſury for 10000 Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats.
This Command admitted of no Demurs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the preſence of the Gentleman that brought the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
he gave Orders for his Family to ſet forwards towards
<hi>Madrid,</hi> and diſpatched a Gentleman to the Vice-Queen, to
acquaint her with his Departure. He writ to the Prime
Miniſter, aſſuring him, he would be at Court within Eight
Days,<note place="margin">The Duke preſſes the Execution of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy.</note> and at the ſame time acquainted the Conſpirators with
what had happened, ſhewing them the abſolute neceſſity
there was of executing their Deſigns on the day appointed.
Nor were the Conſpirators backward; but ſome odd Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
had like to have put off the Execution, if not broke all
their Meaſures. <hi>Almada</hi> revealed the whole Deſign to a Man
of Quality, that uſed always to rail violently againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
but finding him timorous, with his drawn Sword
made him ſwear Fidelity. Nevertheleſs, ſuſpecting the Man,
he kept his Eye upon him, and acquainting his Aſſociates with
his Jealouſie, they reſolved to delay their Enterprize; yet
the next day perceiving all was quiet, they were aſhamed to
have been ſo eaſily terrified, and perſiſted in their firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.
Another thing fell out, which caſt a great Damp
on them; for on the Eve of the Day appointed to riſe, <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concellos</hi>
the Secretary was ſeen to croſs the River, which
they imagined he did upon ſome Intimation of the Deſign,
and that he went to bring over ſome Forces from the other
ſide; but he returning at Night, having only been at an
Entertainment, all was calm again. It was late before the
Conſpirators parted. <hi>George de Melo,</hi> who lodged at a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Houſe out of the Town, thought he would take it
ill, that he had not been acquainted with the Deſign, and
therefore at his return home, gave him a full Account of the
whole Matter. The other, tho' ſurprized, ſeemed to rejoyce
at it, and thanked <hi>Melo</hi> for repoſing ſuch Confidence in him.
They parted, and <hi>Melo</hi> being in his Chamber, began to blame
himſelf for his raſhneſs, in truſting a Man he was not well
aſſured of. Walking in his Room full of theſe troubled
Thoughts, he heard ſome noiſe, and looking cut of his Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
could perceive his Kinſman ready to take Horſe. He
ran down in a rage with his Sword in his hand, and by force
made him return to his Chamber, then taking the Keys of the
Houſe, ſecured him till the next day, at which time the other
complyed, and reſolved to joyn with the reſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators.</p>
               <p>14. At length the Day came which was to decide whether
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:54712:208"/>
the Duke of <hi>Bragança</hi> ſhould deſerve the Title of King,<note place="margin">The Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators meet and execute their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</note> and
Deliverer of his Country, or be called Rebel, and Enemy to
the State. The Conſpirators met early at the Houſes of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meida</hi>
and the other great Men, where they were to Arm
themſelves. In all their Countenances appeared ſuch Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as gave aſſured hope of Victory; but what is moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
is, that among ſo many Perſons as were concerned,

or betray their Truſt. All being armed, they repaired to the
Palace by ſeveral ways, and moſt of them in Litters, the better
to conceal their Number and Arms. They were divided into
four Bodies, as had been agreed, and expected the Clock ſhould
ſtrike Eight, which was the moment appointed to fall on. As
ſoon as the Clock ſtruck, <hi>Pinto</hi> gave the Signal agreed upon,
by firing a Piſtol, and then all Parties fell to their Work.
D. <hi>Michael de Almeida</hi> fell upon the <hi>German</hi> Guard, which
being ſurprized, for the moſt part unarmed, was overcome
without much ſtrugling. The Great Maſter of the Game, his
Brother, and D. <hi>Stephen da Cunha</hi> charged the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
before the Palace, at the Place, called <hi>The Fort.</hi> Moſt of
the Townſmen, who knew of the Deſign, were in this Action,
and boldly fell in with Sword in Hand upon the Court of
Guard. None ſignalized himſelf more than a Prieſt, who
carrying a Crucifix in one hand, and a Sword in the other,
amidſt his loud Exhortations ceaſed not to Act beyond the
moſt deſperate of the Conſpirators. None could ſtand before
him; ſo that after ſome ſmall Reſiſtance, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officer
and his Soldiers were forced to Surrender themſelves, and
for ſafety of their Lives, to cry out with the reſt, God
ſave the Duke of <hi>Bragança,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal. Pinto</hi> having
made his way into the Palace, headed thoſe that were to
Attack <hi>Vaſconcellos</hi> his Apartment. At the foot of the Stairs
they met <hi>Francis Soarez de Albergaria,</hi> Judge of the Civil

the Door with his Sword, till the Secretary could make his
eſcape; but being wounded in his Right Arm, ſo that he
could not hold his Sword, and over-powered by the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
he leaped out at a Window, and had the good Fortune
to eſcape. Immediately the Conſpirators broke into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and not finding the Secretary, tho' they ſearched all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
they threatned an Old Woman-Servant with preſent
Death, if ſhe did not diſcover him; and ſhe, to ſave her Life,
pointed to the Place where he was, being a cloſe Cupboard
or Cloſet, taken out of the thickneſs of the Wall, where they
found him covered with Papers. Fear prevented his uttering
one word, and D. <hi>Roderick de Saa</hi> gave him the firſt Wound,
firing a Piſtol at him; after which, ſeveral of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators

               </p>

               <p>16. This done, <hi>Antony de Saldanha</hi> led the People to the

not free from Care. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſtill poſſeſſed of
the Citadel, whence they might Canonade the City, and
whilſt it held out, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had always an inlet at

the People's Happineſs but the Preſence of their King. Yet
was not his Preſence equally deſired by all Men. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
looked upon his Exaltation with an envious Eye; The
Gentry, who had no hand in the Conſpiracy, ſtood dubious.
Some ſaid, they knew not whether he would juſtifie thoſe
proceedings. The Creatures of <hi>Spain</hi> were in a Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and only took care to ſave themſelves from the
Fury of the Multitude. The Duke's Friends, knowing his
Intention, proſecuted their Buſineſs. They met at the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
to ſettle Affairs till the Arrival of the King, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animouſly
choſe the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lisbon</hi> Preſident of the

Perſon of his Character, but ſoon complyed, upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Braga</hi> ſhould be joyned in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

make the other as guilty, in reſpect of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
if he accepted; or if he refuſed, to render him odious
to the new King and People. He of <hi>Braga</hi> perceived the
Snare, but being wholly devoted to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
refuſed to have any ſhare in the Government. Thus
the whole Power fell into the Hands of the Archbiſhop of
<hi>Lisbon.</hi> D. <hi>Michael de Almeida, Peter de Mendoza,</hi> and D. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony

               <p>17. The Governour's firſt care was to make himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

Several Barks were fitted out, and manned with the choice
Youth of the City, each endeavouring to ſignalize himſelf,
but they met with no Oppoſition, the Officers, and moſt of
the Soldiers having been ſecured aſhore, at ſuch time as the
Conſpiracy took effect. Expreſſes were ſent the ſame Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to Heaven for the Recovery of their Liberty, and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Magiſtrates to cauſe the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> to be
proclaimed King, and to ſecure all the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The next
care was to diſpoſe all things for the Reception of the new
King. The Archbiſhop acquainted the Vice-Queen ſhe muſt
withdraw, to make room for the King and his Family. He
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:54712:210"/>
cauſed an Apartment to be furniſhed for her in the Royal
Manſion-Houſe of <hi>Xabregas,</hi> which is in the Suburbs.
The Vice-Queen, upon the firſt Order, left the Palace,
but with a Countenance full of Indignation, and without
ſpeaking one Word. Only a few of her own Servants,
and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi> though with the hazard of
his Life, attended her. Still the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> was in
ſuſpenſe, not knowing how Affairs had ſucceeded at <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
till <hi>Melo</hi> and <hi>Mendoza</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Villavicioſa.</hi> By the joy of

Expreſs from <hi>India,</hi> by <hi>John de Sylva Tello,</hi> the

Proclaimed in all his Dominions in <hi>Aſia,</hi>

                  </note> and as far as
the Coaſt of <hi>China.</hi> The <hi>Hollanders</hi> at this time were
very powerful in thoſe Seas, and being at War with
<hi>Spain,</hi> did all the harm they could in the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies
and Factories, endeavouring with the aſſiſtance
of the <hi>Indians,</hi> utterly to extirpate all others, that they
might themſelves ingroſs that Trade. To this purpoſe,
they omitted not any manner of Villainies that might
conduce to their advantage, and particularly though
they had afterwards certain Intelligence of King <hi>John</hi>'s
being Proclaimed, and being in amity with their State, yet
they ceaſed not to proſecute their ends in thoſe remote
parts, as ſhall appear in the Sequel of this Hiſtory.
However, before the Revolution reached <hi>India,</hi> they
had got footing in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> laid Siege to <hi>Malaca,</hi> which
they took, and had their deſigns againſt <hi>Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But after they had information of the Truce conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

though before there was a mortal Enmity betwixt the

The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was raiſed to the Throne
of his Anceſtors, in a manner almoſt miraculous, he
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:54712:213"/>
mounted without any oppoſition, 600 Towns, and
15000 Villages, ſubmitted to him in leſs than eight
days, and all the people of the Kingdom declared they
were never happy till his Acceſſion to the Crown. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
no ſooner was he ſeated on the Throne, but
he found many Enemies, and among them ſome of thoſe
who had helped to raiſe him to that Grandeur. About
100 of the Greateſt Men in his Kingdom, Conſpired
to deſtroy him, and if Heaven had not protected him,
there had been but a ſhort ſpace betwixt the Birth and
Grave of his Sovereignty. The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi>
the chief Inquiſitor, two other Biſhops, the Marqueſs
of <hi>Villareal,</hi> and his Son, the Duke <hi>de Caminha,</hi> were
the principal Conſpirators: <hi>D. Lorenzo, Pidez de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallo,</hi>
the Count <hi>de Armamar,</hi> and <hi>D. Auguſtin Manuel,</hi>
were brought in as Aſſociates, the Jews of <hi>Lisbon</hi> were
concerned in the Deſign, and there was a party in the
Fleet then lying at <hi>Belem,</hi> one Man being aboard every
Ship, in order to Fire it upon a ſignal given. <hi>Laurence
Pidez de Carvallo,</hi> was to break into the Queens Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with 100 Men, to ſecure all there. It was given
in Charge to the Jews, to fire the City in 8 or 10 pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that the people being buſied there, they might have
time to force the Palace. The Inquiſitor General ſent
Letters into <hi>Spain</hi> to acquaint the King with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
that the Forces on the Frontiers might be ready
to March to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> upon the firſt Advice, and the Duke
<hi>de Maqueda</hi> to enter the Port with the Fleet of <hi>Spain.</hi>
Concerning the manner of diſcovering this Conſpiracy,
there are three ſeveral Accounts. One is, that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being directed to the Marqueſs <hi>de Ayamonte,</hi> who
was Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Frontiers, he broke them
open, and ſent them back to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
when he had ſeen the Contents, which is moſt probable;
he being afterwards Convicted of High-Treaſon, and put
to Death, at <hi>Segovia,</hi> for Conſpiring againſt his King,
with the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> and the new King of
<hi>Portugal.</hi> Another ſays, that a Spy employed by the King
to go often into <hi>Spain,</hi> meeting a <hi>Bohemian</hi> who was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to carry the ſaid Letters, and ſuſpecting ſomething
by his Diſcourſe, made him Drunk, then Stabbing him, and
having taken the Packet, brought it to the King; but
this ſeems not to have any thing of probability, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
of Truth. The third is, that <hi>D. Alfonſo de
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:54712:213"/>
Portugal,</hi> Count <hi>de Vimioſo,</hi> being deprived of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
on the Frontiers, and grievouſly reſenting that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front;
the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi> conceived the deſire
of revenge would eaſily engage him to enter into the
Conſpiracy. He therefore diſcover'd the whole deſign
to him, and the Count ſeeming to embrace the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
acquainted the King with the whole matter. The
Conſpiracy being diſcovered, the King ſo ordered the
Affair, that moſt of thoſe perſons therein concerned were
apprehended, without the leaſt noiſe or confuſion. The
5th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at 11 at Night, was the time appointed,
for putting the Conſpiracy in execution. That very
morning the King cauſed all the Troops that Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the neighbouring Villages, to march into <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
upon pretence of a review to be taken in the large place
before the Palace. He with his own hand, gave ſeveral
Billets Sealed up, to perſons he could confide in, with
poſitive Orders to every one, not to open his Billet till
12 at Noon, and then punctually to obey what it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
Then having ſent for the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi>
and Marqueſs of <hi>Villareal</hi> under colour of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſome important Affairs,<note place="margin">The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators ſeized and puniſhed.</note> they were both ſeized in
the King's Lodgings about Noon, without any noiſe: At
the ſame time a Captain of the Guards publickly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the Duke of <hi>Caminha,</hi> in the place before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.
Thoſe who had received the Billets having open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, found each an Order to take up one of the
Conſpirators, and ſecure him in ſuch a Priſon, till fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
order, which was ſo punctually executed, that 47
were taken without any difficulty, none endeavouring
to eſcape. When the News of the Conſpiracy was
noiſed abroad, it is not poſſible to expreſs the rage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the multitude againſt thoſe that were the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters
of it, every Man deſiring to be the Executioner
of them, as is the nature of the Rabble, wherever they
conceive a hatred. The Wrack, forced a Confeſſion
from many of the Criminals, and the Arch-Biſhop, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor,
the Marqueſs of <hi>Villareal,</hi> and Duke <hi>de Cami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nha,</hi>
to ſave themſelves that miſery, owned the whole
Deſign. The Marqueſs, the Duke, the Count <hi>de Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamar,</hi>
and <hi>D. Auguſtin Manuel,</hi> were ſentenced to be
Beheaded. The Arch-Biſhop and Inquiſitor, becauſe of
their Character, the King Condemned to perpetual Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment:
All the others were adjudged to be Drawn,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:54712:214"/>
Hanged, and Quartered, and they all ſuffered according
to the Sentence pronounced againſt them, upon the 29th
day of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> It is remarkable, that when the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
on the Scaffold had ſpoke to the people, they cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out furiouſly, <hi>let him die, let him die:</hi> To which the
Marqueſs anſwered; <hi>So the Jews cried out againſt Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Theſe Executions having ſecured the Prince,<note place="margin">Several Military expeditions.</note> he
bent all his Thoughts upon War, and having to that
purpoſe obtained of the King of <hi>France</hi> five Colonels of
Horſe, three of Foot, and two of Dragoons, he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to be ready to march to the Frontiers, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
new Troops to reinforce his Army that lay then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Badajoz:</hi> However, they were otherwiſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

The firſt Act of Hoſtility I meet with betwixt
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> was in the Province of
<hi>Alentejo,</hi> near <hi>Elvas.</hi> A Party of <hi>Spaniards</hi> having broke
into that Province, exerciſed all manner of Cruelties
to terrifie the People, ſparing neither Age nor Sex, nor
even the Churches. <hi>D. John de Acoſta,</hi> who Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at <hi>Elvas,</hi> having notice hereof, ſent out five Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of Foot under the Command of <hi>Gaſpar de Sequeira
Manuel;</hi> Theſe were followed by 400 Men under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Luis Mendez de Vaſconcellos:</hi> Theſe being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by certain Troops three Leagues from <hi>Campo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi>
marched towards the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Ravages, and Charging them, killed 200 upon
the ſpot, purſuing the reſt to the Gates of <hi>Badajoz,</hi>
where they took ſhelter. This fortunate beginning was
followed by like conſequences; 600 <hi>Spaniards</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
into the Province of <hi>Alentejo</hi> to ſurprize the Town
of <hi>Montalvao; Maſcarenhas,</hi> Collonel of a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
with only four Companies Attacked them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came to the Town, and with ſuch good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
that having killed 18 or 20, the reſt retired to the
Paſs on a ſmall River, and he fearing ſome ambuſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Night drew on, purſued no further. In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
perceiving they were quite gone, he followed
them as far as the Town of <hi>Ferreira</hi> in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> which
he Plundered and Burnt without any oppoſition, though
it might eaſily have been defended againſt a greater
power. Beyond the Mountains, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:54712:214"/>
and Burnt four open Towns, to revenge which, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wis
Gomez de Figueiredo</hi> paſſed over into <hi>Galicia,</hi> took
the Town of <hi>Monterey,</hi> and having pillaged reduced it
to Aſhes. To requite this, another party of <hi>Spaniards</hi>
fell into the Countrey about <hi>Braganza,</hi> but the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
and Soldiers who Quartered thereabouts aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
cut moſt of them in pieces, and then piercing into
<hi>Caſtile,</hi> burnt ſeven Villages, and the Town of <hi>Geronda,</hi> of
which, they left nothing ſtanding but the Walls: At the
ſame time, <hi>Luis Gomez de Figueiredo</hi> with 1500 Foot and
300 Horſe fell upon the Marqueſs of <hi>Tarraſona,</hi> who
marched towards <hi>Valverde</hi> with 2000 of the former,
and 200 of the latter, and after a Fight, which laſted
about four hours, obtained the Victory, which had been
greater but that Night coming on hindred the purſuit.</p>
               <p>5. Daily Action more and more incenſed the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Other War like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits.</note>
and an implacable hatred had taken poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their hearts, ſo that the Frontiers were never free
from ſlaughter and Rapine. <hi>D. Gaſton Coutinho</hi> the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi>
General, being informed that 6000 <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Foot,
and 800 Horſe had fortified themſelves in two Villages,
one whereof was in <hi>Galicia,</hi> the other in <hi>Portugal,</hi> he
marched with 30 Horſe to view them, and finding their
Works weak enough to be overthrown, if Attacked with
vigour, ordered his Foot to advance: A Party of the
Enemies Horſe that advanced, was eaſily Repulſed,
which cauſing ſome Conſternation in the main Body,
gave time to plant two pieces of Canon againſt them.
Theſe two pieces having played ſome time, <hi>D. Gaſton</hi>
who had made four Batallions of his Foot courageouſly
aſſaulted the Works in as many places: The Soldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as forward in the purſuit of Honour as their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
nothing could withſtand them: They forced the
Entrenchments, took four redoubts, entred the place
and took all the Baggage, but not contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with this Victory and the gaining of 11 Colours,
they burnt all the Villages for two Leagues about. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
400 <hi>Spaniards</hi> were killed upon the place, 14 Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
and 70 Soldiers were taken. Nor was this all,
the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> General making his advantage of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
Conſternation, the next day marched into <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,</hi>
and purſuing thoſe that having eſcaped, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
themſelves in another Village, forced them again
to retire, burnt nine Houſes, and then returned home
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:54712:215"/>
with Honour, and his Soldiers enriched with Plunder. In
the mean while, <hi>Vaſco de Azevedo Coutinho,</hi> and <hi>Emanuel
de Souſa de Abreu,</hi> being continually infeſted by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> gathered all the Forces they
could and marched to <hi>Lobos,</hi> in the Caſtle of which
place, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> always had a ſafe retreat, after
committing their ordinary Ravages. This Caſtle they
aſſaulted and carried with the loſs only of 22 Men,
which done, they burnt 700 Houſes, as well in the
Town of <hi>Lobos,</hi> as in the neighbouring Villages. This
was not yet the laſt ſtroak of ill fortune the <hi>Spaniards</hi> felt.
<hi>Martin Alfonſo de Mello,</hi> underſtanding a great body
of them was marched from <hi>Badajoz</hi> to Attack <hi>Olivenza,</hi>
a Town ſeated on the River <hi>Guadiana,</hi> which parts
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> aſſembled all the Forces he could to
relieve that place. Being on his March, an Expreſs
came to him from the Governour, giving an account
that they had aſſaulted the Town in two places, but
met with ſuch a vigorous oppoſition that they were
forced to retire with the loſs of 200 Men; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
he deſired ſome ſuccour, leaſt they ſhould return.
They accordingly returned, hoping to ſurprize the place,
feigning themſelves a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Convoy with Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet met they with no better ſucceſs, being again
repulſed with the loſs of 140 Men. <hi>Martin Alphonſo,</hi>
ſtill hoped to be able to overtake them in their return,
but they taking another way than was given out, he
miſſed of them, and therefore diſmiſſed his Troops to
their ſeveral Garriſons.</p>
               <p>It was a generally received Opinion throughout all
<hi>Spain,</hi> though the Author of it was not known, that the
Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Sidoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a,</hi> being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in <hi>Spain,</hi> Challenges King <hi>John.</hi>
                  </note> held ſecret Correſpondence
with the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and favoured his Cauſe. The
ground of this Suſpicion was, that King <hi>John</hi> had to
his Queen the Siſter of that Duke, and upon this Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,
it is thought the King of <hi>Spain</hi> talking one Day
with the Count Duke <hi>de Olivarez,</hi> complained to him,
That he had three or four times obſerved the Family of
<hi>Guzman</hi> was fatal to his Grandeur: The Count Duke

moved him to it, Certain it is, he publiſhed and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
throughout <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> a Cartell in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Honour, charging the new King with the
Crime of Rebellion; and challenging him to ſingle
Combat with all the Formalities uſed in thoſe Caſes.
This Cartel was dated at <hi>Toledo,</hi> the 29th. day of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
1641. and is too long to trouble the Reader

with the Ground. Then paſſing on, he did the ſame to

The King to ſhew he was no leſs formidable by Sea

<hi>Antony Tellez,</hi> ordering him to ſeek out the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet,

nor did he fail of his Deſign altogether, for meeting a
Squadron of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe he cut them off, and then
applying his Scaling Ladders, after a Diſpute of five
Hours, entred the Town. His Men immediately fell

though ſo unequal in Number, charged the Enemy ſo

he recommended it to them to find out means

communicated it to <hi>Antony Tenezedo</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi>
in whom he confided, as having done him many ſignal
favours; he diſcovered the whole matter to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Cittadel, who immediately apprehended the
Count, and had him Condemned to Death. This Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
had been executed within two days, had not the
Count appealed to the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of the Fleet having had the Sentence confirmed by
the Council there, no hopes remained for his deliverance
but in God. Whilſt the Admiral ſent into <hi>Spain</hi> to
have the Sentence confirmed, the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> got
intelligence of what had hapned. He immediately ſent
away a Caravel, Commanded by a Captain, in whoſe
Conduct he had great confidence, ordering him to ſail
for <hi>Cartagena,</hi> and uſe all poſſible means to deliver the
Priſoner. The Weather proved favourable to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
the Captain Arrived ſafe, and found means to let
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:54712:220"/>
the Count know he was come to reſcue him. To this
purpoſe, he agreed with a <hi>Dutch</hi> Captain who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a Frigat in that Port, for the Caravel being ſo
leaky, that it could not be put to Sea again, he burnt it.
In the mean while, the Count with ready Money and
large promiſes, corrupted a Corporal, and two <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Soldiers, that had the keeping of him, and they altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
got aboard the <hi>Dutch</hi> Frigat, which carried them
ſafe to the Iſland of <hi>Tortuga,</hi> where they were favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
received by the <hi>French</hi> Governour. Thence they
went over to the Iſland <hi>Tercera,</hi> and laſtly arrived at

               <p>1. THE hatred the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugueſes</hi> bore to
one another, was too great to ſuffer them to lie
ſtill: Though the Seaſon was not yet fit for Action,
the Frontiers were never free from incurſions. <hi>D. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho
Manuel</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Major-General, thinking no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
too great to be ſurmounted, marched out with
150 Horſe, judging that a ſufficient number to plunder
the Town of <hi>Fituro</hi> in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> four Leagues from the
Frontiers of <hi>Portugal.</hi> His Deſign being divulged, and
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> believing his Forces greater than they
were, they abandoned the Town, leaving it to be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacked
by the Soldiers without the leaſt oppoſition. But
the retreat proved not without danger, for the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
of the neighbouring places aſſembling to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of 200 Horſe, Charged them before they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their own Frontiers, and that with ſuch reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were at firſt forced to give ground.
But having quitted all the Booty which encombred them,
they rallied, and giving a freſh Charge, worſted thoſe
by whom before they had been drove. Night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on, put an end to the Battle. The number of the
Dead was equal, and the Victory had been dubious,
but that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> got away in the dark, leaving the
Booty and the Field to the <hi>Portugueſes.</hi> This ſmall
Action was the cauſe of a greater, for the Marqueſs <hi>de
Elecha,</hi> General of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, reſolving to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
that loſs, entred <hi>Portugal</hi> with 500 Horſe, and
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:54712:221"/>
300 Musketiers, ſurprized the Town of <hi>Sabugal,</hi> fired
13 Houſes, killed ſeven of the Inhabitants he found in
Arms, and drove away all the Cattle he found. Not
content with this, he returned by the way of <hi>Alfayates</hi> to
brave the Garriſon, but this boldneſs coſt him dear.
<hi>Ferdinand Tellez de Menezes</hi> the General who was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two Leagues of that place, gathering 200 Horſe and
three Companies of Foot, ſent to the Governour of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayates</hi>
to joyn him with the beſt men he had, which
was accordingly performed; that Governour bringing
with him 200 Men. With this force they purſued the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> and having overtaken, fell upon them: The
Fight was bravely maintained, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and
<hi>Portugueſes</hi> gave three ſeveral Charges in ſuch a manner,
that it was not diſcernable who had the better: being
now fallen in after the Fire, with Sword in hand, and
the Marqueſs <hi>de Elecha,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General, and <hi>D.
Francis de Eraſſo,</hi> who was next in Command to him,
being both Slain, Victory began to incline to the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes,</hi>
for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> diſmayed at the loſs of their
Commanders fled, leaving the Field ſtrewed with Dead
Bodies, Arms and Plunder which they quitted to ſave
their Lives. The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were forward enough to
have purſued them, but <hi>Ferdinand Tellez</hi> held them in,
fearing to fall into ſome ambuſh, being to paſs before the
Enemy. The Duke of <hi>Alva's</hi> Enterprize redounded more
to the honour of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> He being deſirous of do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
ſomething conſiderable in <hi>Portugal,</hi> drew together
8000 Foot and 900 Horſe, with which he entred <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
burnt four open Towns, put many of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
to the Sword, and finding a vigorous reſiſtance
at <hi>Eſchallam,</hi> which place, he had cauſed to be Attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the ſame time, he retired again, to avoid meeting
all the Troops of the Frontiers drawn together to oppoſe
him.</p>
               <p>2. It was not only the ſucceſs on the Frontiers that
rendred the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> fortunate. Two Jeſuits
being procurators for the Provinces of <hi>Cochin</hi> and <hi>Goa</hi>
in <hi>India,</hi> arriving at this time, brought him an Account
how well affected the people in thoſe diſtant Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were to his intereſt. This happy News was a great
addition to the joy of his ſucceſs in War, for they aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

he was reſtored to the Crown of his Anceſtors.
The King who omitted nothing that might encourage

Upon examination, this Man declared that
his Maſter held Correſpondence with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and
he being thereupon Apprehended and put upon the

General, finding himſelf reduc'd to that neceſſity,
that he muſt either fight or fly, choſe rather to hazard a
Battle, than forfeit his Reputation. He performed the
Office of a Major General, ordering his Battle himſelf.
The command of the Right Wing he gave to the <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iro
Mor,</hi> and the Left to the Commiſſary General, who
had under him the <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe, commanded by Captain
<hi>Piper.</hi> The two Armies ingaged, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
gave ſuch a furious Charge on the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Left Wing,
where the Commiſſiary commanded, that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Horſe fled, and running upon their own Foot, ſo diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
that part of the Army, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> drove
them from their Ground; their General being in danger
to be bruiſed to Death, his Horſe falling upon him, but
a <hi>French</hi> Captain ſaved him, giving him another Horſe
that ran loſe, and ſuſtaining the ſhot of the Enemy till
he mounted. Being delivered from that Danger, he had
recourſe to the Body of reſerve, which advancing to the
Place, which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe had left to purſue the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> and others that fled, made ſuch Havock among
the Foot, before Victorious, that they were forced to
fly. The Horſe returning from the purſuit, and ſeeing
the Foot broke, could never be brought to a Charge,
but betook themſelves to their Heels, quitting their
Cannon and Baggage. Of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> about 2000
Foot and 700 Horſe were killed and taken, with about
40 Colours and Standards. Of the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> 750 were
ſlain, and among them two Collonels. The <hi>Portugueſes</hi>
continued a Day in the field of Battle, leaſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
ſhould return and vaunt they had kept it. King <hi>John</hi>
rejoycing at this Victory which ſecured his Crown, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the General Earl of <hi>Alegrette,</hi> giving him a Penſion
of 4000 Crowns, and rewarded many other of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal

grieved he was not preſent at the Battle, as believing it

loſt for want of Conduct, and it troubled him the more,
becauſe he was the adviſer of it.</p>

were not idle, but made a road as far as <hi>Valverde,</hi> driving
away all the Cattle, and taking many Priſoners. Not
content with what was done, they advanced to <hi>Silleros,</hi>
a place ſix Leagues higher in the Countrey; but here
they met not with their uſual ſucceſs, for after ſome
skirmiſhing, they were forced to retire. The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
to divert the Enemy from ravaging <hi>Caſtile,</hi> on the 5th
of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Attacked <hi>Fiaces,</hi> but to no purpoſe, for tho'
the Wall was low and weak, it was ſo reſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
that they were forced to quit the enterprize.</p>
               <p>2. Wherever the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> came,<note place="margin">

all before them, that the Enemies Frontiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bare and deſolate, they might find the greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
if they attempted to invade <hi>Portugal.</hi> Now to
remove the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtill farther off, and in caſe the
War continued to employ them about recovering of
their own, or if a Treaty of Peace were ſet on Foot, to
have ſomething to reſtore, they were reſolv'd to attempt
the taking of <hi>Codiſſeira.</hi> This place was conſiderable
as well for its Riches, as the Strength of the Caſtle
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:54712:228"/>
and Number of its Garriſon. The Count <hi>de Alegrette,</hi>
who as has been ſaid, was rewarded with that Title by
the King, to ſhow himſelf worthy of it, reſolved to uſe
his utmoſt Endeavours to gain this place. It was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to carry it by open Force and a Seige, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he concluded upon a Surprize. Having choſen 600
Foot, and ſome Troops of Horſe, backed by a good
Number of Voluntiers, and provided Scaling Ladders,
Petards, and all other Neceſſaries, he Marched by the
way of <hi>Portalegre</hi> and <hi>Elvas</hi> to <hi>Aronches,</hi> where he was
reinforced by other Troops and Voluntiers, with which
Forces he poſted himſelf within a League of <hi>Codiſſeira.</hi>
There he halted till Night, having ſecured all the Men he
met by the way; That none might carry Intelligence
to the Enemy. His eagerneſs made him think it dark
enough ſooner than really it was; And therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
the Place, whilſt yet ſome glimmering of
Light was abroad, he was diſcovered at a diſtance, by
a Sharp ſighted Sentinel, who giving the Alarm in the
Town, was ſoon anſwered by the Caſtle, in both which
Places, As well the Inhabitants as Souldiers, Ran to
the Walls, and put themſelves in a poſture of Defence.
Notwithſtanding, all the oppoſition made from the
Walls, the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> boldly made up to the Gate, and
Fired the Petards at the Town and Caſtle Gates, which
were torn in pieces, and they Entring put to the Sword,
all they found in Arms. <hi>D. John de Guevara,</hi> was reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into the great Market-place with many of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
hoping there to Maintain his honour; but the harm
they did among the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> enraged them the
more, ſo that they were ſcarce ſatisfyed to diſarm and
make them priſoners of War. The Danger being over,
they fell to plundering the Town, and not ſo content
ſet fire to it, reducing to aſhes the place they deſigned
to have maintained. This ſucceſs made the Victors
think of attempting <hi>Badajoz.</hi> They marched to <hi>Telena,</hi>

a Fort upon an Eminence, that might ſerve as a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
upon the Garriſon of <hi>Salvaterra,</hi> and where he might
be at Hand upon any Opportunity, to throw himſelf
into that place which was very conſiderable, as being
upon the Frontiers of <hi>Beira.</hi> Some conſiderable Action
might reaſonably be expected here, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Strength, and the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> to theirs, and
the Forces on both ſides daily encreaſing. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Army grew up to the Number of 10000 Foot, and 3000
Horſe, which on the 20 of <hi>November,</hi> undertook the
Siege of <hi>Salvaterra,</hi> and preſſed it ſo vigorouſly, that
they ſoon lodged themſelves upon the Ditch, and had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun

This was the poſture of their Affairs, when underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

that they left behind them much Proviſion, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,

Souldiers. The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> coming later then they had
hoped, as thoſe who were ſtayed by the violent Rains,
were much troubled to be diſappointed of meeting the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, the routing of which they had promiſed
to themſelves, and greater Security to their Frontiers
for the future. Having burnt the Baracks, and the
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:54712:229"/>
Country round about, they returned to their Winter-quarters,
as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had done on their ſide.</p>
               <p>4. Thus ſtood all the Affairs on both ſides,<note place="margin">Both ſides ceaſe from Hoſtilities.</note> when as
well the one as the other perceived that this ſort of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſerved only to harraſs themſelves. The Catholick
King ſeemed to maintain an Army to no purpoſe, ſince
in 5 or 6 Years time, he had done nothing but waſte
Mony, and looſe Men and Ground. All the <hi>Portugueſes</hi>
did, was to deſtroy Towns, frighten the Country Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and kill ſome few Soldiers. Theſe Conſiderations
moved both Parties to put their ſtanding Forces into
Garriſons, and forbear farther Hoſtilites. Whilſt the
Catholick King attended the Affairs of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and
made his Intereſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> to obſtruct the new King's

which is the Life and Sinews of all Armies. He
alſo took care to ſtrengthen himſelf with Friends and
Confederates, and having ſecured the King of <hi>France,</hi>
his Miniſters endeavoured to joyn in Amity with the

                  <note place="margin">Portugues <hi>Affairs at</hi> Rome.</note> It remained to ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the Friendſhip of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> not only by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the publick Act of Obedience, and filling the
vacant Churches, but by ſatisfying that Court, as to two
Points, which it ſeemed to reſent. One was, that King
<hi>John</hi> perſiſted in retaining ſome Revenues taken from
the Church. The other, that he kept the Arch-biſhop
of <hi>Braga</hi> Priſoner, for which he was excommunicated,
and therefore the Pope demanded, that the Revenues
ſhould be reſtored, and the Arch-biſhop put into his
Hands, as being his proper Judge. To thoſe things the
<hi>Portugueſe</hi> Miniſters anſwer'd, that had the Pope ſent
his Nuncio, the Diſpute about thoſe Revenues, might
have been eaſily accommodated; it being made appear,
that the Crown was in poſſeſſion of them for about 600
Years. And as to the Arch-biſhop, that he being guilty
of High-Treaſon, what the King had done, was juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
according to the Canons, and therefore he could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
no Cenſure of the Church. Nevertheleſs, the King
was ready to commit the Tryal of that Cauſe to ſuch
Judges, as his Holineſs ſhould appoint; but not to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:54712:229"/>
his Perſon, becauſe of the danger there was, that
he ſhould be ſet at Liberty by the way, if he touched at
any port of <hi>Spain;</hi> as alſo, becauſe King <hi>John</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
yet owned as ſuch at <hi>Rome,</hi> they would not adjudge
the Arch-biſhop guilty of High-Treaſon. The Court
of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeemed ſatisfyed as to this Point, but not as to
the other.</p>
               <p>5. In this place it will not be amiſs to relate the end

                  </note> Brother to King
<hi>John.</hi> It was ſaid above, how he was taken in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
where he ſerved the Emperor, and delivered up to
the Miniſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> as guilty of being privy to the
revolt of <hi>Portugal.</hi> It was layed to his Charge, that
being a Subject of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he had not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to him the deſigned revolt of that Kingdom. On
this account, he was put into the Caſtle of <hi>Milan,</hi> where
freſh Evidence was found againſt him. He was kept
with Guards upon him in the very Room, all his own
Servants being removed from him, upon Suſpicion that
they contrived his Eſcape. The Governor of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
imagining that his Confeſſor who was a Jeſuit, might
have a hand in that Contrivance; ſent him word to choſe
another, ſo it were a Subject of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
no Jeſuit, letting him alſo know, that every now and
then he muſt change his Confeſſor. This Meſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
delivered by the Lieutenant of the Caſtle, <hi>D. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
broke out into a Paſſion, which he had never done
before, and among many other raſh Expreſſions, ſaid,
<hi>His Comfort was, that he ſuffered for the King his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for his Family and Country, for which he was willing
to lay down his Life.</hi> This the Lieutenant depoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him; and ſeveral Soldiers alſo reſtifyed, that being
upon his Guard, they had heard him drink a Health to
the King his Brother. The Governor having taken
thoſe depoſitions, there came a Commiſſion from <hi>Spain,</hi>
appointing three Judges to try him, and they again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
all the Witneſſes; then they proceeded to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the Priſoner himſelf, who being asked what he
knew of the deſign of revolting in <hi>Portugal;</hi> utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
he had any knowledge of it, but unadviſedly in his
Diſcourſe, added, that being at <hi>Lisbon, F. Bartholomew
Gerreiro</hi> a Jeſuit had told him, that many <hi>Sebaſtianiſts</hi>
(ſo they called thoſe affected to the line of <hi>Braganzza</hi>) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him not to depart <hi>Portugal,</hi> becauſe they thought his
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:54712:230"/>
Preſence neceſſary for carrying on their Deſigns; that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
he would not ſee any of them, but went away
for <hi>Germany.</hi> Next, they asked him whether he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the King (meaning the Catholick King) an account
of thoſe Words; he ſaid he had not, as making no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them, but had immediately departed the
Kingdom. They alſo put Queſtions to him about the
Healths he had drunk, and the words he ſpoke upon the
changing his Confeſſor, but they laid the chief ſtreſs on
the words ſpoke by <hi>F. Guerreiro,</hi> and his not diſcovering
them to the King, for which they pretended he was
guilty of High-Treaſon, and conſequently deſerved
Death. <hi>D. Edward</hi> pleaded, that he being a Knight of
the Military Order of Chriſt, the judgment of ſecular
Judges againſt him was void. To this they anſwered,
that in caſes of High-Treaſon, thoſe Priviledges ceaſe;
beſides that, two of the Judges were alſo Knights of
Military Orders. Death put an end to this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
for the Priſoner falling Sick, either through his long
Suffering, or ſome other Cauſe, put the ſame period to

of <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> which he managed ſo dexterouſly,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:54712:231"/>
that bringing them into an ambuſh they were totally rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and 120 Horſes taken. The Enemy made another
Incurſion towards <hi>Olivenza,</hi> but as they retired, 200
<hi>Portugueſe</hi> Horſe Charging them in the Rear, recovered
all the Booty. At this time came to <hi>Elvas, Martin Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo

General of Horſe, Commanded the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
He gathered 1200 Horſe, and advanced towards
<hi>Elvas,</hi> 800 Horſe, and three Regiments of Foot march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out upon the alarm. <hi>Martin Alfonſo</hi> ſent the Horſe
before, ordering <hi>Andrew de Albuquerque</hi> to Attack the
Enemy, if he found them on this ſide the Rivers <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana</hi>

were Overpowered, to retire and draw the Enemy
within the reach of the Foot. <hi>Labarta</hi> Executed his

their example, however <hi>Francis de Franca</hi> with ſuch as
ſtood by him made good his ground till the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
retired. The Province <hi>Tralos Montes</hi> ſtill pteſerved its
quiet, both Parties being inclinable to admit of it.
Count <hi>Seren</hi> who Governed <hi>Beyra,</hi> having Obtained
Leave to quit that Poſt, the King divided it into two
Parts, Appointing two Generals becauſe the Province
was Large. <hi>D. Roderick de Caſtro</hi> had the Territory
about <hi>Guarda, Pinhel</hi> and <hi>Lamego. D. Sancho Manuel</hi>
that about <hi>Caſtelbranco, Viſeu</hi> and <hi>Coimbra. D. Roderick</hi>
being come into his Province, immediately diſpoſed all
things for the Defence of it, and repulſed a Party of the
Enemy that broke in by the way of <hi>Alfayates.</hi> His
next deſign was to take the Fort of <hi>Galegos,</hi> 4 Leagues
from <hi>Almeyda,</hi> and 2 from <hi>Cuidad Rodrigo.</hi> To this
purpoſe he gathered 60 Foot of the <hi>Standing-Forces,</hi> and
2500 of the <hi>Militia,</hi> with 160 Horſe, and 3 pieces of
heavy Canon. On the 23d of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he marched from
<hi>Almeyda,</hi> and the next day came before <hi>Gallegos,</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a battery, and began to play upon the Place, but
perceiving it required more time to make a breach than
he could well ſpare, and Underſtanding the Garriſons
of all the Neighbouring places were marched to <hi>Cuidad
Rodrigo,</hi> to Relieve <hi>Gallegos,</hi> he thought a Fair Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
was offered him of taking St. <hi>Felices,</hi> a Place of
more conſequence. Wherefore they Inſtantly broke
up, and marched towards it with 120 Foot, and 120
Horſe, and by the way Underſtood, that all the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of the place was marched, except 300 Foot, and
800 of the Country People. Upon this advice he
haſted forwards, and giving the Aſſault at ſeveral places
together, Entred the Town, Plundered and Burnt it.
<hi>D. Antony de Iſaſſe,</hi> the Governour having Loſt 150 of
his Men retired with the reſt into the Caſtle, and <hi>D.
Roderick,</hi> Returned with great Honour to <hi>Almeida.</hi>
Severall other ſmall Skirmiſhes hapned, in which the
<hi>Portugueſes</hi> ſtill had the better, which ſo Encouraged
<hi>D. Roderick,</hi> that gathering 800 Foot, and 150 Horſe,
he made an inroad into the Territory of <hi>Cuidad Rodrigo,</hi>
Burning all the Open Towns, and utterly deſtroying
the Country, without meeting the leaſt oppoſition. <hi>D.
Sancho Manuel,</hi> Governour of the other part of the
Province, was not idle, but cut off 100 <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that
had taken a prey in his diſtrict, and Fortifyed <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terra,</hi>
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:54712:232"/>
upon advice that the Enemy were aſſembling a
conſiderable body, which he was not able to Oppoſe in

               <p>3. This Year the King created his Eldeſt Son <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Deſign to Murder King <hi>John.</hi>
                  </note>
Prince of <hi>Braſil,</hi> and began to Aſſign the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of the Houſe of <hi>Braganza,</hi> for the maintaining of
his Houſe. As the King ſtudied all means to ſecure his
Crown, ſo the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> omitted not by all
ways, tho' never ſo unjuſt, to contrive his deſtruction,
and had now infallibly compaſſed it, had not a ſpecial
Providence preſerved him. One <hi>Dominick Leyte,</hi> a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> who had been Clark in one of the Courts,
and was well deſcended, fled to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where, having
offered his Service to that King's Miniſters, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
upon ſeveral great promiſes, and ſome rewards in
poſſeſſion, to Aſſaſſinate King <hi>John.</hi> In order to it, he
returned to <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> with one <hi>Emanuel Roque,</hi>
where, by degrees, he hired ſeveral Houſes in the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners-Street,</hi>
next the Church of St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi> He opened
Doors all along from one Houſe to another, made loop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes
through the walls to the Street, and provided ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Fire-locks loaded with Poiſoned Bullets, to Shoot
the King as he paſſed that way in proceſſion upon <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus-Chriſti</hi>-day;
that if one piece ſhould happen to fail,
another might certainly hit. The day being come, and
he lying in wait, tho' he twice attempted to fire, his
Heart failed him, and the King being paſſed, he ſhut
the Doors, and went away to the Monaſtery of <hi>Our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Grace,</hi> where <hi>Emanuel Roque</hi> expected him with
two Horſes, and they both returned to <hi>Madrid.</hi> There
he framed excuſes for miſſing of his Deſign; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
freſh encouragement, returned again to <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
By the way, he diſcovered his Deſign to <hi>Emanuel Roque,</hi>
who getting to Town before him, on pretence of taking
a Lodging, diſcovered the Treaſon. <hi>Dominick Leyte,</hi>
being Apprehended, Confeſſed the Crime, had both his
Hands cut off, and was afterwards Hanged and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               <p>4. The Marqueſs <hi>de Niza,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Courts.</note> who had been before Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
in <hi>France,</hi> was ſent back this Year to ſollicite
the Concluding a League betwixt the two Crowns. He
propoſed to Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> a Match betwixt Prince
<hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and the Eldeſt Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi>
which the Cardinal ſeemed to approve of, yet it
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:54712:233"/>
took no effect, no more than the League at that time.
However, King <hi>John</hi> ſent three Men of War to joyn
the <hi>French</hi> Fleet. At <hi>Rome, F. Nunho da Cunha,</hi> preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a long memorial to the Pope, preſſing him to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Biſhops Elected by the King, becauſe of the
great want of Prelates there was in all the <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
Dominions, but without any ſucceſs; for three Popes
ſucceſſively, abſolutely perſiſted in the denial. <hi>Francis
de Souja Coutinho,</hi> who was Ambaſſador in <hi>Holland,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having interpoſed all the delays that could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to hinder the States ſending a Fleet to <hi>Pernam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buco,</hi>
finding they had now 30 Sail ready to put to Sea,
boldly made uſe of certain blanks he had of the King's,
to aſſure them that <hi>Parnambuco</hi> ſhould be reſtored;
which done, he immediately gave the King an Account
thereof, deſiring he would order him to be ſecured,
and if it were neceſſary to take off his Head, to ſatisfie
the States, rather than the fraud ſhould be imputed to
His Majeſty. By this wile the Fleet was kept back
from <hi>June</hi> till <hi>December,</hi> when it was put out three
times, and was ſtill beat back by unſeaſonable weather,
to the great advantage of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> in <hi>Pernambuco.</hi>
The King on the other hand, always pretended he had
ordered his Subjects in that Province to lay down their
Arms, that they maintained the War in Contempt of
his Commands, and that the ſuccours they had from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hia,</hi>
were all by ſtealth. Several propoſals were made
for buying thoſe places the <hi>Dutch</hi> poſſeſſed there, but they
all came to nothing.</p>

from the Iſland to the City, but adventuring contrary
to the advice of the Council of War to Attack the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
in their ſtrength, was repulſed with great loſs.
This done, he immediately ſent advice to the King, of
the Condition he was in, who ordered him ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
Twelve Ships were fitted out, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Antony Tellez de Menezes,</hi> Count <hi>de Villa-Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
with Orders, that after relieving <hi>Bahia,</hi> five of
them ſhould be delivered to <hi>Salvador Correa de Sá,</hi> and
<hi>Benavides</hi> appointed Governour of the Province of <hi>Rio

ſail, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Pernambuco</hi> having intelligence of
it, and fearing it was deſigned againſt them, earneſtly
preſſed <hi>Sigiſmund Vanſcope</hi> to quit <hi>Bahia,</hi> and come to

The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Governours at <hi>Pernambuco,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

ſent Major <hi>Antony Dias Cardoſo</hi> with 300 Men, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
all he found there, driving away 200 Priſoners,
and a vaſt number of Cattle. After this, <hi>Andrew Vidal</hi>

of <hi>Rio Grande,</hi> and waſted all that Territory, killing
70 <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and bringing away many Priſoners, and
as much Cattle as ſupplied the want of Proviſions there
was before in the Camp. Whilſt theſe 800 Men were

dexterity, keeping them always upon their guard, that
though it was begun about the beginning of <hi>October,</hi>
they never perceived the work till the 6th of <hi>November,</hi>
when our Artillery began to play upon the City, the
Shoar and the bar, for all thoſe places were within reach.
We alſo Attacked and carried the Palace of Count <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau,</hi>
guarded by two Companies, which having Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
our Men returned without any loſs. At this
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:54712:234"/>
time <hi>Sigiſmund Vanſcop</hi> returned with his Fleet, having
abandoned his Fort at the Iſland <hi>Taparica,</hi> before the
Arrival of our Fleet. The Count <hi>de Villapouca</hi> Arrived
at <hi>Bahia,</hi> eight days after the Enemy had abandoned the
Fort; but eight of their Ships again appeared upon the
Coaſt. Some Ships went out to receive them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a long diſpute, two <hi>Portugueſes</hi> and as many <hi>Dutch</hi>
were burnt and ſunk. The Count took poſſeſſion of
the Government of <hi>Bahia,</hi> and <hi>Antony Tellez de Silva</hi>
the former Governour remained there about his private
Affairs, but with ill ſucceſs, as will hereafter appear.
The five Ships deſigned for <hi>Angola,</hi> went away in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi>

This Year the Fleet of <hi>Spain</hi> conſiſting of 47 Ships and
ſeveral ſmall Veſſels, and Commanded by <hi>D. John</hi> of
<hi>Auſtria,</hi> appeared before that City, as if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned

and though <hi>D. John</hi> fought with him from nine in the
Morning till three in the Afternoon, he was forced to

They ſent a Fleet to his aid, and by their means the

of <hi>Leganes</hi> came the ſecond time to <hi>Badajoz,</hi> to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces. His coming was the cauſe
that all the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> preparations were redoubled, new
Forces raiſed, and the Frontiers fortified. Whilſt the
main Bodies were gathering on both ſides, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>de Leganes</hi> ſent 600 Horſe by the way of <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi>
to plunder the Countrey as far as <hi>Marvao.</hi> The
Count St. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> having timely notice of it, ſent
<hi>Achim de Tamericourt,</hi> the Commiſſary-General, with
400 Horſe and Orders to fight whereſoever he ſhould
meet him. <hi>Tamericourt,</hi> executed his Orders with ſo
much bravery, that meeting the Enemy near <hi>Portale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre,</hi>
he ſoon routed them, took 200 Priſoners, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
all the prey. This diſaſter provoked the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>de Leganez</hi> to haſten putting in execution his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
upon <hi>Olivenza,</hi> which place, the Ingenier <hi>Coſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
(who before we ſaid was won by the <hi>Spaniards</hi>)
had ingaged to put into the Catholick King's hands
without much difficulty. On the 20th of <hi>June,</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
at break of day before <hi>Olivenza,</hi> with 8000
Foot and 3000 Horſe. <hi>Coſmander,</hi> who had the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of the Attack, divided theſe Troops into four
parts, ordering them to give the Aſſault in as many
places; reſerving to himſelf a barrier of the covered
way, where the Soldiers uſed to come out to work. The
<hi>Spaniards</hi> advanced with reſolution, and mounted two
Bulwarks before the Centinels gave the Alarm. The
Soldiers of the next Guards, and ſome of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
haſting to the places where the danger was, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Fight till the reſt of the Garriſon came to
their relief. <hi>D. John de Menezes</hi> the Governour, at the
firſt Alarm, ran half Naked with his Sword in his hand
into the Street, and with his example ſo encouraged the
Soldiers, that they drove the Enemy, forcing many to
caſt themſelves down headlong from the Bullwarks.
Yet the danger was not over, for in other places
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had turned ſome Cannon of the other
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:54712:235"/>
Bullwarks upon the City, and many fell on both ſides.
<hi>D. John,</hi> though he had received three wounds, ceaſed
not to act, as well as give out Orders. The danger
laſted till it was clear day; when <hi>Coſmander</hi> thinking
to force the barrier of the covered way, was ſhot dead
from the Wall. His death put an end to the diſpute,
for though the Marqueſs <hi>de Leganez</hi> diſmounted his
Horſe to carry on the Aſſault; thoſe that were drove
out ſo diſcouraged the others that were to come on,
that the Marqueſs was forced to ſound a retreat, and
immediately returned to <hi>Badajoz.</hi> After this in ſeveral
ſmall rencounters the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were ſucceſsful againſt
the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> took a conſiderable Convoy from them
near <hi>Albuquerque;</hi> and the Count <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Lozenco</hi> made
an Incurſion as far as <hi>Talavera,</hi> whence he returned
with a great Booty, paſſing in ſight of <hi>Badajoz,</hi> in hopes
the Marqueſs <hi>de Leganez</hi> might be drawn out, but he
ſtirred not. Some difference ariſing betwixt the Count
and <hi>John Mendes de Vaſconcellos,</hi> who had governed that
Province before, the King ſent the latter Priſoner to the
Old-Tower, where he remained till the time we ſhall

Intelligence, that the Fleet under the Count <hi>de
Villa Pouca,</hi> was arrived at <hi>Bahia,</hi> but that no Succour
was to be expected from thence. They were no ways
diſmayed at this News, but reſolved to proceed more
vigorouſly than before. Accordingly they ſent <hi>Henry Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
with his own Regiment, and ſome Companies of
<hi>D. Antony Philip Camarao,</hi> to <hi>Rio Grande.</hi> He march'd
with ſuch Secreſie and Expedition, that the Enemy
knew nothing of it, till they felt the effects of his Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
for he Burnt and deſtroyed all before him. Such
as could eſcape, retired to <hi>Gurairas,</hi> a fortifyed place
in a Lake, but he attacked, and carryed that alſo by
Night, putting all within to the Sword, without ſparing
Sex or Age. Thence he marched to <hi>Cunhau,</hi> which
was alſo fortified, yet was deliver'd up, thoſe within on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compounding for their Lives. The King at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
of how great Conſequence it was to expell the
<hi>Dutch</hi> out of <hi>America,</hi> ſent <hi>Francis Barreto de Menezes,</hi>
with two ſmall Veſſels, and 300 Men to command
there, as Camp-Maſter General. By the way, he met
a <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadron, by whom he was taken, and carryed
Priſoner to <hi>Arrecife,</hi> where he was kept in Cuſtody 9
Months, and at laſt made his Eſcape, with one <hi>Francis
Bra,</hi> Son to the Officer that had him in keeping. Being
come into the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Quarters, he joyned with <hi>John
Fernandez Vieyra,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Vidal</hi> being poſitively
ſet down to endure the utmoſt Extremities, rather then
forſake the Enterprize they had in hand. They ſent
Captain <hi>Paul de Cunha,</hi> to ſollicit ſome Succours from
the Count <hi>de Villa Pouca,</hi> at <hi>Bahia,</hi> but he returned
without any, at ſuch time as a Fleet was arrived from
<hi>Holland,</hi> which conſiſted of 44 Sail, with 9000 Land-Men
aboard it, beſides Sea-Men, when it came out,
but ſome had periſhed in a Storm. Upon the Arrival of
this great Power, the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> gather'd all their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
quitting the moſt diſtant, and leaſt advantagious
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:54712:236"/>
Poſts; and yet after all, they could make up but 2200
Men fit for Service. <hi>Sigiſmund Vanſcop,</hi> who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> proclaimed a Pardon to all Slaves, or
<hi>Portugueſes,</hi> that ſhould come over to him, but it took
no effect. On the 18th. of <hi>April,</hi> he took the Field
with 7500 Foot, 500 Seamen, 300 <hi>Indians,</hi> 5 pieces of
Cannon, and a great quantity of Ammunition; and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
to the Fort <hi>Barreta,</hi> the Captain who commanded
there, unadviſedly went out with 80 Men, moſt of
whom were kill'd, the Captain taken, and his Enſign
ſurrendred the Fort. <hi>Francis Barreto,</hi> who commanded
the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> having called a Council of War, it was
reſolved to give the Enemy Battle, though at ſuch great
odds, rather than ſtay to be beaten out of all their Poſts
by degrees. According to this Reſolution they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and poſted themſelves in a ſmall Plain, at the Foot
of the Mountains <hi>Gararapes,</hi> on the 16th. of <hi>April.</hi> They
ſent out Major <hi>Antony Diaz Cardoſo,</hi> with 20 Men to
obſerve the Enemy, who ſtirred not that Night, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
next Morning, being <hi>Low Sunday,</hi> upon the
Mountains; <hi>Antony Dias</hi> with his 20 Men, and 40 <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
that had joyned him, skirmiſhing in their Van.
The Enemy drawing near, our Men attack'd them with
Sword in Hand, and at the firſt Charge diſordered their
Van, which retiring to the other Troops, endeavoured
to rally. <hi>Henry Dias,</hi> with his Regiment, preſſing hard
upon them, was overpowred by the freſh Troops, and
forced to give way, ſo that many of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> who
were diſordered in Confidence of the Victory, began to
fly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Francis Barreto,</hi> in good time rallyed them, and
charging the Enemy again, recovered the Day. Yet
the <hi>Dutch</hi> were not ſoon broke, for the Fight continued
four Hours very obſtinate. At laſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> gave way,
and retired to a Hill, whether <hi>Francis Barreto</hi> thought
not good to purſue them, becauſe his Men were ſpent
with Travel, and faſting 24 Hours. There were taken
33 Colours, many Arms, and a great Booty. At Night
the Enemy returned to the Shoar, leaving behind
1000 Dead, and carrying 523 wounded; of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes,</hi>
80 were killed, and 400 wounded. This done,
<hi>Francis Barreto</hi> marched back to poſſeſs his former Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
hoping the Enemy was not in a Condition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them, and ſo it proved; for they had only poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
themſelves of the Fort <hi>Barreta,</hi> and Town of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda,</hi>
                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:54712:236"/>
which laſt he reſolved to recover. At Night he
ſent <hi>Henry Diaz</hi> with his Regiment, and ſome other
Companies, who drove out the Enemy, killing 160 of
them, and recovered 5 pieces of Canon. <hi>Francis Barre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
ordered the Works to be raſed, and his Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to their Poſt. <hi>Sigiſmund Vanſcop</hi> ſent a Drum, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
exchange of Priſoners, which was refuſed, and
they all ſent away to <hi>Bahia.</hi> Some Ships of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Fleet that had been ſeparated by Storm, arriving now,
<hi>Sigiſmund</hi> ſeveral times attacked the Quarters of <hi>Henry
Dias,</hi> but was as often valiantly repulſed by the <hi>Blacks.</hi>
There was great want of Men and Proviſions in our
Quarters, which was in ſome meaſure remedyed by the
arrival of Collonel <hi>Francis de Figueyroa</hi> from <hi>Bahia,</hi> with
300 Men, and a quantity of Cattle. The joy of this
Succour was abated by the Death of <hi>D. Antony Philip
Camarao,</hi> Governor of the <hi>Indians,</hi> a good Chriſtian, and
reſolute Soldier. <hi>Sigiſmund Vanſcop</hi> perceiving Fortune
favour'd him not at <hi>Pernambuco,</hi> put to Sea with ſome
Ships, and landing in ſeveral parts of <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ia,</hi> returned
with a great Booty he had gather'd. <hi>Francis Barreto</hi>
growing better verſed in the Affairs of that Country, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
the War with good Conduct, as we ſhall ſee in
the following Years.</p>
               <p>4. It has been ſaid above, that <hi>Salvador Correa</hi> was
ſent from <hi>Lisbon</hi> with the Title of Governour of <hi>Rio de
Janeyro,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Dutch</hi> beaten out of <hi>Angola</hi> in <hi>Africk.</hi>
                  </note> and General of the Kingdom of <hi>Angola.</hi> In
<hi>January,</hi> he arrived at <hi>Rio de Janeyro,</hi> and found there
<hi>Emanuel Pacheco de Mello,</hi> with the 5 Ships ſent by the
Count <hi>de Villa Pouca,</hi> in purſuance of the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
<hi>Salvador Correa</hi> was no ſooner landed, but he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Council to deliberate about recovering the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Angola.</hi> It was unanimouſly reſolved to go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Enterprize, and for the carrying of it on, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
contributed 55000 Cruzadoes (which is <hi>7333l.
06 s.—04 d.</hi>) This encouraged him to hire 6 Ships, and
buy 4 ſmall Veſſels. He liſted 900 Land Men, and 600
Sea-men, and having made all neceſſary Proviſion for
them, ſailed for <hi>Angola</hi> on the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> with 15
Sail. The weather proved ſo bad, his ſmall Veſſels
could not keep up with him. However he arrived at
<hi>Quicombo,</hi> where he was ordered to raiſe a Fort, and
landed to view the place. Five days after, arrived his
Vice-Admiral, and two of the ſmall Veſſels, but the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:54712:237"/>
Night following, the Vice-Admiral ſunk in the <hi>Bay,</hi>
without the leaſt Wind, no Man knowing what ſhould
be the cauſe of it. In her periſhed 360 Men, for only
two were ſaved. <hi>Salvador Correa</hi> called a Council,
where he propoſed, that though the King's Orders were
not to make War upon the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as ſuppoſing they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
peaceably with the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> yet finding on the
Contrary, that they ceaſed not to make War upon thoſe
who were retired up the Country; he thought it was
but reaſonable to aſſiſt their Country Men, and expell
thoſe Uſurpers. All that were preſent anſwered, they
would either recover <hi>Angola,</hi> or dye. With this una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
Conſent he ſet ſail again, and arrived at <hi>Loanda.</hi>
Having taken a <hi>Black,</hi> he reported that 300 <hi>Dutch,</hi> with
3000 <hi>Blacks</hi> ſo ſtreightned the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who were
fled to the City <hi>Maſangano,</hi> that it was impoſſible to
have any Correſpondence with them. Having received
this Confirmation of the unjuſt proceedings of the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
he ſent to ſummon the Governor of <hi>Loanda</hi> to ſurrender.
This Meſſage ſo ſurprized him, that he ſent to deſire only
8 days, to reſolve what was to be done. <hi>Salvador Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi>
perceiving this was only to gain Time to call in their
Men that were Abroad, replyed he would grant two
Days, after which they muſt expect to be treated with
the utmoſt Rigour. They accepted of the offer, and in
that time gather'd all the Force they could into the Fort of
St. <hi>Michael,</hi> which commands the City, and that of <hi>our
Lady</hi> on the Shoar, both which can contain 5000 Men.
At the expiration of the two days, <hi>Salvador Correa</hi> ſent
to know whether they were ready to ſurrender; but
they anſwered, they were reſolved to hold out to the
laſt. Hereupon he inſtantly landed 900 Men, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to the Town, which he entred without Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
poſſeſſing himſelf of the Fort <hi>S. Antony</hi> abandoned
by the Enemy, who had left in it 8 pieces of Canon,
whereof only two were nailed. With the other 6 and
4 Demi-Canon brought from the Ships, he formed two
Batteries that Night, which at break of Day began to
play on the Fort of <hi>St. Michael,</hi> but not with any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
effect. <hi>Salvador Correa</hi> diſpleaſed at this diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
and more at the News, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had
defeated the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> at <hi>Maſangano,</hi> reſolved to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon a deſperate Action, which was to aſſault both
the Forts, joyned by a Line of Communication, and
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:54712:237"/>
defended by 1200 <hi>Dutch, French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> and as
many <hi>Blacks.</hi> Accordingly at break of Day, the aſſault
was given, and though bravely carryed on, he was
forc'd to retire, leaving 163 Men killed, and carrying
off 160 wounded. However he reſolved upon a ſecond
attack, but the Enemy prevented him, by hanging out
a white Flag, and ſurrendring the Forts. Five days after
the Surrender, the <hi>Dutch</hi> that were abroad in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
being 250, with 2000 <hi>Blacks,</hi> upon Advice that
the Forts were beſieged, came to relieve them, but fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them loſt, agreed to be ſent away with the reſt,
notwithſtanding the Queen <hi>Ginga,</hi> and the King of <hi>Congos</hi>
Officers encouraged them to continue the War. The Fort
of <hi>Benguela</hi> hearing what had happened at <hi>Loanda,</hi> was
immediately ſurrendred by the <hi>Dutch</hi> that held it. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vador
Correa,</hi> having gathered all the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> that
were diſperſed about the Mountains, repeopl'd the City
<hi>Loanda,</hi> and ſent ſome Veſſels to recover the Iſland St.
<hi>Thomas.</hi> But thoſe <hi>Dutch</hi> that he ſent away, paſſing by
that Iſland, and giving an account of their ill ſucceſs,
their Country Men there, went away with them, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
behind their Artillery, and moſt of their Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Inhabitants ſoon made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Maſters of. Not content with this, <hi>Salvador Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi>
ſent all along that Coaſt, to all places where the
<hi>Dutch</hi> had factories, and in two Months, wholly clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Country of them. Being now rid of the <hi>Dutch,
Salvador Correa,</hi> reſolved to take Revenge of Queen
<hi>Ginga,</hi> the King of <hi>Congo,</hi> and their Confederates, who
had aſſiſted them. He gave the Charge of this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Bartholomew de Vaſconcellos,</hi> with whom joyned
the King of <hi>Dongo,</hi> and the <hi>Jaga</hi> of <hi>Ambaca,</hi> who had
always been faithful to the <hi>Portugueſes. Vaſconcellos,</hi>
ſoon reduced the King of <hi>Congo,</hi> and other leſſer
Princes; the Iſland of <hi>Loando,</hi> being taken from the
former, and new Tributes impoſed on him, as a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Infidelity. Queen <hi>Ginga</hi> fled 300 Leagues
up the Country. This Queen was Daughter to a King
of <hi>Angola,</hi> who was beheaded by the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
whereof, ſhe gathered all the Youth ſhe could,
killing the old People and Children wherever ſhe came,
and continued a ſavage Life in the Mountains with theſe
Robbers, always watching, all Opportunities of doing
harm to the <hi>Portugueſes.</hi> Now at length being driven
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:54712:238"/>
up the Country, ſhe ſent an Ambaſſador, and concluded
Peace with <hi>Salvador Correa,</hi> who ſo well ſettled that
Kingdom, that it continues ever ſince under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

                  <note place="margin">Africk <hi>and</hi> India.</note> making many inroads into the Country in
which he gained much Honour; but the Forces in that
City being but ſmall, he could not make ſo great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages

the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> to fortifie the Town of <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patam,</hi>
which the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had lately built. The

Army to hinder the Work. <hi>D. Alvaro</hi> landed 500 Men,
and after a ſharp Diſpute, put the <hi>Indians</hi> to flight, with
much ſlaughter. This done, he ſaw the Fortifications
finiſhed, and returned to <hi>Goa;</hi> nothing more of Note
happened in <hi>India,</hi> during the Government of <hi>D. Philip
Maſcarenhas,</hi> which laſted till the Year 1651. The
War in <hi>Portugal</hi> being proſecuted with ſmall Force on
both ſides, and the Campaign being often ſpent in ſmall
Incurſions, do not afford much matter worthy an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which is the Reaſon, the Relations of Affairs at
home are ſo ſhort; and the Actions abroad being very
conſiderable, though I endeavour to reduce them to as
ſmall Compaſs as may be; yet becauſe I would omit
nothing that is remarkable, they often ſwell to a greater

which Collonel <hi>Brink</hi> himſelf maintained, in which
place, they advanced not much till <hi>Brink</hi> being ſhot

The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> purſued as far as the Fort <hi>Barreta,</hi> the

However, he was no way diſmayed, but cloſing his

The Count <hi>de Atouguia,</hi> upon the firſt notice hereof,

Both of them had ſome reincounters with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>

ſome incurſions upon the Enemy, for the moſt part with

gave the two Princes an opportunity of putting to Sea
again, after acknowledging the many favours they had

Garriſon, but neither here was his Succeſs any better
than in the former Attempt. On the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi>
they again Marched out and lay cloſe in ambuſh near
the Salt-pits, but the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> having intimation of
the Place they lay in, attacked them there, and after a
Vigorous reſiſtance put them to flight with conſiderable
Slaughter. In theſe and the like attempts the Year was
Spent, the Enemy ſtill decreaſing in power, as receiving
no ſupplies from <hi>Holland,</hi> our Embaſſador <hi>Francis de
Souſa</hi> artificially diverting all that were deſigned for
them.</p>
               <p>6. The Baron <hi>de Alvito,</hi> who governed <hi>Tangier,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the chief ſupport of that place conſiſted in the booties
brought in from the Countrey,<note place="margin">Tangier <hi>and</hi> India.</note> ceaſed not to ſurprize
the <hi>Moors</hi> in ſeveral parts, and brought home conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
preys, which was a great relief to the Garriſon.
<hi>Nunho da Cunha</hi> did the ſame at <hi>Marzagao,</hi> and in one
incurſion killed 300 <hi>Infidels,</hi> and brought away 47 Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.
<hi>D. Francis de Noronha</hi> ſucceeded him in that poſt,
and entred upon his Command with no leſs ſucceſs than
his Predeceſſor went off. In <hi>India, D. Philip Maſcaren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>has</hi>
was ſtill Vice-Roy, and this being the laſt Year of
the Truce with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> they ſeemed inclined to
attempt the Kingdom of <hi>Jafanapatan</hi> before it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.
This obliged the Vice-Roy to ſend a Fleet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Command of <hi>D. Roderick de Monſanto,</hi> to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of that place, but the <hi>Dutch</hi> attempting nothing,
the Fleet returned to <hi>Goa.</hi> The Count <hi>de Aveyras,</hi> ſailed
from <hi>Lisbon</hi> this Year, to be the ſecond time Vice-Roy of
<hi>India,</hi> but he died by the way. Four Ships and two Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,

as was ſaid the laſt Year, during the abſence
of the Count <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> which continued till the
Year, 1657. Through the negligence of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
of the ſtores, Forrage grew ſo ſcarce on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
that ſeveral Troops of Horſe were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
from <hi>Elvas,</hi> and <hi>Campo Mayor,</hi> farther into the
Countrey. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> made their advantage of this
opportunity, for a Party of 1200 Horſe, and 600 Foot,
from <hi>Badajoz,</hi> carried away a great booty from the
Territory of <hi>Villaboim,</hi> there being no Troops in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
to oppoſe them. To revenge this loſs, <hi>D. John
da Coſta,</hi> ordered <hi>Andrew de Albuquerque,</hi> General of the
Horſe, with 1000 of them, and 800 Foot, to make
himſelf Maſter of <hi>Salvatierra,</hi> which is ſix Leagues
from <hi>Olivenza,</hi> and where the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commiſſary-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>John de Rozales</hi> then was with ſome Troops. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
de Albuquerque</hi> aſſembled his Troops at <hi>Olivenza,</hi>
and marched with ſuch ſecrecy to <hi>Salvatiera</hi> that he
had ſecured all the avenues before the Enemy heard
of his approach. The Foot broke into the Town with
little oppoſition, and with as little took the Caſtle,
where they made 100 Horſe Priſoners. The booty
was very conſiderable, the Town conſiſting of 400
Houſes. <hi>Andrew de Albuquerque</hi> returned to <hi>Olivenza,</hi>
having loſt but three Men in this Action, for certain
Troops of the Enemy that appeared ſerved only to be
Witneſſes of the burning of the Town. Some few
days after, <hi>D. John da Coſta</hi> lay in ambuſh to cut
off the Troops of <hi>Badajoz,</hi> that uſed to come out to
Forrage between the Rivers <hi>Guadiana</hi> and <hi>Caya,</hi> but
they not going out that day, his Deſign was diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
His Horſe being now much out of Caſe for want
of Forrage, the ſcarcity till continuing, he ſtudied all
means how to diſable the Enemies Troops. Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that they had turned 400 Horſes to graſs near
<hi>Medellen,</hi> which is 16 Leagues from <hi>Campo Mayor;</hi> he
gave charge to Captain <hi>Emanuel de Saldanha</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to deſtroy them. <hi>Saldanha</hi> committed this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
to his Lieutenant, <hi>Francis Lobo,</hi> who ſet forward
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:54712:243"/>
twice, with only 10 Men to put this in Execution, but
diſcovering parties of the Enemy both times, he was
forced to return. The third time he went through, and
having defeated 15 Men that guarded the Horſes, kill'd
moſt of them, and returned in ſafety. The Enemy now
making great Preparations to enter upon Action, <hi>D.
John da Coſta,</hi> who had neither a Force to oppoſe them
in the Field, nor Proviſions in the Frontier Towns to
hold out a Siege, acquainted the King with his wants,
who ſent large ſupplies of Mony, whereby the Province
was put into ſuch a Poſture of Defence, that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
thought not fit to attempt any thing on that ſide.
But <hi>D. John da Coſta</hi> being thus ſupplyed, ceaſed not to
moleſt them, with continual Incurſions. Not to ſpeak
of other ſmall Parties, one of 30 Men, commanded by
the Cornet <hi>Stephen de Rocha,</hi> came off with more Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
then Succeſs. Being advanced in the Enemies
Country, he found his retreat was cut off by 7 Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons;
whereupon he retired to an old ruined Houſe,
he found in the Field. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſurrounded it,
and offered him quarter, which he refuſing, they attacked
it, and were repulſed. After endeavouring in Vain to burn
it, they went away, carrying with them the Horſes of
thoſe in the Houſe, and the Cornet returned to <hi>Moura,</hi>

Son, having privately ſtole away from Court, without
his Fathers Knowledge, appeared at <hi>Elvas,</hi> and was
there received with all the Reſpect due to his Perſon.
The King was not a little diſturbed at this Accident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
jealous of the Prince's Deſigns, and therefore uſed
all gentle Means to draw him back to <hi>Lisbon;</hi> but that
which at laſt prevailed with him, was want of Money,
which forced him back to Court about the end of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</hi>
He poſitively reſolved to return to the Fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

the Country People to rebuild ſeveral Places
that had been deſtroyed on the Borders during the War,

Twice they attempted to rebuild them, but they were
as often totally demoliſhed by order of the Viſcount,
whereupon the Country deſiſted. The Count <hi>de Atouguia</hi>
who governed the Province, <hi>Tras os Montes,</hi> lived this
Year free from Action; both ſides, as if it had been by
Agreement, forbearing to infeſt one another. Nor was
there any conſiderable Action in that part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince

that it might be ſaid he had infuſed new Courage into
the Army, marched with 1500 Men, and entring the
Town of <hi>Bodon,</hi> plundered and burnt it. <hi>D. Sancho Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi>
who governed the other part of the Province, ceaſed
not all the Summer to infeſt the Frontiers of the Enemy,

Orders to all the Provinces of the Kingdom, abſolutely
forbidding any Incurſions to be made for the future, into

it was to the Kingdom, by reaſon of the great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
reaped by thoſe inroads, for he in the ſpace of two
Years, had deſtroyed above 1400 of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe,
having ſcarce loſt 100 of his own. Beſides he looked
upon this as ſo great a check to his Authority, that he

his Order, and the King gave him the Title of
Earl of <hi>Soure.</hi> He to appear worthy of this Honour,
endeavoured to make amends by his Conduct, for what

gathered 1500 Horſe from the Neighbouring Garriſons,
which Lieutenant General <hi>Tamericour,</hi> and Commiſſary
General <hi>Duqueſne</hi> divided betwixt them. With theſe

they were drove back by ſome of our Troops. Freſh
Troops ſeconded the Enemy from the City, and they
kept in play, till <hi>D. Alvaro de Viveros</hi> took the Field,
with all the Horſe of that place, and having drawn them
up, advanced further then was thought convenient for
the ſafety of the Town. <hi>Duqueſne</hi> who was neareſt,
thinking it now time, moved towards him with more
Courage than Order. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General halted and
bravely ſtood the Charge, in which <hi>Duqueſne</hi> received

but that Captain <hi>Labar,</hi> a valiant <hi>French</hi>-Man, diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with a party of Horſe, charging another of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
was himſelf killed, and moſt of his Men wounded.
The Province <hi>Tras os Montes,</hi> governed by the Count <hi>de
Antouguia,</hi> by conſent of both Parties, was for ſeveral
Months free from Action. Some ſmall Incurſions were
afterwards made on both ſides, but none of Note. The
King having now choſe the Count <hi>de Penaguiao</hi> his Lord
Chamberlain, to go Ambaſſador into <hi>England;</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Count <hi>de Atouguia</hi> to execute his Office, and
<hi>John Mendez de Vaſconcellos,</hi> was ſent in his place to
govern the Province. The moſt remarkable Action per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
this Year by <hi>D. Roderick de Caſtro,</hi> in his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Province of <hi>Beyra,</hi> was the burning of the
Town of <hi>Martiago,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Some Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Bei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi>
                  </note> which contained 300 Houſes; the
other Enterprizes were too ſmall to merit any place
here. <hi>D. Sancho Manuel,</hi> who commanded in the other
part of <hi>Beyra,</hi> underſtanding that a Troop of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
was quartered at <hi>Lobeyros,</hi> and had twice repulſed
parties of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Militia that ravaged the
Country thereabouts, ordered the Cornet <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Homen,</hi> with 40 choſen Men to lye in wait for
them. He ſent before ſome of the Militia to drive the
Cattel; the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troop backed by a company of
Foot, immediately ruſhed out upon them, but the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
who was at hand, furiouſly falling in upon the
Foot, broke them, and with the ſame Succeſs routed
the Horſe, killing many, and taking ſeveral Priſoners.
This Succeſs was ſoon ballanced by a greater diſaſter,
for <hi>D. Sancho</hi> being informed that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gathered
a great Power, in order to break into his Province;
and not being in a condition to oppoſe them, he thought
to divert them, by making at the ſame time an inroad
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:54712:246"/>
into their Frontiers, hoping he might retire to places of
ſafety, before they could intercept him. With this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
he gathered 350 Foot, and 200 Horſe, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
to <hi>Segura,</hi> ſent before Captain <hi>Gaſpar de Tavora</hi>
with 140 Horſe, to drive the Cattle about <hi>Sacravim,</hi>
which done, he had orders ro retire to Collonel <hi>John
Fialho,</hi> who ſhould expect him with 60 Horſe, and the
reſt of the Foot, at a place called <hi>Salto,</hi> near the River
<hi>Lagao. Gaſpar de Tavora,</hi> executed his Orders with ſuch
expedition, that by Noon he had joyned <hi>John Fiallo.</hi>
But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having notice of <hi>D. Sancho</hi>'s March,
no ſooner entred <hi>Portugal,</hi> then they turned back, and
marching towards their Town of <hi>Carza,</hi> by which the
<hi>Portugueſes</hi> muſt of neceſſity paſs, appeared before <hi>John
Fialho,</hi> when leaſt he expected it, with 600 Horſe, and as
many Foot. He covering his Horſe with the Foot, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
in good order for above a League, till coming to a
Paſs, the Enemy drew up before him. Neceſſity now
obliging him to charge them, he fell with ſuch Bravery
upon the 600 Foot, that he abſolutely broke them; but
in the mean while, the 600 <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe charging his
200 now divided from their Foot, after ſome ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
overpowered, and totally routed them. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
purſued their Advantage, and <hi>John Fialho</hi> rallying
his Foot, recovered an advantagious Poſt to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
The Enemy ceaſed their purſuit in care for their
Foot, which had been overthrown, and return'd to
compleat their Victory, by deſtroying <hi>John Fialho</hi> and
his party. He had, as was ſaid, gained an advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
poſt; but having ſpent all his Ammunition, was
made Priſoner with all the Officers of Horſe and Foot,
140 Horſe eſcaped, the reſt with all the Foot, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
killed or taken. After this Diſaſter, <hi>D. Sancho Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi>
retired to <hi>Idanha Nova,</hi> and garriſoned the Fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
with the Militia, writing to the Prince for ſupplies,
which were ſoon ſent him. Being recruited, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Forces with thoſe of <hi>D. Roderick de Caſtro,</hi> he
reſolved to revenge the late Affront, by ſurpiſing the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Coria.</hi> They marched with 1500 Foot, and 700
Horſe, ſome Petards, and other neceſſaries for ſuch an
Enterprize; but the diſtance being great, they could not
come before the City till after day. However, having
divided their Foot, they attacked the Suburbs in two
places, which they entered, plunder'd and burnt;
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:54712:247"/>
which done, ſeeing no poſſibility of forcing the City,
they retired, and each returned to his Province.</p>
               <p>3. The troubles of <hi>France</hi> increaſing, rendred all Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Negotiations ſo uncertain at that Court, that <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
de Souſa Coutinho,</hi> having obtained leave of the King,
came to <hi>Portugal,</hi> leaving <hi>D. Felicianus Dourado</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of the Embaſſy, to Reſide there during his abſence.
At this time there was held at <hi>Paris</hi> a Synod of Biſhops,<note place="margin">Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours uſed for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhops, but in vain.</note>
to whoſe Conſideration King <hi>John</hi> recommended the
finding of ſome expedient for prevailing with the Pope
to precognize the Biſhops of <hi>Portugal.</hi> They uſed their
utmoſt endeavours, but the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſt ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing,
nothing could be done at this time. <hi>Antony de
Souſa de Macedo,</hi> having obtained leave of the King to
quit the Embaſſy of <hi>Holland, D. Antony Rapozo</hi> Succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him in that employ. He made it his buſineſs to
heighten the miſunderſtanding betwixt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Dutch,</hi> becauſe the latter having ſuſtained great loſſes
by the War they were engaged in with the former, were
thereby diſabled from ſending ſuccours to <hi>Pernambuco.</hi>
The King at the ſame time conſidering how advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
the Friendſhip of <hi>England</hi> might prove to his
Affairs, reſolved to ſend an Ambaſſador thither, and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
upon the Count <hi>de Penaguiao</hi> for that employ, as
we have ſaid before.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Francis Barreto,</hi>

                     <hi>Francis Barreto,</hi> his further Actions in <hi>Brazil.</hi>
                  </note> the General of <hi>Pernambuco,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
the Siege of <hi>Arrecife,</hi> with conſiderable reſolution,
hoping at length to reduce the Beſieged, whoſe only
hope conſiſted in the ſuccours they expected from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
The firſt part of the Year paſſed without any
memorable Action. In <hi>May, Francis Barreto,</hi> ordered
Major <hi>Antony Diaz Cardozo,</hi> with 400 Men, to lie cloſe
in ambuſh, and ſend out parties to endeavour to draw
the Garriſons of the Forts <hi>Barreta</hi> and <hi>Affogados,</hi> into
the ſnare. The Major poſſet himſelf of the poſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
him without being diſcovered, and ſending out
certain ſmall Parties drew out the Enemy, as he had
deſigned, but the number of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> being grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than had been expected, the Fight continued doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for above an hour; at length the <hi>Dutch</hi> were rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and fled to their Forts, leaving the Field covered
with dead Bodies. After this, <hi>Barreto</hi> being informed
that the Enemy had laid up great ſtore of Brazil-Wood
and other Commodities at <hi>Rio Grande,</hi> in order to be
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:54712:247"/>
tranſported into <hi>Holland,</hi> he ſent thither the Collonel
<hi>Andrew Vidal</hi> with 300 Men, who burnt their wood,
waſted all the Countrey, and returned with a great
booty and many Priſoners. The <hi>Dutch</hi> had in thoſe
Seas 50 ſail of Ships, from 20 to 30 Guns, but ſo ill
Manned and Equipped for want of ſupplies from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that tho' they met the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Brazil-Fleet and
fought it, yet after a ſhort diſpute they were forced to
retire without any Prize, and the Fleet arrived ſafe at
<hi>Lisbon,</hi> on the 26th of <hi>October.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. We left the Baron <hi>de Alvito,</hi>

labouring under great ſcarcity of Proviſions the laſt
Year. He had not as yet received any relief from <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
which being known at <hi>Ceuta, D. John Soares,</hi> who
Commanded there for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> hoping their wants
might reduce that Garriſon to revolt from their King,
ſent two Brigantines and a Bark thither, ordering the
Commander of the Bark to enter the Port, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
the Letters he had writ for that purpoſe, to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
and other Men of note. This being put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
the Baron read the Letters, which were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
him to ſubmit himſelf to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
with promiſe of great Rewards, or elſe to offer him
ſafe paſſage to <hi>Lisbon.</hi> The Baron, whoſe Loyalty was
not ſhaken, having in vain endeavoured to draw thoſe

in which, went ſeveral reſolute Gentlemen with Fire-Arms,
and Orders to Attack the Enemies Bark, when
they ſhould approach to receive the Letter they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
The Barks coming together they fired, killed
three of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and carried the reſt Priſoners
to the City. This Action ſo exaſperated the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
that they ſent three Ships to interrupt any relief that
might be deſigned for <hi>Tangier,</hi> but the Baron ordering
the Veſſels that came from <hi>Lisbon</hi> to be detained in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garve,</hi>
till further advice from him, the Enemy quitted
their ſtation, and gave way to five Caravels with Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to relieve that City. The Baron being informed that
certain Captive <hi>Moors</hi> in the Town, had by intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
with thoſe abroad, agreed to let themſelves down
the Wall of the old Town, near which, the others
were to lie hid in order to receive them; he ordered
three Soldiers habited like <hi>Moors</hi> to be let down, and
when the <hi>Infidels</hi> came on to ſuccour them, they were
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:54712:248"/>
received with ſuch a volley of great and ſmall ſhot,
as laid many dead before the Town, the reſt flying with
more ſpeed than they came on.</p>

home,<note place="margin">The Affairs of <hi>India.</hi>
                  </note> imbarked for <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and died by the way. The
Count <hi>de Aveyras,</hi> ſent by the King to ſucceed him,
dying alſo in the Voyage, as was ſaid before; the
Sealed Patents, which are always laid up to provide for
ſuch exigencies, being opened, it was found that the
care of the Government was committed to <hi>D. F. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
dos Reys,</hi> Primate of <hi>India, Francis de Melo de Caſtro,</hi>
and <hi>Antony de Souſa Coutinho.</hi> Having entred upon the
Government, they fitted out a Fleet of 22 Sail, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Antony de Souſa Coutinho,</hi> one of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.
This Fleet ſet ſail in order to recover <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate;</hi>
ſome of them entred that Bay, but receiving
much harm from the Cannon of the Town, they ſtood
out again, and came to Anchor in the River <hi>Lafette,</hi>
100 Leagues from <hi>Maſcate.</hi> They had lain there but
a few days before they diſcovered a mighty Fleet of
<hi>Arabs,</hi> Commanded by one <hi>Hali</hi> a <hi>Moor. Antony de
Souſa,</hi> received them with ſuch gallantry, that after the
Battle had laſted many Hours, he obtained a Compleat
Victory, killing above 5000 of the <hi>Infidels.</hi> Captain
<hi>Antony Lobo,</hi> in this Action, being boarded by two of
the Enemies Veſſels, ſet fire to his own Powder, and
blew himſelf up and both them. <hi>Antony de Souſa</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Goa,</hi> where he found <hi>D. Vaſco Maſcarenhas,</hi>
Count <hi>de Obidos,</hi> whom the King had appointed Vice-Roy,
upon the News of the Death of the Count <hi>de
Aveyras.</hi> Within a very few days, the whole City
running into Mutiny, offered the Government to <hi>Antony
de Souſa,</hi> who rejected their offer; then they pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>D. Bras de Caſtro,</hi> a Turbulent Man, who preſently
accepted of it, which done, they ſeized upon the perſon
of the Count, and kept him Priſoner. But God ſhewed
how diſpleaſing to him this Rebellious Government
was, by the Judgments that immediately attended the
beginning of it, for the <hi>Dutch</hi> before the expiration of
the Truce began a War, which proved the moſt fatal
to the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> of any they ever had ſince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of that Countrey. The <hi>Hollandrs</hi> reſolving to
break the Truce, fitted out 10 Ships, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:54712:248"/>
of <hi>John Manſucar,</hi> who coming to <hi>Tutocorim,</hi>
ſeized all the Money laid up there to buy Pearl, and at
the ſame time took a Ship bound from <hi>Cochim</hi> to <hi>China.
D. Bras de Caſtro,</hi> immediately prepared to oppoſe them.
<hi>Ceylon</hi> was the place next to danger, as being that they
had always aimed at. <hi>Emanuel Maſcarenhas Homem,</hi>
was Governour there, who hearing of the preparations
of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> ſent four Companies to ſecure <hi>Calaturé,</hi>
the ſafety of <hi>Columbo</hi> depending on that Port. This
reinforcement not coming in time, the place fell into the
hands of the Enemy, and for <hi>Columbo,</hi> all the people of
the Countrey flocking thither could not hold out long
for want of Proviſions. The News of this loſs being
carried to <hi>Manicravare,</hi> where <hi>Lope Barriga</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the whole Garriſon mutinied, becauſe, according
to the Orders received from <hi>Maſcarenhas,</hi> he deſigned
to march them to <hi>Columbo,</hi> and killing ſome that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them, ſent him away and took the Field. The
King of <hi>Candia</hi> thinking to make his advantage of this
diſorder, marched a good body of Forces towards them,
and offered them large terms if they would come over
to his Service. They anſwered him with their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and after a fight which laſted many hours, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to <hi>Columbo. Emanuel Maſcarenhas</hi> the Governour,
having gathered what Forces he could into the City,
deſigned to oppoſe the mutiniers, and fired three pieces
of Cannon. They reſolved to be revenged, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced
by two Companies of Foot, which deſerted to
them from the City, but the Religious and Inhabitants
to prevent the miſchief they ſaw impending, opened one
of the Gates and let them in. <hi>Emanuel Maſcarenhas,</hi>
took Sanctuary in a Monaſtery, and the City choſe for
their Governours <hi>Gaſpar de Araujo Pereyra, D. Francis
Rolim,</hi> and <hi>Francis de Barros da Silva,</hi> and to Command
in the Field <hi>Gaſpar Figueyra da Serpa,</hi> an experienced
Soldier. He hearing the <hi>Dutch</hi> with ſome Natives were
abroad gathering Cinnamon, marched to cut them off,
but they having intelligence of his march, were gone
before; ſo having reduced ſome Towns that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted,
he returned to <hi>Columbo.</hi> The Governours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
advice that the <hi>Dutch</hi> were raiſing a Fort at
<hi>Angratota,</hi> which would Command all the Countrey
about <hi>Columbo,</hi> ſent <hi>Gaſpar Figueyra</hi> with 500 Foot, to
drive them thence. <hi>Gaſpar Figueyra,</hi> marched with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:54712:249"/>
and having ſecured all the Avenues by which
the Enemies might receive any relief, carried on a Trench
ſo cloſe to their work, that having raiſed a Platform
and planted thereon one piece of Cannon, he ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded
them, that after 10 days the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
upon diſcretion; 110 of them were taken, 40
<hi>Jaos,</hi> and 300 <hi>Chingalas,</hi> who were ſeverely puniſhed,
as being for the moſt part Subjects to the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi>
At the ſame time <hi>John Botado,</hi> who was in the
Inland with a Company of <hi>Portugueſes</hi> and ſome <hi>Blacks,</hi>
was ſet upon by an Officer of the King of <hi>Candia,</hi> with
3000 Men, and though the <hi>Blacks</hi> forſook him, the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes</hi>
fought ſo deſperately that they put the <hi>Indians</hi>
to flight, leaving ſo many dead, that thoſe who ſaw
them could not be perſwaded they had been killed by
ſo few. <hi>John Botado,</hi> with his Men retired to <hi>Columbo.</hi>
Four Ships and one Caravel ſailed this Year from <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi>

2. In the midſt of all his fortunate Succeſſes, the King
received one Fatal blow, which outbalanced many of
his former proſperities. This was the death of his
Eldeſt Son <hi>Prince Theodoſius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prince <hi>Theodoſi</hi>-the Kings Eldeſt Son dyes.</note> whom for his excellent
qualities he entirely loved, The <hi>Prince,</hi> as has been

perfect health, for there continued a defluxion upon
his ſtomach, which no medicines could ever remove, but
on the contrary ſome that were uſed ſeemed to haſten
his End. On the 3d of <hi>May</hi> he took to his bed, and
for 6 Days the Phiſitians Employed all their Art for
recovering of him, the whole Clergy and layety offering
up their Prayers to God for him. All proved in vain,
for the Number of his days was compleat, therefore on
the Night he received the Viaticum and on the 15th
gave up his Ghoſt. The <hi>Encomiums</hi> beſtowed on this
Prince are ſo great, they will appear incredible, and
therefore I think fitter to omit than trouble the Reader
with them. He dyed Aged 19 Years, 3 months and 7
days. His body was buryed in the <hi>Royal Monaſtery</hi> of
<hi>Belem,</hi> being Attended thither by an incredible multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

agreed to Support the charge of the War with the Tenth

add one Fourth part more of the ſaid Tax; but if it
ſhould happen the Enemy Invaded the Kingdom with
ſuch powerfull Forces as might bring it into danger,
then they offered all they had for the Support of the
Crown: Before the <hi>Parliament</hi> broke up, the King ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
another Loſs, in the Death of his Eldeſt Daughter
<hi>Joanna,</hi> who departed this Life on the 17th of <hi>September,</hi>

The beſieged were now reduced to deſpair, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
determined to attempt gaining the Fort <hi>Arrayal,</hi>
which <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> their Generall knowing to be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
Enterprize, endeavoured to divert them from,
but perceiving he Laboured in vain, told them, the only
means to attack that Fort was by Gaining firſt the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Aguiar.</hi> On the 11th of <hi>March,</hi> he marched out of
the Fort <hi>Affogados</hi> with the greateſt part of that and the
Neighbouring Garriſons. Captain <hi>Alfonſo de Albuquerque</hi>
Commanded at the quarter of <hi>Aguiar.</hi> He not thinking
it for his honour to receive them in his works, marched
out and ſoon drove them back to their Forts. Twice
after this they attempted the ſame Poſt, and were both
time repulſed with conſiderable Loſs, which cauſed them
to forbear any farther attempts on the beſiegers and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their Men in bringing proviſions from the River of
<hi>S. Francis.</hi> Theſe Men were met there by 100 <hi>Portugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and ſome Blacks Commanded by Captain <hi>Francis Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regos,</hi>
who the firſt firing was ſhot through the body, Yet
his Men continued the Charge with ſuch bravery, that
they drove the <hi>Dutch</hi> to their Fort, and thence to their
Ships, without the proviſions they came for. Here upon the
Council ſent one of their body into <hi>Holland</hi> to preſs for

certain Hords of Arabs come thither for conveniency of
paſture, he ſent the Commander in cheife of the Horſe,
with 92 Troopers to attack them by Night. Being come

Apprehenſions. The three Governors, who we ſaid laſt
Year commanded in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> ſent <hi>Gaſpar de Figueyra de

revolted, and bring in Proviſions. The King of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>'s

the Upper. He attacked them vigorouſly, and their

to purſue him, he rallyed, drove them back, and
entred their Works with them, making a mighty Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This Succeſs made many Towns ſubmit, which
payed their Arrears of Contributions, and a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity

was conveyed to <hi>Columbo.</hi> Soon after, 10 Companies

where there was great ſtore of Proviſions; and though
10000 <hi>Chingalas</hi> defended a Wood that lay in the way,

Diſeaſes rendred him incapable of that Poſt; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Francis de Mello</hi> gave it to his Nephew, <hi>Antony de

the King of <hi>Candia; Francis de Mello,</hi> at the earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt

but he marched out againſt the King of <hi>Candia,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
worſted him in ſeveral Encounters, forced him to
retire to the City <hi>Candia,</hi> near to which he encamped,
and continued a conſiderable time; underhand raiſing
ſuch jealouſies in the King's Mind, that he cauſed him to
behead many of his Favourites. The <hi>Dutch</hi> at the ſame
time had agreed with <hi>Hidalcan,</hi> to beſiege <hi>Goa</hi> by Land,
whilſt they blocked it up by Sea, promiſing him the
plunder of the Place. They came before it according
to agreement with a Squadron, but <hi>Hidalcan</hi> failing

of Horſe, by order of the Count <hi>de Soure,</hi>
marched with all the Horſe he could gather, and ſome
Foot, to the Valleys of <hi>Mata Moros,</hi> and St. <hi>Ann,</hi> near
the City <hi>Xeres.</hi> All the Country people was retired to
thoſe Places, and defended them the ſpace of ſome
Hours; but being at length defeated, the Villages were
plundered and burnt; which done, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Troops
loaden with Booty, returned to their Quarters. Very

                  <hi>Oliva</hi> was a large
Town, not far from the City <hi>Xerez,</hi> defended by an old
Caſtle, and was the Receptacle of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when
they made incurſions on that ſide. Thither <hi>Andrew de

Albuquerque,</hi> though not well recovered of his Wounds,
marched with 2000 Foot, and 1500 Horſe. By break
of day he attacked the Town, and made himſelf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

found more oppoſition, becauſe two Petards he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to the Gates, failed of the intended effect, and
all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> able to bear Arms, had retired thither.
However, <hi>Albuquerque</hi> lodged himſelf under the Wall,
and began to carry on two Mines. The Beſieged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

what he could carry. The Booty was great, becauſe
not only the Inhabitants of <hi>Oliva,</hi> but of many other
Towns, had conveyed their Goods thither, as to a place

<hi>Albuquerque</hi> added ſome Works to the place, and leaving

and having called a Council of War, it was reſolved to
turn it into a formal Siege. In order to it, they agreed
their firſt attempt muſt be to gain the Fort called <hi>Rego,</hi>
which was upon the <hi>Salt pits. Peter Jaquez</hi> went away
to the Fleet, with a Reſolution ſo to ſecure the Bar of
<hi>Arrecife,</hi> that no Succour might poſſibly be conveyed
in. On the 5th. of <hi>January,</hi> the Works by Land were
advanced nearer, and the Enemy ſhut up within a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
Compaſs, and a Battery of 9 Pieces of Cannon
raiſed againſt the Fort <hi>Rego,</hi> Collonel <hi>Andrew Vidal</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up his Poſt there. On the 11th of <hi>January, Francis
Barreto</hi> with 2500 Foot, marched to the Fort, raiſed
two batteries the one of 7 and the other of 5 Pieces of
Cannon, and began to carry on his approaches with
great Art. That Night they came within Musket-ſhot
of the Fort. On the 15th both the Cannon and ſmall ſhot
played inceſſantly on bothſides, the <hi>Dutch</hi> at the ſame time
attempting to put ſome ſuccour into the Fort, but were
diſappointed. That Night <hi>Hugh Naquer</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the Fort Surrendred, Capitulating for the
Garriſon to march out with their Armes, and to be ſent
to <hi>Portugal.</hi> Before day, he marched out with 70 Men.
Two Companies of <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were put into it. Hence
<hi>Francis Barreto</hi> marched to the Fort <hi>Altanar,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome ſhort reſiſtance was delivered upon the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
as the other. Before the taking of this Fort the
<hi>Dutch</hi> had abandoned 3 others, and now quitted 3 more,
with the ſame precipitation. <hi>Barreto</hi> deſigning next
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:54712:252"/>
to attack the Fort of <hi>Sinco Pontas,</hi> was informed
that the Enemy had ſecured a Poſt, he thought to have
lodged his Men upon; whereupon he ſent Collonel <hi>Andrew
Vidal,</hi> with 1000 Men to diſlodge them, which he did;
and Fortifyed himſelf in the ſame Place. Next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Canon was conveyed thither and the Trenches
were opened againſt the Fort <hi>Sinco Pontas.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi>
perceiving the danger to approach, made overtures for a
Surrender, which were eaſily admitted; and after ſome
days Spent in adjuſting all differences, they finally agreed
upon the following Articles. That the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
poſſeſt of all their moveables. That they ſhould
have ſome of their own Ships with Iron Guns, to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport
them to <hi>Holland.</hi> That ſuch as would might ſtay
there and be Treated in point of Religion as they were
in <hi>Portugal.</hi> That all the Out-Forts be put into the hands
of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> with their Artillery and Ammunition.
That a Garriſon be immediately received into <hi>Arrecife</hi>
and the City <hi>Mauricea,</hi> where the <hi>Dutch</hi> might continue
3 Months but without any Sort of Armes. That all
Ships coming from <hi>Holland</hi> for Four months to come
have the Liberty of all thoſe Ports. That the <hi>Dutch</hi>
give hoſtages to ſecure the Surrender of all other places
they poſſeſt, belonging to <hi>Portugal</hi> on that Coaſt. That
the <hi>Indians, Mulattos</hi> and Blacks who ſerved, be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Theſe were the principall Articles ſigned on both
ſides the 26th of <hi>January.</hi> Next day the <hi>Portugueſes</hi>
took poſſeſſion of all the Poſts where they found 121
braſs Guns, 170 of Iron; Ammunition and proviſion for
a Year and great quantity of Stores. The ſame Night
that <hi>Arrecife</hi> was delivered, a <hi>Dutch</hi> Lieutenant Collonel
fled over to the Iſland <hi>Itamaraca,</hi> and perſwading the
People there that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> ſpared neither Sex nor
Age, they Shipt themſelves and goods on board two Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats,
and Sailing to <hi>Paraiba</hi> ſpread the ſame Terror there,
obliging Collonel <hi>Autin,</hi> who Commanded, againſt his
will to Embark on a Ship that arrived there from <hi>India,</hi>
and leaving the Fort in poſſeſſion of 50 <hi>Portugueſes</hi> who

could be, knowing that want of Proviſions would in
time ruine us. He marched and in the way to <hi>Calature,</hi>
found an Entrenchment guarded by ſome <hi>Blacks</hi> whom
he defeated. Then advancing to <hi>Diagao</hi> a place where
he muſt paſs the River, he found it Guarded by two
Companies of <hi>Dutch,</hi> and a Number of <hi>Chingalas,</hi> upon
whom he kept Firing for the Space of 10 days, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

received orders to march up the Country, in order to

<hi>Antony Mendez</hi> drew up his Men under cover and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

At the beginning of this Year, <hi>Gaſpar Figuegra de Serpa</hi>
had waged War ſo ſucceſsfully upon the King of <hi>Candia,</hi>
that he had reduced him to Peace. The <hi>Dutch</hi> layed
ſiege to <hi>Calature</hi> and continued before it 10 days, at the
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:54712:255"/>
End whereof finding themſelves too weak to carry it,
they departed. Before <hi>D. Bras de Caſtro</hi> was depoſed
from the government of <hi>India,</hi> he ſent <hi>Antony de Souſa</hi> to
ſucceed <hi>Francis de Mello</hi> in the Government of <hi>Ceilon,</hi>
with Six Galliots and Two pinks laden with proviſions
and other neceſſaries. Meeting Two <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War,
theſe ſmall Veſſels were diſperſed, Two of them ran
aſhore, two made their way to <hi>Columbo,</hi> and <hi>Antony de
Souſa</hi> with Two more got into <hi>Jafanapatan.</hi> Thence he
went by Sea to the Port <hi>Putelao</hi> 15 Leagues from <hi>Columbo,</hi>
where <hi>Antony Mendez Aranha</hi> met and conducted him
ſafe by Land to that City, into which he was received
with great joy, and <hi>Francis de Mello</hi> put him in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the government. Twelve <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War
arrived at <hi>Ceilon</hi> from <hi>Batavia,</hi> Six of them lay before
the Barr of <hi>Columbo,</hi> the other Six made their way to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature,</hi>
where Landing their men they layed Seige to it,
and the place being very ill provided, after the Garriſon
had endured the utmoſt Extremities it was at laſt, ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
upon honourable Termes. <hi>Gaſpar Figueyra de Serpa</hi>
not knowing that <hi>Calature</hi> was loſt, advanced with 500
<hi>Portugueſes</hi> to endeavour to put ſome ſuccour into it, but
being attacked by 1600 <hi>Dutch,</hi> was totally routed and
many of his men killed. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> purſuing their
Victory came and ſate down before <hi>Columbo,</hi> raiſed Four
batteries, and playing continually with 12 peices of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Canon, ruined not only the houſes but the works of
the Town, and gave a furious aſſault to the Fort <hi>Sancta
Cruz,</hi> yet without ſucceſs for they were repulſed with
conſiderable Loſs. At the ſame time ſeverall other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks
were carryed on with great obſtinacy, inſomuch
that at laſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> broke into the City, where they
found no leſs oppoſition, than without, moſt of them that
entred being either killed or wounded. At length they
were repulſed in all parts with the loſs of near 1000
men. This diſcouraged not the <hi>Dutch</hi> who ſtill carryed
on their works with great diligence, raiſing new
batteries and lodging themſelves upon the edge of the
ditch. Then they fell to mining which the beſieged
underſtanding, they countermined and drove them out of
all their ſubterraneous works. Theſe loſſes made the
Enemy alter their reſolutions and change the Siege into
a blockade, whereupon the Governour turned out 300
perſons that were not fit for Service, whereof about 200
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:54712:255"/>
eſcaped into the Mountains. The <hi>Dutch</hi> having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
conſiderable ſupplies, carry on their works anew,
and again fall to battering of the place inceſſantly. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
from the King of <hi>Candia</hi> were conducted
through the Enemies Camp into the City, where they
demanded it ſhould be put into the hands of their Maſter.
All the anſwer they received was by thruſting them out
of the gates. Though they ſhewed this reſolution, the
City began to be infected with the ſtench of the dead who
were not well buried, and Famine raged ſo violently
that it was proved that Mothers had eaten their own
Children. <hi>Gerard Huld</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Generall being kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by a ſhot in the Head, the Governor of <hi>Galé,</hi> who
ſucceeded him in that Command, fearing leaſt another Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
might come and rob him of the Honour of taking
the Place, carryed on his Works, and plyed his Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
ſo briskly, that ſeveral large Breaches were made.
On the 7th. of <hi>May,</hi> 1656. he aſſaults St. <hi>John</hi>'s Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,
and carrying it, with the ſame heat enters a
new Fort that was raiſing; thence the <hi>Dutch</hi> venture to
break into the Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence after a long diſpute they
were beat out, and the Beſieged following their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
recovered the Fort and Bulwark; yet freſh Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
coming on, the <hi>Dutch</hi> again made themſelves maſters
of the latter, and lodged themſelves therein. That
Night the Governor of the Town being informed that
two Women had eaten their own Children, cauſed them
to be ſhot to pieces at the mouth of great Guns. Next
Day, ſeeing it impoſſible to maintain the Place, he
call'd a Council, where it was reſolved to ſurrender.
After ſome Debates, the Articles were agreed upon,
which were honourable to the Beſieged, and in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to them, the Governor marched out with only 94
Officers and Soldiers, and 100 Towns-men. The <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
committed all manner of Sacriledge in the
Town, and without regard to their Articles, plunder'd
thoſe few Towns-men and Soldiers that were left alive.
But from ſo infamous a Nation, nothing but Villany
can be expected. The Count <hi>de Sarzedas,</hi> Vice-Roy of
<hi>India</hi> dying, as was ſaid before, upon opening the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of Succeſſion, it appeared that <hi>Emanuel Maſcaren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>has

by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſallying furiouſly upon them, and they
expecting no ſuch reception were ſoon put to flight, and
a great number ſlain and taken priſoners. This raſh and

made herſelf terrible to her Enemies, produced a quite
contrary effect, for it only provoked his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty

vigour than had been done of late years. In order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Generall the Duke of St. <hi>German</hi> having
been ſent for to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and there fully empowered to
act, as he ſhould find moſt expedient, returned to the
Frontiers well furniſhed with mony, Armes, proviſions,
20 peices of Canon, and an Army of 13000 Foot, and
4000 Horſe. He was at firſt doubtfull whether he
ſhould bend his Force againſt <hi>Elvas,</hi> or <hi>Olivenza,</hi> but
conſidering the dammage received from the frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
of the garriſon of the latter of theſe two places,
he reſolved to attack it. <hi>Olivenza</hi> is ſeated in a plain
almoſt a League from the River <hi>Guadiana,</hi> and beſet on
all ſides with hills that command it being within Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non

which covered that part of the Town. The trenches
were diligently carryed on and many ſallies made by the
beſieged. The Duke perceiving the conqueſt of this
place to be a work of great difficulty, thought fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it by Art as well as Main-force. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuffered his men to lye ſtill ſeverall days, as if he
intended to ſtarve the Town, on a ſudden in the dead

<hi>Emanuel de Saldanha</hi> the Governour of the Town, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

days after the Town was inveſted, the Count <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi>
came to the relief of it, with an Army of 12000
Foot, and 3500 Horſe. After being four days on the

and planted a battery againſt their works, but the Duke
having raiſed alſo another, did ſuch Execution that he
was glad to withdraw and return to his Camp near <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumenha.</hi>
Three days he lay there, and then again drew

At length the Count ſeing no poſſibility of Forcing the
Enemy without hazarding his whole Army, thought it
better to endeavour to draw them from the Seige by a
diverſion. In order to it he marched to <hi>Badajoz,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to ſurprize that important place in the Night, by
ſending 3000 men who by the likeneſs of their habit and
Language, might be admitted as if ſent from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:54712:258"/>
the Garriſon and Townſmen running to Arms were put
to flight, after leaving about 300 dead behind, beſides
ſeveral Officers of Note. This Enterprize proving ſo
unſucceſsful, the Count <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> marched towards
<hi>Albuquerque,</hi> burning and deſtroying all the Country
in hopes by that means to draw the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army from
<hi>Olivenza,</hi> and at laſt ſits down before <hi>Valencia</hi> preſſing
that place day and Night, but with great loſs on his ſide,
for it was no leſs bravely defended by <hi>Sebaſtian Granero,</hi>
the Governour an old Souldier of known Valour. In
the mean while the Duke of St. <hi>German</hi> had ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Olivenca</hi> ſo hotly that the works of the place were
all ruined, and the greater Fort almoſt demoliſhed by
the mines he had ſprung. <hi>Emanuel de Saldanha</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
ſeeing the ruin of his works; and that the Army
which ought to have relieved him was marched away,
obtained a truce of the Duke conditioning to deliver
up the place if not relieved by a day appointed. The
Count <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> having received this advice before
<hi>Valencia,</hi> immediately raiſed his Siege and marching

from which place he writ to the Governour of <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venza</hi>
in hard Terms, commanding him at the peril of
his Life, to defend the place to the laſt extremity, and
promiſing to come to his relief as ſoon as he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſome recruits he expected. <hi>Saldanha</hi> the Governour
being ſenſible of his own weakneſs, and the vainneſs of

he had agreed upon with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Generall, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
on the day appointed delivered up the Town

was generally agreed the Town could have held out ſome
days longer, and the Governour being accuſed of not
having performed his duty, but to have made a haſty
and diſhonourable ſurrender, was firſt kept priſoner at
<hi>Lisbon;</hi> and afterwards baniſhed the Kingdom for ever.
The breaches of the Town being repaired and a good
Garriſon put into the place, the Duke marched towards
his Enemy, burning and waſting all the Country before
him, by this means intending to draw the Count to a
battle; but perceiving this nothing moved him, he ſits

was only an old wall, but the Caſtle was of greater
ſtrength. The inhabitants terrifyed by the fate of <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venza,</hi>
no ſooner ſaw the Cannon begin to play upon
their Walls but they abandoned the Town, and retired
into the Caſtle which was well fortifyed. This ſucceſs
cauſed the Duke to alter his reſolution of fighting, and
now he reſolved to make himſelf Maſter of the Caſtle
before he would come to a battle. On the other ſide
the Count <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> who before carefully ſhunned
hazarding his Army, ſeeing now the ill conſequence of
ſuffering the Enemy to encroach ſo far upon him, was
wholly bent upon engaging, but the River being

This done, it was decreed in Council, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance

down before the Fort of St. <hi>Chriſtopher.</hi> This Fort is
ſeated on a Hill, on the further Bank of the River from

being a regular Fortification after the modern manner. <hi>D.

themſelves of two Hills, on each of which there was a

<pb n="496" facs="tcp:54712:260"/>
thence battered the Fort. Next day they opened their
Trenches, and carryed them on with great Application;
the Beſieged on their ſide, doing all that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
for their Defence, in which they made many
vigorous Sallies; in one whereof, after a hot Diſpute,
they drove the Beſiegers before them with much Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and deſtroyed their Works. However, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged

the other of <hi>Iriſh,</hi> under the commnnd of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel

Theſe two Regiments, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General

the Foot of the Bridge and the Fort, by which
ſupplies uſed to come from the Town, ſo that this ſame
was now an Obſtacle againſt thoſe that were to ſuccour
the Beſieged. Thus the Fort was reduced to the laſt
Extremity. This moved the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Major, with two Captains and 160 Men
to attempt breaking through the Enemies Line, which
they moſt reſolutely performed, and got into the Fort.
No ſooner were they entred, but <hi>D. Ventura</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
commanded them to attack the Beſiegers in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt

drove the Enemy from their Camp. This Succeſs coſt
the Marqueſs his Life; however, though the <hi>Portugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>

over, and bent his whole Force againſt it. The firſt
conſiderable Action in this Siege, was the taking of two
Hills which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had fortifyed and ſtrongly gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoned.
<hi>John Mendez</hi> attacked them with all his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

St. <hi>Gabriel,</hi> which being but weakly Manned, was eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<hi>Dungan</hi> who commanded there, defended it with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Bravery, till it was no longer tenable, and
then ſurrendered it upon Articles; when the Beſiegers
had loſt 1800 Men before it, and among them many
Perſons of note. Having made himſelf maſter of this
Fort, <hi>John Mendez</hi> finiſhed his Lines, encompaſſing
the whole Town with them, which before the reduction
of theſe Forts he could not do. Then he began to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Place, to caſt in Bombs, and to preſs the Beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

done by the Enemies ſhot; but ſcarcity of Proviſions, and
Diſeaſes proceeding from ill Food, were more terrible
then all other Dangers, and now no hope remained, but
in the relief they expected from without. The News
of this Siege being brought to <hi>Madrid,</hi> highly incenſed
the multitude, and perplexed the Council, in which at

their Lines, and took their Poſts about the Town.
Nothing was omitted by the Governour that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to a vigorous Defence; but the Beſiegers by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
having cut off all their Communication abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and poſſeſſed themſelves of all advantagious Poſts, the
place was no longer in a poſture to hold out long, had
it not been ſpeedily relieved. In order to it, all the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons
were drained, and the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Army rendeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouzed
at <hi>Eſtremoz,</hi> under the command of the Count
<hi>de Caſtagneda.</hi> Here the Count received Advice from
the Governor of <hi>Elvas,</hi> that his Garriſon was extreamly
weakened through Want, Sickneſs, and continual La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
for which Reaſon he ſhould be obliged to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render,
unleſs ſpeedily ſuccoured. Upon this Advice
the Count <hi>de Caſtagneda</hi> ſet forward with 12000 diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined
Foot, and 3500 Horſe, beſides a confuſed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:54712:261"/>
of all ſorts of Rabble that followed the Army as
Voluntiers. With this Force he came and drew up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Hill of <hi>Santangracia,</hi> whither alſo the Duke of
St. <hi>German</hi> drew up the beſt part of the Troops to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him. In this poſture both parties continued all
that Night. By break of day the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> began to
advance towards the Lines, and made their firſt effort
upon the quarter where <hi>Nicholas</hi> of <hi>Cordova</hi> commanded,
the fight was obſtinate for a conſiderable ſpace, and the
<hi>Portugueſes</hi> were twice forced to give back. Mean

                  </note> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

who were the leſſer Number, being charged in

till their right Wing of Horſe being overpowered, was
put to flight. The Duke of St. <hi>German</hi> ſeeing the Foot
left naked on that ſide, came himſelf to their Succour,
with a party of choſen Horſe. Hence ruſhing furiouſly
upon his Enemy, he received a ſhot in the Head, which
made him faſt from his Horſe. This accident of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals

he drew off, and ſaved the remainder of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
For the Count <hi>de Caſtaneda</hi> ſatisfyed with having
relieved the place, thought not fit to hazard any more
by purſuing the Enemy. Of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> above 2000

conſent, kept themſelves ſo quiet, that theſe two
Years do not furniſh us any Military Action worth the
writing. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had bent all their Thoughts
upon concluding a Peace with <hi>France,</hi> that ſo they might
wholly apply themſelves to the War with <hi>Portugal.</hi> To
this effect a Treaty was ſet on Foot, and the whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
managed by the two prime Miniſters, Cardinal
<hi>Mazarine</hi> for <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>D. Luis de Haro</hi> for <hi>Spain.</hi>
After long debates, which belong not to this Hiſtory,
a Peace was Concluded betwixt the two Crowns; the
<hi>French</hi> renouncing their League with <hi>Portugal,</hi> upon
Condition that King ſhould quit all claim to the Crown,
and be reſtored by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to all his ancient Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
as Duke of <hi>Braganza.</hi> The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
who attended the Cardinal, during the whole time
of the Treaty, had not failed to uſe his utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
to obſtruct the whole Negotiation taking effect,
or at leaſt, to prevent his Maſter's intereſt being aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.
But the particular intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> outweigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all that could be urged in behalf of an Ally; and
the Cardinal aſſured the Ambaſſador, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Peace, his maſter's Intereſt ſhould not be forſaken
for that the <hi>French</hi> would be in a better Condition to
ſupport him, and could not want a pretence for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
This Promiſe of the Cardinals proved not Vain,
as will appear by the Sequel. Count <hi>Schomberg,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
<hi>French</hi> Commander, was already in the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi>
Service, and had under him ſome <hi>French</hi> Troops,
which were afterwards increaſed to a greater Number.
The <hi>Spaniard</hi> immediately, after the Concluſion of the
Peace with <hi>France,</hi> began to apply himſelf to carry on
the War againſt <hi>Portugal</hi> with all his Force; and to that
end, ſeveral old Regiments were brought over out of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>

ordered to joyn the <hi>Germans,</hi> who lay before the
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:54712:265"/>
great baſtion, which, it was hoped, might with more
eaſe be ruined, and four more pieces of Cannon were
there planted to batter it, which played with good ſucceſs
and began to fill the ditch. In the mean while a <hi>French</hi>
Ingenier ſent from the <hi>Portugues</hi> Camp to view the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lines being taken, diſcovered to <hi>D. John</hi> that the
Count <hi>de Caſtaneda</hi> had reſolved to attack him in his
works, having with him at that time 13000 Foot and
3000 Horſe, and only expecting the auxiliary <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
which according to the contract of marriage with his
Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> would ſoon be with him.
This intelligence cauſed <hi>D. John</hi> to fortify his Lines,
having by the advice of the Duke of St. <hi>German,</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
to receive the Enemy within them, tho' others
adviſed to march out and meet them. Having diſpoſed
all things for the reception of the <hi>Portugues</hi> General,
to forward the Seige, he orders a general aſſault to be
given to all the works of the beſieged, the <hi>Italians</hi> and
<hi>Germans</hi> without much difficulty lodged themſelves
in the counterſcarp, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon whom lay
the hotteſt Service, after four hours fight with great
ſlaughter on both ſides, made themſelves maſters of two
great baſtions, and all the ſpace betwixt them; ſo that
now the Town had no other defence left it but it's bare
wall. This was the condition of the place, when the
Count <hi>de Caſtaneda</hi> with the <hi>Portugues</hi> Army, came
and encamped within a League of the Town, but after
ſeverall movements to diſcover the weakeſt part of the
Enemies works, finding it a matter of too great difficulty
to Force their Lines, he marched away, having before
his departure ſent a Letter to the Governour, directing
him to make the beſt conditions he could for his garriſon,
for that it was impracticable to relieve him. All hopes
of releif being Loſt, and the Town now reduced to
extremity, the Governour upon a freſh Summons from
<hi>D. John,</hi> capitulated and delivered up the Town upon
ſuch Terms as he could obtain. Thus after a months
Seige <hi>D. John</hi> took poſſeſſion of <hi>Jurumenha,</hi>

the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> yet well ſtored with proviſions and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,

began on all ſides to ruin the old walls, and from
the higher grounds to beat down the houſes and kill the
People in the Streets. The inhabitants and even the

but it was now too late, <hi>D. John</hi> ſought Revenge for
the inſolence of the Fooliſh Governor and would not
hearken to any Termes. In this deplorable condition,
the inhabitants ſent out again two Antient-Prieſts, to
move the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General to Compaſſion, but whilſt
they were pleading for the Town, the Enemy without
expecting any Command from their Officers, broke in
and made themſelves Maſter of the place. <hi>D. John</hi>
by his Authority took care that none but ſuch as were
in Arms ſhould be put to the Sword, no woman Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed,
nor no Churches ſacked. Through a miſtake
both the Governours were led to Execution, till <hi>D. John</hi>
being informed of the innocence of the former that had
been layed aſide, cauſed him to be honourably diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and the latter for his raſhneſs was Shot to Death

<pb n="508" facs="tcp:54712:266"/>
and burnt down to the Ground, and the Caſtle

to <hi>Oguela,</hi> which at firſt ſtood out againſt the Summons

out to treat of a Surrender, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers as they

which diſhonourable Action, when the Governor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
to <hi>D. John,</hi> he cauſed all their Goods to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to the Inhabitants, and granted honourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
to them and to the Garriſon. The Count <hi>de
Sartinara</hi> was appointed Governour of this place, and

King <hi>Alfonſo</hi> being now at Age, to take upon

ambitious to begin his Rule with ſome important Action,
which might gain him Reputation both at Home and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
His firſt ſtep hereto was to remove the prime
Miniſters and Officers of the Kingdom, and to ſupply
their places with others more ſuitable to his own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
or leſs offenſive in the Eyes of the People, then
the former had been. He called to him the Count <hi>de

before, when he beſieged <hi>Jurumenha.</hi> His deſign was
not known to any Man, except the Duke of St. <hi>German,</hi>
but it was given out he intended directly for <hi>Lisbon.</hi> At
firſt, the Count <hi>de Villaflor</hi> was in Confuſion, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what place this Storm would fall upon; but upon
ſecond thoughts, ſeeing <hi>D. John</hi> ſtill advance into the
Country, he concluded that <hi>Ebora</hi> was the place he aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at, becauſe he well knew it was that Generals cuſtom to
attempt the conqueſt of Towns, that were of great Name
and ſmall Strength, ſuch as <hi>Ebora</hi> was. Being fixed in
this his Opinion, he threw into that City 3000 Foot,
and about 1000 Horſe, which with 5000 Men of the
Inhabitants able to bear Arms, he thought would ſo long
defend the Town, till he could be in a poſture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it. In the mean while the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army advanced
through the Countrey, burning and waſting all in their

and then brought his Light Horſe about to relieve thoſe
that were ingaged in the Rear, he was forced to draw
off and retire to <hi>Eſtremoz</hi> with ſome loſs. Three days
after, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army encamped near <hi>Ebora. D. James

On the <hi>North</hi> of it runs a ſmall River, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drawn out into little Trenches, fertilizes the Plain.
About the Town is a Mud Wall, and at this time ſome
other ſmall Works had been caſt up, ſuch as the preſent
Exigency would permit. The Water for the uſe of the
City, is brought from the Neighbouring Hills, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a continued row of Arches. This Aqueduct they
thought to ſecure by a Fort, but the Enemies ſudden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
prevented them. <hi>Luis de Meſquita</hi> was now Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of the Town, a Man of noble Extraction, but
no Souldier, whom the Garriſon diſdaining to ſubmit
to, <hi>Emanuel de Miranda</hi> an old Commander, was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
in his Place. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army having inveſted
this place, the general Officers were intent upon ſecuring
all the advantagious Poſts. In the mean while the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi>
Horſe made ſome Skirmiſhes to keep them off at a
diſtance, but being beaten back to the Town, the Beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

of St. <hi>Antony,</hi> which they found but ſlenderly guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſped not ſo well at the <hi>Carmelite</hi> Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
which lay betwixt that of <hi>St. Antony,</hi> and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for after ſix Hours ſharp diſpute, they were forced
to leave the beſieged poſſeſſed of it. This done, <hi>D. John</hi>
diſtributed the Poſts to his Army, but thought it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to intrench himſelf, not doubting to be maſter of
ſo weak a place, before the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> General could
gather a ſufficient Force to attempt the relief of it.
However the Trenches were opened againſt the Town,
and Batteries raiſed, but the firſt that gained a poſt
were the <hi>Italians,</hi> who with much bravery ſtormed, and
took the Monaſtery of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> whence planting
their Cannon, they made a great havock in the Town.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> aſhamed to be outdone by the <hi>Italians,</hi>
carryed on their Works with great diligence, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Church of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> which overlooking the Town,
they planted their Cannon upon it, to the great Damage
of the Beſieged. <hi>D. John,</hi> ſeeing the miſerable condition
of the Place, ſent another Summons, offering honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Conditions if they ſurrendred in time, which all the
Officers of the Garriſons, ſeeing no poſſibility of holding
the Place, or likelyhood of Relief, thought it time to
accept of, but <hi>Lewis de Souſa,</hi> Elect Biſhop of <hi>Porto,</hi>
and Adminiſtrator of the Church of <hi>Ebora,</hi> a Man fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for the Army than the Church, croſſed their deſign,

this means obſtructed the ſurrender that and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

diſadvantage, were forced to give way, and retire into the
plain of <hi>Ebora. D. John</hi> diſcouraged at this repulſe, put
3000 Foot, and 600 Horſe, under the Command of
<hi>Francis Gattinara</hi> Count of <hi>Sartirane</hi> into <hi>Ebora,</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to march back into <hi>Caſtile</hi> without coming to
a battle, if poſſible to avoid it by marching over the
Mountains. His firſt days march met with no obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,
becauſe the Count <hi>de Villaflor</hi> was marched before,
in order to chooſe an advantageous Poſt to give battle
in, where the Horſe might be of ſmall uſe, in which
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were much Superior to him. Some there
were, who adviſed to march on all Night, but <hi>D. John</hi>
thinking that would look too like flying, refuſed that
wholeſom advice. In the Morning he was informed,
that the <hi>Portugues</hi> Army was at hand, being covered
from him by the tops of the hills. It was no time now
to think of avoiding a battle, and therefore <hi>D. John</hi>
drew up his Army, and being poſſeſſed of a high hill,
thought good to remove and make himſelf maſter of
two others that lay in the way to <hi>Eſtremoz.</hi> At the
ſame time the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> not knowing any thing of the
Enemies deſign, had reſolved to poſſeſs himſelf of the
ſame place. Hereupon the Count <hi>de Villaflor</hi> advancing
with the Horſe, fell upon the rear of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
whoſe Horſe were upon the Plain, their Foot having
already gained the hill. <hi>D. James Cavallero</hi> facing about
with his Horſe, received the charge and made good his
ground, ſo that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> having ſpent half the
day and gained no advantage, began now to faint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the toil and heat, which <hi>D. John</hi> perceiving, he
ſpeedily poſſeſſed himſelf of the two hills he aimed at,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:54712:269"/>
drew up his Horſe in four bodies upon the Plain, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
his baggage in their Rear, and planted his Canon
upon the hills. On the other ſide, the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> ſeizes
the hill which <hi>D. John</hi> had quitted, looking upon it as
part of Victory,<note place="margin">The battle of <hi>Ebora.</hi>
                  </note> to poſſeſs the ground the Enemy had
deſignedly abandoned. About three hours both Armies
continued in theſe Poſts, refreſhing their wearied men,
when <hi>D. John</hi> thinking he had given them the ſlip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to continue his march, but the Count <hi>de Villaflor</hi>
perceiving it, reſolved not to ſuffer him to go off, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hazarding a battle. The ſignal being given, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
and the <hi>Portugues</hi> Left wing of Horſe firſt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Right of the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> who recieved them with
ſuch Reſolution, that the Fight continued a long time
doubtful, till <hi>Emanuel Freire</hi> one of the <hi>Portugues</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
of Horſe wheeling about with ſome Squadrons
he had reſerved, ſet upon the Enemies flank and broke
through them, whereupon the whole wing was ſoon put
to flight, as was the reſerve coming to their relief, and
the Left wing which was ordered to relieve the Right
by reaſon of the diſtance and badneſs of the way, could
never be brought to ingage. Mean while Count
<hi>Schomberg,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Portugues</hi> Foot, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to attack the Enemy upon the hill. This being
an Action rather raſh than valiant, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
undertook climbing the hill upon their hands and
feet, and tho' many of them fell, yet the greater part
gained the top, which encouraged three Regiments of
<hi>Portugues</hi> Foot, to aſcend a farther way about which
was much eaſier. This extravagant raſhneſs, of the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo terrifyed the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Foot, that they
immediately without ſenſe of ſhame betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to flight. In a moment their whole infantry
was put to the rout, notwithſtanding <hi>D. John</hi> alighting
from his Horſe, performed all that man could do to
make them rally and face the Enemy. But now the
victorious <hi>Portugues</hi> Horſe, comming in to ſecond their
Foot, there enſued a terrible ſlaughter, for it was no
longer a Fight. The Duke of St. <hi>German</hi> who had been
ſent before to mark out a Camp, hearing the noiſe of the
Canon, haſted back, and finding the whole Army diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
and routed, with much difficulty perſwaded <hi>D.

Frontier. He marched to the place he had pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with what ſtrength he could make, and began the
work which was extreamly difficult by reaſon of the
unſeaſonableneſs of the weather, and the danger from the
Enemy, to oppoſe whom he incamped before the work

was then ſick, and <hi>Alfonſo Furtado de Mendoza</hi> was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
in his place. <hi>D John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> who was now
returned to <hi>Bajadoz</hi> from Court, where he had been to
anſwer to what was objected againſt him upon account
of his late defeat, hearing of this undertaking of the
Duke <hi>de Oſſuna,</hi> ſent him large Supplies under the

2000 Horſe. Not above a Canon ſhot from him
lay the <hi>Portugues</hi> Army, conſiſting of a like Force.
<hi>Mendoza</hi> perceiving the Duke was not to be drawn to
a battle, his only deſign being to cover his work, and
it being a raſhneſs to attack him in his Camp, thought
the only way to draw him thence would be to enter
the borders of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and put all things to Fire and
Sword. To this intent he ſent out a party of Horſe
to <hi>Almeida,</hi> which the Duke perceiving, charged and

and drawing on the Enemy till the reſt of their Forces
came up with them. Thus the Fight was protracted
till the groſs of both Bodies came to Engage, and then
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe gave ground, and had been utterly
routed, had not the Count <hi>de Bouette</hi> ſtood firm with
his Troops, and given thoſe that fled time to Rally.
But the Duke perceiving there was no likelihood of
ſtanding the ſhock of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> ſent a Squadron
of Horſe to fall into their Camp, which they underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
drew back to ſecure their works, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
deſign, being no other than to diſcharge themſelves of
them, both parties as it were by conſent, returned to
their Camps. The execution on both ſides was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,
in all about 800 Horſe fell, but not ſo many Foot.
This drawn battle was the laſt, neither ſide being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
too far to provoke the other. However the Duke
finiſhed the Fort he had begun, into which he put a ſtrong

The Count <hi>de Caſtanheda,</hi> perceiving the ſtrength of the
Place, and reſolution of the Garriſon, reſolved formally
to beſiege it, and to that purpoſe, poſſeſſing himſelf of the
Monaſtery of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> which was within Cannon ſhot

him, attempted nothing, but wheeled off again, and
marched back till Night over-took him. Then having
ordered his Troops to halt, he ſent out Count <hi>Bouette</hi>
with a Party, to bring in ſome Proviſions for his weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

his time, and having now made ſeveral Breaches in the
Walls fit for an aſſault, ſent to ſummons the Governor to
ſurrender in time, ſince all hope of Relief was vaniſhed,
and the place was in no condition to hold out. The
Governour to gain time, entred upon a Treaty, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
ſuch high Terms that they were ſcornfully reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

a furious Aſſault, which the beſieged ſtood with
ſuch undaunte Reſolution, that after a great ſlaughter
on both ſides, the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were compelled to give it
over. This repulſe moved the Count to carry on his
Works more deliberately, and endeavour to ſpare the
Blood of his Soldiers. But it was not long before Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
began to grow ſcarce in the Town, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
the Governor to hearken to a Capitulation offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Conditions upon him. However, though the Propoſal

Out-works; yet better ſecured by the Courage and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience

place the Duke hoped to have carryed by Storm, but
having been ſeveral times beaten off with great loſs; he
ſate down quietly before it with 7000 Foot, ſending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Horſe to gather Proviſions. After a few days
lying ſtill, as if he had no further deſign againſt the
Place, he marched off, that he might the better ſurprize
the Garriſon, for in the dead of a dark Night, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
again, attempted to ſcale the Walls, where the
Watch was negligently kept, yet being diſcovered, and
the Town taking the Alarm, he was beaten off, and no
hope left of prevailing, either by an Aſſault, or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.
Both theſe Deſigns failing, he reſolved upon a
formal Siege, and accordingly raiſed his Batteries, whence
he ſhook and ruined the Walls with his heavy Cannon.
<hi>Peter Jaques de Magallaens,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi>

and poſted himſelf on a Hill, oppoſite to the Town, ſo
diſpoſing his Troops that the Enemy could not judge of
their number, hoping thereby to move them to raiſe the
Siege, which fell out as he expected; for the Duke not
being able to judge of his Strength, thought not good
to expoſe himſelf to uncertainties, and therefore drew
off from the Place. <hi>Peter Jaques</hi> having gained this
Point, reſolved to purſue the Enemy, and force him to

               <p>1. WE are now drawing to the end of this tedious War,
and though betwixt the death of King <hi>John,</hi> and
the Concluſion of the Peace, there happened ſeveral
things remarkable enough in the Civil Government; yet
I have thought fit not to interrupt the Series of Marſhal
Affairs now drawing to a Period, but rather to put an
end to the courſe of theſe extern contentions, and when
I come to relate the inteſtine Troubles and Confuſions,
then at once to ſum up thoſe Accidents that preceded
in order to them, that then the Reader may with the
more eaſe to his Memory, take firſt a view of the whole
War, and next of the ſtrange Cataſtrophe that enſued,
with all the previous Accidents tending to it.</p>
               <p>2. Before the main Armies could take the Field, both
parties ceaſed not to infeſt their Enemies Frontiers with
frequent Incurſions. But for the moſt part, theſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:54712:272"/>
were inconſiderable,<note place="margin">A Body of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> being rather like Robberies,
then publick Hoſtilities. The firſt Action of moment
we find this Year, was an incurſion made by 1000 <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi>
Horſe, towards <hi>Badajoz,</hi> plundering and burning
all the Country before them. Count <hi>Marſini</hi> at this
time, commanded on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Frontiers, who upon
the news of the Spoil made by the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>D. James Correa</hi> General of the Horſe, with 500
Men to oppoſe the Enemy. <hi>Correa</hi> after repreſenting
the weakneſs of that number, having received a check
for his ſeaſonable Advice, marched out. The <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi>
were then diſperſed, but hearing of the Approach
of the Enemy, aſſembled their Troops, and having lay'd
part of them in Ambuſh, with the remainder charged
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who meeting leſs oppoſition then they
had expected, thought themſelves ſecure of the Victory,
till being encompaſſed by thoſe that roſe out of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh,
moſt of them were either killed or taken. <hi>D.
James Correa,</hi> with thoſe few that could eſcape, fled to
<hi>Badajoz,</hi> not much troubled at his loſs, becauſe he had
been contrary to his Judgment and Advice, ſent upon
the Action with ſo ſmall a Force.</p>
               <p>3. Whether it was that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were reſolved
to ſtand upon the Defenſive, and therefore ſpared their
Forces;<note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Caracena</hi> General of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi>
                  </note> or that the Difficulties their new riſing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
labour'd under, would not permit them to be ſo
forward as the Enemy, is hard to determine; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were generally the firſt that
took the Field. So this Year, the Marqueſs of <hi>Carace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
who with a general Applauſe for his good Service
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> had been appointed
General for this War, having taken a review of his
Army, which he found to conſiſt of 12000 Foot, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
6500 Horſe, marched into <hi>Portugal,</hi> with a full
Reſolution to beſiege <hi>Villavicioſa.</hi> This Town is the
antient Seat and Patrimony of the Dukes of <hi>Braganza,</hi>
and is properly called <hi>Villavicioſa,</hi> becauſe of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs
of the Air, the fruitfulneſs of the Soil, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of its Forreſts, and other Delights wherewith that
Territory abounds. The Town it ſelf is ſeated on a
high Hill, and is divided into three parts. The firſt
which is in the nature of a Suburb, contains ſeveral
Monaſteries, many Inhabitants, and the ſtately Houſe of
the Duke of <hi>Braganza.</hi> To this joyns the Town, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:54712:273"/>
with an old Wall, but little inhabited. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, ſtands the Caſtle, well enough fortifyed for
that time, having a Ditch, a covered Way, a Half-Moon,
and other Works. <hi>Chriſtopher Brito,</hi> was at
this time Governor of the place, and had under him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
expert Commanders, and 1000 Garriſon Soldiers,
beſides the Towns-men that were fit to bear Arms. As
ſoon as <hi>Brito</hi> underſtood the Enemy advanced towards
him, he ſecured and ſtrengthened three ſtrong Poſts
without the Walls, <hi>viz.</hi> the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi>'s Houſe,
which was built like a Caſtle;<note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Caracena,</hi> beſieges <hi>Villavicio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa.</hi>
                  </note> the Fort of <hi>St. Benedict,</hi>
and the Gate called <hi>No.</hi> Eighteen Companies of <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Muſquetiers immediately aſſaulted theſe three Poſts at
the ſame time with much Bravery, but they were all
three with no leſs Valour made good by the Defendants.
However, <hi>Brito</hi> conſidering thoſe places were too far
remote from the Town, to be kept without great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of weakning his main Strength, drew off his Men
the Night following, and abandoned them. As ſoon as
Day appeared, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> commanded by <hi>Roderick
Moxica,</hi> entred the Houſes next to the Town, without
any Oppoſition, all that were able to bear Arms, being
withdrawn into the Town. Here the Soldiers commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all the Outrages that could be expected from the
cruelleſt Enemy, ſparing neither Sex nor Age; raviſhing
Women, and prophaning even the Churches, till ſome
religious Men who had made their Eſcape, giving an
account of theſe barbarous Proceedings to the Marqueſs
of <hi>Carazena,</hi> he took Order to cure this Licentiouſneſs
of the Soldiers. Being thus poſſeſſed of the Suburb,
the Marqueſs planted his Cannon againſt the Town, but
being impatient of delay, he aſſaulted the Wall with
Scaling Ladders, and at the ſame time applyed a Petard
to one of the Gates, yet all in Vain, for he met with
ſuch vigorous Reſiſtance, that he was compelled to
draw off his Men. Next he applyed himſelf to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining,
but the Earth being unfit, this Work proved
more prejudicial to him than to the Beſieged. At laſt,
having made ſome Breaches in the Walls, the <hi>Italian</hi>
Foot were ordered to mount them, which they perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with as much Gallantry as could be imagined, but
thoſe who to divert the Beſieged, were to Scale the
Walls, being eaſily repulſed with great Loſs, by reaſon
their Ladders were too ſhort, and all the Strength of
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:54712:273"/>
the beſieged making good the breaches, all that the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
could do was to lodge themſelves under the Walls.
In the Mean while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who beſieged the Caſtle
were not Idle, but having battered it gave a moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
aſſault tho' with no better ſucceſs than the <hi>Italians</hi>
had done, yet with greater ſlaughter on both ſides. In
this Action <hi>Brito</hi> the Governour received three wounds,
and loſt ſeveral Officers and Soldiers of good Note. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
theſe repulſes, the Marqueſs proceeded cautiouſly,
yet never ceaſing to batter the works with his Cannon.
At length receiving intelligence that the <hi>Portugues</hi> Army
was upon it's march from <hi>Eſtremoz</hi> to relieve the place,
leaſt he ſhould find his Forces divided betwixt the Town
and the Caſtle, he reſolved to bend his whole ſtrength
againſt the Town and to leave the Caſtle for another
time. However leaſt the beſieged ſhould have the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of relieving the Town from the Caſtle, he
commanded the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Foot to attack the paliſade of the
Caſtle, whilſt the <hi>Italians</hi> gave the General aſſault to
the Town. This Action was very hot, both parties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obſtinately ſet down not to give way, but at laſt Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
muſt give place to number, and the <hi>Italians</hi> having
gained the tops of the Walls and breaches, ſuch of the
defendants as eſcaped were forced to retire into the Caſtle:
Nothing being now left the beſieged but the Caſtle,
the Marqueſs ſent to Summons the Governour to Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render,
threatning the danger of delay, who never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
ſent the meſſenger back with a very ſlight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
The Marqueſs being now wholly intent upon
taking the Caſtle, raifed a battery againſt it upon the
top of the Church, dedicated to the Conception of our
Bleſſed-Lady.</p>
               <p>4. Whilſt the Caſtle was thus preſt by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
the Count <hi>Caſtanheda</hi> General of the <hi>Portugues</hi> Army,<note place="margin">The Count <hi>de Caſtanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tugueſes</hi> General, advances to relieve <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavicioſa.</hi>
                  </note>
advancing to its relief, ſent <hi>Francis Carneiro</hi> a Captain of
Foot, with only two Soldiers, who with an unparallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
boldneſs rode through the beſiegers, to give the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
an account of the approaching relief, and the
two Souldiers with the ſame bravery and ſucceſs, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to their General with the News of what they had
done. In the next place, the Count called a Council of
War, to conſult whether it were fit to hazard a battle,
where it was unanimouſly decreed to Fight the Enemy.
The Count being joyful at this univerſal agreement, ſent
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:54712:274"/>
preſently a Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mpeter, to advertiſe the Marqueſs of
<hi>Carazena</hi> of his approach, and to let him know now
pleaſing it was to him to give battle to ſo great a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
The Marqueſs looked upon this meſſage only as
a bravado, and ſent back an anſwer accordingly, then
calling a Councel of War, after ſundry opinions had
been heard, the Marqueſs his opinion prevailed which
was to give the Enemy battle. This done he made
choice of a Plain below the Caſtle, whether he marched
with his Army, leaving 1500 Foot, which he judged a
ſufficient ſtrength to keep in the beſieged.</p>
               <p>5. Near to <hi>Villavicioſa</hi> is a Plain commonly called the
Plain of <hi>Monteſclaros,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Battle of <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſclaros.</hi>
                  </note> encompaſſed about with Hills
and Rocky cliffs, but pleaſant and diverſifyed with
Trees and Vineyards, and full of ditches and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
to Armies. Into this Plain, the <hi>Portugueſes</hi>
came firſt leading 16000 Foot, and 6000 Horſe. The
<hi>Spaniard</hi> was much weaker, having loſt many men in
the ſiege beſides thoſe he had left at the Caſtle. The
Marqueſs of <hi>Carazena</hi> knowing the nearer the Enemy
drew to him, the more advantagious the ground was
for him, becauſe there was not Room to ſpread abroad,
he cauſed his men to poſſeſs themſelves of that ground,
his Foot ſtretched out, keeping the ſide of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and his Horſe marching in the Plain on the Left.
This his celerity did not a little ſtartle the Count of
<hi>Caſtanhena,</hi> for that his Foot and Artillery were not as
yet come up, and he feared to be Forced to engage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could reach him, but Count <hi>Schomberg</hi> upon
advice from him, haſtning their march, delivered him
from this perplexity. The Marqueſs drew up his Foot
in two Lines, the Horſe becauſe the ground would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
no more Front were drawn up in five, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Horſe had the Right wing, the Forreigners the Left.
In the <hi>Portugues</hi> Army, almoſt all the Horſe were on
the Right, and the Foot on the Left, the nature of the
place not allowing the Horſe to be imbattled on both
wings, yet among the Horſe were diſpoſed ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of choſen Foot. That wing which conſiſted only
of Foot, was in two Lines, yet all was ſo contrived
that the Horſe could ſpeedily relieve the Foot, or the
Foot the Horſe as occaſion required. Things being in
this poſture, after the Canon had played, The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
Commands <hi>Alexander</hi> Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> General
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:54712:274"/>
of the Forreign Horſe, to charge the <hi>Portugues</hi> Right
wing, which he performed with ſuch Valour and fury,
that he drove the firſt Line of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> in great
diſorder upon their Rear. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> having in the
purſuit broke their Ranks, fell in upon the pikes of the
Foot, that had been mixed with the Horſe, which ſorely
galling them, quite changed the Face of Affairs; for
whilſt they Laboured to extricate themſelves from that
peril, the Horſe who before had fled, rallying charged
them afreſh. They that before thought themſelves vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orious,
being thus preſſed on all ſides began to give way
and fall into diſorder: Then Count <hi>Rabata</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the <hi>German</hi> Horſe, ſeeing them juſt ready to fly,
rode up a in Rage, and upbraiding the cowardize of his
men, brought them on to the Charge afreſh. The Prince of
<hi>Parma</hi> alſo rallying thoſe that were diſperſed, the battle was
again renewed, and the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> charged more fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than at the firſt onſet; inſomuch that the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
prevailed driving their Enemies, and the <hi>Germans</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made their way through the Right, were falling
in upon the Left wing. The <hi>Portugues</hi> General percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the danger, ſent Count <hi>Schomberg,</hi> the Count <hi>de</hi> St.
<hi>Lorenco,</hi> and other chief Officers, to give a check to the
Enemy. Theſe having gathered the diſperſed Troops, and
drawn freſh ſuccours from all ſides, reſtored the Fight,
yet ſo that both wings were joyned together, and ſo
preſſed the harder upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops, almoſt tired
with the fatigue of the long Service. Hereupon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
of <hi>Carazena,</hi> who from a Hill viewed the Action and
gave orders, ſeeing his Left wing born down, ſent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to <hi>James Correa</hi> who Commanded on the Right,
either to come immediately to the relief of the Left, or
elſe by charging upon the Left of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> to draw
them away to him. <hi>Correa</hi> obeyed not his orders, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through cowardice, or Treachery, or that the
ground would not permit, is uncertain. Thus the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
and <hi>Germans</hi> being forſaken by their Friends, and
beſet on all ſides by their Enemies, were almoſt all cut
off, yet dyed not unrevenged, having made a great
ſlaughter, and amidſt the multitude, ſlain many Officers
of note, Count <hi>Schomberg</hi> narrowly eſcaping when his
Horſe was killed under him. Now at length the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Right wing came on, after their Left was utterly
loſt, but it was a matter of much difficulty to charge
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:54712:275"/>
over the heaps of dead Bodies, and ſcatter'd Arms. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Horſe were gauled by the ſcattering Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Foot, who with their Pikes, diſcompoſed and
broke their Ranks, ſo that they were forced to wheel
often, and rather defend themſelves, then offend their
Enemies. At length being ſeconded by their Foot, they
gave ſuch a violent Charge, that the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who
had ſtood long to it before with various Fortune, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
began again to decline, till their General, the
Count of <hi>Caſtanheda</hi> ſeeing that was the laſt effort, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in with his Guards and what Troops he could ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and acting the part of a Soldier, as well as of a
General, inſpir'd new Courage into them, and reſtored
the Fight. In this Heat, when the Succeſs ſtood doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
two things concurred to beſtow the Victory on the
<hi>Portugueſe.</hi> One was the taking of <hi>James Correa,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, the other, that the <hi>Swiſſers</hi>
ſerving in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, being diſcontented for want
of their pay, went over to them. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe
diſmayed at theſe two unexpected Accidents, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
fell off, the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> preſſing upon them, yet ſo
as not being ſuffer'd to purſue, the others rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
then fled. Nothing remained now but the Foot,
who being beſet, for that Count <hi>Schomberg</hi> had ſeized
all the advantagious Poſts,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Army totally rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> ſought deſperately, having
ſcarce any hopes left to eſcape. The Fight had laſted
ſeven Hours, and both ſides being tired, both the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Horſe and Foot, becauſe the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> did not
purſue, marched off with Speed, and began to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
up ſuch as had fled farther, ſo that they made
a conſiderable Body. Count <hi>Caſtanheda</hi> unwilling
to ſuffer ſo great a Party to eſcape, ſent <hi>Vaſconcellos</hi> and
<hi>John de Silva</hi> with ſome Troops of Horſe, who wheeling
about a Monaſtery, fell in with them, and ſtayed their
March till the Count came up with the reſt of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being thus encloſed without hope
of ſafety, either by fighting or flying, were finally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
and cut to pieces. About 4000 Foot of ſeveral
Nations, who before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were encloſed, had
retired to a place of Strength, ſeeing the whole Army
loſt, ſurrendered upon Diſcretion. Near 1000 more,
who had fled to the Woods, were either taken, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
there. In all about 5000 of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to have been killed, and not fewer taken, and
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:54712:275"/>
of both ſorts were many Officers of Note. Nor was
the Victory cheaply bought, above 2000 of the Victors
being ſlain, among which were ſeveral remarkable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
This was the deciſive Battle of <hi>Monteſclaros,</hi>
which finally ſettled the Crown upon the Head of the
new King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Marqueſs of <hi>Carazena</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all loſt, made his way to <hi>Villavicioſa,</hi> where he
ordered the Forces he had left there, to continue the
Siege, to riſe from before the Place, leaſt they ſhould be
overwhelmed by the Victorious Army. They with all
ſpeed drew off their Artillery, and marching in good
Order, though often attacked by the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> made

                  </gap> their Retreat, firſt to <hi>Jurumenha,</hi> and thence to
<hi>Badajoz,</hi> whither the ſmall remainder of the Army was
fled. Thus the Marqueſs in his old Age, tarniſhed that
Reputation he had gained in his Youth.</p>
               <p>6. This great Battle was the laſt Action of Note,<note place="margin">King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> of <hi>Spain's</hi> Death.</note> that

only to treat of the Depoſition of King <hi>Alphonſo,</hi>
which inſued, and the tendencies to it.</p>
               <p>7. However, to the end that Narration may be no ways
interrupted, though this be not exactly the proper
place, we will proceed without interruption to what
remains. Great debates had been at the Court of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi>
after the death of King <hi>Philip</hi> upon the ſubject of
Peace or War. Not only the multitude, but even the
moſt conſiderable of the Nobility, conſidering the great
Expence, the many Loſſes, and the little Progreſs made
in the War, were inclinable to Peace. The Queen her
ſelf was for it, but politick ſeemed averſe, the better
to diſcover the diſpoſitions of the People. Nor would
ſhe ſeem to comply with their deſires alone, till the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador then Reſident at <hi>Madrid,</hi> had ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to her, that unleſs ſhe would hearken to ſome Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals
of Peace, the King his Maſter ſhould be obliged
to protect and defend his Brother the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
with all his Forces both by Sea and land. Theſe
Threats joyn'd to the general conſent of her own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:54712:276"/>
at length drew the Queen to aſſent to a Treaty.
By her the King of <hi>England</hi> was choſen Mediator, and
Guarantee for the Treaty and Peace that was to enſue.
Commiſſion was given to the Marqueſs <hi>del Carpio,</hi>

for the Houſe of <hi>Braganza,</hi> it remains we
ſhould ſhew into what Troubles and Confuſions they
brought themſelves to the endangering of the new gotten
Kingdom, to the ruin of their Head, the then King, to the
perpetal in famy of the diſloyal Actors, and to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of all their Neighbours, who were ſpectators of
their monſtrous proceedings. It will not ſuit with the
brevity of this Hiſtory, to clear all the matters of leſſer
moment, which others have handled at large, and for the
moſt part with more Partiality, then ſolid Truth. Let it
ſuffice, that nothing ſhall be omitted which is worthy of
Memory, and might ſeem to influence, or promote
thoſe alterations that happened in the State. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the War with <hi>Spain</hi> has been taken from the
beſt Authors that have treated thereof, but in the
enſuing Diſcourſe, I have not only conſulted Authors,
who as was ſaid before, are too Partial, or elſe wanted
Information; but having had the advantage of living a
conſiderable time in <hi>Portugal,</hi> I have received great
Light into thoſe Affairs from ſeveral Perſons of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Judgment, who were Eye-witneſſes to all the
Tranſactions. But becauſe it may be offenſive to ſome
to lay the Truth too naked, I ſhall abridge the Relation
as much as may be, giving all the reſpect to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that the Subject will bear without wronging the
Dead. Nothing of Favour nor Affection can draw my
Pen to favour either ſide, as well in regard I am a
Stranger to both, as for that I can expect no Reward
or Intereſt from thoſe that are depreſt, but ought rather
to miſtruſt being cryed down by the prevalent Faction.
Whatever my Fortune is, I will not conceal the Truth,
but to avoid all Reflection, will barely relate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of fact, without diſcanting upon it.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Alfonſo</hi> in his Infancy, when he was but three
Years of Age,<note place="margin">The ſource of King <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi>'s Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.</note> had been taken with a Palſie, which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
thoſe very tender Years, was hard to be removed;
but as he grew up in Strength, fit Remedies being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
he became perfectly cured, ſo that no ſign of it
remained, except ſome ſmall Contraction in his Right
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:54712:277"/>
Hand. This fatal Palſie, may be ſaid to have been the
very Source of all this unfortunate King's Calamities,
for though, as has been ſaid, there was ſcarce any token
of it left in him; yet his Enemies made their uſe of it,
to perſwade the ignorant, that it had affected his Brain,
and that he was conſequently become unfit for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
To gain their ſlaunders the more Reputation,
they never ceaſed to accuſe him of falſe Crimes, and to
blacken in the moſt odious manner, his youthful Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights
and Extravagancies, which in themſelves were no
more then what are daily ſeen in thoſe raw Years, where
Power is joyned to heat of Blood. The Nobility were
averſe to him, becauſe he was naturally vehement, and
therefore they feared he would in time cruſh their Pride,
and make them ſenſible of that diſtance which ought to
be betwixt a Monarch and a Subject. His Mother a
haughty Woman, became implacable, becauſe being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
uſed to rule, ſhe muſt againſt her Will reſign up
the Power to him. His Queen it is moſt likely, bore
more Affection to his Brother then to him, as is viſible
by the Privacies that paſſed betwixt them, from her firſt
coming into the Kingdom. His Brother could not
withſtand the Temptation of a Crown, which by ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out his Hand might be ſecured, and by delaying too
long, might have ſlipt away for ever, if the King had
either had Iſſue, or out-lived him. And in fine, the
giddy multitude were ever lovers of Change, and ſo
artificially prepared by the horrid Reports daily ſpread
againſt the King, that many of them looked upon him
no otherwiſe, then as a Monſter, or a Fury, for ſo was
he repreſented to them, and the cuſtom of <hi>Portugal</hi>
is ſuch, as their Kings are but little ſeen by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.<note place="margin">The Count <hi>de Ode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor to the young King. His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               <p>King <hi>John</hi> dying, and his Queen entering upon the
Regency, <hi>D. Francis de Faro,</hi> Count of <hi>Odemira,</hi> was
appointed Governor to the young King <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who
being a Man of excellent parts, and allyed to the Blood-Royal,
omitted nothing that might be conducing to the
Improvement of his Charge, taking care that he ſhould
be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> was not naturally addicted to
ſtudy, and therefore perhaps made not ſo great an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
as his Governor expected, who not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:54712:277"/>
his Age, would perhaps have him to be a Man
before his time, and therefore was much offended, that
he would addict himſelf to the Company of other Boys
like himſelf, and follow the Sports uſed among them.
But generally ſpeaking, the King's greateſt delight was
in violent Exerciſes, and particularly in making parties
of Boys, and ſeeing them fight. Among the reſt that
uſed to divert him, was one <hi>Antony Conti de Vintimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glia,</hi>
the Son of a <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Merchant, but born at <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
who being crafty above his Years, by always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding
and furthering the King's Deſigns, ſo worked
himſelf into his Affection, that he took no Delight in
any paſtime without him. <hi>Conti</hi> knew ſo well how to
improve his Fortune; and the King's Favour, that at
length, he became by his continual attendance upon
him, an Eye-ſore to the Count <hi>de Odemira,</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to all the Nobility, who were jealous that a Man of
mean extraction ſhould have the Ear of their Prince, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he might in time grow up ſo as to cope with their
Grandeur. Hereupon the Queen joyned her Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to that of the Count, to forbid the King's farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
of young <hi>Conti.</hi> He obeyed for a while, or
at leaſt ſaw him but by ſtealth, till at length impatient
to be curbed, he ſlighted their injunctions, and fell again
to his former familiarities with him. The Queen and
Count who had no power to conſtrain, ſeeing their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
rejected, were force to connive at this return of
their Familiarity, hoping that Time, or ſome Accident
would change the King's Inclination. The King being
of Age to be able to mount a Horſe, his Governour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
him carefully in that manly Exerciſe, as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this might conduce to draw him from other leſs
honourable Paſtimes, but it proved not as he expected;
For <hi>Alphonſo</hi> took the advantage of the riding place,
to admit not only <hi>Conti,</hi> but alſo many others of the
meaneſt ſort, whom he delighted to ſee wreſtle, pitch
the Bar, and Fight, not ſparing at times to mix himſelf
among them. The Count not knowing what other
courſe to take to break the King of that Company, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
one day to caſt them all out of the Place in
the King's ſight, reproaching and threatening them all,
but particularly <hi>Conti,</hi> to whom he denounced Death,
if he were ſeen again with the King, who though at
that time he ſaid nothing, yet he highly reſented it, and
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:54712:278"/>
afterwards was mindful of this Boldneſs of his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.
The abſence of <hi>Conti</hi> laſted not long, for the
King's Mind being wholly bent upon him, and ſome
who thought to make their Fortunes by flattery, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
this Separation as a Diminution of the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
he was ſoon recall'd. Being to return to Court
the more to terrifie his Enemies, he endeavoured, and
that ſucceſsfully, to incline the King to miſchievous
Sports, ſuch as fighting of Maſtives, Bulls and Horſes,
and to flinging of Stones with Slings, which often flying
at Rovers, did harm to People at a diſtance. Theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
were the cauſe that no Murther, or other Miſchief,
was committed in the City, but what was improved by
his Enemies, as if Countenanced by <hi>Alphonſo.</hi> But now
the Count <hi>de Odemira</hi> to draw him from theſe unſeemly
Exerciſes, put him upon Fencing, in which he made no
great Improvement, becauſe he would not obſerve Rule,
but wholly put himſelf upon cutting and thruſting with
all his Force in ſuch ſort, as he often eluded Art it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Within the ſame Pallace with the King, lived his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Queens Ambition, and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> and their Mother the Queen Regent, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
not ſo zealous for her Children, as careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the power ſhe had got, being uſed to rule, and
diſdaining to part with it. The <hi>Infante,</hi> ſo all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Kings are called, (except the Heir to the Crown,
who alone has the Title of Prince) and his Brother
were ever at Variance, nor was it poſſible to reconcile
them, becauſe the Elder looked upon it as a Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the younger, who blamed and condemned all
his Actions, and the younger being ſupported by his
Mother and the great ones of his Party, never ceaſed to
give him freſh provocations. <hi>Antony Conti</hi> perceiving
the King was now at thoſe Years, that the Charms of
Beauty began to work upon him, loſt not this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of ſecuring himſelf in his Favour, but by all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
means endeavoured to heighten his Deſire, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
his Pleaſure. The Queen Mother obſerving that her
Son, though he carried it with great Diſſimulation in
reſpect to her, could not forbear caſting many amorous
glances upon her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>adies, and fearing leaſt the ſplendor
of the Crown might induce ſome of them to ſubmit to
his Will, ſound no expedient to ſecure their Honour,
but by taking away all Opportunity. To this purpoſe,
ſhe appointed him a ſeparate Retinue, and a particular
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:54712:278"/>
apartment in the Pallace, which, tho' he was of Age
ſhe had forbore doing before, leaſt he ſhould wreſt the
Government, ſhe was ſo unwilling to part with, out of
her hands. This ſudden change for ſome time withheld
<hi>Alphonſo,</hi> always beſet with the great men of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
from the mean company he before took delight in.
But <hi>Conti</hi> fearing leaſt if he took to a ſolid deportment,
his favour would ſoon decline, never ceaſed till he drew
him back from thoſe grave formalities, to the practice
of his former violent and extravagant Exerciſes. It is
worth the obſerving, that tho' in <hi>Portugal</hi> it be one of
the things the Nobility and Gentry moſt value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon, to ride at a Bull with a ſpear and ſtrike him
therewith, yet, one of the great crimes objected againſt
<hi>Alphonſo,</hi> is that as he was riding in the Plain beyond
<hi>Tagus,</hi> he ran with his ſpear at a Bull, but ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately,
that his Horſe being gored he was caſt to
the ground and taken up for dead. His delighting in
unruly Horſes, his liking to fierce Dogs and many
other ſuch youthful exceſſes are urged againſt him
and painted out as the blackeſt infamies. Yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
has ſince been more improved to his diſadvantage,
or then made a greater noiſe,<note place="margin">Slanders caſt upon the King.</note> than his attacking alone
three men in a dark Night, whom for a conſiderable
ſpace he ſet very hard, till Number prevailing he
at length fell, having received at their hands two wounds
and was ſaved from farther perill by his ſervants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in. Theſe very Actions alledged againſt him,
prove that he was not ſo Lamed with the Palſy, as was
pretended by his adverſaries. And as for the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
of quarrelling in the ſtreet, it is a fault ſo habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
to Youth in all parts, that to object it to him,
as a crime unpardonable, looks as if indeed there were
none real to accuſe him of. But it is moſt certain that
what in the unfortunate is accounted Vice, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
paſſes for Virtue. However after he was recovered
of his wounds, the Councel of State in the Name of the
Kingdom made a remonſtrance to him, upbraiding him
with things paſt and deſiring him for the future to have
more regard to the ſafety of his Perſon. Indeed as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a courſe piece of Court-ſhip to pray their King to ſpare
his Life that he might afterwards End it miſerably in
impriſonment. This remonſtrance had ſuch effect upon
the King, that tho' he did not abandon Vice, yet he
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:54712:279"/>
changed thoſe his fierce inclinations, for others more
ſoft and ſecure, ſuch as are the intriegnes of Love, ſo
that now his whole delight was in Feaſting and Women.
He walked the ſtreets of <hi>Lisbon</hi> at Night with a Train
of bravoes, ranging to lewd houſes, and ſometimes thoſe
that accompanied him committed outrages upon ſuch as
they met: Neither was this all, for at length even by day
he would ſlip out or ſuffer women to be brought to him
to the Court. To divert him from theſe ſcandalous cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
his Mother with ſome of the Nobility, contrived to
fill his mind with buſineſs, giving him ſome part in the
adminiſtration of publick Affairs, yet ſo as that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Authority might ſtill remain in her hands. Thus
<hi>Alphonſo</hi> was brought to give audience with his Mother,
and to aſſiſt in Council, and was not at all averſe to it,
ſo that tho' he did not quite forſake his vices, yet he had
not ſo much leiſure to indulge them. <hi>Conti</hi> was not at
all diſpleaſed at theſe proceedings, hoping this would
be the means for advancing his Fortune, and therefore
loſt no time or opportunity, but plyed the King with
immoderate ſuits for himſelf and his companions. The
firſt thing the King asked for him of his Mother, was
that he might be admitted into the order of Knighthood
called of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which as ſhe durſt not abſolutely refuſe
for fear of provoking her Son, ſo ſhe delayed granting
it, ſtill putting him off from time to time with ſeveal
excuſes. <hi>Conti</hi> perceiving her ſubtilty, ſailed not to preſs
the King, urging how unworthy his grandeur it was to
be refuſed that which was in his power to take, and by
theſe and other inſinuations ſo fiered his mind, that at
length he forced the Queen to condeſcend to all that
was asked for him. Being thus raiſed from the degree of
a Merchant to that of a Miniſter of State, not only the
meaner ſort made application to him in their Suits, but
even the Nobility had recourſe to him in matters of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
leaſt his intereſt ſhould thwart their deſigns, nay
even the Queen herſelf, tho' contrary to her haughty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
refuſed not to truckle to his greatneſs, fearing
ſhe could not maintain her Authority by oppoſing him.
But he knowing all this Courtſhip was Feigned, uſed Art
againſt Art. ſhewing a good countenance to all yet at
the ſame time arming himſelf againſt all Emergencies.
To this purpoſe he began to make a party in the Court,
introducing inſtead of the experienced Nobility, all the
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:54712:279"/>
youth into places of honour, and preferring ſome of mean
parentage; till the Queen, fearing leaſt the increaſe of
his party ſhould prove her downful, began openly to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him. Thus the Court was divided into factions,
ſome ſiding with the King, others with the Queen, and
others adhering to Neither. <hi>Conti</hi> ceaſed not to blow the
Coles, but his chief aim was to perſwade the King to
take upon himſelf the Government, urging, as the truth
was, <hi>Denis, Alphonſo</hi> the 5th and <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> Kings of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>
took upon them the adminiſtration being yet youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than he. That which moſt moved the King, was
that his Mother falling ſick at this time, the whole Court
was made to him, which gave him to underſtand what
a diminution it was to his ſplendor, and therefore he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be inflamed with a deſire of abſolute command.
The Queen recovering and reaſuming the care of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
found the King more intractable than he had
been before, as being wholly bent upon wreſting the
power from her by force, if ſhe ſhould refuſe to reſign.
This was a deadly ſtroke to her ambitious Spirit, which
abhorred the thought of falling from that height where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſhe had upheld herſelf for ſo many Years; nor could
ſhe be without ſome care for the Kingdom, if it were
wholly left at the diſpoſal of a wilful and unexperienced
Youth, beſet with a croud of dangerous and unskilful
favourites and Councellors. Being perplexed and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with theſe thoughts, ſhe reſolved to ſet up her
Younger Son <hi>Peter</hi> againſt the King,<note place="margin">The Queen ſets up the Infante a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King.</note> that ſo he in hopes
of attaining the Crown through her means might be
wholly at her devotion, and at the ſame time <hi>Alphonſo</hi>
fearing to loſe his right might be kept in awe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to prepare the <hi>Infante</hi> who of himſelf was willing
enough, ſhe perſwaded him he ought to be declared
Prince and Heir to the Crown, alledging that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was impotent, and conſequently the Kingdom muſt
devolve to him. For the Executing of this deſign, ſhe
tampered with all the Nobility and Magiſtrates, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to call the <hi>Cortes</hi> or Parliament to confirm her
reſolution, but finding it a matter of greater difficulty than
ſhe had expected, moſt men abhorring to ſet up two
Brothers, as it were two King's, to rend the Kingdom
and deſtroy themſelves, and thinking it a raſhneſs to
condemn <hi>Alphonſo</hi> as impotent before any proof were
made of his Ability, ſhe deſiſted from the method, but
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:54712:280"/>
not from the deſign. Her next practice then was to ſet
out the <hi>Infante</hi> in the moſt ſplendid apparel, to cauſe him
to ſhow himſelf often to the People, to give him a Family
compoſed of all ſuch as were diſaffected to his Brother,
and to put him into a houſe the beſt in <hi>Lisbon</hi> built by
<hi>Chriſtopher de Moura</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Caſtelrodrigo.</hi> Having
thus ſet up the <hi>Infante</hi> in oppoſition to his Brother, and
ſecured him to herſelf, her next artifice was to counterfeit
a deſire of quitting the regency and retiring into a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery</hi>
of <hi>Nuns.</hi> For this purpoſe ſhe drew up a ſubtle
writing intimating her pretended deſire, and yet ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it that the great men and principal Miniſters to whom
ſhe ſent it for their advice, ſoon ſaw into the depth of it,
which was that ſhe deſired to be, as it were, conſtrained
to continue the Regency, yet ſo as ſhe muſt be drawn
to condeſcend by the removal of <hi>Antony Conti</hi> and the
reſt of his party from about the King. Thoſe to whom
the writing had been communicated being all her crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">The Council combine with the Queen.</note>
and fearing leaſt if ſhe were ſuffered to abandon
the government, they ſhould by the King be deprived of
the preferments they enjoyned, reſolved not to forſake
her leaſt they ſhould be involved in her fall. Therefore
by writing they gave her to underſtand, that tho' ſhe
were reſolved to lay down the adminiſtration of the
Kingdom, it was not yet time to do it, till ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the Perſon of the King, thoſe that ſeduced
and led him into ill courſes. Nothing could be more
pleaſing to the Queen than this anſwer ſo pat to her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
ſince they had fulfilled all her wiſhes without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
her to expreſs them. However that all might
ſeem to be carried by the advice of the Council, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they were all reſolved to perform her will, ſhe
would have nothing done but what ſhould be there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed
and given under their hands. The Councel met
accordingly, and, tho' ſome of the graveſt among them
oppoſed the deſign, as too viſible an affront to the King,
yet it was carried,<note place="margin">The faction ſeize <hi>Conti</hi> the Kings favourite in the King's appartment and ſend him to <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>Conti</hi> and his adherents ſhould be
ſeized, and ſent into baniſhment contrary to the will of
the King, for this Council ſat not to ſerve him, but his
Mother. In purſuance to this reſolution, the Queen ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſecured the King in her Lodgings upon pretence of
buſineſs, the Duke of <hi>Cadaval</hi> with his Party Entred the
King's apartment, where <hi>Conti</hi> then was. He ſeeing
a Throng and ſuſpecting ſome danger locked himſelf in,
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:54712:280"/>
but the Duke without reſpect to the Sacredneſs of the
place, or to the Remonſtrances of the Count <hi>de Caſtello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melhor</hi>
who would have diverted him from that Action,
offered to break open the door, whereupon <hi>Conti</hi> ſeeing
no hopes of eſcaping, and the Count not able to relieve
him or acquaint the King, delivered himſelf up to the
Duke upon promiſe of Life. At the ſame time ſome
ſome others of <hi>Conti</hi>'s partizans were ſecured partly in the
pallace and partly in the Town, all which were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
put aboard a Ship that lay ready to Sail in the
River and ſent away to <hi>Brazil.</hi> The Queen being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that all ſhe had commanded was put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
led the King forth into the great Hall, whither ſhe
had aſſembled all the Nobility, Miniſters of State, and
Magiſtrates of the City, the better to appeaſe, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
the King. Here a Remonſtrance was made to him
in the Name of the Kingdom, full of grievous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
againſt his Conduct, and againſt his Favourites,
whom to prevent any farther ill conſequences they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
they had been obliged to ſend into baniſhment.
This done having kiſſed his hand they departed. It
was no ſmall ſurprize to the King to be brought ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
into that aſſembly, and therefore not rightly
conceiving the drift of what had been ſaid, he began to
ask the meaning of it. <hi>Garcia de Melo</hi> told him that to
ſatisfy the complaints of his People, they had ſent <hi>Conti</hi>
and his adherents into baniſhment. He ſcarce believing
they durſt offer him ſuch an indignity, began loudly and
in a rage to call upon <hi>Conti,</hi> and running to ſeek for him
threatned to follow him, whereſoever they had ſent him.
<hi>Melo</hi> told him his ſearch would be in vain for that he
was now under Sail for <hi>Brazil,</hi> that as the caſe ſtood
he muſt have either parted with <hi>Conti</hi> or his Crown.
At this anſwer he ſeemed ſomewhat to compoſe himſelf.
Then calling for <hi>Emanuel Antunes,</hi> who only had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
of all his former Favourites, he ſhut himſelf up with
him and the Count of <hi>Caſtellomelhor.</hi> Theſe two gave
him a full Relation of what had paſſed, and here were
layed the firſt Foundations of the Counts enſuing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
After this meeting, the King appeared unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at what had hapned, and rid according to cuſtom
that Afternoon, but he had learned to Counterfeit, and
had other thoughts within his breaſt than what appeared
by his countneance.</p>
               <p>

This mighty act of policy which the Queen had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
to perpetuate her Regency,<note place="margin">Count <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelmelhor</hi> ſucceeds in the King's Favour.</note> was the very cauſe of
her ſpeedy falling from it. Count <hi>Caſtelmelhor,</hi> a Man
above exception for his Birth and Parts, had now
ſucceeded in the Kings Favour, in the place of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi>
and omitted not to encourage him in the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of taking upon him the Government. Beſides
a young Lady belonging to the Queen, for whom
the King had a more then ordinary Affection, made him
the more earneſt, diſcovering to him all his Mothers
private Diſcourſes. For the better carrying on his
Deſign, the King ordered the Count, whoſe waiting
Week was expired to wait on another, leaſt one
might ſucceed him, whom he could not ſo well confide
in. This done, he retired according to cuſtom to
<hi>Alcantara,</hi> a Houſe near <hi>Lisbon,</hi> carrying with him his
Brother and a great Train. That ſame day he returned to
<hi>Lisbon,</hi> and viſited his Mother, diſcourſing ſo lovingly
with her, that all reſentment ſeemed to be paſſed, but
on a ſudden, without acquainting her, he went back to
<hi>Alcantara,</hi> accompanyed only by the Count <hi>de Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melhor,</hi>
and the Count <hi>de Antouguia.</hi> From thence
he diſperſed Letters into all parts of the Kingdom, to
the Officers of the Army, and Governors of Towns, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
them, that being now at Age, he had taken
upon him the Government.<note place="margin">The King reſolves to take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him.</note> Then he ordered all the
Nobility and Miniſters of State that were at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to
repair to him to <hi>Alcantara.</hi> The Queen aſtoniſhed at
this News, and fearing to be caſt down from her Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
aſſembles the Council of State, where it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that <hi>Emanuel Pacheco,</hi> ſhould be placed upon the
Road to ſtop all thoſe that ſhould offer to repair to the
King; that the Queen ſhould write a Letter to him in
ſoft Terms, deſiring him either to delay ſome time his
taking the Government upon him, or at leaſt to admit
her to bear a great part with him, and that in caſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
failed, ſhe ſhould then uſe Force to conſtrain
him. Accordingly <hi>Pacheco</hi> turned back thoſe that were
going to <hi>Alcantara;</hi> the Guards, and all the Queens Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents,
were ordered to be ready in Arms to ſupport her,
and a Letter was ſent to the King from her, full of allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and ſoft, but all deceitful Expreſſions. But before
the ſending of the Letter, the People of <hi>Lisbon</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that the Court armed againſt the King, began to
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:54712:281"/>
run into tumult for his Defence, fearing leaſt any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
might be offered him. This zeal of the Multitude
was what humbled the Queen, and therefore ſeeing no
hope left of prevailing by open force, ſhe had recourſe to
Artifice and Entreaty, and therefore, as has been ſaid,
ſent a ſubmiſſive Letter by the Biſhop of <hi>Targa.</hi> In this
Letter among other things, the Queen urged to have
the <hi>Cortes</hi> or Parliament call'd, that ſhe might there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
the Government, but the King and the Count per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
this was only a contrivance to gain time, an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was ſent her by the ſame Biſhop. The purport of
this Anſwer was, that the King conſidering the great
Burthen of care that attended the Government, was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to eaſe his Mother, who had long laboured under
it, of that Toil, and to take it upon himſelf. She now
plainly perceiving that there was no longer hope, either
by Force or Art, of retaining the Government, reſolved
at length to quit it, leaſt it ſhould be violently taken
from her. However, ſhe wiſhed it might be done in the
Pallace, that the World might believe it had been free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſigned, and not to be forcibly extorted from her.
Thoſe who were acquainted with her Subtilties, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the King not to truſt himſelf to her Power, which
made him delay ſome time at <hi>Alcantara.</hi> However, at
length finding himſelf ſecured on all ſides, and the
Queens Intereſt declining, ſince the People of <hi>Lisbon</hi>
had declared for him; he repaired to the Pallace, where
in the preſence of the Nobility, Miniſters of State, and
Magiſtrates of the City,<note place="margin">She is at length for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</note> the Queen delivered up the
Seals into his Hands, which is the uſual Ceremony in
<hi>Portugal,</hi> when a King takes upon him the Government.
This Ceremony was perform'd on the 23d. of <hi>June,</hi>
1662, the King then wanting but one Month of 19
Years of Age, whereas according to the antient cuſtom of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> their Kings were always reputed of Age at 14,
and accordingly at thoſe Years, the Regency ought to ceaſe.</p>
               <p>The Queen Mother thus diſcharged of the care of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,<note place="margin">She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to retire, but ſtays at Court in hopes to wreſt the Power from her Son.</note>
began again to talk of retiring, but that after
ſuch a manner, that no Body believ'd ſhe truly meant it.
For firſt ſhe talked of building a new Monaſtery, but
could never find out a convenient Place, then of erecting
an Apartment for her ſelf, near ſome of the old ones,
but none would admit her. And this it was believed
was her deſire, only to protract time, and to continue
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:54712:282"/>
in the Pallace, till ſome new emergency might again
call her to the Government. But now all the Court
was made to the King, all the Nobility attended him,
and there wanted not crouds of Flatteers and Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
to fawn on him. His principal Miniſters and
Favourites were the Counts of <hi>Caſtelmelhor,</hi> and <hi>Atouguia,</hi>
and <hi>Sebaſtian Caeſar de Meneſes.</hi> Theſe managed all
principal matters of State, and on their Counſel he chiefly
relyed. His Enemies however never ceaſed to ſlander
him, ſpreading it abroad, that being wholly void of
Senſe, he only ſpoke ſuch Words as they put into his
Mouth. Count <hi>Caſtelmelhor</hi> endeavouring to eſtabliſh
himſelf abſolutely in the King's Favour, eaſed him asmuch
as was poſſible of the publick cares, indulging his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to Horſes, Arms, and even to Women, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any publick Scandal. At this time the Count deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
out of Priſon, <hi>Henry Enriquez de Miranda,</hi> who
had been confined by the Queen, and he being now
brought to Court, became one of the King's greateſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
and yet though he was raiſed to this Degree,
there never happened the leaſt Diſorder betwixt the
Count of <hi>Caſtelmelhor</hi> and him. Much otherwiſe was
it with the Count of <hi>Atouguia, Caeſar de Meneſes,</hi> and
Count <hi>Caſtelmelhor,</hi> but the latter not thinking himſelf
yet thoroughly eſtabliſhed, would not attempt ſo ſoon
to caſt them down.<note place="margin">Count <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor</hi> riſes,</note> At length having wholly gained
the aſcendant over the King, and having all things as
prime Miniſter at his diſpoſal, he lodged himſelf in the
Apartment that had belonged to Prince <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the
King's eldeſt Brother. He only wanted now ſome charge
that might always keep him about the King's Perſon,
and there being none at that time vacant, he thought of
one that of late had been ſuppreſſed, or incorporated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that of the Secretary of State; in <hi>Portugueſe</hi> it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Eſcrivao da Puridade,</hi> that is <hi>the private Secretary,</hi>
This employment he begged of the King, who readily
granted it, and though the Secretary of State inſolently
enough diſputed it, cauſed him immediately to ſettle
him in the poſſeſſion thereof. By this charge he alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the right to a Seat in the Counſel of State. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus raiſed to the higheſt pitch of Favour, he began to
beſtow preferments without meaſure upon all his Friends
and Adherents, and at the ſame time omitted not to cruſh
and terrifie his Enemies, that the power of the one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:54712:282"/>
and the dread of the other might be a ſure ſtay to
his greatneſs.<note place="margin">Thoſe that affronted the King in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi> baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> In the next place, he adviſed the King
to ſhew ſome reſentment for the Affronts done to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
during the Queen's Regency; as particularly in
the forcing away of <hi>Conti</hi> out of his Apartment, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the like Inſolencies, which if not puniſhed, might
draw him into contempt. In purſuance of this Advice,
the Duke of <hi>Cadaval, Garcia,</hi> and <hi>Emanuel de Melo,</hi> the
Counts of <hi>Soure, Pombeiro, Peter Vieira,</hi> Secretary of
State, who had often audaciouſly reprov'd the King,
and ſome others, all guilty enough, were ſent into Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p>This proceeding againſt ſo many perſons of Note,
though but an act of Juſtice,<note place="margin">The Queen Infante, and their party hold Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the King.</note> miniſtred occaſion to their
partizans to revile anew the King and his Government.
And now the Queen ſeeing her ſelf excluded from all
publick Affairs, began again to cheriſh the <hi>Infante,</hi> and
to hold frequent and private Conſultations with him,
wherein it was always inculcated that the King was ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
and unfit for Rule. Count <hi>Caſtelmelhor</hi> who was
not ignorant of all their Machinations, contrived all
ways he could to ſeparate them, but all in vain. For
the <hi>Infante</hi> building upon the notion of his Brothers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity,
had more mind to be himſelf a King, then to
be next to a King. Therefore he carryed himſelf with
profound Diſſimulation, ſtudying all ways to elude the
Arts of the Favourite. But the Count ſeeing he could
not otherwiſe prevail upon him to deſiſt from his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,
perſwaded the King to change all his Servants,
putting in their places ſuch as he could confide in, that
ſo he ſhould have the leſs opportunity of carrying on his
Deſigns. The next thing was to perſwade the Queen
at length to retire from Court, as ſhe had ſo often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to deſire, though by her proceedings it plainly
appeared nothing was more diſtaſtful to her than the
thoughts of a private Life. Yet ſeeing the King ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to have her retire, ſhe again has recourſe to her
Diſſimulation, and ſends to ask leave to withdraw to
ſome private Houſe, becauſe the Apartment ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to build was not yet finiſhed. The King's Anſwer
was, that it became not her Granedur to quit the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
for a private Houſe, but that if ſhe were ſo deſirous
of a retreat, ſhe might cauſe more Diligence to be uſed
in finiſhing her Structure, which till then, had gone on
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:54712:283"/>
very ſlowly. Soon after, <hi>Alfonſo</hi> being informed that
his Mother never ceaſed to uſe all Arts to advance his
Brother <hi>Peter</hi> to the Throne, being terrifyed with the
danger of his Crown, which yet at laſt, by theſe ſame
Practices, was raviſhed from him; he ſent an abſolute
Order for her to depart from the Palace. This poſitive
command preſſing, and fearing to be forced away, ſhe at
length reſolved to depart, and accordingly on the 17th.
of <hi>March,</hi> 1663, withdrew to the new Apartment ſhe had
built at a ſmall diſtance from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> being attended
thither by the King,<note place="margin">The Queen at laſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</note> the <hi>Infante,</hi> and all the Nobility.
The Queen Mother being thus removed, the <hi>Infante</hi>
ſeemed now wholly devoted to pleaſe the King, except in
one only thing which he knew to be offenſive to him, and
that was in frequently viſiting his Mother, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
private Diſcourſes with her. Nor was ſhe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
often in publick to warn him of the danger of this
his aſſiduouſneſs towards her, whether ſhe really meant
it as dangerous to him, or rather did it artificially to
make the King the more odious, and procure themſelves
the greater Commiſeration. Thus with great difficulty,
Queen <hi>Luiſa</hi> was at the laſt not only put out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,
but even out of the Palace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> to whom the nearneſs of his Mother had
been a curb,<note place="margin">The King grows more looſe in his Life.</note> being now delivered from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that reſtraint,
ran more licentiouſly into all the Vices of Youth. Count
<hi>Caſtelmelhor</hi> fearing a diſorderly Life might haſten his
fall, in whoſe Ruine he muſt himſelf be involved, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed
ſeveral means to reclaim him, or at leaſt to conceal
his Extravagancies, but it is a work of great difficulty
to correct the vicious Inclinations of Youth, eſpecially
when ſupported by the luſtre of a Crown. In ſhort, his
Vices were too viſible to be excuſed, but to lay to his
Charge all the Villanies his Adverſaries have aſperſed
him withal, were too much to wrong his Memory; for
it is certain, that no inſolence was committed during
his Reign, which the malice of his Enemies has not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
him withal. However, ſo certainly it was,
that the King indulging his Appetites and Vicious deſires,
the whole burthen of the Government was in a manner
devolved upon the three Favourites, that is, the Counts
of <hi>Caſtelmelhor,</hi> and <hi>Antouguia,</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtian Caeſar de
Meneſes. Caſtelmelhor</hi> had long meditated to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the other two, but as long as the Queen conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:54712:283"/>
at Court durſt not attempt it, leaſt they
having loſt the King ſhould become an acceſſion to
and ſtrengthen her party. Now ſhe being removed,
there remained no other obſtacle to the fulfilling
his deſire, and therefore by often buzzing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> falſe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
into the King's Ears, he firſt cauſed the Count
<hi>de Atouguia</hi> to be expelled the Court and ſoon after
to be baniſhed the City. None remained now to
cope with him but <hi>Meneſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conti <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called from</hi> Brazil.</note> who to ſupport himſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
the King to recall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Antony Conti</hi> from <hi>Brazil,</hi>
hoping that he being returned and reſtored to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Favour, would not in gratitude omit to ſtand by the
man that had been the cauſe of bringing him back from
baniſhment. The Count could not be long ignorant of
this practice, and therefore immediately ſo worked the
King, that <hi>Meneſes</hi> was baniſhed before <hi>Antony Conti</hi>
could arrive to ſupport him. Soon after <hi>Conti</hi> arrives
from <hi>Brazil,</hi> the Ship that brought him being received
into the port of <hi>Lisbon</hi> with ſound of Trumpets, firing
of Cannon, and all other demonſtrations of joy, as if it
had been the reception of ſome Soveraign Prince. Yet
all this was but a glimmering of happineſs to <hi>Conti,</hi> for
Count <hi>Caſtelmelhor</hi> having perſwaded the King, that as
it was a Vindication of his Royal Authority to recal
him from baniſhment, whither he had been ſent in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Majeſty, ſo to entertain him at Court would
only ſerve to provoke the Nobility,<note place="margin">But bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Court.</note> to whom the very
name of <hi>Conti</hi> was odious, for theſe reaſons without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
him to Land at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> he was ſent away into the
Country with expreſs Command, not to preſume to
come near the Court. Nevertheleſs to the End it might
be thought this exile was not the effect of his jealouſie,
but rather of his care both for the ſafety of the King and
<hi>Conti,</hi> he omitted not to careſs him at that diſtance, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him frequent preſents, and a conſiderable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at Court falling, he cauſed it to be conferred upon
him tho' abſent, and beſtowed a Rich Benefice upon
<hi>John Conti</hi> Brother to <hi>Antony,</hi> who was in orders. <hi>Conti</hi>
was not ſo dull, but he could Eaſily ſee through theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices.
Therefore he uſed all his endeavours to obtain
an interview with the King,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conti</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately meets the King.</note> not doubting but if he once
ſaw him, he ſhould be reſtored to his former favour.
Such induſtry was uſed to compaſs his deſign, that at
length he had a private meeting with <hi>Alphonſo</hi> at <hi>Alcanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
                  <pb n="543" facs="tcp:54712:284"/>
the Count being then abſent. At this conference the
King's former affection was ſo revived, that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to carry him immediately to Court. But <hi>Conti</hi>
fearing his ſudden and unexpected return might prove
dangerous, deſired it might be put off for the preſent,
only praying the King, that he would recal from ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
thoſe Noblemen who had been exiled for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to his Mother. This interview, and the propoſal
made by <hi>Conti</hi> being made known to the Count by one
that had overheard their diſcourſe, he ſoon diſcovered
the deſign was to make a party to ruin him. To the End
then to prevent his Enemy and turn that deſtruction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himſelf, he employed ſeveral Spies to obſerve all his
words and Actions, not ſparing any expence for intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
By theſe means at length he diſcovered that <hi>Conti</hi>
had conſpired with the Noblemen to reſtore the Queen
to the regency,<note place="margin">A conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt the King diſcovered and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</note> leaving the King nothing but the empty
name and Title without any power or Authority. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
got knowledge of this Treaſonable practice, and
found witneſſes to prove it, he inſtantly acquaints the
King, who appointed judges to examine the matter.
Upon a full hearing and ſufficient proof, ſeveral of the
conſpirators were convicted, and yet (tho' by his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
the King had always been accuſed of exceſſive
cruelty) not one of the Criminals ſuffered death, only
<hi>D. Theodoſius de Melo</hi> Brother to the Duke <hi>de Cadaval</hi>
was baniſhed Five Leagues from <hi>Lisbon, Sebaſtian Ceſar

                  </hi>
The General depoſitions involved the Queen Mother
in the common guilt, whereupon a Secretary was ſent
to examine her, but ſhe refuſing to anſwer, the King
let that fall. Count <hi>Caſtelmelhor</hi> puffed up with this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
removed from the apartment he was in before to
another nearer the King, where it being obſerved by
ſuch as envied him, that more Court was made to him
than to the King himſelf, his name was thereby rendred
the more odious, and he being now arrived to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

ſerving in the Army ſeveral Years with great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

<pb n="545" facs="tcp:54712:284"/>
in inclinations, yet ſo addicted to theſe two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that they ſeemed not to move without them.
Soon after the <hi>Infante</hi> falling ſick, <hi>Vaſconcellos</hi> attended him
with ſuch dilligence, that he not only confirmed himſelf in
his favour, but incurred the ill will of all his other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal

all recalled by the King except only the Count <hi>de Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceira.</hi>
All things being thus reſtored the King preferred

not acceptable to the <hi>Infante,</hi> He thereupon thinking
himſelf beſet with ſo many Spies, reſolved to alter his

taken up he ſeldom viſited the King, as if he had been

his change of Life to proceed from a Diſaſter which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

had made overtures on his behalf to the Duke of <hi>Bouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi>
daughter, which alſo had taken effect, ſo far as they
were agreed in words, tho' the Articles were not ſigned.
This Marrige was propoſed in order to ſecure the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Crown, in caſe the King as had been given
out ſhould be incapable of getting Children. But now
the <hi>Infante</hi> having changed his mind, upon what account
is uncertain, could by no perſwaſions be prevailed upon
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:54712:285"/>
to conſent to this marriage, although the King himſelf
preſſed it very home. This match being thus broke off,
the Marqueſs <hi>de Sande</hi> having in order to conclude for
the King firſt enquired whether the report that went of
the King's impotency were true, was aſſured by the
Count <hi>Caſtelmelhor,</hi> that the King had already ſeveral

againſt that imputation. All things being then diſpoſed

But what appeared moſt rare in her was that being a
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> a name odious to the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> yet ſhe knew
ſo to carry herſelf that ſhe gained the Love and eſteem
of the whole Country. Yet all theſe good Qualities
were ſomewhat ſullied by her unbounded ambition,
and inſatiable deſire of rule, which were the cauſe ſhe
would never quit the government, or Court, till forced
from them both, and that ſhe increaſed the hatred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
her two Sons by ſetting up the younger in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

The Queen Mother being dead, the King believed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
more ſafe, and on the contrary the <hi>Infante</hi> deprived
of her ſupport, thought himſelf more expoſed. Count
<hi>Caſtelmelhor</hi> who till then had ſtood in ſome awe of him
becauſe of her power, acted now with more freedom.
Thus the <hi>Infante</hi> growing more diſcontented,<note place="margin">The <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> grows diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the King jealous.</note> the King
at the ſame time grew the more jealous of his reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and conſequently averſe to all thoſe he ſaw him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
or cheriſh. Upon theſe diſcontents, ſome of his
Servants fearing to offend quitted him, and others were
removed from him, ſo that his retinue was much below the
dignity of the Brother of a King. Some days he bore with
this hardſhip, till the News of the New Queens being
ſet forward, obliged him to preſs the King, that he might
appear like himſelf at her reception. The King orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to give the Names of ſuch as he deſired ſhould
attend him, but not approving of thoſe he made choice
off, nothing was concluded upon, tho' many debates
paſſed betwixt them on that account. At length on the
2d. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1666, the Fleet which brought the Queen
entred the River of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the News whereof being
brought to the King, he is reported to have received
without the leaſt demonſtration of joy, or ſatisfaction,
which was then looked upon as an ill omen of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſucceſs of that Marriage. The Marqueſs <hi>de Ruvigny</hi>
who Commanded the <hi>French</hi> Fleet having ſent to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi>
to beg leave to pay his reſpects to him, he layed
hold of this opportunity, to put the King in mind how
diſhonourable it was to them both, that the Admiral
ſhould find him ſo ill attended. What could be done in
ſo ſudden an Emergency was, that the King ſent his own
Servants to attend his Brother during that Ceremony.
This was no way pleaſing to the <hi>Infante,</hi> who being
highly incenſed againſt Count <hi>Caſtelmelhor,</hi>

was not to be overcome, ſince it had not yielded
to the intreaties and power of the Count, when he had
amidſt the reſt of the crowd, hid his want of attendance

only by <hi>Roderick de Meneſes.</hi> Fame having
immediately ſpread abroad, not only through the City
but through the whole Kingdom, the News of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat;
the univerſal report was that all things were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for a Civil War. At <hi>Lisbon Peter</hi>'s party was already
more numerous than <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s, the vertues of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
were every where extolled, and the vices of the
latter no leſs exaggerated; but above all the affection
of the one, and the averſion of the other to Count <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelmelhor</hi>
weighed more than all other things, with the
People who bore him an implacable hatred. Many of
the Nobility interpoſed to pacify the brothers, but all their
endeavours proved in vain, for neither of them would
abate any thing of his demands. When all other means
failed, the Queen who then was indiſpoſed ſent for the
<hi>Infante,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Strange ſhow of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Infante, and the Queen.</note> who being come to her, they received one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with ſuch affection, as ſeemed to be a ſufficient ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
of the Love that was growing betwixt them. Here
the Queen prevailed that he ſhould not depart the Court,
and ſhould wholly leave that affair to her management,
which he could not refuſe her, being as was believed
already ſomewhat fired with that Sight of her. At
length the difference betwixt the Brothers was reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the Prince choſe other Servants and the King al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of them. Yet tho' they ſeemed to have layd
aſide all animoſities, the grudges betwixt them were of
a higher nature than to be ſo eaſily forgot. But <hi>Peter</hi> was
ſupported with a deep diſſimulation, <hi>Alphonſo</hi> had little
of that Art, and for the moſt part threatned much more
than he would perform, which was the cauſe that he
was often heard to let ſlip very harſh expreſſions againſt
his Brother. He having long meditated how to rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of theſe diſpleaſures, at laſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ixed upon a Method,
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:54712:286"/>
which was to beg of the King the Poſt of Conſtable of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> which is the ſame as <hi>Generaliſſimo.</hi> The more
he inſiſted in demanding, the more poſitive the King was
in refuſing, as being not ignorant of the danger of
ſuch a Grant. Count <hi>Caſtelmelhor</hi> was aſtoniſhed at this
Requeſt, and ſpared not to tell the King, that it was
not the General's Staff, but the Crown that he aſpired
to, and that it were well to cruſh his aſpiring Spirit.
Nor ſo ſatisfyed, he uſed all his Endeavours to find
out, who had adviſed him to demand that Poſt. At
length it appeared to him, that Counſel could proceed
from none but the Counts of <hi>Torres</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> who
had been excellent Commanders in the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Them therefore he inſtantly removed from him,
ſending them away to their Charges on the Frontiers.
Nevertheleſs, though the abetters were removed, the
cauſes of diſſention ſtill remaining, the differences betwixt
the two Brothers, grew daily higher and higher, and at
laſt the Queen who ought to have laboured to compoſe
them, became her ſelf a Party, leaving the Intereſt of
her Husband to adhere to that of his Brother. Beſides
her proper Inclination to the <hi>Infante,</hi> two things perhaps
might conduce to move the Queen to this unjuſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,<note place="margin">Motives of the Queens Averſion to the <hi>King.</hi>
                  </note>
the one that the King was already grown wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of her, and the other (from which perhaps his Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

how to diſſolve this knot of Affection that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Queen and the <hi>Infante,</hi> thought nothing ſo
effectual as marrying of him, which without delaying,
he propoſed to the King, who approving of the Advice
commanded his Brother to make choice of a Wife. He
having deſired ſome time to conſider of a matter of that
Importance, returned his Anſwer in Writing, ſignifying
in ſubſtance, that he was ready to comply with the
King, only praying that a Servant of his might be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to go to the Courts of <hi>Europe</hi> to find out a Lady
fit for him to match with. Neither the King nor the
Count ſaw into the deſign of this deceitful Anſwer,
which was contrived only to protract time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they approved of it, and admitted of <hi>John de Roxas,</hi>
whom he had named to go upon that Embaſſy.</p>

was improved to heighten their Animoſities.
A <hi>French</hi> Man belonging to the Queen, was murthered

Priſoner to <hi>Coimbra,</hi> and thence conducted to <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon.</hi>
There he was tryed before all the Tribunals, till
he came to the Council of State, none daring to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Judgment againſt him, becauſe he implored the
protection of the Church, as having been taken out of
Sanctuary, a thing never permitted in <hi>Portugal.</hi> The
Queen, who thought nothing was done to thwart
her, but through the Malice of Count <hi>Caſtelmelhor</hi> to
her, being inraged, that Juſtice was not done upon the
Murtherer of her Servant and Country-man, railed bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
at him, laying all her diſcontents to his Charge.
Nor yet ſo ſatisfyed, ſhe refuſed to be preſent at the
Bull Feaſt, uſually kept at <hi>Lisbon</hi> upon St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s
Day, alledging ſhe could not ſhew her ſelf to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

was the hotteſt, as looking upon the Injuries done
to her, to be levelled at himſelf, who had wholly eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

to bring the Secretary of State, who had carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf very diſreſpectfully towards the Queen, in
the Affair of the Murtherer, before the Council, to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
for his Inſolency. There contrary to his Cuſtom,
<hi>Peter</hi> inveighed largely againſt him, and with ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
that the Council ſigned an Order for his Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which notwithſtanding all the Count's oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was obeyed, and he ſent into Exile. This Succeſs
againſt the Favourite, encouraged the <hi>Infante</hi> to aim at
greater things, his party daily encreaſing; for beſides the
Queen, there adhered to him the Duke of <hi>Cadaval,</hi> who
had been Baniſhed by the Counts Procurement, <hi>D. Sancho
Manuel,</hi> who after defeating the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army at <hi>Eſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moz,</hi>
had been remov'd from his command by theſame
Intereſt, and many more of the Nobility, on ſundry other
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:54712:287"/>
Accounts, beſides the thoughtleſs multitude, ſtirred up
by the deſire of Novelty, and animated with the name
of ſo many Heads of Note. Notwithſtanding the
Strength of this Faction, it was yet thought too ſoon to
attempt any thing againſt the King directly, and judged
more proper to let the Storm fall upon his Favourite,<note place="margin">The Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on level a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Favourite.</note>
who being once caſt down, the King would be left ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to all their Practiſes. To conſult of the means
of removing the Count, there was a great Meeting
held of all the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Confederacy; he alſo being
preſent. There moſt Men being averſe to Murther, if
the thing might be otherwiſe performed, it was reſolved
to ſeize upon, and ſend him away, either into <hi>India,</hi> or
ſome other remote parts of the World; yet ſo, that if
he ſhould make reſiſtance, or attempt to eſcape, then he
ſhould be killed. Many days paſſed not, before the
Count had intire Information of the whole Conſpiracy
againſt him, and having layed it before the King, he was by
him impowered to uſe ſuch means for their common Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
as he ſhould think moſt effectual. He preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doubles the Guards at the Palace, arms all his own
Creatures, ſet his Spies, and ſtirs not out of the Palace,
without a ſufficient Train and Guard for his Security.
This ſudden change at Court, alarm'd the City, ſo that
the People ran in heaps to the Palace for Information,
but finding that there was no interruption of publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
nor any thing but the increaſe of the Guards, they
ſoon diſperſed and returned to their Houſes. The <hi>Infante</hi>
finding his project defeated, to avoid all Suſpition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to his Country-Houſe at <hi>Quelas.</hi> Whilſt he was
there almoſt in deſpair for the great diſappointment he
had received, a Diſcovery was made, or pretended to
be made, for the certainty of it could never appear, that
the Count had hired People to poiſon him. Hereupon
his Partizans adviſe him to be very circumſpect in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
himſelf, and they on their part were not wanting
in ſpreading abroad the danger they pretended him to
be in. Having thus prepared the Multitude, and being
ſenſible that the Count could not but ſtudy to ſecure
himſelf by his downfal, the <hi>Infante</hi> made inſtant appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to the King, to puniſh him according to the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs
of the Offence he alledged. To this effect he
wrote to the King, acquainting him that he was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Count practiſed againſt his Life; that therefore
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:54712:288"/>
he demanded he ſhould be baniſhed from the Court, or
elſe, that he himſelf ſhould be forced to fly into Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
parts for Safety. Both the King and Count ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
read this Letter, referred the whole matter to the
Council of State. There it was fully diſcuſſed, one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
affirming that it was a Preſumption at one time to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
the King's Favourite, and aſſign his Puniſhment in
ſuch a manner as ſeemed to threaten the King himſelf;
that if the Count were juſtly accuſed, he ought to be
tryed according to the known Laws of the Kingdom,
and if convicted, to be puniſhed; but that if it ſhould
appear he was wronged, care ought to be taken, leaſt
the Prince's aſpiring practices ſhould not be prejudicial
to the King. The other ſide on the contrary being devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Intereſt, urged all the plauſible Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
they could gather to ſhew that he ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
with, Right or Wrong, either in regard he was
the King's Brother, or for fear he might effect that by
force, which he could not obtain by Entreaty. After
conferring both Opinions, they came to this Reſolution,
That it ſhould be put to the Tryal,<note place="margin">The <hi>King</hi> offers the <hi>Infante</hi> Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> whether the <hi>Infante</hi>
could be appeaſed by Submiſſion, and all manner of

upon his Knees. But he conſidering, that to accept of
this Submiſſion would no way forward his End, for
that the Count would ſtill remain at Court, after two
days delay, ſent back the Marqueſs with his Anſwer,
ſignifying that nothing but the Baniſhment of the Earl
could ſatisfie him. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> hoping his Brother's Fury
might abate in time, delayed ſending to him again for
the preſent, whereat he being the more enraged, cauſed
a Letter to be deliver'd to the King, among other
things, threatning not to appear at Court, as long as

This latter Advice was approved off, but the Execution
being delayed, and <hi>Peter</hi> having received Intelligence
thereof, he ſtood upon his Guard, arming all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
and promiſing to live and dye by them. Next

impeaching him of Practices againſt his Life,

having ſpoken to this effect, he gave them the ſame in
Writing, to which they unanimouſly anſwer'd, they
would ſtand by him, and ſupport his Dignity to their
utmoſt.</p>
               <p>It is eaſie to conceive how much King and Count

                  </note> which was

was no leſs in the <hi>Infante</hi> to ſummon the Tribunals,

and therefore the King ſent to him to diſcover, who
were the Count's Accuſers, that ſo he might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
againſt in due form of Law. The <hi>Infante</hi> poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
refuſed to diſcover the Evidence, unleſs the
Count were firſt removed from Court. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> put it
to the Council and ableſt Lawyers, whether it were le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
and beſeeming the King's Dignity, that the Count
ſhould be removed before the Witneſſes were known,
and it was carryed by the Majority, that the demand
was unjuſt and unreaſonable. This their reſult, under
their Hands, the King ſent to his Brother; at the ſame
time ſending away Expreſſes to the Commanders on the
Frontiers and Sea-ports, to ſuffer no Man to depart the
Kingdom. By theſe means the expectation of a Civil
War, which till then, had gone no farther then <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
was ſpread abroad throughout the whole Kingdom. The
<hi>Infante</hi> adviſing with his Friends upon the reſult of the
Council ſent him by the King, they came to this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
that in caſe his Majeſty perſiſted in protecting
the Count, then <hi>Peter</hi> without his conſent ſhould ſpeed
into the Province beyond the Mountains, where the
Count of St. <hi>John</hi> had the command of the Forces, which

he ſent the King a long Letter full of invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:54712:289"/>
the Count, and complaints that he could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Juſtice, concluding that his Majeſty made more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Earl then of him, and ſeeing both could not
live together, he had reſolved to quit the Court. Upon
what Account he intended to withdraw, we have ſeen
but juſt before, not to ſubmit to the King's Will, but
to force him to comply with his. And though he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
privately to withdraw himſelf, yet the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for his Journey were ſo publick, that there was
none ſo blind, who could not diſcover it. Nor was
this done without cauſe, for the report of his removal
being ſpread abroad, and that it was in the nature of a
Flight from the Favourite, the whole City began in a
moment to riſe in mutiny, ſeveral of the Nobility open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fomenting it, and declaring that was the day, on
which according to an antient Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Men are reckoned to have appeared that day in
Arms, to ſtop the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Journey, and to decide the
Controverſie betwixt the Count and him. This popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Fury being made known to the King and Count,
they both perceiving themſelves too weak to withſtand
the violence of that Storm, reſolved inſtead of that lofty
Courſe they had followed before, to ſtoop to Neceſſity,
and try what good Words could work upon the <hi>Infante.</hi>
To this purpoſe, the King ſent him a Letter, full of
moſt loving Expreſſions, deſiring him to ſuppreſs that
Tumult, which had been raiſed on his Account, and to
come to Court, where all things ſhould be diſpoſed to
his Satisfaction. The Anſwer to this Letter, was in no
leſs obliging Terms, only in the Concluſion, the <hi>Infante</hi>
again intimated, that the King muſt reſolve either to part

perceiving, that neither Threats nor Intreaties prevailed
upon the <hi>Infante,</hi> and that the mutiny in the City was
grown to ſuch a head, it would endanger both the King

viſiting the Frontiers, and in his return, would reſtore
him to the Court,<note place="margin">The Queen aſſists the <hi>Infante.</hi>
                  </note> and to his Favour. But leaſt his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment

he perſwaded the Queen to intereſt her ſelf in that affair,
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:54712:289"/>
and beg it of the King, that he ſo might rather ſeem to
have condeſcended to her intreaty, than to the neceſſity
impoſed upon him by his brother. She fearing to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige
the <hi>Infante,</hi> or thwart his deſigns, would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle
in it, till by a meſſenger ſent to him ſhe had
his direction how to proceed. Nor was ſhe ſatisfyed
with one meſſage, but ſent again for more particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
ſo great was her concern for him, and ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
for her husband. Being now fully informed of his
will, ſhe concludes the buſineſs with the King and Count,
who ſubmitted to withdraw himſelf upon faith given for
the ſafety of his perſon. But before he departed, he
would have articled that the <hi>Infante</hi> upon his removal,
ſhould clear him from the imputation of the deſign of
poiſoning him. Whether his conſcience accuſed him of
any ſuch practice, or whether he feared, being once caſt
down, his innocence could not protect him againſt the
malice of his Enemies is uncertain. Thus the Count
being aſſaulted on all fides by the <hi>Infante,</hi> by the Queen,
by the Nobility, and by the multitude, and not able to
ſtand the ſhock of ſo many Enemies, at length withdrew
from the Court,<note place="margin">The Count withdraws.</note> and lodged himſelf in a Monaſtery
about Seven Leagues from the City. But as his expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was not the End, but rather the means to compaſs
the deſigns then carryed on, ſo the diviſions and diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions
at Court inſtead of ceaſing, increaſed, for as long as
the ambition of the <hi>Infante,</hi> and the King's neglect of the
Government laſted, only the pretence but not the cauſe
of theſe troubles was removed.</p>
               <p>Nothing could be more grievous to the King,<note place="margin">The King in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity.</note> than
to conſider, that upon all occaſions his brother being back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the multitude extorted from him, whatever he
deſired, which made it plain to him, that at laſt he
would not forbear to aim at, or fail of wreſting from
him the Crown. His violent nature made him more
open, when he ſhould have been moſt circumſpect, and
therefore his thoughts being filled with the hatred his
Brother bore him, the jealouſy he had of his Wife, the
perfidiouſneſs of the People, and the diſloyalty of the
Nobility; he could not forbear inveighing againſt his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in publick, and even before the Queen, who he
knew gave the <hi>Infante</hi> a particular account of all his
words and Actions. In this perplexity, he cauſed the
extraordinary companies that had been raiſed by Count
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:54712:290"/>
                  <hi>Caſtelmelhor,</hi> to be filled up for the ſecurity of the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.<note place="margin">The Infante reſolves to proceed.</note>
On the other ſide the <hi>Infante</hi> fluſhed with ſucceſs,
reſolved wholly to root out all that was left of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
party about the King, for tho' the Count him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was removed, yet his creatures remained at Court,
and nothing of moment was Tranſacted without his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
had by meſſengers betwixt them. Before the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi>
could put his deſigns in practice, he was adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by the Queen of all the words the King daily let
fall againſt him,<note place="margin">The King betrayed by the Queen.</note> and perhaps of more than ever had been
ſpoken. This intelligence cauſed him to haſten the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of his projects. The principal men at that time
remaining near the King of Count <hi>Caſtelmelhor</hi>'s facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were <hi>Henry Enriquez de Miranda, Emanuel Antunez,</hi>
and <hi>Antony de Souſa de Macedo</hi> the Secretary of State.
Of theſe the chiefeſt was <hi>Miranda</hi> whom therefore the
<hi>Infante</hi> reſolved firſt to deſtroy, and to that end ſent ſome
privately to warn him to depart the Court, before he
run himſelf into greater danger. Deſpair ſo ſeized the
unfortunate man, conſidering the expulſion of the Count,
that he attempted to kill himſelf, but being prevented,
he fled fearing to be torn in pieces by the Rabble. Count
<hi>Caſtelmelhor</hi> having received information hereof, inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
adviſed the King to be circumſpect in all his words
and Actions, for that it was eaſier by fair means to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
his Brother, than by open Force. His advice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
approved by the King, upon the next occaſion that
offered, he ſummoned his Brother to appear in Council
where ſome important matter was to be debated, but no
kind meſſages or Letters were of any Force to move him
to come, till the Queen ſent for him, when he appeared
with a great Train of followers, and full of diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The King received him not ſo coldly as before,
but being no Maſter of the Art of Counterfeiting, could
not ſo well hide his juſt diſpleaſure as the other. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this feigned reconciliation might have produced ſome
good Effects,<note place="margin">The King makes choice of <hi>Antony de Souſa de Macedo</hi> in the place of the Count.</note> had it not been decreed by fate that the
unhappy King muſt periſh. To haſten his ruin it fell
out that <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who was not uſed to that continual
burden of buſineſs, ſeeking on whom he might lay that
weight, pitched upon <hi>Antony de Souza de Macedo</hi> one of
the Counts creatures, who for ſome words ſpoken to the
Queen had been ordered into baniſhment, but unknown
to her lay concealed at Court. In order to raiſe him to
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:54712:290"/>
the Honour of prime Miniſter, the King begged of the
Queen that ſhe would forgive his offence, and conſent
that his baniſhment ſhould be remitted, but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his repeated inſtances, and ſubmiſſive intreaties ſhe
remained implacable. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> thinking to Conquer her
obſtinacy by extenuating the crime, put into her hands
the order of Council for his baniſhment, wherein it was
expreſly ſet down, that rather for to ſatiſsfy her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than for that his fault deſerved ſuch puniſhment,
they had for ſome days thought fit to ſend him into exile.
This which ſhould have been a motive to appeaſe, ſo
enraged her, that ſhe flew out into many extravagant
ſpeeches unbeſeeming a private woman, and much more
a Queen,<note place="margin">The Queen<hi>'s</hi> undecent behaviour towards the King.</note> and after venting her fury in this undecent
manner without any regard to the King's preſence, ſhe
flung into another Room, whence ſhe ſent a billet to him
demanding to have <hi>Antony de Souza</hi> ſeverely puniſhed.
The King hoping her paſſion would fall by degrees, and
that ſhe might be brought to reaſon, ſhewed not her billet
according to cuſtom to the Council of State, but ſhe
on the contrary becomming dayly more intractable, and
he not able long to hide his reſentment, their animoſities
ſwelled to ſuch a pitch that the Court was almoſt emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
all men ſhunning him as declining, and ſhe admitting
none to her preſence being wholly Tranſported with the
deſire of Revenge. Mean while <hi>Antony de Souza</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
more openly in the pallace than he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
being always well attended to prevent danger,
But there wanted not thoſe who ſoon ſpread it among the
People, that he threatned the City in caſe he were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
the Court, that he would repair to the Army with
the which he would return to puniſh their Rebellion
with fire and Sword. Many ſuch like diſcourſes were
framed and given out on purpoſe to incenſe the People
againſt the King, and fix their affections upon his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as their deliverer from Tyranny and oppreſſion.
Things being thus diſpoſed the <hi>Infante</hi> to requite the
Queens Favours and raiſe himſelf one ſtep nearer to the
Crown, reſolved by open Force, if other means failed,
to expel <hi>Antony de Souſa</hi> from the Court. In order hereto
on the 5th of <hi>October,</hi> 1667, he went from his Houſe to
the Pallace accompanyed by a great Number of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,<note place="margin">The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi> heads the Rabble.</note>
and all the Rabble of the City following in a
moſt Tumultuous manner. Being come to the Pallace,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:54712:291"/>
he ſtayed till all the Councellors of State ſummoned by
him the day before, were come, that the foulneſs of the
Action might be ſomewhat diſguized by their preſence.
They being all come, he enters with them the King's Bed-Chamber
before he was awake, who was not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
to ſee ſuch a croud Ruſh in upon him at ſo unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
an hour. Then the <hi>Infante,</hi> told him, that his
Crown and Perſon were in extream danger, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
being in Arms about the Pallace, demanding, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony
de Souza</hi> ſhould be delivered to them, to receive
condign punniſhment for the affront he had done to the
Queen. To theſe words he added more threats in the
name of the People, but as he would have run on, the
King in a rage interrupted him, calling aloud for his
Sword. The <hi>Infante</hi> according to his uſual diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
calmly offered him his, which he would not accept.
The Noiſe of the Multitude filling the Pallace, brought
the Queen to the King's apartment, where ſhe found
him in a violent paſſion, and enquiring, as if ſhe had
not known, what the matter was, he told her that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony
de Souza</hi> in malice and deſpight to his Authority
had been murdered, and that now they came in Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
manner to force him to pardon the murderers.
But ſhe who knew better, replyed that <hi>Souza</hi> was living,
which the King would not believe till the Duke of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daval</hi>
having dragged him from his lurking place, brought
him into his preſence. At his ſight he was ſomewhat
appeaſed, and then the Queen, <hi>Infante,</hi> and the reſt of
their followers left him abruptly. When they were
gone, the King ſaid he forgave them, who had ſo unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
urged the expulſion of <hi>Antony de Souza,</hi> to which
the Count <hi>de Sabugal</hi> then preſent inſolently anſwered,
they ſtood not in need of pardon but deſerved praiſe,
and this he repeated till the King told him, he would
beſtow pardon and praiſe where each was requiſite. So
much is regal Authority depreſſed, when faction pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails.
<hi>Antony de Souza,</hi> this Tumult being over, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
ſtill in the Pallace, which the <hi>Infante</hi> obſerving,
conſulted with his Friends what was next to be done.
One among them hotter than the reſt, ſaid the next thing
was to aſſume the Crown, whilſt the Peoples affection
ſtood for him, but he took him up very ſhort, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
as yet to have the ſecrets of his heart pryed into,
as fearing an Action done in that Tumultuous manner
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:54712:291"/>
could not be durable.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Antony</hi> de <hi>Souſa,</hi> and <hi>Emanuel Antunes</hi> the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Friends of the King forced to fly.</note> It was reſolved that <hi>Antony de
Souza</hi> and <hi>Emanuel Antunes</hi> ſhould be threatned with
death, unleſs they departed the Pallace. They percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no power was left in the King, or their friends
to protect them, ſtole away privately, without the
King's knowledge by Night.</p>
               <p>Next Morning the King miſſing them, ordered ſearch
to be made for them,<note place="margin">The <hi>King</hi> abandoned by all Men.</note> but in vain, for his orders were
wholly neglected. In this Condition, finding himſelf
forſaken by his Friends, and oppreſſed by his Enemies,
he knew not which way to turn himſelf, or of whom to
ask Advice. His Council ſided with the <hi>Infante,</hi> his
Queen favoured him, the People followed, and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
adhered to him. Thus all things being in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Confuſion, even the moderate party began to think
no way was left to ſettle Peace, and reſtore Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but the aſſembling of the <hi>Cortes</hi> or Parliament. The
Magiſtrates of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and the Common Council, were
the firſt that petitioned the King to ſummon the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
but he being ſenſible, the only deſign was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
him, put them off from day to day, without any
poſitive Anſwer: Whereupon they took the boldneſs to
write to all the principal Towns of the Kingdom, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
them by importunate petitioning to extort the
King's Conſent. A few days after, the Council of State,
at which were preſent, the King, Queen and <hi>Infante,</hi>
unanimouſly made their Application to him, to the ſame
effect, but he being the more convinced it was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
lay'd againſt his Perſon, became the more obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in refuſing, ſo that nothing was done for that day.
But the next day the Council meeting again, and ſending
him a moſt audacious remonſtrance full of invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Conduct, and urging the neceſſity of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the three Eſtates; and beſides not only the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
and multitude of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> but generally of the
whole Country preſſing upon him with Threats and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Violence, he was at laſt conſtrained contrary to his
Inclination to comply with their demands: For it was
now come to that paſs, that the Council did not adviſe
but command him, whereſoever he went, the clamours
of a Parliament followed him, and from all parts Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were brought, urging the ſame thing. It was now
equally dangerous to him to refuſe, or to call the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
for the intent was not to do juſtice, by calling

them,<note place="margin">The King forced by his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to call the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the States.</note> but to palliate diſloyal practices under that Name.
Not content to have extorted a complyance to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the States, though the King deſired it might be
delayed till his return from <hi>Salvaterra,</hi> which would be
about the middle of <hi>February,</hi> they obliged him to ſend
out the Writs of Summons, for the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> 1668,

before Hand to ſeparate her ſelf from him. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
on the 21ſt. of <hi>November,</hi> 1667. ſhe retired to
the Monaſtery of <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Nuns, called <hi>Eſperanca,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which, when ſhe was entred, ſhe gave out ſhe was a
Maid, as being untouched by the King, and that ſhe
came thither for refuge amidſt thoſe Confuſions
that embroiled the Kingdom. Preſently after, ſhe ſent
the King a Billet, writ with her own Hand, to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<hi>That ſhe had left her Country and Friends, to become
his Wife, but finding ſhe was not acceptable to him, and
fearing the dangers that threatned on all ſides, ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to return into</hi> France. <hi>That ſhe deſired his leave,
and the reſtitution of her Dower, ſince the Marriage was
void for want of Conſummation.</hi> Having read this Billet,
the King was ſo enraged, that he immediately took
Coach, with a reſolution to force her from the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery;
but the <hi>Infante</hi> who was privy to the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
was there before him with a vaſt Company, and
withſtood him, ſo that he was forced to return without
doing any thing. Amidſt all his Misfortunes, and the
Affronts put upon him, nothing ſo nearly touched <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi>
as this laſt offered him by the Queen. As ſoon as
ſetled, ſhe ſent for the <hi>Infante</hi> and conferred with him in
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:54712:292"/>
private, as was then given out about her return into <hi>France,</hi>
but the more received Opinion, and approved by the
Event, was that there they agreed to be Marryed; as
ſoon as her Marriage with the King could be made void.
Her next Care was to ſend to the Chapter of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
Church of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to deſire their Judgment for
the diſſolution of the Marriage, then ſhe ſent for all the
Nobility, who being come into her Preſence, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
their Aſſiſtance and Protection; and laſtly, ſhe
ſent an Expreſs into <hi>France,</hi> to acquaint the King and
her Kindred with what ſhe had done.</p>
               <p>Mean while King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> overwhelmed with ſuch
a continual ſtream of diſaſters, following one upon the
Neck of another, being inſulted by the Commonalty,
contemned by the Nobility, deluded by his Brother,
and forſaken by his Wife, ſtood as one amazed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſtupified, not knowing what courſe to take. Nor
was there any left to extricate himſelf out of this Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
of Confuſions and Miſeries. But now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the laſt act of this Tragedy, and all that had been
before acted under a mask, muſt appear bare-fac'd to
the World. Therefore the Council of State being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
together with the Magiſtrates of the City, it
was reſolved the King ſhould be layed aſide, and the
Government put into the hands of his Brother. Yet
that the Action might appear the more juſtifiable, they
agreed to endeavour to perſwade the King to reſign up
the Government to his Brother, but in caſe he refus'd,
then it was concluded he ſhould not only be depoſed,
but impriſoned. However that it ſhould be left to the
determination of the Parliament, whether the <hi>Infante</hi>
ſhould be enthroned as King, or the King reſtored to his
Liberty. This Decree being paſſed in the morning by

Then the Marqueſs of <hi>Caſcaes,</hi> with a loud Voice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted
the King in theſe very Words, without the leaſt
reſpect or common Civility. <hi>Thou lyeſt wallowing in
Sloath and Pleaſures, when the ruin of the Kingdom threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:54712:293"/>

unfit to Rule, or get Children, paſs from thy Self willingly
that Burthen, which thou art not able to bear, to thy Brother</hi>
Peter, <hi>leaſt the Kingdom be deprived of a King, and the
Royal Family of an Heir, and leaſt thou be forced to that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thy Will, which thou wilt not freely conſent to.</hi> The
reſt of the Council ſpoke to the ſame effect, though not
altogether in ſuch audacious Language. The King, tho'
ſurprized at ſo trayterous a Propoſition, anſwered, That
he was a lawful King, and brought to that paſs, by the
Malice and Perfidiouſneſs of his Enemies;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Alphonſo</hi> reſolutely denies to reſign the Crown.</note> but that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
no Fear or Danger ſhould force him to reſign the
Crown as long as he had Breath to draw; yet if they
would uſe Violence to him, that then he would appeal
for Juſtice to the ſupream Tribunal, which is above all
Kings, againſt thoſe that violated his Authority, and
wrongfully ſnatched his Crown. Being thus diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of their firſt attempt, the Council repaired to the
<hi>Infante,</hi> where they protracted their Debates till late at
Night, for being reſolved to uſe force, they feared leaſt
the People, who before took their part againſt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
ſhould be of another Mind, when the matter
came to touch the King's Perſon. However, after much
time ſpent in fruitleſs projects, they came to this Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That the King ſhould be forcibly depoſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
that for the better palliating that odious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and involving the People as a party in it, the <hi>Infante</hi>
himſelf accompanyed by all the Nobility and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
ſhould put it in Execution, that the King's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
ſhould be at firſt concealed, till by ſpreading
abroad ſeveral rumours, the People were prepared to

to the end, it might be thought, the King had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
given up the Government to his Brother. All
things being thus diſpoſed, at break of day the <hi>Infante</hi>
repairs to the Palace, attended by an infinite multitude.
There he ſet a Guard upon the King, and having lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the Doors that led to his Apartment, he ſent <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony
Cavide</hi> to notifie to him, that by the general conſent
of the Kingdom he was deprived of the Government
and his Liberty, and alſo by the moſt terrible Threats
to extort from him the ſigning of the Inſtrument of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
prepared for him. The unfortunate King ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:54712:293"/>
himſelf wholly in the power of his Enemies, and
fearing the utmoſt effects of their Malice, ſigned the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
which was immediately made publick as a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Treaſonable Practice. It contained in
ſubſtance, that he freely reſigned the Government to his
Brother <hi>Peter</hi> and his Heirs, reſerving only to himſelf
Three Hundred Thouſand Cruzados a Year, with the
Manſion Houſe of the Family of <hi>Braganza.</hi> A Cruzado
is Four Hundred Reis of <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Money, and Three
Thouſand Reis, is juſt Twenty Shillings <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo
that 300000 Cruzados, makes the juſt Sum of 37500 <hi>l.</hi>
Sterling. But how well even this miſerable Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for a Crown was obſerved, may appear by his
being kept ever after a Priſoner, with only a few Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of no Note, ſuch as his Brother thought fit to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him, ſo that in all probability his Expence could
not amount to the tenth part of that Summ.</p>
               <p>The unhappy King being thus dethroned,<note place="margin">The <hi>Cortes</hi> meet.</note> and made

firſt there were great Debates amongſt them, whether it
were at all lawful to take an Oath to <hi>Peter</hi> as Regent,
and next Heir to the Crown, or whether the Crown
ſhould alſo be transferred to him; ſome doubting whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the firſt were juſtifyable, and others more violent,
urging the latter ought to be done. At laſt the Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
agreed to the ſetling the Regency and Succeſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Peter,</hi> but were generally averſe to his uſurping the
ſtyle of King, thinking it enough, that he who was
judged unfit for Government, was removed from the
Helm. <hi>Peter</hi> after having put it to the Vote, whether
he ſhould aſſume the Crown, finding his Pretenſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
endeavoured to have it believed he was averſe
from it. But the Queen who intended to make him her
Husband, and could not endure to think of loſign any
part of her Title,<note place="margin">The Queen preſſes to have <hi>Peter</hi> declared King. He is received as Regent.</note> or abating any thing of her Pride, and
being a Woman, that knew not how to diſſemble her
Vanity, urged the matter more home to the States, who
nevertheleſs decreed, that he ſhould exerciſe all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal

being decided, there aroſe another, which was whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

There had been a League offenſive and defenſive,<note place="margin">1668.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Peace with <hi>Spain.</hi>

the Year 1667, againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> by which the <hi>French</hi>
were obliged to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a powerful diverſion
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which they performed with great Succeſs.
After that ſome Overtures of Peace being made by the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> began readily to give ear to
them, and though the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador preſſed that
the Negotiation might be in common with his Maſter,
as in juſtice according to the League betwixt them, it
ought to have been; yet the Prince who now ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Government, more mindful of the peculiar Intereſt,
which was to ſecure the Power he had newly gotten,

At length the Peace was concluded betwixt the two
Crowns, on the 13th. of <hi>February,</hi> 1668, and publiſhed
10th. of <hi>March</hi> following. This Peace was highly cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up among the Rabble, as an effect of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Prince, when all Men plainly ſaw, and
were ſenſible that in reality the victories obtained by
King <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> were the only motives that obliged the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> to propoſe it, and that the Overtures had been
made while he was yet at the Helm, which muſt have
had as good a ſucceſs, had he remained time enough in
the Throne to bring things to Perfection, and perhaps
he might have done it without the diſhonour of abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>On the 13th. of <hi>February</hi> 1668. the Chapter of the
Cathredal of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with others, they had culled out
all prepared for the deſign, pronounced the Marriage
betwixt King <hi>Alphonſo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the King and Queen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared null.</note> and the Princeſs <hi>Mary Francis
Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> null, and that therefore both of
them were left at Liberty to diſpoſe of themſelves. Then
the three <hi>Eſtates</hi> and Magiſtrates of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> as they
had been before directed, moved the Prince and Princeſs,
that ſince the former Marriage was declared null, they
would conſent to match together, on pretence it was
for the good of the Kingdom. This they were moved
to, in regard they were unwilling to reſtore her Dower,
and the Parties were no leſs ready to conſent to what
themſelves had before contrived and agreed betwixt
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:54712:294"/>
themſelves. However tho' there had been care taken
for the diſanulling the former marriage by ſuch perſons
as were wholly in the intereſt of the cauſe, there was
yet ſtarted a ſcruple, that it was not Lawful to proceed
to a new match, eſpecially with the Brother of the
former husband without a diſpenſion. But the Prince,
though pretending only to comply with the <hi>Cortes</hi>
had not been negligent in that Affair, for not
long after the Publication of the nullity, arrived in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>
the diſpenſation from the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Vendoſme</hi>
the <hi>Popes</hi> Legate a <hi>Latere</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> by which it appears
the diſpenſation was granted by one that was a party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed
in the Affair, and precedent to the ſentence of
nullity.<note place="margin">The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Queen.</note> Upon theſe grounds they made no difficulty to

of the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> on the 2d
of <hi>April</hi> 1668. After the marriage, freſh inſtances were
made that the Prince might be declared King by the
<hi>Cortes,</hi> but this attempt alſo proving ineffectual, he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed
to them that on the 9th of <hi>June</hi> following, he
would take his Oath to maintain the Laws of the Realm,
and receive from them theirs of fidelity, which was
accordingly performed. The three Eſtates continued
their Seſſion after this till the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1668,
when they broke up. Several months being paſſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the conſummation of this marriage, when the thing
done was not to be retrieved without horrid ſcandal,
and embroiling the whole State of the Church, then at
laſt the Prince bethought himſelf of ſending to the <hi>Pope</hi>
to confirm the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s diſpenſation. <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the

This Brief was dated <hi>December</hi> the 10th. 1668.
Theſe perſons ſo authoriſed accordingly in the <hi>Popes</hi>
name, delared the marriage of King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> null, that
of his Queen with the Prince to be good and valid, and
all the Children that were, or ſhould be gotten between

               <p>When the unfortunate King had been detained a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
time Priſoner in the Pallace of <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1669.</note> it was
thought neceſſary to remove him,<note place="margin">King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi> ſent priſoner to the Iſland <hi>Tercera.</hi>
                  </note> leaſt the People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to themſelves and commiſerating the ſufferings of
their Sovereign, ſhould make ſome commotion that might
endanger the preſent government. It was therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſend him into the Iſland <hi>Terecera,</hi> whether he
was conveyed by the Count <hi>de Prado,</hi> then Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Fleet, and there continued ſeveral
years under a ſtrict Guard. At length not only the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> but throughout all <hi>Portugal</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by thoſe who came from that Iſland, that he led a
moſt miſerable Life in that remote Iſland, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
reduced to the laſt extremity through ſufferings and
anguiſh of mind, there was cauſe to apprehend they
would in time be moved to reſent his calamities, and
perhaps be ſtirred up to revenge them upon thoſe who
were the cauſe thereof. Beſides it fell out that the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> at the ſame time fitted out a Navy at <hi>Cadiz</hi>
without declaring for what intent, which being known
at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> thoſe who dreaded the Return of the King,
as having been the promoters of his Ruin, preſently ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
it was to take him from his baniſhment. For
theſe reaſons he was ſent for with all poſſible ſpeed,
and brought back into <hi>Portugal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He is brought back and confined to the Caſtle of <hi>Cintra.</hi>
                  </note> where he was lodged
in the Caſtle of <hi>Cintra</hi> upon the Sea Coaſt not far from
<hi>Lisbon.</hi> In this place he was not only obſerved and
Guarded, but as cloſely confined as if he had been a
common Malefactor, the very Windows of his lodgings
being made up, ſo that he could not look out, but that
what Light he had, came from above his height. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his uſage in that place I received from Dr. <hi>Reis</hi>
a Phiſitian at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> whoſe Son was Phiſitian to the
King, and who had ſeveral times the opportunity of
ſeing him, being ſent for by his ſaid Son to aſſiſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
when indiſpoſed, for ſcarce any body elſe was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to ſee him. In this deplorable condition the
wretched King continued till his death.</p>
               <p>But before we give an account of his End, it will
be fit to ſet down thoſe few matters of moment that
preceded it. And indeed there are but few things that
can furniſh matter for Hiſtory. <hi>Portugal</hi> ever ſince the
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:54712:295"/>
concluſion of the Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> having been inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in no War, nor furniſhed any other important ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to treat of. Warlike Kings, and turbulent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are the propereſt for ſwelling of Hiſtories, the
great accidents and Councels then occurring giving great
variety to dilate upon; but in a peaceable and quiet
State, there is little to be found more then the ſettled
and regular proceedings which being always in a manner
the ſame, are not worth the writing becauſe they neither
delight nor inſtruct in the reading. Some few things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
which being of no mighty conſequence ſhall
briefly be ſet down, that we may at length put an End
to this Hiſtory. The new Prince regent, as has been
ſaid,<note place="margin">Birth of the <hi>Infante</hi> Mary <hi>Frances.</hi>
                  </note> was Marryed to his brothers Wife, <hi>Mary Frances
Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> on the 2d. of <hi>April.</hi> By her he had
before the End of the ſame year a daughter named <hi>Mary
Frances,</hi> the only fruit of that ſurprizing marriage. And
tho' at firſt it was looked upon, as a great token that
God approved of their proceedings by giving them iſſue
ſo ſuddenly, yet afterwards thoſe very perſons who cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up this providence, could not but be undeceived
when they perceived, that theſe Princes living together
about 16 years never had any other Child, and even
ſhe dyed without being marryed. All things having
ſucceeded proſperouſly to that Prince, as he that had
eſtabliſhed himſelf in the government, ſecured his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
gained his Wife, and now got a Daughter, his
only care was how to continue in amity with all the
World, that ſo he might firmly Eſtabliſh his new at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
power. He preſerved Peace both at home, and
abroad in ſuch Tranquility, that for ſeveral years there
will remain nothing elſe memorable of him to poſterity.
In the Year 1677,<note place="margin">1677.</note> the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> of the continent of
<hi>Brazil</hi> in <hi>America</hi> ſeeeking to extend their borders,<note place="margin">

reached to the great River called <hi>de la Plata,</hi> paſſed over
the ſaid River and Planted a Colony at <hi>Buenos Aires,</hi>
which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> looking upon as an incroachment
upon them, they gathered to a body in thoſe parts, and
falling upon the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Planters, put them all to the
Sword. Advice hereof being brought into <hi>Portugal,</hi> the
Prince Regent expreſſed his reſentment by his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
at the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> demanding Reparation of
dammages. The thing was long in debate, both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
arguing for their Right to the place and protracting
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:54712:296"/>
time. At length the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> weary of delay began
to let fall ſome threats of a War, but with ſo little prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to it, that the Effects were not to be feared. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

only Daughter to the Prince, being now almoſt
marriagable, and her Father deſpairing of having any
more Iſſue by his Wife, he thought of diſpoſing of her,
and having caſt about to all parts for a fit match, at laſt
pitched upon the preſent Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> then a youth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

And to remove the only obſtacle which was the Law of
<hi>Lamego,</hi> whereby it is enacted, that the heireſs of the
Crown Marrying a Forreigner, ſhe ſhall forfeit her Title,
to provide I ſay againſt the obſtacle of this Law, the

Year. There they paſſed an Act for diſpenſing with the
ſaid Law for that time, provided it ſhould not be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
for any other. This impediment being taken
away, there ſeemed to remain nothing to obſtruct the
happy concluſion of the Nuptials but the diſtance of the
Parties. the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who according to contract
was to come into <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſent before over Land a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Number of Coach and ſaddle Horſes. On the
other ſide the Prince Regent fitted out a ſquadron of
12 men of War, to Conduct the Duke to <hi>Lisbon.</hi> All
the Ships were gilt and painted, but above, all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
was gilt from ſtem to ſtern, the poop and prow
down to the ſurface of the Water, and the ſides down
to the gunwale. The great Cabin was painted by the
beſt Maſters in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and the floor layed in ſquares of
<hi>Ebony</hi> and <hi>Ivory.</hi> The Bed was moſt Rich, and the
Royal-Standard all of Cloath of tiſſue, with the
arms of <hi>Portugal</hi> in the higheſt raiſed Embroidery. <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi>
Seamen being at that time ſcarce, eſpecially able
ones, great encouragement was given to all ſtrangers
that would enter into the Service. When all things
were prepared, this ſightly Squadron ſet Sail in the Year
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:54712:296"/>

expecting there to take the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> on board.<note place="margin">The Match broke off.</note>
In the mean time all things were preparing at <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
with the greateſt ſplendor imaginable for his reception.
Triumphal Arches were built, extraordinary bull Feaſts
contrived, and all the Gentry ſtrove to outvie one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(even to the ruin of their Eſtates and empoveriſhing
their Families) in Gallantry. Yet all theſe mighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
were caſt away, for when it was thought the
Duke would have gone aboard the Fleet, he at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to delay and protract time, and after deluding them
in this ſort as long as he could, he at laſt poſitively

averſe to it, and that with good cauſe, as being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to part with their Soveraign without hope of ever
ſeeing him again, as going to leave them for a Crown;
and then if he ſhould return, it muſt be with diſhonour,
as being diſappointed of the End for which he left them.
Theſe conſiderations had at laſt prevailed upon his
Mother, his Council, and himſelf, to alter their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſo that tho' the Articles of the marriage had been
ratified on both ſides, and ſo great an expence made
towards the comſummating of it, all that had been
done was diſſolved and came to nothing. The Fleet
returned to <hi>Lisbon</hi> with ſmall ſatisfaction, and found
as little there either at the Court for the affront put
upon it, or in the City for the extravagant and uſeleſs
expence it had been put to. This was the End of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned

               <p>The year 1683, put an End to the long ſufferings of

                  </note>
He dyed on the 12th of <hi>December,</hi> at the Caſtle of <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi>
in the Fortieth year of his Age, and 16th of his
impriſonment. It is impoſſible to give a juſt character
of him, fear of offending the prevailing party having
ſtopt the mouths of his Loyal Servants and Friends,
who beſt knew and would ſpeak honourably of him,
and there being no credit to be given to the ſlanders of
his adverſaries, whoſe chief care it ever was to reproach
his perſon, and blacken his Actions. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
is the greateſt of calamities Kings are ſubject to,
that their misfortunes do not terminate with their Lives,
for never Prince was yet dethroned tho' never ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly,
but his memory was alſo rendred odious to
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:54712:297"/>
proſperity, by all the Arts that malice could invent,
becauſe prevailing wrong could not ſubſiſt but under the
colour of Right, and to defame juſtice oppreſſed, is to
flatter and ſupport iniquity Reigning. To ſay King
<hi>Alphonſo</hi> had no vices, were to ſay he was not man, yet
to make them ſo enormous, as ſome would have them
believed, were only to vouch for malice, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
diſloyalty. Through the courſe of his Reign, that
is, whilſt he was in power, there appears none of his
actions that have been urged againſt him, tho' aggravated
with the moſt malicious circumſtances, which have not
been ſeen in thouſands of Subjects and yet paſſed unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
either as without the reach of the Law, or excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
as the effects of extravagant Youth. For his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as it could not be expected to be ſo ſolid at his
Years, as in a riper Age, ſo neither can it be found by his
words, or deportment that he was any way defective
therein. And laſtly as to his impotency in regard to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
that, if true, could have been no leſſening of
his perſonal right to government, but it is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
certain, that I have heard ſeveral perſons affirm they
knew his illegitimate iſſue, whoſe mothers if they durſt,
would upon Oath confirm the aſſertion. But there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo certain, as that <hi>Portugal</hi> never was more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
both by Sea and Land than under this government,
for under him were obtained four of the greateſt victories
againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which produced the Peace, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
whereof was aſcribed to his brother, who had done
nothing to purchaſe it. And if any object that thoſe
Triumphs were due to the Generals, we muſt deprive
all King's of the glory of warlike Exploits, who do not
actually Command their Armies in perſon, beſides that
it is no ſmall honour to him that he choſe ſuch Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
as could direct, and ſuch generals as knew how to
act ſo much for his advantage. And as for the maritine
affairs greater Fleets came home yearly from <hi>India</hi> and
<hi>Brazil,</hi> and far leſſer loſſes were ſuſtained by Ship-wrack
during his Reign than in many years after. This may
ſuffice in ſome meaſure to do right to the memory of this
unhappy Prince. Yet it may not be ungrateful to add
one word more, touching certain words reported to have
been ſpoken of him juſt before his death. The cloſeneſs
of his confinement, and the danger of reporting his words
abroad by thoſe who heard them, is the cauſe that we
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:54712:297"/>
cannot be ſo poſitive in this particular therefore I do not
avouch it for a certain known truth, but as a rumour whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
about where People durſt ſpeake. It is ſaid of him
that when he was in the laſt agony, and as it were brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
his laſt, he ſhould ſay, <hi>I am now going, but it will
not be long before the Queen ſhall follow me, to give
an account before the dreadful tribunal of the wrong
ſhe has done me.</hi> As I do not averr this for a certainty,
ſo it is very obſervable the ſaid Queen outlived him but
a very ſhort time,<note place="margin">The Queens death.</note> that is, only three months and a few
days. Her death was on the 27th of <hi>December,</hi> of the
ſame year 1683, and ſince there is little to be ſaid in her
commendation, it will be better to be altogether ſilent
than to make reflections upon the dead.</p>

<hi>Aurenge Zeb,</hi> with the danger they were in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Account, praying Relief. He preſently comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his ſecond Son to march with an Army of 100000
Foot, and 80000 Horſe, and a great Train of Artillery
to their Succour. Upon the approach of this mighty
Army,<note place="margin">The ſiege. raiſed.</note> the <hi>Raja</hi> raiſed his Siege and departed, in his
way deſtroying all the Country about <hi>Goa.</hi> The Siege
being raiſed, the young Prince ſent to aſſure the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes,</hi>
that his Father would be always ready to aſſiſt
them againſt their Enemies. They in return, ſent a
ſolemn Ambaſſy to the <hi>Mogul,</hi> by whom a ſetled Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
was eſtabliſhed with that great Monarch. The
King having long continued a Widdower, and having
no Iſſue, but only one Daughter, was earneſtly preſſed
by his Subjects to Marry to ſecure the Succeſſion.
Hereupon, by the advice of his Council, he reſolved to
demand in Marriage one of the Daughters of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
<hi>Palatine,</hi> and accordingly in the Month of <hi>October</hi>
1686, he named the Count <hi>de Villar Mayor,</hi> his
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:54712:298"/>
Ambaſſador Extraordinary to that Elector upon this
occaſion, who ſet forward in <hi>December</hi> following, for
<hi>Heydelberg,</hi> where he arrived in the beginning of the
Year 1687, with a very ſplendid Retinue. In <hi>June</hi> he
made his publick Entry, which was extraordinary mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent,
and the next day after he had Audience, in
which he demanded of the Elector, his Daughter, the
Princeſs <hi>Mary Sophia</hi> in Marriage, for the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
At the ſame time, in complyance to the Requeſt
of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> a Squadron of Men of War
was fitted out in <hi>England,</hi> and ſailed under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Duke of <hi>Grafton</hi> to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> there to
take aboard the new Queen, and conduct her to <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
On the 8th. of <hi>July,</hi> the Ceremony of the Marriage was
performed at <hi>Heydelberg,</hi> on the 10th. the Queen ſet out
on her Journey towards <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> on the 27th. ſhe
went aboard the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Squadron,<note place="margin">1687.</note> at the <hi>Briel,</hi> and on
the 11th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>

                  </note> arrived in the River of <hi>Lisbon.</hi> That
ſame day the King went aboard to receive the Queen,
and conducted her aſhore, where the Marriage was
conſummated the ſame Night. The exact Neutrality
which <hi>Portugal</hi> has obſerved during the late Wars, which
have harraſſed and exhauſted the greateſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi>
is the cauſe there is nothing worthy our Obſervation to
add relating to that Kingdom. Only this may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that as the War has improveriſhed other States,
ſo they by continuing in Peace, have vaſtly enriched
themſelves, and ſo improved their Maritime Strength,
that they have at this Preſent, near 100 Sea-Men, for
one they had 20 Years ago, for now they Trade in
their own Veſſels to all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> whereas at that
time, all their Commodities were tranſported upon For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Bottoms. And moreover their own particular
Trade to their Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> and to <hi>India</hi> is
vaſtly augmented. Such are the Fruits of Peace, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when other Nations ſink under the Calamities of
War. To conclude, there remains nothing more, but
to ſet down the Royal Iſſue of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Preſent
King <hi>Peter</hi> II. on the 11th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1687. as was
ſaid before, marryed <hi>Mary Sophia,</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Newburg.</hi>
He had iſſue by her, firſt <hi>John,</hi> born in 1689, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
