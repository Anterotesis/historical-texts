            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving been blaſted with the whirlwind of this late, unnaturall and civill Engliſh war, ſeeing the Storm more likely to encreaſe then to calm, I recollected my former Journall and Manuall notes of my Travails by Land and Sea forty years ſince in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, France, Germany, Poland,</hi> and <hi>Belgia,</hi> and finding <hi>Omne ſolum forti patria, ut piſcibus aequor;</hi> I peruſed all the books of any Engliſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and by often conferences of the traders and reſident planters, of the preſent ſtate, condition, numbers, enemies, bad neighbours, aire, health govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fortification and ſaftety, religion, quietneſſe, profit, and returns, ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for ſupplie and vent of the growing commodities; I conferred with my fellow patients, 7 Knights and Gentlemen, my kindred and neighbours, and reporting the true ſtate of all our Colonies; and whiles thus muſing I ſtood at a maze unreſolved, the ſtorm grew far more tempeſtuous with thunder and lightning, black and terrible guſts, and ſpouts, that made the rivers riſe, and my friends to hide: for the roaring Cannon beat down their wals and houſes, the Muſqueteers, Dragoons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Piſtold horſemen ſwept all Cattell and their goods afore them; the Pikemen in their incloſures and retreats, left them no beds, pots or pans; their ſilver plate was turned into earthen diſhes: New names, and terms, like an unknown language, and like to ſtrange people unheard of in all the Globe as far as our Antipodes, called Cavalleers, Presbyters, Independents, Roundheads, and Malignants, like the Gothes, Huns,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97730:3"/>
and Vandalls, and Alans, that invaded and conquered <hi>Italy, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> and like the Saxons, Jutes, and Angles, that conquered <hi>Britanny.</hi> Theſe having plundered, and put upon us new Laws and Ordinances, called Contribution, Exciſe, Quartering, and Sequeſtrations, my friends were now and rightly by Gods Providence made light, and not troubled or incumbred with much ſtuffe to travel with, nor Farms, Tenements, or Copyholds, and for our ſins our pride abated, our hearts humbled: our afflictions made us pray heartily, and call to God to direct us to infuſe contrition and true ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and purpoſe of amendment to follow his calling. Wee found this ſtorm and heavy judgement had likewiſe afflicted <hi>Scotland, Ireland, Man, Jarſey,</hi> and <hi>Garaſey</hi> Iſles. Then peruſing my old evidences, I found my Aunceſtor Sir <hi>Richard Plantagenes</hi> had Chawton, Blendworth, Clanfield, and Catrington in Hampſhire. But in thoſe Civil-wars in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth time, much like theſe or that of the Guelfs and Gibellines in <hi>Italy,</hi> all was loſt. I reſolved to be a Newter in this quarrell, not to kill Engliſh men and Chriſtians, but with Chriſt to fly into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and like the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to fly out of one City into another, and get out of the fire: At laſt my ſeven Knights and Gentlemen imployed me the oldeſt and boldeſt Traveller to ſee all Engliſh Plantations, by warrant to buy land in the healthieſt and beſt for us eight, and for a hundred ſervants, and twenty of our old tenants and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. But in my private inſtructions, I was on a full and deliberate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell directed to follow old <hi>Catoes</hi> rules in ſeating of the Romane Colonies, begun to be ſeated to ſave charge of Garriſons in new Conqueſts. Firſt, to ſeat in a healthy pure aire: elſe after all the hazzard, charge and building paſt, their people die, and their poſterity extinguiſh, and their children inherit ficknes &amp; weakneſſe. Secondly, to ſit down in a freſh navigable river for trade and ſupply, where there was ſtone neer to build, and not to build on wood ſubject to firing of enemies, negligence of ſervants, or treachery of ſlaves and apprentices; for this reaſon I on my view of <hi>Virginia,</hi> diſliked <hi>Virginia,</hi> moſt of it being ſeated ſcatteringly in wooden clove board houſes, where many by fire were undone, and by two maſſacres in an inſtant fired, without any forts there, or retreats of ſafety in time of danger, and ſeated amongſt Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marches and Creeks, where thrice worſe then Eſſex, and Tenet, and Kent for agues and diſeaſes, brackiſh water to drink and uſe; and a flat Country, and ſtanding waters in woods bred a double corrupt air, ſo the elements corrupted, no wonder as the old <hi>Virginians</hi> affirm, the ſickneſſe there the firſt thirty years to have killed 100000 men. And then generally five of ſix imported died, and now in <hi>Iune, Iuly</hi> and <hi>Auguſt</hi> chiefly, one in nine die imported, abſent a year and returning: though much land more now is cleared and victuall and cattell mendeth the diet. Thirdly, <hi>Catoes</hi> and the third Romane rule was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97730:3"/>
to ſeat in rich land ſo that the richneſſe of the place and neerneſſe of husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry may continue the Colony with plenty and ſafety: this alſo <hi>Virginia</hi> for the moſt part wanteth, they living in ſalts, and moſt of their lands after two crops is a light hot earth, which kils barley with the hot ground and Sun in <hi>May.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus inſtructed I viewed <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and Saint <hi>Chriſtophers, Bermudoes, New England,</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> and <hi>Maryland;</hi> Saint <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> I finde worne out, two parts full of French aliens ſubject to blaſt it, and winds blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away Cotten, wanting victuals, and no ſtore of land; <hi>Barbadoes</hi> hath ſome rich men, having Sugar mils, Indico, Ginger, Suckets of Oranges and Lemmons, and bad Tobacco; but their uſuall bread is of Caſſada roots, whoſe juice is poyſon, ſo the negligence of a ſervant or ſlave in the right making of it may coſt the whole family a poyſoning; the ſervants uſuall food is ſome Peaſe, Potatoes, Roots, and thoſe boyled make their drink called Mobby and Plantana roots; ſome rich have Poultry, and Hogs, and Cows tied up to trees, for there are few Raunges and Incloſures. Theſe two laſt yeares the plague as I am informed killed 10000 brave people, and there are many hundred Rebell Negro flaves in the woods; here was no ſtore of land for our 120 men and their families, here wants the Engliſh mans graſſe, and ſo the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh mans Beef, Mutton, Milk, Butter and Cheeſe, and they want rivers to turn their Sugar mils, ſo that <hi>New England</hi> ſendeth Horſes, and <hi>Virginia</hi> Oxen, to turn them at exceſſive rates, and their keeping is there chargeable, and at <hi>Barbadoes</hi> they buy much Beef and Meal, and Peaſe, and Fiſh from <hi>New England,</hi> and other places, yet this Iſle is full of gallant people, very civill and well governed, and now no fear of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> being ſo popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Then I touched at <hi>Bermudoes,</hi> an Iſle twenty miles long, and two miles over; and in ſome places more guarded with Rocks and Iſles, difficult in acceſſe, full of Figs, Oranges, Lemmons, Pomcitrons, Potatoes, and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, Mays wheat for bread, excellent Fiſh, Tobacco and Peaſe; healthy it is and quiet in government; But this Iſle being but a pretty priſon, was not for my Companies uſe. Thence I ſailed to <hi>New England,</hi> where I found three months ſnow, hard winter, but lean land, in generall all along the Sea coaſt well peopled Towns, the people very thriſty, induſtrious, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; their fiſh carried to <hi>Bilbao,</hi> and Saint <hi>Sebaſtans,</hi> their Pipe-ſtaves to the Iſles and <hi>Spain,</hi> and the corn of the floated river of <hi>Connectacute</hi> is tranſported, and the Beaver trade is their beſt ſubſiſtence. Still hoping for a richer and more temperat ſoile, I went to <hi>Virginia,</hi> paſſing 310 miles along the ſhoars and Iſles of <hi>New Albion,</hi> by <hi>Manhatas</hi> Iſle, by Long Iſle, Cape May, and the two Capes of Deleware Bay, by the leſſer and ſouthermoſt, being by our Sea-mens obſervations juſt in 38 degrees, and 40 minutes, and ſo by

And ſix leagues higher neer a Creek called <hi>Moſilian,</hi> the King having two hundred men. And then we come to the <hi>Fals,</hi> made by a rock of lime-ſtone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I ſuppoſe it is, about ſixty and five leagues from the ſea, near to which is an Iſle fit for a City, all materials there to build; and above, the river fair and navigable, as the Indians inform me, for I went but ten miles higher. I doe account all the Indians to be eight hundred, and are in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall factions and war againſt the <hi>Saſquehannocks,</hi> and are all extream fearfull of a gun, naked and unarmed againſt our ſhot, ſwords, and pikes. I had ſome bickering with ſome of them, and they are of ſo little eſteem, as I durſt with fifteen men ſit down, or trade in deſpight of them, and ſince my return eighteene
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97730:11"/>
Swedes are ſettled there, and ſo ſometime ſixe Dutch doe in a boat trade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of them.</p>
               <p>I ſaw there an infinite quantity of Buſtards, Swans, Geeſe and Fowl, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſhoares as within the like multitude of Pigeons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtore of Turkies, of which I tried one to weigh forty and ſixe pounds. There is much variety and plenty of delicate freſh and ſea-fiſh, and ſhell-fiſh, and Whales or Grampus: Elks, Deere that bring three young at a time and the woods beſtrewed many moneths with Cheſt-nuts, Wall-nuts, Maſt of ſeverall ſorts to feed them, and Hogs, that would increaſe exceedingly. There the barren grounds have four kindes of Grapes and many Mulberries with Aſh, Elms, and the talleſt and greateſt Pines and Pitch-trees that I have ſeen. There are Cedars, Cypreſſe, and Saffafras, with wilde fruits, pears, wilde cherries, pine-apples, and the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Parſemenas. And there is no queſtion but Almonds, and other fruits of <hi>Spain</hi> will proſper, as in <hi>Virginia.</hi> And (which is a good comfort) in four and twenty houres you may ſend or goe by ſea to <hi>New England</hi> or <hi>Virginia,</hi> with a fair winde, you may have cattle, and from the Indians two thouſand barrels of corn, at twelve pence a buſhell in truck, ſo as victuals are there cheaper and better, then to be tranſported: Neither doe I conceive any great need of a Fort or Charge where there is no enemy.</p>
               <p>If my Lord Palatine will bring with him three hundred men or more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is no doubt but that he may doe very well and grow rich, for it is a moſt pure healthfull air, &amp; ſuch pure wholeſome ſprings, rivers, and waters, as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, of a Deſert, as can be ſeen, with ſo many varieties of ſeverall flowers, trees, and foreſts for ſwine. So many fair riſings and proſpects, all green and verdant: and <hi>Maryland</hi> a good friend and neighbour, in four &amp; twenty houres ready to comfort and ſupply.</p>
               <p>And truly I beleeve, my Lord of <hi>Baltamore</hi> wil be glad of my Lord Palatines Plantation and aſſiſtance againſt any enemy or bad neighbour. And if my Lord Palatine employ ſome men to ſow flaxe, hemp and rapes in thoſe rich Mariſhes, or build ſhips and make pipe-ſtaves, and load ſome ſhips with theſe wares, or fiſh from the Northward, he may have any money, ware, or company brought him by his own ſhips, or the ſhips of <hi>Virginia</hi> or <hi>New England</hi> all the year.</p>
               <p>And becauſe your Honour is of the noble houſe of the <hi>Pawlets,</hi> and as I am informed, deſire to lead many of your friends &amp; kindred thither, whom as I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I deſire to ſerve, I ſhall intreat you to beleeve mee as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Gentleman and Chriſtian, I write you nothing but the truth, and hope there to take opportunity in due ſeaſon to viſit you, and doe all the good offices in <hi>Virginia,</hi> my place or friends can ſerve you in.

bounds; but valiant Captain <hi>Freeman</hi> made him no lier, when lately he killed three Indians ſo without badge incroaching. And therfore fair and far off is beſt with Heathen Indians; and fit it is to reduce all their trading to five Ports or Palliſadoed trucking houſes, and to kill all ſtraglers and ſuch ſpies without ranſome. Then ſhall chriſtians and their cattle be ſafe and quiet, and ſeverely putting to death all that ſell the Indians guns arms and ammunition, then Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are ſooner ruled, civilized and ſubjected, as in <hi>New England</hi> is daily ſeen.

Then between the two South Capes there are two petty Kings called <hi>Aquats</hi> and little <hi>Matankin,</hi> having both an hundred Bow-men, and above <hi>Watceſſit</hi> South-weſt, are the black and white <hi>Mincos</hi> neer three hundred men, being ſpeciall friends to <hi>Watceſſit,</hi> and enemies to the <hi>Saſquehannocks.</hi> Now for choice ſeats for Engliſh, <hi>Watceſſit</hi> firſt, where were ſeventy Engliſh, as Maſter <hi>Miles</hi> depoſeth, he ſwearing the officers there to his Majeſties allegiance, and to obedience to your Lordſhip as Governour, being twenty one leagues up <hi>Delaware Bay</hi> in <hi>Charles</hi> river, to which any ſhip may come, and about it <hi>Manteſes</hi> plain, which Maſter <hi>Evelin</hi> avoucheth to be twenty miles broad, and thirty long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 50 miles waſhed by two fair navigable rivers, and is 300000 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres fit to plow and ſow all Corn, Tobacco, and Flaxe, and Rice, the four ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Albion.</hi> The ſecond ſeat is three miles off to <hi>Watceſſit</hi> adjoyning to <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Cotton</hi> river, ſo named of ſix hundred l. of <hi>Cotton wilde</hi> on trees growing: and is called <hi>Ritchneck,</hi> being twenty four miles compaſſe, one wood, huge Timber trees, and two foot black mould, much deſired of the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> to plant Tobacco, they alledging each plant there dried and cured, will bring a pound, whereas wom land five and ſixe to a pound, and theſe large leaves in the new land, and freſhes, ſerve to lap up all the bad S. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophers,</hi> and <hi>Barbadoes</hi> rolled Tobacco, and maketh it fire ſooner: of the three upper leaves they make <hi>Varinas</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> The Dutch give for this double price, and the Engliſh double for ſweet ſented: and though <hi>Charles</hi> river is 120 miles North of <hi>James</hi> river in <hi>Virginia,</hi> yet having a more farre conſtant and tempered growing heat, Tobacco three years together tried, is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſooner ſtruck by wet ſeaſons by full three weeks, then in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and hath yeelded double the price: and no doubt Cotton will grow as in <hi>Millain,</hi>

            <p>The ſixt is an Ile called <hi>Palmers</hi> Ile, containing 300 acres, half meade, halfe wood; in it is a rock forty foot high, like a Towr, fit to be built on for a trading houſe for all the Indians of <hi>Chiſepeack</hi> Gulfe: it lieth a mile from each ſhore in <hi>Saſquehannocks</hi> river mouth, and there four Sakers will command that river, and renue the old trade that was; it lieth in forty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and twelve minutes, it is moſt healthy, but cold neer the hils, and full as all the ſeventeen rivers there of eleven ſorts of excellent freſh fiſh; the Indians in ſtead of ſalt doe barbecado or dry and ſmoak fiſh, to each houſe a reek or great pile, and another of Sun dried on the rocks, Strawberries, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, Symnels, Maycocks and Horns like Cucumbers.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh is five mile off it, called <hi>Mount Royall</hi> or <hi>Bolalmanack</hi> hill, and more properly <hi>Belveder,</hi> for thence you may ſee 100 miles off high hils, above the clouds like ſugar-loaves that ſhelter and bear off the North-weſt windes; here is a clear Indian field ſixe miles long to plant and plow rich land, and as well ſtored as the reſt, and under it is <hi>Elk</hi> river, having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny branches navigable, in all theſe the Tide of freſh ſweet water ebbes and flowes, and hath three fathome deep, the mouth of it is like a fort with fit <hi>Iſthmos</hi> and <hi>necks,</hi> and runneth up ſeven leagues to a ſtreet, but eleven miles o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver land into <hi>Charles</hi> river, and <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi> this neck is a rare work of God, for it is 450 miles compaſſe to goe by ſea and water, from one ſide to the other of this eleven miles ſtreet, and <hi>Vvedale</hi> is on one of theſe branches.</p>

            <p>But it is materiall to give a touch of Religion and Government, to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the curious and well-minded Adventurer. For Religion it being in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> yet unſettled, ſeverall Tranſlations of Bibles, and thoſe expounded to each mans fancy, breeds new Sects, I conceive the <hi>Holland</hi> way now practiſed beſt to content all parties: firſt, by Act of Parliament or Grand Aſſembly, to ſettle and eſtabliſh all the Fundamentals neceſſary to ſalvation, as the three Creeds, the Ten Commandements, Preaching on the Lords day, and great days, and Catechiſing in the afternoon, the Sacrament of the Altar and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; But no perſecution to any diſſenting, and to all ſuch as to the <hi>Walloons,</hi> free Chapels; and to puniſh all as ſeditious, and for contempt, as bitterly rail and condemn others of the contrary; for this argument or perſwaſion of Religion, Ceremonies, or Church-Diſcipline, ſhould be acted in mildeneſſe, love and charity, and gentle language, not to diſturb the peace or quiet of the Inhabitants, but therein to obey the Civill Magiſtrate.</p>

a Parliament or Grand Aſſembly, and make Laws, or repeal, alter, explain, and ſet taxes and rates for common defence, and without full conſent of Lord, upper and lower Houſe nothing is done: Appeals are here alſo tried, all cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall caſes for life, above only by two Juries, or actions at Law, a Jury on either ſide may be called, and by them tried: and any before judgement, may ſtop the Law, and be tried in Equity; The two months Courts may try be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore four Juſtices of Peace, any action not exceeding 10 l. or 1500 l. of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, at 4 s. charge onely, and plead without Atturney; an Appeal lieth thence to each quarter, or Chancery firſt Court above, and from thence an Appeal to the Grand Aſſembly: any matter under 40 s. value, or 200 l. of Tobacco, to be ended by the next Juſtice at 1 s. charge, no depoſition to be taken but before two Juſtices, whereof one of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> or in Court, or before a Councell, or of Eſtate: and here is no Jeofails, nor Demurrers, but a Summary hearing, and a Sheriffe, and Clerk of Court, with ſmall fees ends all for the moſt part in a few words.</p>

Our days in Summer 2 hours ſhorter, and in Winter more comfortable two houres longer, and a warmer Sun and bigger fires, and no rent to my Landlord, makes us merry.
