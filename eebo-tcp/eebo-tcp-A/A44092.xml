            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What he lays down concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and that which he advances concerning the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> its being once a <hi>General</hi> Doctrine deriv'd down from <hi>Noah</hi> and the <hi>Ante-diluvian Patriarchs,</hi> all that is <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> and design'd only for the <hi>more Curious.</hi> There is one thing more which he bad me say, and that is this, That he treads not in any Man's Steps; but the Entertainment which he has here prepared for thee, is wholly, and in all its Parts, <hi>new,</hi> at least <hi>his own.</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Resurrection</hi> is defin'd by <hi>Maimonides</hi> to be <hi>The return of the Soul into the same Body from which it had been separated;</hi> and agreeable to this Definition, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, spread throughout the whole Christian World, is this, That <hi>the same Body which died, consisting of the same Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, shall rise again out of its Grave in the Day of Judgment, and be re-united to the Soul.</hi> But <hi>Origen</hi> heretofore, as you rightly observe, (my dear <hi>Philalethes)</hi> and some other <hi>late</hi> Opinionists, have been pleased to advance another Notion, That <hi>the Body to which the Soul shall be united in the next Life, shall not be a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body, but a thin and Etherial one, and that too consisting of new Particles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In asserting the truth of the Catholick Doctrine (the Task you are pleased to impose on me) I shall use all possible Plainness, and observe this Method.</p>

            <p>To pretend to make out the <hi>Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the Doctrine of the Resurrection, from the Opinions and Traditions of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> may seem perhaps a very vain Attempt. But it is no more than what many of the Ancients have endeavour'd to do; and <hi>Photius</hi> mentions an Author, who published a large Work in <hi>Fifteen</hi> Books, to prove, That the Doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, with other <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrines, was own'd by many of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The several <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Babylonians, Chaldaeans,</hi> and <hi>Italians.</hi> What success either He, or any other Author that attempted the same, might meet with, I am not concern'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; but I think I shall be able to shew, that many of the Notions and Opinions of the <hi>Heathens</hi> were grounded on a Tradition concerning the <hi>Resurrection;</hi> nay, that many of the Heathens in Ancient Times acknowledged it, and that many of 'em do so to this Day. I shall first lay before you some Opinions embraced by the <hi>Heathens,</hi> which, I think, carry with them no small resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Doctrine of the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> And in the Second place shall present you with others which plainly express it.</p>
            <p>The first Opinion which I shall take notice of, is concerning the <hi>Human</hi> Shape and Actions attributed to the Soul in its State of Separation. It was anciently the common and receiv'd Opinion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and so it is at this time through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Heathen World, That the <hi>Soul</hi> (or <hi>Manes</hi> which remain after Death) has a perfect <hi>Human</hi> Shape, and all the same Parts, both External and Internal, that the <hi>Body</hi> has; and that when it leaves the <hi>Body,</hi> it <hi>Eats</hi> and <hi>Drinks,</hi> and does all the same things that a living Man does. Now from whence can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66134:7"/>
this odd Opinion should arise, and be so generally propagated all over the World? I shall leave it to be considered by you, whether it were not grounded on an Ancient Tradition, That the <hi>Soul</hi> after Death shall be united to a <hi>Human Body.</hi>

               <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> to prove that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Resurrection was known to <hi>Homer,</hi> produces his description of <hi>Tityus</hi>'s Punishment after Death, and what he says of the Punishments of <hi>Sisy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> and <hi>Tantalus.</hi> Their Punishments, says he, suppose not a <hi>Soul</hi> only, but also a <hi>Body.</hi> The same sort of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he makes use of to prove, that <hi>Plato</hi> held the same Doctrine. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves that <hi>Plato</hi> in the Story which he relates concerning <hi>Eris,</hi> speaks of those that were punished in Hell, as of <hi>Men</hi> compounded of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> with the same Parts and Countenances which they had when living here on Earth; that he makes <hi>Aridaeus,</hi> and other <hi>Tyrants,</hi> to be bound <hi>Neck</hi> and <hi>Heels,</hi> and to be <hi>Flea'd,</hi> and then to be drag'd through <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Briars. Now,</hi> says he, <hi>for</hi> Plato <hi>to say, that the Soul is judged with the Body, can signify nothing else but that he believ'd the Doctrine of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For how could</hi> Aridaeus, <hi>and the rest, be punished after that manner in Hell, if</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:66134:7"/>
               <hi>they had left their Bodies, their Heads, Hands, and Feet on Earth? Sure they will not say, that the Soul has a Head, a Skin, and Hands, and Feet.</hi> But this is a Mistake of that excellent Person. The Reason why the Heathens described the Punishments of the <hi>Damn'd</hi> after this manner, was not because they thought that their <hi>Bodies</hi> were not left here on Earth, but partly because it was the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Opinion, that the <hi>Soul</hi> had all the same Parts that the <hi>Body</hi> has, and partly because such Descriptions do more easily move and affect us; and it is not easy to describe the Torments of the <hi>Soul</hi> after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other manner. Our <hi>Lord,</hi> in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> speaks of them in the same manner, as if they had <hi>Bodies;</hi> tho' what is related of 'em is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be before the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and their <hi>Bodies</hi> are suppos'd to be yet in their Graves. I might mention others of the Ancient Christians that have made use of Arguments of the like nature; but it is not my Business to confute those who have written <hi>for</hi> the <hi>Resurrection;</hi> I shall therefore pass them by.</p>
            <p>From what has been said concerning our Saviour's speaking of the Soul of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> as if it had a Body, tho' he did not believe it had; you may possibly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66134:8"/>
imagine that the Heathens did not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, that the Soul has all the Parts of a Human Body, though they are wont to speak of it, as if they believ'd it. But it evidently and undeniably appears, that that was, and is at this time, their real Opinion. Hence the Custom so general in the World of leaving <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> on the <hi>Graves</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> and of burying together with the dead Bodies all sorts of <hi>Utensils, Houshold-Stuff,</hi> and <hi>Weapons,</hi> which they think the Soul will make use of in the next Life. Hence also the Custom in so many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, of putting to Death the <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Slaves</hi> of the deceased, that they may wait upon 'em, and serve in the same Capacities in the other World. For Brevity sake, I am content to seem a little Immodest, and to take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that you believe I can prove what I have asserted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Opinion, that deserves to be consider'd, is that of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Transmigration</hi> of <hi>Souls</hi> out of one Body into another. 'Twas (you know) the Opinion, not only of the <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Platonists,</hi> and some of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whole Nations of the ancient <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> and 'tis still the received Opinion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66134:8"/>
of the greatest part of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and of many other Countries in divers parts of the World, that when a Man dies, his <hi>Soul</hi> passes into another Body, either the Body of a Man, or of some other Creature. Now, on what could this Opinion be grounded, but on some broken and imperfect Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerning the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of our Bodies? How came so strange an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to obtain in so many Countries? They had doubtless heard from their Ancestors, the Descendants of <hi>Noah,</hi> that after Death, the <hi>Soul</hi> should be reunited to a <hi>Body;</hi> and not knowing, by reason of the imperfectness of the Tradition, how it was to be done, they invented a way for it, and imagin'd it was to be by a <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>born again.</hi> And as <hi>Error</hi> is always fruitful in Inventions, and, one having <hi>taken Root,</hi> there is presently a <hi>Superfoetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of many others, they afterwards carried it on farther, and fansy'd a <hi>Transmigration</hi> of the Soul, not only into another <hi>Human</hi> Body, but also into the Bodies of other living Creatures, and even into <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Plants.</hi> But the Transmigration of the Soul into the Bodies of <hi>irrational</hi> Animals was never so generally receiv'd as its Transmigration into another <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Opinion which I think de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be taken notice of, is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the equal duration of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul;</hi> that the <hi>Soul</hi> should indeed remain after Death, but not unless the <hi>Body</hi> did so too.

               <hi>Corpus.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> had an Opinion amongst 'em, much the same with this. It is commonly said by those that speak of the Custom of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> of embalming the Bodies of their Dead, such as <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Petrus Bellonius,</hi> and others, that the Reason why they were so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preserve their Bodies, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they expected a <hi>Resurrection.</hi> But this indeed was not the Reason. The true Reason was this; They believ'd the Soul never left the dead Body, but always adher'd to it as long as it lasted, how long soever that were; and after the dissolution of the Body they believ'd the Soul was to enter into another. For this also <hi>Servius</hi> is my Author. So others tell us, that they were wont to keep the dead Bodies of their Friends in their Houses, and their Closets, and to set 'em at Table, as Guests, at Meals with 'em; believing that they had there the <hi>whole</hi> Man, not only the <hi>Body,</hi> but the <hi>Soul</hi> too. <hi>Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The <hi>Fourth</hi> Opinion which I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to your Consideration, is this, That these very Bodies of ours are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being made Immortal and Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and of being translated up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, there to inhabit everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Union with the Soul? Did any of the <hi>Heathens</hi> believe thus much? They did so. 'Twas the Doctrine of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daick</hi> Philosophers, and likewise of the <hi>Greeks</hi> themselves. <hi>Psellus,</hi> in his <hi>Gloss</hi> on the <hi>Chaldaick Oracles,</hi> tells us, that it was a Doctrine of those Philosophers, <hi>That a Man's Body may by the Works of Religion</hi> (Lustrations, and the like) <hi>be so purged and attenuated, the impure Matter being consumed by the Heavenly Fire, as that the Soul may carry it up to Heaven with it.</hi> That <hi>Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Helena,</hi> and others, amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> were translated (like <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias)</hi> into Heaven in their proper Bodies, we read in divers of our Ancient Authors.

               <hi>they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt those things which are by nature Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal among the Gods.</hi> He does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve these Reports himself; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he calls it a <hi>Foolish thing to place Earth in Heaven. The Soul</hi> (says he) <hi>only is from the Gods, from them it came, and to them it returns, not with the Body, but separated wholly from it, perfectly pure, clean, and freed from Flesh. The Soul, as</hi> Heraclitus <hi>says, flies from the Body as Ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening does from a Cloud.

               <hi>it ascends to the things above.

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> Opinion of the <hi>Heathens</hi> which I shall present you with, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the very same <hi>Human</hi> Body, after its dissolution. In this only it differs from our <hi>Christian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that it makes the Soul return, not immediately to those Particles from which it was separated by Death, and which were laid in the Grave, so as that those who died <hi>Men,</hi> should rise of the same <hi>Stature,</hi> but first to those Particles, which were unîted to it in the Mothers Womb: And afterwards those Particles that constituted the Body in its several Ages, are, according to this Opinion, to rise again, and be united all in their due time to the same Soul; 'till at last the same Particles that were buried shall be all re-united together, and constitute the Body in the very same manner as formerly. They tell us, that after the expiration of many Thousands of Years,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66134:13"/>
when all the same <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Planets</hi> shall return to the same <hi>Configuration</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that they formerly had to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, there shall be a Resurrection of all things to their former State, not only of <hi>Men,</hi> but all other things in the World. <hi>Socrates,</hi> for Example, shall be born again of the same Mother, and grow up in the same manner, with all the same Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, teach Philosophy at <hi>Athens</hi> to the self-same Scholars, eat the self-same <hi>Diet,</hi> and wear the self-same <hi>Cloths,</hi> be accused by the same Accusers, condemn'd by the same Judges, and die by the same <hi>Poison.</hi> You and I (my Friend) are, according to them to, live here again in all the same Circumstances: Our Friendship the same, and the same Correspondence between us. You are to send again to me, to know what I have to say for the Doctrine of the Resurrection: I am to send you this very same Treatise, written on the same <hi>Paper,</hi> and with the same <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Ink;</hi> and the <hi>Hair,</hi> that now makes this <hi>Blot,</hi> must make the same again. Thus all things must go on in a continual <hi>Round</hi> and <hi>Revolution,</hi> and by a continual successive <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> But who are they that tell us these things? Who were they that taught this Opinion? The <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:66134:14"/>
and the <hi>Platonists,</hi> amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and many of the <hi>Priests</hi> or Philosophers of <hi>Egypt,</hi> from whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> learnt it. Would you have me quote my <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor?</hi> It is <hi>Origen,</hi> and not he only (tho' he alone were <hi>enow)</hi> but I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise several others. <hi>The Followers of</hi> Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras <hi>and</hi> Plato (says <note n="*" place="margin">

And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Notion, when the Stars shall return to the same Order, which they were in in</hi> Socrates<hi>'s time,</hi> Socrates <hi>must be born again, and suffer the same things which he did before; the same</hi> Anytus <hi>and</hi> Melitus <hi>accusing him, and the same</hi> Areopagites <hi>passing Sentence upon him: And the same is the Dctrine of the</hi> Egyptians.

               <hi>Merich Casaubon</hi> understands so, as if it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Resurrection of the Body, in the true Christian Sense, and the Words, <gap reason="foreign">

it of the Body (for the Soul, if not immortal, yet that it remain'd a long time after Death, they believ'd) not of the Body alone, but of the Body and Soul to be join'd again into one and the same Person, may appear, because he saith, <gap reason="foreign">

               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. You will easily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, that I am not at all prejudiced against this Opinion of that learned Man: But let Truth prevail above all things. It must be confess'd, that he did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>Antoninus</hi>'s meaning, and that he was mistaken in <hi>two</hi> Respects: 1. If <hi>Antoninus</hi> had intended a Resurrection, he ought to have been understood only of such a Resurrection, as I have shewn the <hi>Stoicks</hi> generally believ'd. 2. It is not true that he intended a <hi>Resurrection</hi> in any Sense. In this last place he only alludes to that Opinion which the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks</hi> commonly taught, not asserts it:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66134:17"/>
And in the other Place he only speaks of the duration of the <hi>Soul</hi> after Death, of which he himself doubted. It must be acknowledged, that that <hi>Philosopher</hi> had too mean an Opinion of the Body, to propose it as a thing to be <hi>wonder'd</hi> at, why the <hi>Bodies</hi> of <hi>good Men</hi> are not to be rais'd again. And the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, on which <hi>Casaubon</hi> lays a great Stress, and which seems to be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Error, signifies not only, <hi>again,</hi> as he renders it, but <hi>amplius,</hi> or <hi>in posterum.</hi> So in <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi>

            <p>I might here observe, that the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> more ancient than the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks,</hi> speaks not only of the <hi>general Conflag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> but says, <note n="a" place="margin">

those two great <hi>Atomical</hi> Philosophers, <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> believ'd, that our Bodies will hereafter be restor'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and be made up of the very same Particles; should I tell you thus much, you would take me perhaps to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>pleasant</hi> than <hi>serious.</hi> But how strange soever you may think it, it is nevertheless true, at least if my Authors were not mistaken.

               </gap>ter innumerable changes, by a Second fortuitous concourse of the very same Particles. <hi>Democritus</hi> (as I suppose) form'd this Notion from what he had learnt concerning the Instaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Things, by conversing with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> among whom (we know) he lived many Years to be instructed in their Philosophy: And from him, it is likely, <hi>Epicurus</hi> receiv'd it.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66134:19"/>
World, and shew, that the Heathens had not only some Opinions amongst 'em which were built on a Tradition concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Resurrection, and that carry with 'em a very great resemblance of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; but that many of 'em in several parts of the World have held the same Doctrine with us, and do to this day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, in the same sense as we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it; I mean, that they hold, That the Particles of the Body which died will be rais'd again, and, without a <hi>new Birth,</hi> be united to the Soul, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute the very same Man.</p>

                  <hi>Mr. Rich. Wrag in Hackluit tom.</hi> 2. p. 310.</note> of our own Nation tells us, that a <hi>Banian</hi> of <hi>Cambaia</hi> gave an Acquaintance of his this Account of their Faith, relating to the next Life. <hi>Law</hi> (says he) <hi>they hold none, but only seven Precepts, which they say were given 'em from their Father</hi> Noe, <hi>not knowing</hi> Abraham <hi>nor any other.</hi> 1. <hi>To honour Father and Mother.</hi> 2. <hi>Not to steal.</hi> 3. <hi>Not to commit Adultery.</hi> 4. <hi>Not to kill any Thing living.</hi> 5. <hi>Not to eat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thing living.</hi> 6. <hi>Not to cut their Hair.</hi> 7. <hi>To go bare-foot in their Churches. They hold there shall be a Resurrection, and all shall come to Judgment, but the Account shall be most strict, insomuch that but one of</hi> 10000 <hi>shall be receiv'd to Favour, and those shall live again in this World in great Happiness: The rest shall be tormented.</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:66134:22"/>
               <hi>And because they will escape this Judgment, when any Man dies, he is burnt to Ashes, and thrown into a River. And by this means they hope to escape the Judgment to come. As for the Soul, that goeth to the Place from whence it came, but where the Place is they know not. That the Body should not be made again they reason with the Philosophers, saying, that of nothing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be made; beholding the course of Nature that nothing is made but by a means, as by the Seed of an Animal is made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by Corn cast into the Ground there cometh up new Corn. So, say they, a Man cannot rise again except some part of him be left undissolv'd, and therefore they burn the whole. For if he were buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Earth, they say there is a small Bone in the Neck which would never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd. Or if he were eaten by a Beast, that Bone would not consume, but of that Bone would come another Man; and then the Soul being restored again he should come to Judgment, whereas now, the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing destroy'd, the Soul shall not be judged. For their Opinion is, That both Body and Soul must be united together as they have sinn'd together, to receive Judgment: and therefore the Soul alone cannot. Their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Precepts, which they keep very strictly, they do not keep for any hope of Reward</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:66134:22"/>
               <hi>they have after this Life, but only that they may be blessed in this World. They say, the Three chief Religions in the World are of the</hi> Christians, Jews, <hi>and</hi> Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, <hi>and yet but one of them True. But being in doubt which is the truest of the Three, they will be of None. For they hold that all these Three shall be judged, and but few of them which be of the True shall be saved, the Examination shall be so strict. They say these Three Religions have too many Precepts to keep them all well, and therefore wonderful hard it will be to give an Account, because so few do observe all their Religion aright.</hi> This Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is the more considerable for what it mentions of <hi>Noah:</hi> and I should be glad to tell you, that I find it confirm'd by other <hi>Relations</hi> of those Parts. But that, I must own, I cannot as yet do. On the contrary I know that the <hi>Bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> and of other Parts, do not generally talk after this manner, or own <hi>explicitly</hi> a <hi>Resurrection,</hi> but the <hi>Transmigration</hi> of Souls into other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Nevertheless it is not improbable but that among those many Sects of the <hi>Banians,</hi> or Gentiles, of <hi>Mogulistan,</hi> whose Opinions we find describ'd in our more vulgar <hi>Relations,</hi> there may be some, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in <hi>Cambaia,</hi> who have these Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66134:23"/>
and Notions. And this is th more credible, because (as I shall by and by shew) there are other Nations in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which assert a <hi>Resurrection.</hi> Those <hi>Brachmans</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> of whom we read in the Histories of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> were either of that Country which is now call'd <hi>Cambaia,</hi> or of a Country bordering upon it: And <hi>Palladius,</hi> in his <hi>Treatise of the Brachmans,</hi> makes <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damis,</hi> the most Famous and Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amongst 'em, speak of the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> He, in his Discourse with <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> has these Words: <hi>Thou shalt not lie hid from God, neither shalt thou have any Place to which thou mayest flee at the time of the</hi>

               <hi>go. And to these they say, all Men do go, that are not of the Religious. They place others higher, whither they say the holy Priests do go that live in the Wildernesses, and all the Felicity they give them there, is to sit refreshing themselves with the Wind. They place others yet higher, the Gods of which they say have round Bodies like Bowls; those that go to these Heavens have round Bodies as the Gods themselves have.</hi> The same Author tells us, That <hi>they wear their Hair long, holding, that by it they shall be carried to Heaven.</hi> That <hi>the Priests are generally shaven, for they say, They need no help to carry them to Heaven.</hi> This might pass, I presume, with many for a full and sufficient Proof, that they own a <hi>Resurrection:</hi> But I do not my-self rely on it. These Opinions might be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the gross Notion they might have of the Materiality of the Soul. I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd in the beginning of this <hi>Discourse,</hi> that the <hi>Heathens</hi> generally believe, that the Soul has all the same Parts that the Body has: They believe that the Parts of the Soul, when the Soul is united to the Body, are diffused throughout all the Parts of the Body, that if a man's <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> has <hi>Hair,</hi> his <hi>Soul</hi> has <hi>Hair</hi> too; and that if you cut off his <hi>Hair,</hi> you cut off together with it the <hi>Hair</hi> of the <hi>Soul.</hi>

In that place, says he, there are Two great <hi>Idols,</hi> call'd <hi>The Blowers of the House of Smoak,</hi> (so the <hi>Chinese</hi> use to call <hi>Hell)</hi> and the Figure of a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Serpent, call'd, <hi>The glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Serpent of the House of Smoak,</hi> with a great Bowl of Iron on his Head, as if it had been thrown at him from some other place; and near it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Figure in the form of a Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant holding a great Iron Bowl aloft in his Hands, and beholding the Serpent with a frowning and angry Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he seems as if he would throw his Bowl at him. Round about this Figure is a number of little Idols on
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66134:25"/>
their Knees, with their Hands lifted up as if they would adore it.</q> But what means all this long Story? What (you will say) are these <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>Skulls,</hi> these <hi>Giants, Serpents,</hi> and <hi>Bowls,</hi> to our Purpose? The Explication he gives of all these things, is this: <hi>All this great Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> says he, <hi>was consecrated to the Honour of this Idol, call'd</hi> Mucluparon, <hi>whom the Chinese affirm'd to be the Treasurer of all the dead Bones, and that when the Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonous Serpent before-mentioned came to steal them away, he made at him with the Bowl which he held in his Hands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Serpent in great fear fled away to the bottom of the profound House of Smoak, whither God precipitated him for his great Wickedness: And farther they affirm'd, that he had maintain'd a Combat with him</hi> 3000 <hi>Years already, and was to continue the same</hi> 3000 <hi>Years more; so that from</hi> 3000 <hi>to</hi> 3000 <hi>Years he was to employ Five Bowls, wherewith he was to make an end of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him. Hereupon,</hi> they added, <hi>that assoon as this Serpent should be dead, the Bones that were there gathered together, would return to the Bodies to which they appertain'd formerly, and so should go and remain for ever in the House of the Moon. To these Opinions</hi> (adds my Author) <hi>they join many others such like, unto which they</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:66134:26"/>
               <hi>give so much faith, that nothing can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to remove them from it. For it is the Doctrine that is preach'd unto them by their</hi> Bonzees, <hi>who also tell them that the true way to make a Soul happy, is to gather the Bones of the Dead together into this Place; by means whereof there is not a day passes but a Thousand, or Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, Bones are brought thither. Now if some for their far distance cannot bring all the Bones whole together, they will at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise bring a Tooth or Two, and so they say, that, by way of an Alms, they make as good satisfaction as if they brought all the rest: Which is the reason that in all these Charnel-Houses there is such an infinite multitude of these Teeth, that one might lade many Ships with them.</hi> Thus far <hi>Pinto:</hi> I wish I could quote you a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Author. Tho the silence of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Travellers who have given an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Country, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> and the odd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Story it self, be enough to perswade one that the whole is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than an idle Fable; yet that which he says of the Combat maintain'd with the <hi>Devil</hi> 3000 Years already, and to be continued 3000 Years more, comes up so near to the Opinion of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Magi,</hi> those great Theologists

            <p>You see <hi>(Philalethes)</hi> I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to <hi>abuse</hi> you, by imposing upon you an Argument, which I think I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66134:29"/>
to doubt of. And moreover, I must tell ye, that it is not improbable but that there may be some others amongst the Modern Instances which I have laid before you, as particularly that of the <hi>Virginians,</hi> that hereafter may be found to be grounded on Mistakes. The truth is, the <hi>First</hi> Authors of Reports of this nature are oftentimes such as are either too Ignorant of the Language of those whose Opinions they give an Account of, to understand 'em aright, or not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently Knowing and Judicious to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish rightly one Opinion from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But, upon the whole, if you please to reflect on all that has been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto said, and consider all things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I am of Opinion you will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt to lay down this Proposition at the <hi>Foot</hi> of the <hi>Account,</hi> That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> as we now understand it, is an old <hi>Universal</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, deriv'd down from <hi>Noah,</hi> and grounded on the more ancient <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Patriarchs.</p>
            <p>But why deriv'd down from <hi>Noah?</hi> Why grounded (perhaps you may ask) on the ancient Revelations of the <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvian</hi> Patriarchs? Might not the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> receive this Notion from the <hi>Jews?</hi> I know many Modern Writers, and some
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66134:30"/>
of the Ancients, who contend that the Doctrine of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> was in some measure known to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> give this account of it, that they learnt it of the <hi>Jews</hi> by reading the Scriptures, or by conversing with some of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But I leave it to your serious Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether this Account which I have given you of it, be not much more probable. How could so many different Nations, Nations so <hi>Ancient</hi> and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from <hi>Judaea,</hi> receive this Doctrine, or their <hi>broken</hi> Traditions concerning it, from the <hi>Jews?</hi> I could offer you many Arguments, and, I think, pretty good ones, to confute that common and ill-grounded Opinion, That most of those Notions in which the Ancient <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> agreed with the <hi>Jews,</hi> were bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from them. But this is not a proper time for it. Are you apt to suspect that the <hi>Notices</hi> of the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> which we find among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of <hi>these present</hi> Times were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the <hi>Missionaries</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has of latesent abroad into the several Parts of the World? I must needs say, that, if I know any thing of these Matters, I know that that could not be. Will you say they were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from some <hi>Christians,</hi> or <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:66134:30"/>
who in <hi>former</hi> times arriv'd in those Countries? This I grant may be true of some of 'em. But if you consider that before the times of <hi>Christianity</hi> there were manifest <hi>Foot-steps</hi> of this Doctrine to be found amongst the Heathens in <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> Parts of the World as well as in these Days; and that the ancient <hi>Magi</hi> of the East did plainly assert it; as you will be forced to acknowledge that the whole cannot be accounted for that way, so (I think) it will seem very probable that the <hi>present</hi> Heathens themselves are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to their first Ancestors, and not to any <hi>Christians</hi> or <hi>Mahometans,</hi> for what they know concerning it. I take no notice of another Opinion very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongst the <hi>Fathers,</hi> That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> may be learnt from <hi>Natural Reason.</hi> I should be very glad to have it well prov'd, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> might be discover'd to those <hi>Heathens</hi> of whom we have spoken, by that light of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> But for my part I utterly despair of it. I know of no Natural Reason, no light of Nature so bright and shining as to discover this Mystery; and have therefore purposely forborn to make use of any of those Arguments which the Fathers, and some <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bishop</hi> Paerson <hi>on the Creed,</hi> p. 376.</note> of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66134:31"/>
Writers are wont to produce from it. I look on this Doctrine as one of those that could never be discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but by an extraordinary <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Should God be pleas'd to ask me, as he did the Prophet, <hi>Son of Man, can these dry Bones live?</hi> I can only appeal to him for the truth of it, and must hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly answer in the Prophet's Words, <hi>Lord God, thou knowest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall conclude this Argument with a Testimony of <hi>(a)</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which confirms the Notion which we have advanc'd. He <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21.</note> affirms, That the Resurrection was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World. <hi>The Heavens</hi> (says he) <hi>must receive Christ untill the time of the Restitution of all things: Of which God hath spoken by the Mouth of his Holy Prophets,</hi>

I begin with the Testimonies of the Old Testament, and the Common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ancient <hi>Jews.</hi> 'Tis confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently asserted by <note n="a" place="margin">De Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur. initio Epistolae Dedic.</note>

3.

               <note n="a" place="margin">In his own Life.</note> tells us, that in his Youth he had made it his Business to enquire into the Doctrines of the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Sects, the <hi>Essens,</hi> the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and to learn their Customs and Ways of living, being conversant amongst 'em with great perseverance and application, that having inform'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of their several Rules and Placits, he might adhere to that Sect which should please him best.

            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Another Sect that denied the <hi>Resurrection</hi> was that of the <hi>Sadduces.</hi> That they denied it I need not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove.

This I shall prove by and by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> There was another Sect of the <hi>Jews</hi> call'd <hi>Hemero-Baptists,</hi> who agreed, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> assures us, with the <hi>Sadduces</hi> in denying the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and in their other Tenets; only in this they dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from 'em, that they esteem'd it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, for the cleansing themselves from Sin, to bathe themselves every Day, both

Winter and Summer: From whence they had their Name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> himself did not fully rely on the Doctrine of a future <hi>Resurrection,</hi> but doubted once a little of it, as a Doctrine at that time not sufficiently reveal'd, or almost forgotten, may be gathered from the Answer which he return'd to that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of God Almighty, <hi>Son of Man, can these (dry) Bones live?</hi> If the Doctrine of the Resurrection had been at that time the common and receiv'd Doctrine, as it was afterwards in the time of our Saviour, and the Prophet had been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assur'd of it, he would not have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, as he did; <hi>Lord God, Thou knowest:</hi> But roundly, as <hi>Martha</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd our Saviour concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of her Brother <hi>Lazarus, I know, Lord, that they can and will.</hi> 'Tis true, the Words, <hi>thou knowest</hi> are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of another interpretation, and may be so understood as to signifie, <hi>thou knowest that they can.</hi> But the true meaning seems to be otherwise, and they seem to import thus much: <hi>Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est whether they can or no; I do not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> To these we may add the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans,</hi> who tho' they were not of the Communion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> were however
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66134:36"/>
the Followers of the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> If we may believe some of those ancient Writers, who have given an account of their Opinions, they were not only ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Doctrine of the <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> but rejected likewise that of the Immortality of the Soul.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> tho' the Doctrine of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> was not <hi>always</hi> receiv'd by the <hi>Jews</hi> as a necessary Article of Faith, or Term of Communion, as appears from <hi>some</hi> of the foregoing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66134:37"/>
Instances, yet 'tis certain that about the time of our Saviour, as well before as after, it was the <hi>receiv'd</hi> and <hi>common</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of that Nation. This evidently appears from the following Examples.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Answers which the <hi>Seven</hi> Martyrs give their Tormenters, which we read recorded in the Second Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> there's a clear and open Profession of this Doctrine: And it plainly appears from the Answer of the Third of those Martyrs, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection which they expected was of the <hi>same Humane</hi> Body. Being call'd to his Torments, and holding out his hands, <note n="a" place="margin">C. 7. v. 11.</note> 
               <hi>These I had</hi> (says he) <hi>from Heaven, and for his Laws I despise 'em, and from him I hope to receive 'em again.</hi> This happen'd about 165 Years before Christ. 'Tis true, I am not fully perswaded that these Words were really spoken by that Martyr. Since there were not any <hi>Jews</hi> then present who might think it worth their while to commit the Words of those several Martyrs to Memory, it may be reasonably suppos'd that the Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ascrib'd to 'em were made by the Author of the History, as is usual with other Historians. Thus <hi>Josephus</hi> in his History of those Martyrs makes 'em speak quite different Speeches; so likewise the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:66134:37"/>
               <hi>Arabick</hi> History which is extant in the <hi>Polyglot Bible,</hi> and (if I well remember) the Hebrew <hi>Ben Gorion;</hi> all differing both from the Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and from one another. Yet this at least is to be concluded from these Words, that when the Second of <hi>Maccabees</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, this Doctrine was generally receiv'd, and 'twas also then taken for granted, that at that time when those Martyrs suffer'd, it was the general and receiv'd Doctrine. How ancient that Book is, we do not certainly know, but we know from <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> who cites it, that it was extant within 150 Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Saviour's Pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ion; and from the First and Second Chapters it may easily be gather'd, that it was written long before his <hi>Nativity,</hi> before the <hi>Jews</hi> were conquer'd by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

               </gap>ine of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has been look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> upon by the <hi>Jews</hi> as a necessary Article of their <hi>Creed,</hi> from before the Date of their <hi>Talmuds. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> That tho' it was not receiv'd by 'em as an indispensible Article of Faith in the time of our Saviour, and for some time before and after, yet even in those times it was the common and receiv'd Doctrine. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That by the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> they always understood, not barely the re-conjunction of the Soul with <hi>a Body</hi> after Death, but the resuscitation of the <hi>same Humane</hi> Body. I shall only add that the <hi>Resurrection</hi> is acknowledged not only by the <hi>Rabbinists</hi> or the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> which are much the greater Number, but also by those that are call'd <hi>Karraites,</hi> who follow only the Scripture, disallowing Traditions, and are therefore reckon'd by the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudists</hi> as Hereticks. These are said to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66134:43"/>
be descended from the ancient <hi>Sadduces.</hi> If so, it appears, that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were at last convinced of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and made Proselytes to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Resurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas about the end of the first Century after our Saviour's Nativity, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> began to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as a necessary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith. I gather it thus. That it was not an Article of Faith till after the time of <hi>Josephus,</hi> who liv'd till near the end of that Century appears from hence, that neither the <hi>Essens,</hi> nor the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> were in his time accounted <hi>Hereticks.</hi> And that it was receiv'd as a part of their <hi>Creed</hi> before the Year 140, appears from what we read in <hi>Justin Martyr</hi>'s Dialogue with <hi>Trypho,</hi> p. 306, 307. It appears from thence that the Doctrine of the Resurrection, and that too of the <hi>same Humane</hi> Body, was at that time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all such <hi>Jews</hi> as were accounted <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and that the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,</hi> who denied it, were at that time rejected as <hi>Heretioks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should here <hi>(Philalethes)</hi> have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd this Point, but it comes now into my Mind, that there are two things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of which you desire particularly to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66134:44"/>
which ought to be consider'd in this Place. Your Queries are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Transmigration of Souls out of one Body into another by a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Whether that be not held by many of the <hi>Jews?</hi> and if so, Whether they, that hold it, do not deny the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Body? How that Opinion can be consistent with this?</p>
            <p>To the First of these Queries I must answer in the Affirmative. It is very true, that the Transmigration of Souls out of one Body into another, is by many of the <hi>Jews,</hi> both ancient and modern, maintain'd. They call it <hi>The Revolution of Souls,</hi> or <hi>The secret of the Revolution. Leo Modena</hi> speaks of it as of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion, but he adds withal, that there are <hi>many</hi> that do not believe it. And the Author <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Addison.</note> of <hi>The Present State of</hi> the Jews <hi>in</hi> Barbary, takes notice of it as receiv'd by the <hi>Jews</hi> of those Parts.

               <hi>Talmudists</hi> themselves. The <hi>Cabbalists</hi> tell us, that the Soul of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, David,</hi> and the <hi>Messias,</hi> is one and the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66134:44"/>
same. We are told by others, that <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide Seld. de Succes. Pont.</hi> p. 111, 112.</note> 
               <hi>Phineas,</hi> the Grand-Son of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet were the same Man: By which they must mean, either that the Soul of <hi>Phineas</hi> pass'd into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Elias,</hi> or that <hi>Phineas</hi> did not die, but that having lain hid for many Ages, or having been translated, he afterwards appear'd again, and was call'd <hi>Elias.</hi> It may seem more probable, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd the first, and it's generally taken for granted by learned Men that they did so: Yet I cannot be confident of it: for I find that some of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid seld.</hi> l. c. p. 109.</note> had this Tradition and Opinion amongst 'em, that <hi>Phineas</hi> liv'd many Ages.</p>
            <p>The Reason they give for the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration of Souls, is the same with that which is generally assign'd by the Heathens, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Soul may be purg'd and amended.

Another place from whence <note n="*" place="margin">Drusius, Beza, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scator, &amp;c. in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> some inferr, that the Transmigration of Souls was receiv'd among the <hi>Jews</hi> in those times, is St. <hi>John</hi> ix. 2. where we read that <hi>Jesus passing by, and seeing a Man who was blind from his birth, his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples askt him saying; Master, who did sin, this Man or his Parents, that he was born blind?</hi> But it is not necessary, that, because the Disciples believ'd that he sinned before he was born, they should therefore believe, that his Soul had been before that united to a Body. It is much more probable, that they thought his Soul might have sinned in its solitary state of Pre-existence, and was therefore sent down into such a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. That this was their fancy, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed by most Commentators, St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> himself; and it cannot be denied but that the Doctrine of the <hi>Pre-existence</hi> of the Soul was in those times receiv'd among the <hi>Jews.</hi> Sure I am, it is at this time their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and established Doctrine.</p>
            <p>I mention'd but now certain <hi>Natural Philosophers</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were call'd <hi>Sapientes Mecar,</hi> and that there seem to have been some so call'd in the time of the Apostles. It is probable there were such even before those times.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66134:48"/>
It may seem from what I said of 'em, that <hi>some</hi> of 'em believ'd the <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But granting that <hi>some</hi> of 'em did so, yet it does not appear, that those that did so were some of the most ancient, such as lived in our Saviour's time, or before. They might live long after those times, and I am of opinion that they did.</p>
            <p>To your Second <hi>Query,</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the consistency of the two Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, this of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and that of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> How one can be consistent with the other? My Answer is this: Those <hi>Jews</hi> that hold the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, do all, as well as the rest, acknowledge the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> but with this difference: They do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Resurrection of all <hi>Humane</hi> Bodies (for that cannot be) but they tell ye, that either the <hi>first</hi> or the <hi>last</hi> of those Bodies, to which the same Soul has been united, shall rise. <hi>Abarbinel</hi> is of Opinion that the <hi>Resurrection</hi> is to be of the <hi>first;</hi> but so is not <hi>Menasseh Ben-Israel;</hi> he alledges, that this does not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Doctrine of the ancient <hi>Zoar.</hi> The <hi>Cabbalists</hi> there declare for the last. And their Words are these: <hi>R. Hisquiha</hi> says, <hi>If you tell me that all</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:66134:49"/>
               <hi>Bodies shall awake and rise again, pray tell me what will be become of those Bodies which were inform'd by one and the same Soul?</hi> R. Joseph <hi>answer'd: As for those Bodies which have deserv'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor done any good, they shall be so dealt with as if they had never had a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and because they were as a dry Tree in this World, they shall also be as such in that which is to come. But the last Body that was inform'd by the Soul, shall rise again, because it was planted, and brought forth Fruit, and took Root as it ought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now in the next place to shew, that, tho' the Doctrine of the <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> was not receiv'd by the <hi>Jews</hi> as a necessary Article of Faith 'till after our Saviour's time, yet it ought not to be lookt upon as the less certain on that account. And this I shall make out by shewing, that 'till after our Saviour's time there was nothing among them thought a necessary Article of Faith, or Term of Communion, but only the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and owning the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the worshipping in the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> that the Immortality of the Soul it-self was not receiv'd by 'em as a necessary Article of Faith, or Term of Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:66134:49"/>
The truth of this will evidently appear, if we can prove, that the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,</hi> who denied not only the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> but also the <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> were admitted by the <hi>Jews</hi> of those Times as Members of their Communion and true <hi>Israelites.</hi> Now that this was so, is apparent from these following Considerations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In the <hi>Acts of the Apostles</hi> it is said, that, when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were preaching to the People in the Temple, <note n="*" place="margin">IV. 1.</note> 
               <hi>The Priests and the Captain of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the</hi> Sadduces <hi>came upon'em, being griev'd that they taught the People, and preach'd through Jesus the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dead.</hi> And in the Chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, that there being a continual flocking of the People to the Apostles, <hi>the High-Priest rose up and all they that were with him (which is the Sect of the</hi> Sadduces) <hi>and were fill'd with Indignation.</hi> By which two places it appears, that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> in those Days were the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and Associates of the <hi>Captain of the Temple</hi> and the <hi>Priests;</hi> and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so, but were also the most intimate Associates of the <hi>High-Priest</hi> himself. Which surely could never have been, had they been look'd upon as <hi>Hereticks</hi> and out of their Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:66134:50"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It appears from the 23 Chap. of the same Book, that a part of their <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin</hi> it self, their great and Sacred Council, consisted of <hi>Sadduces,</hi> that one part was <hi>Pharisees</hi> and the other <hi>Saddn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Nay, from thence we may gather that the Doctrine of <hi>a future Life</hi> might as well have been condemn'd by the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin</hi> as the contrary Doctrine: Else how could St. <hi>Paul</hi> cry out to the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi> that <hi>concerning the Hope and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead he was</hi> there <hi>call'd in Question.</hi> He means not strictly the Resurrection of the Body, but the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul and the Life to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Sadduces</hi> were not only the intimate Associates of the inferior <hi>Priests</hi> and the <hi>High-Priests</hi> themselves, and Members likewise of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> but they were also advanc'd to the dignity of <hi>High-Priests,</hi> and own'd as such by all the <hi>Jews</hi> in general. <hi>Josephus</hi> is my Witness that <note n="†" place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> better sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or Persons of considerable Quality, were of that Sect.</p>
            <p>A learned <hi>Jew,</hi> with whom I once discours'd concerning this Point, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to these Arguments, was pleas'd to tell me, that the Reason why in those times the <hi>Sadduces</hi> were admitted into the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> and into the <hi>High-Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> was because of the over-ruling and arbitrary power of the Heathen Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and that Sect being in an especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner encouraged by the supream Governours, it was on that account embrac'd by such as were of the greatest Quality. In Answer to which, I might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that, in the time of <hi>Hyrcanus, Judaea</hi> was not in subjection to any Heathen Governour; neither does it appear that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> were peculiarly favour'd and promoted by the <hi>Roman</hi> Prefects. If they were, how came it to pass that in so long a time, and among so many High-Priests, there was only one <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi> advanced to that Dignity. But I pass by these Considerations, and for a full reply to this Evasion, shall referr you to the following Arguments.</p>

               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Though' the <hi>Sadduces</hi> were members even of the holy <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> and one of the High-Priefts had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declar'd for that Sect, and another, that openly profess'd it, had been advanc'd to that Honour, yet we do not any where read that any of the learned <hi>Jews</hi> thought it unlawful or remonstrated against it. <hi>Josephus</hi> indeed tells us, that <note n="a" place="margin">

               <hi>the</hi> Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>had not any Power to speak of in the Government, but that when they were advanc'd to any place of Command, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly and by compulsion, they profess'd themselves</hi> Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, <hi>because the Common People would not otherwise endure 'em.</hi> This place may seem to make directly against me: but in reality it does not.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66134:55"/>
the Scripture to signify <hi>all,</hi> as in the <hi>Fifty Third</hi> of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> where Christ is said to bear the Sins of <hi>many,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it is said that he bare the Sins of us <hi>all:</hi> So, say they, in the <hi>Ninety Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Psalm, Verse</hi> 1. <hi>the many Isles</hi> (as it is in the Original) signifies <hi>all the Isles.</hi> But this does not clear the Difficulty.

any of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctors, though to prove the <hi>Resurrection</hi> they are wont to catch at very small things. They all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it of the happiness of the next Life without any respect to the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body. If we follow the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> we cannot understand it any otherwise than of the Resurrection. <hi>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that at the last Day I am to rise from the Earth.

This Hope is fixt in my Bosom.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> Translation is thus: <hi>For I know that he is everlasting, who shall deliver me on Earth, and raise up my Skin that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered these things. For all these things have been done upon me by the Lord. Of all which I am conscious; my Eye has seen 'em, and not another: and they have been all done unto me in my Bosom.</hi> For, <hi>raise up my Skin,</hi> the <hi>Alexandrian Copy</hi> has, <hi>And he shall raise up my Body.</hi> But <hi>Origen</hi>'s Copies agreed with that which is published. St. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> reads it thus: <hi>Thou shalt raise up my flesh, which has suffered all these things.</hi> The <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase</hi> has it thus: <hi>And I know that my Redeemer lives, and hereafter</hi>

               <hi>his Redemption will arise upon the Dust. And after my Skin shall be puft up, this shall be. And in my Flesh I shall see God again. Whom I am to see for my-self, and my Eyes shall see him and not another. My Reins are consum'd within me.</hi> The <hi>Syriack</hi> thus: <hi>I know indeed that my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour lives, and that in the End he will appear upon Earth.

Having laid these several Translations and Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before you, I shall leave this Text to your Judgment, without pretending to decide the Controversy.

            <p>I shall close this part of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which is concerning the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Testimonies of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> with an observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning that Argument, which our Saviour makes use of out of the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> to prove the Resurrection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Sadduces. As touching the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> (says he) <hi>of the Dead, have you not heard that which was spoken unto you by God, saying; I am the God of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>the God of</hi> Isaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob? <hi>God is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living.</hi> The most that this Argument proves, is the <hi>Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> that the Souls of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> did not die with their Bodies, as the <hi>Sadduces</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd: From whence I observe, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66134:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it was not so much the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> as the <hi>Immortality</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> stuck at, and that if it could be once prov'd out of the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> that the <hi>Soul</hi> was <hi>Immortal</hi> and did not die with the Body, they were ready and willing to grant that there would be a <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi> Our Saviour thought it would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to convince 'em of the <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the Body, if they could but be convinc'd of the <hi>Immortality</hi> of the <hi>Soul.</hi>

            <p>If the Doctrine of the Resurrection were not so clearly reveal'd to the <hi>Jews</hi> as to be always own'd as a necessary Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith, if they <hi>saw</hi> it <hi>through a Glass</hi> but <hi>darkly</hi> and obscurely; yet it is not so with <hi>Christians.</hi> If they <hi>knew but in part, and prophesy'd but in part,</hi> yet <hi>he being come, which is perfect,</hi> that <hi>which was only in part, is</hi> to us <hi>done away.</hi> I shall now in the next place demonstrate the Doctrine of the Resurrection of the <hi>same Humane</hi> Body to be the Doctrine of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And this I shall do by shewing,</p>

The Foundation of this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>Origen,</hi> is St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s comparing our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> to the <hi>growing of Corn;</hi> of which I shall speak by and by, and shew how unreasonable it is to argue against the <hi>Identity</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> from that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison. To shew the Absurdity of this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> let us suppose that the Body was never buried, but expos'd in the Air, or perfectly burnt to Ashes, or drown'd and dissolv'd in the Sea, and let this be done some <hi>Thousands</hi> of years ago: I would ask an <hi>Origenist,</hi> Where are then his <hi>principia resurrectionis?</hi> 'Tis impossible to conceive any such <hi>semina resurgendi,</hi> unless we will suppose that there always remains some little part of the Body undissolv'd. And therefore some of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who will have the Body to be made up in the Resurrection by <hi>growing</hi> as out of a <hi>Seed</hi> (and from whom <hi>Origen</hi> seems to have borrow'd his Notion) tell us, that there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain little Bone in the Body of a Man (they call it <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Luz)</hi> which can never be dissolv'd. But in such cases as we suppose, it is highly probable, that there may not be remaining, after so many Motions and Transmutations, any two Particles or Atoms united together, which were united in the Body when
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66134:61"/>
alive. At least it cannot be imagin'd, that there can remain so many Particles united together as are necessary to the making up of such a <hi>Semen.</hi> To this you may add, that the Earth is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and natural Matrix of the Seeds of Corn, and the like, in which it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd by Nature that they should ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, and produce their kind: But the Body of a Man is naturally begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and form'd after a quite different manner. It is therefore very absurd to imagine, that because the Grains of Corn contain such <hi>semina</hi> within 'em as may germinate and <hi>bring forth</hi> in the Earth, therefore likewise in the Particles of a Man's Body there may be such natural <hi>Semina</hi> from whence a new Body may <hi>rise.</hi> I need not observe, that if our Bodies had any such natural <hi>Semina,</hi> it must thence follow, that the Body which <hi>rises</hi> or <hi>springs up,</hi> would be, not of a different kind from that which was buried, as <hi>Origen</hi> would have the <hi>rising</hi> Body to be, but altogether of the same, since the Seeds of all things do naturally produce their own Kind. From a <hi>Humane</hi> Body there would spring up a <hi>Humane</hi> Body, not a <hi>Subtle</hi> and <hi>Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi> one.</p>

But how does this agree with that Comparison, which the same Apostle makes, between the Resurrection of our Bodies, and the growing of <hi>Corn?</hi> The Apostle observes that the <hi>Corn which is sown, is not the same with that which shall be,</hi> and he plainly applies this to our <hi>Resurrection.</hi> Does not that prove, that the Body, which rises, will be no more the same with that which died, than <hi>Corn</hi> is the same with that from whence it sprung? This is that Place (as I have already said) on which <hi>Origen,</hi> and the rest of our Adversaries, chiefly groun'd their Opinions. My Answer is this: There is no necessity we should take the Comparison in all respects strictly. You know, we have a <hi>Maxim</hi> in the <hi>Schools,</hi> that <hi>no Similitude walks on Four Feet:</hi> The meaning is, that <hi>Similitudes,</hi> and <hi>Comparisons,</hi> are always <hi>Lame,</hi> and ought to be understood loosly, and only in <hi>some respect.</hi> And so ought this Comparison, which the Apostle uses. All that he means by it, is this, That as a Grain of Corn, which springs up, differs from that which was sown; so the Body which rises, shall not be altogether the same, but shall differ in some Respects from that which was buried. I observe that the Question which the Apostle answers,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:66134:65"/>
is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>with what sort of Body</hi> the Dead shall rise? I observe the Word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; <hi>with what sort of Body as to its Qualities?</hi> And as the <hi>Question</hi> is only concerning the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Quality,</hi> of the Body, so ought the <hi>Answer</hi> to be understood to intend no other.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more certain than that of all Arguments, the weakest are those that are taken from <hi>Comparisons;</hi> so <hi>loosly</hi> are <hi>Comparisons</hi> wont to be used. I shall crave your Leave to give you here a few Instances, relating to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject now before us. The <hi>Resurrection</hi> of our Bodies is compared to the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Corn,</hi> not only by the Apostle, but by almost all the <hi>Fathers,</hi> yet they at the same time own expresly the <hi>Identity</hi> of the Body. The <hi>Greek</hi> Church uses <hi>boil'd Wheat</hi> as a <hi>Symbol</hi> of it.

That Body which <hi>rises again,</hi> must be that which once <hi>died:</hi> For nothing can be said to <hi>rise again,</hi> but that which once <hi>fell.</hi> If a <hi>new</hi> Body be to be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and united to the Soul, if all that we are to expect be only this, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death our Souls will be again uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>a</hi> Body, certainly they would never have chosen so very <hi>improper</hi> a Word to express it, as <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>It's generally suppos'd by Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, that in the space of about Seven Years, all the Particles of a Man's Body are chang'd: Now suppose (you will say) that a Man should keep his Bed for above Seven Years together, and at last should recover and <hi>rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> tho' there be not one Particle in his Body, when he <hi>rises,</hi> the same that he had when first he began to keep his Bed, yet the Body with which he rises may properly be said to be the very same. The Body in such a case may properly be said to <hi>rise again.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that there's a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a Body whose Particles are <hi>gradually</hi> chang'd in a continu'd union with the Soul, and a Body whose Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are chang'd, not <hi>gradually,</hi> but all together. Altho' in the case suppos'd,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66134:71"/>
the Body is understood to be the same, and may properly be said to <hi>rise again,</hi> tho' it has not any the same Particles, yet when the Soul is separated from the Body, if that Body be dissolv'd, and <hi>new</hi> Particles be form'd into a Body and united to the Soul, it cannot be said to be the <hi>same,</hi> or to <hi>rise again.</hi> I appeal to the common Sense of Mankind.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to shew in the <hi>Second</hi> place, that our Doctrine of the <hi>Identity</hi> of the Body in the Resurrection, is the Doctrine of the Primitive Fathers, the successors of Christ and his Apostles.

            <p n="1">I. St. <hi>Clement,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Companion and <hi>Fellow-Labourer</hi> of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle.

Why are you so hard of believe? Has not St. <hi>Paul</hi> already told you, that the Body in the Resurrection shall not be the <hi>same Humane Body,</hi> as you imagine, but a new one and of a quite different kind?</p>

               <hi>the Resurrection of the flesh was the Doctrine preach'd in the Churches:</hi> But he says that <hi>by the more wise</hi> it was not understood in so gross a sense as <hi>Celsus</hi> represented it.

            <p>So firmly establish'd in the Church was the Doctrine of the Resurrection of the <hi>same</hi> Body, that <hi>Origen</hi> himself, tho' in some places of his Works he advances an Hypothesis not agreeable to it, yet in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places he very plainly asserts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:66134:81"/>
               <hi>whom we may answer thus. If even they themselves confess that there will be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the Dead, let 'em answer us this Question, what that is which died? Is it not the Body? The Resurrection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be of the Body. Let 'em tell us besides, whether they think that we shall have Bodies in the Resurrection, or not? I think, since the Apostle St.</hi> Paul <hi>says, that it is sown a natural Body, and shall be rais'd up a spiritual Body, they cannot deny but that the Body is to rise, or that we are to have Bodies in the Resurrection. Now since it is certain that we are to have Bodies in the Resurrection, and the Body that fell are said to rise again (for nothing but that which fell, can properly be said to rise again) there is no doubt but that our Bodies are therefore to rise, that we may be again cloath'd with 'em. For this by a natural consequence follows from that. For if our Bodies rise again, without all doubt they therefore rise, that we may be again cloath'd with 'em. And if it be necessary that we should be in Bodies, we ought not to be in any other Bodies but our own. Now since it is true that they rise, and that they rise Spiritual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, there is no doubt but that they are to rise again without their Corruption and Mortality: For it would be in vain for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>

               <hi>one to rise from the Dead, that he may die again.</hi> In his First Book <hi>Concerning the Resurrection,</hi> as his Words are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by <hi>Pamphilus</hi> in his <hi>Apology,</hi> he thus disputes for it. <hi>Is it not absurd that this Body which bears the Scars of Wounds receiv'd for Christ's sake, and which, as well as the Soul, endured cruel Torments in Persecutions, and suffer'd the Punishments of Prisons, and Bonds, and Stripes, which was burnt by Fire, cut with the Sword, devour'd by Wild Beasts, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented on the Cross, and many other ways, should be defrauded of the Rewards due to it for so great Sufferings? For does it not seem contrary to all reason, that the Soul which did not suffer alone, should be rewarded alone, and its Vessel, the Body, which serv'd it with great labour, should obtain no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of its Contentions and Victory? that the</hi> Flesh, <hi>which resists its natural vicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Lusts, and preserves its Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity with a great deal of labour, which labour is more the labour of the Body than of the Soul, or at least full as much, should be rejected as unworthy in the time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, and the Soul only obtain the Crown.</hi> To the same purpose are those Words produced by St. <hi>Jerom:</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ad Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machium adv. Joan. Hierosol.</note>

For it is not equitable that the Soul, which sinn'd in one Body, should be punish'd in another: Neither does it become a just Judge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a Body, when it was not that, but another which suffer'd for Christ.</hi> In his Second Book <hi>Concerning the Resurrection,</hi> he had these Words: <note n="†" place="margin">Ap.

               <hi>As we retain</hi> (says he) <hi>the same species (of Body) from our Infancy to our old Age, though the Characters may seem to be much alter'd; so we ought to understand, that the very same Species which now we have, will remain in the Life to come, but chang'd very much for the better. For 'tis necessary that the Soul, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits in Corporeal Places, should have such Bodies as are suited to those Places in which it lives.

               <hi>Bodies of those Creatures are, which do there inhabit; so now, since we are design'd for the Celestial Habitations, it follows that the qualities of our Bodies should be suited to the Glory of those Places.

defence of <hi>Origen</hi> concerning the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> with these Words: <hi>Let them now cease to be Impudent, who say that</hi> Origen <hi>confesses indeed the Resurrection of the</hi> Body, <hi>but denies the Resurrection of the</hi> Flesh. <hi>Let them now leave off re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him when they see that he places the</hi> Flesh <hi>of God the Word in Heaven to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with God the Word.</hi> I shall not here take Notice of the <hi>Dialogue against the Marcionites,</hi> which is extant under <hi>Origen</hi>'s Name, in which the Catholick Doctrine of the Resurrection of the <hi>Same Humane</hi> Body, is zealously asserted and maintain'd against those Hereticks. I do not take it to be <hi>Origen</hi>'s. Yet tis certain that it is very ancient. There are some that reckon <hi>Origen</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Asserters of the <hi>Millennarian</hi> Doctrine, which Doctrine supposes a Resurrection of a true <hi>Humane</hi> Body: But I think it is a Mistake.</p>

alledges in his behalf, it is too too True that he did so.

               <hi>as it has been deliver'd down to us from the Holy Fathers, that the Son of God arose from the Dead in the very same Flesh in which he suffer'd, by which he gave us also hope of a Resurrection. We speak of the Resurrection of the Flesh not in a shuffling and deceitful manner, as some falsly accuse us, but we believe that this very Flesh, in which we now live, shall rise, not another instead of it, neither do we mean any other Body besides this of Flesh. If therefore we say that the BODY shall rise, we speak according to the Apostle, for he uses that Word: If we say that the FLESH is to rise, we make our Confession according to the Tradition of the</hi> Creed. <hi>'Tis a foolish thing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse us as if we thought a Humane Body could be any thing besides Flesh. Whether therefore that which shall rise be called FLESH, according to the</hi> Creed, <hi>or BODY, according to the Apostle, it is so to be believ'd as the Apostle has set it forth, that that which shall rise, shall rise in Power and Glory, and shall rise an Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and a Spiritual Body, that Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall not inherit Incorruption.

            <p>My first Observation is this, That the greatest part of 'em were not only bred up in the Prejudices and Infidelity of the Heathens, but were likewise by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession <hi>Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Lawyers:</hi> And what Opinion the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Greeks</hi> had of the Doctrine of the Resurrection, as profest by the Christians, is very notorious. I have shewn in the beginning of this Discourse, that even among the <hi>Greeks</hi> there were many Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which were founded on an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Tradition concerning the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and that it was in some sense believ'd by many of their Philosophers: Notwithstanding it is certain, that, as it was understood by the <hi>Christians,</hi> it was by all the <hi>Greeks</hi> in general exploded.

               <hi>pitiful Triflers and Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> for asserting it. My conclusion is this: That if the Doctrine of the <hi>Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi> or Resurrection of the very same Body, had not been lookt upon in those Primitive Times as firmly establish'd on the Authority of Christ and his Apostles, if it had been look'd upon only as a <hi>Scholastical</hi> Doctrine, or a <hi>Dogma</hi> that might be dispensed with, those learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and acute Men (of whom we speak) when converted from their <hi>Heathenism,</hi> would never have embraced it, as I have proved they did.</p>
            <p>In the Second place it is worthy to be observ'd, that those Books out of which I have taken their Testimonies, were many of 'em written professedly in Answer to the Objections of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philosophers. And if the Doctrine
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66134:95"/>
of a new <hi>Ethereal</hi> Body, which <hi>Origen</hi> afterwards made bold to advance, could have been warranted by the Scripture, and the Traditions of the Apostles, how gladly would those Fathers have taken hold of it! That the Soul is never without an <hi>Ethereal</hi> Body, was (as we have already observ'd) a common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Greek</hi> Philosophers: Now how easie had it been for those Fathers to answer all the Cavils and Objections and <hi>Flouts</hi> of their insulting Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by proposing this Notion! How easie had it been to remove that great Stumbling-Block which lay in their way to Christianity! They were too learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and too acute Philosophers, not to think on it; but they knew it was not agreeable to the Doctrine <hi>deliver'd to the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be alledged, that the Reason why the Primitive Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd the Resurrection of the same <hi>Humane</hi> Body, was because they believ'd that after the Resurrection Christ is to come upon <hi>Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> are to abide with him here a Thousand Years.</p>
            <p>Perchance you may be apt to suspect, that this was the chief Foundation of that gross Notion which they so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally entertain'd of the <hi>rising</hi> Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:66134:96"/>
To remove such a Suspicion as that is, I need only tell you, that not only the Patrons of the <hi>Millennarian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but such also as rejected that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, asserted the Resurrection of the same <hi>Humane</hi> Body.</p>
            <p>Tho' many of those ancients whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities we have produced, asserted the <hi>Millennium,</hi> such as <hi>Papias,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Sibylline Oracles, Justin M., Iren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>us, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Hippolytus:</hi> Yet others there are amongst 'em, that did not embrace that Doctrine. It does not at all appear, that either St. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or St. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> or <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> or <hi>Tatian,</hi> or <hi>Minucius Felix,</hi> were asserters of it. On the contrary it appears that the wise and learned <hi>Athenagoras</hi> did <hi>not</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. I observe that he asserts, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Resurrection there will be no such Things as <hi>Inanimate</hi> Beings, which is plainly repugnant to the Doctrine of the <hi>Millennium.</hi> In his Discourse <hi>of the Resurrection,</hi> he argues after this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>If God</hi> (says he) <hi>is unwilling to raise the Dead, it is either because it is Unjust, or because it is Unworthy. But it is not Unjust, for if it be so, it must be an Injury either to those that are rais'd, or to some other being. It cannot be an Injury to any other Being: For Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I have now done with my History and Proofs of the Doctrine of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And by this time, I hope, you are so well satisfied of the Truth and certainty of it, as to be ready to ask me that Question of St. <hi>Paul: How say some among</hi> You <hi>that there is no Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?</hi>

The <hi>fourth</hi> and last thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to do, was to answer the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of such as say, <hi>there will be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</hi> And this I shall now in the next place endeavour to do.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> Objection is taken from the Difficulty of it. There are not only many Men whom Necessity and Famine have forc'd to devour one another, but there are many whole Nations in the World that are wont to feed ordinarily on <hi>Humane</hi> Flesh. You may add that we are all in some sense <hi>Canibals</hi> and <hi>Man-eaters,</hi> we <hi>devour</hi> one another, we eat our dead Neighbours, our Brothers, our Fathers, the succeeding Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>swallows down</hi> the former, though we <hi>prey</hi> not upon 'em, in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as some other <hi>Canibals</hi> do, yet, by a subtle <hi>Cookery</hi> of Nature, we eat 'em at <hi>second Hand.</hi> This is true in some Measure: From the Bodies of the Dead springs up <hi>Grass,</hi> this when eaten by the Ox, is turn'd into <hi>Flesh;</hi> this we eat, and the Flesh of the <hi>Ox</hi> becomes <hi>ours. Plutarch</hi>

rich and plentiful <hi>Crop.</hi> Others tell us of a certain <hi>Roman</hi> who fed his Fishes with the Bodies of his Slaves, whom he threw into his Ponds, that he might feed at second Hand on <hi>Man's</hi> Flesh. Now since the substance of one Man's Body, becomes the substance of another Man's Body, how (you will say) can the Bodies of both be rais'd again?</p>
            <p>This Objection is a very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one, and has been all along urg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Doctrine of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> not only by our later <hi>Scepticks</hi> but anciently (as I but now observ'd) by the Heathen Philosophers. I shall not deny, as <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoras</hi> seems to do, that the substance of one Man's Body, when eaten by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, turns to nourishment and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Flesh of that other that eats it. It sufficiently appears that they that eat <hi>Humane</hi> Flesh to satisfie their Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, are reliev'd and cherish'd, and, of consequence, nourish'd by it. But my Answer is this:</p>
            <p>That God Almighty who has engag'd his Promise that the Bodies of all Men shall rise again, will take care so to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all things relating to our <hi>Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as that that may not hinder his Promise from being fullfill'd. He will take care that the Particles of One Man's

Body shall never so become the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of another Man's Body, as that the Resurrection of either should be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by render'd impossible. 'Tis an Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the most accurate <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> grounded on infallible <hi>Statick</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that not above the <hi>Fiftieth</hi> Part of what a Man takes into his Body turns to Nourishment. From hence I make this following Inference:</p>
            <p>Should an Ox, for Example, feed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on such Grass as grew in that Field which was impregnated by the Dead Bodies of the <hi>Cimbrians</hi> (but now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd) as the Grass would not consist wholly of those Particles which belong'd to the dead Bodies, but would chiefly consist of other more common Particles, those of <hi>Rain</hi> and the like, so not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>50th</hi> Part (perhaps a much less proportion) of the Grass which is eaten, would become the Flesh of the Ox, and not above the <hi>50th</hi> Part of that Flesh of the Ox which is eaten by a Man, would be turn'd into the Substance of the Man. Should a Man feed on <hi>Corn</hi> that grew in such a Field, as the Corn would consist not wholly of the <hi>Humane</hi> Particles, but chiefly of others; so not above the <hi>50th</hi> Part of the Corn so eaten would become the Flesh of him that ate it. The
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66134:98"/>
same may be said of him who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed his Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es with the Bodies of his Slaves: As the Fish must be suppos'd to receive their Nourishment from those Bodies, not wholly, but only in part, so not above the <hi>50th</hi> part of the Substance of the Fish (you may say much less, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unfitness of Fish for Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) would become the Flesh of the Eater. It is plain, that even according to the common course and nature of Nutrition, were there no particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence concern'd in the matter, there would be in such Cases but very few Particles in any Man's Body which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd before to another. Should one Man devour another wholly (in this the great Strength of the Objection lies) it appears from <hi>Sanctorius</hi>'s Observation that not above the <hi>50th</hi> part of the Flesh of the Person devour'd would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Flesh of him that ate it. And besides the other 49 parts of the Flesh, there would remain all the <hi>Bones</hi> untouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which make up a great (the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial) part of the Body.</p>
            <p>It is further to be consider'd, that though the same Body that died is to rise again, yet it is not necessary that all the Particles of it should be <hi>rais'd up.</hi> 'Tis enough that such Particles are <hi>rais'd</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:66134:99"/>
as made up the <hi>integrant</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> Parts of the Body. By <hi>necessary</hi> Parts, I mean those which remain after the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most degree of <hi>Maceration,</hi> without which the Body would not be <hi>Integral,</hi> but <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</hi> And these are chiefly the <hi>Bones,</hi> the <hi>Skin,</hi> the <hi>Nerves,</hi> the <hi>Tendons,</hi> the <hi>Ligaments,</hi> and the Substance of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Vessels. As long as these, and all that are necessary to Life, remain, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is truly <hi>Whole,</hi> though never so much macerated. All the Flesh that is added makes nothing at all to the <hi>Wholeness</hi> or <hi>Integrality</hi> of the Body, tho' it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Ornament.</hi> And this is that Flesh which would chiefly turn to Nourishment if the Body were devour'd. The Substance of the Vessels, Tendons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not so apt for Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment. If the <hi>dying</hi> Body be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>macerated,</hi> I do not doubt but that in the Resurrection it will be restor'd by foreign and adventitious Matter to its due and just Proportion. So in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are <hi>full</hi> and <hi>fleshy,</hi> there's a great deal of substance that is not <hi>necessary,</hi> which if it become the Flesh of another Man, the Body may be rais'd up without it, and yet be still <hi>Physically Whole</hi> and truly the <hi>same.</hi> In Bodies that are <hi>Fat</hi> and <hi>Grass,</hi> there is doubtless a great
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:66134:99"/>
deal superfluons, which will never be rais'd up, though it were never made the <hi>Ingredient</hi> of another Man's Body. To sum up all in a word: I say that God Almighty, who has promis'd that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of all Men shall be rais'd up again to Life, will so order all things relating to our <hi>Nourishment,</hi> as that those Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, of which the <hi>necessary</hi> Parts of one Man's Body were compounded, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver become the Particles of the <hi>necessary</hi> Parts of another Man's Body: At least he will take care that they may not continue to be so at the time of his <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Providence has decreed that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>necessary</hi> Particles, but that <hi>all</hi> the Particles of the dying Body shall be rais'd up again, it will take such care of our <hi>Nourishment,</hi> as that the Particles of one Man's Body shall never continue to be part of another Man's Body at the time of his Death. God will take care that no one shall die whilst his Body contains any Particles that belong to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. But (as I said) it is not at all necessary that we should believe thus much.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> in his Treatise <hi>concerning the Possibility of the Resurrection,</hi> in answer to this Objection, which we have now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd, alledges, that it is not necessary
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:66134:100"/>
that any of the same <hi>Flesh</hi> should be rais'd up: 'Tis enough, he says, if the <hi>Bones</hi> are rais'd up and cloth'd with new <hi>Flesh.</hi> And this he proves from the Prophet <hi>Eccechiel</hi>'s Description of the Mystical Resurrection, where (says he) only the same <hi>Bones</hi> were rais'd up, and the <hi>Flesh,</hi> &amp;c. was made up of <hi>new</hi> Matter. But how does it appear that in that Resurrection the <hi>Flesh</hi> is to be understood to be made up not of the <hi>former,</hi> but of <hi>new</hi> Particles?</p>
            <p>He alledges moreover that the Body, which rises, may be said to be the <hi>same</hi> with that which was buried, though it contain in it but a very small part of the same Substance. He observes that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s comparing the <hi>Resurrection</hi> to the <hi>growing of Corn,</hi> seems to justifie the supposition of a <hi>Plastick</hi> Power in some part of the matter of a deceased Body, whereby, being Divinely excited, it may be enabled to take to it self fresh Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and so subdue and fashion it, as thence sufficiently to repair or augment it-self. This is wholly the Hypothesis of <hi>Origen.</hi> He adds, that the Alcalisate <hi>Ashes</hi> of a certain Plant like our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> red Poppy, being sown in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, has been known to produce cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Plants larger and fairer than any of that Kind that had been seen in those
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66134:100"/>
Parts. Which seems, says he, to argue, that in the saline and earthy, <hi>i. e.</hi> the fixt Particles of a Vegetable, that has been dissipated and destroy'd by the Violence of the Fire, there may remain a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Power enabling them to contrive dispos'd Matter, so as to re-produce such a Body as was formerly destroy'd. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to this Plastick Power, residing in any Portion of the destroy'd Body it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he is not willing to have recourse. He rather believes, that God by his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipoten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e will perform the thing, and work up some of the Particles of the deceas'd Body, together with the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Matter, into a Humane Body. And the Body which is so work'd up may be call'd (as he tells us) the <hi>same</hi> Body.</p>
            <p>This is not to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>end the Doctrine of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> but to give it up to it's Adversaries, and to advance another Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine instead of it. For it is not true that a Body so made up, may be call'd the <hi>same</hi> with that which died. How can a <hi>Grain</hi> of Corn, that is grown up, be said to be the <hi>same</hi> with that which was sown? I have own'd already that the <hi>Identity</hi> of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in this Life, does not consist in the <hi>Identity</hi> of <hi>Particles:</hi> I have granted that our Bodies in our <hi>old age</hi> are the <hi>same</hi> with those which we had when <hi>Infants,</hi> or in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66134:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our Mothers Womb, tho they have not in 'em any one Particle the same. But I said withall, and the same I say here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that it does not therefore follow that the rising Body may be the <hi>same</hi> with that which was buried, tho it have not any, or but few, of the same Particles. The <hi>Identity</hi> of the Body here in this Life consists in a sit Construction and Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of successively fleeting Particles of matter. The <hi>Identity</hi> of the <hi>Rising</hi> Body, or it's <hi>sameness</hi> with that which died, can consist in nothing else but in the Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the same Particles of Matter, which made up the <hi>necessary</hi> Parts of the <hi>dying</hi> Body, to their former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p>Another Objection concerning the Difficulty of the Resurrection, is this: We are told by some, that allowing Five or Six Foot deep in <hi>Church-yards</hi> and <hi>Burying-places,</hi> and One Foot deep in other parts of the Earth where the Particles of Humane Bodies may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sos'd to have been drop'd and scatter'd by the Wind, there will hardly be fit Matter enough in the whole <hi>Surface</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> to make up so many <hi>Humane</hi> Bodies as there have been, and will be, in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:66134:101"/>
Should I shew that here in <hi>England</hi> alone, which is but a very small Part of the Globe of the <hi>Earth,</hi> if you go but <hi>One single Foot deep,</hi> there is as much Substance as would make up all the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Mankind that ever were, or ever will be, tho' the World should last in all 10000 Years; should I shew thus much, I suppose it would be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the weakness of this Objection would be sufficiently expos'd. I shall not only undertake to prove that, but I shall undertake to demonstrate that in less than the <hi>17th</hi> Part of the Kingdom (which is much less than the biggest of our Counties) there is more than enough to do it. I demonstrate it thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It appears by the best Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that there are in <hi>England</hi> about <hi>Forty Millions</hi> of <hi>Acres:</hi> In every <hi>Acre</hi> there are 43560 square Feet. There are therefore in the whole Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1742400000000 Square Feet.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Its suppos'd by the most Judicious, that in all the World there may be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at one time, old and young, about <hi>Three Hundred Millions</hi> of People. It appears by the <hi>Weekly Bills,</hi> that there are born and die every Year about the <hi>Thirtieth</hi> Part of Mankind. Therefore <hi>Thirty</hi> Years must be allow'd for one
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:66134:102"/>
Age. Now if we multiply <hi>Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Millions</hi> by as many <hi>Thirties</hi> as are contain'd in 10000 Years, the whole Number of Mankind in 10000 Years will amount to but little more than 99999000000, which is not the <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth</hi> Part of the Number of square Feet contain'd in <hi>England.</hi> By allowing <hi>three hundred millions</hi> one Age with another, I have allow'd much more than <hi>three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Millions</hi> to be at this time living in the World. For in the first Ages of the World, and after the <hi>Floud,</hi> there were but very few.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A <hi>solid</hi> Foot of <hi>common</hi> Earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it Substance more than enough to make up a <hi>Humane</hi> Body, Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children consider'd one with another. For it weighs about <hi>Five<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and Thirteen</hi> Pound; whereas the weight of an ordinary <hi>Man</hi> is no more than <hi>Ten Stone,</hi> or <hi>Sevenscore</hi> Pound. If therefore allowance be made for the Bodies of <hi>Women,</hi> who generally weigh much less than <hi>Men,</hi> and for those of <hi>Children</hi> under <hi>Sixteen</hi> Years of Age, who are <hi>half</hi> the Number of Mankind (Infants under <hi>Five</hi> Years of Age, who weigh but very little, are reckon'd one <hi>Quarter</hi> of Mankind) I say, if we make this allowance, it will plainly appear
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:66134:102"/>
that the weight of a <hi>Humane</hi> Body, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one with another, is not so great as the weight of a <hi>Solid</hi> Foot of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Earth. It is manifest therefore, that in less than the <hi>Seventeenth</hi> Part of <hi>England,</hi> if you go but <hi>One Foot</hi> deep, there is as much Substance as would make up all the <hi>Humane</hi> Bodies that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were, are, and will be, tho' the World should last in all 10000 Years.</p>
            <p>We will give the Objector leave to suppose that the World will last in all 20000 Years, and that there are in the World, one Age with another, <hi>Six Hundred Millions</hi> of <hi>Humane</hi> Bodies, yet in less than one <hi>Quarter</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England,</hi> there would be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Foot of the <hi>Surface,</hi> more Earth than would weigh down all. I need not here put him in mind that the <hi>Sea</hi> has devour'd many Millions of Bodies.</p>
            <p>It appears from what has been said, that the Resurrection of <hi>all</hi> the Bodies of Mankind is not <hi>impossible.</hi> And since it is not <hi>impossible,</hi> there is not any <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty</hi> in it. For all things that are <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,</hi> are <hi>equally easie</hi> to an Omnipotent Agent. 'Tis an Assertion of <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Pliny</hi>'s (as has been already observ'd) That <hi>God</hi> himself is not able to raise up a dead Man to Life. But whatever he thought of his <hi>Gods,</hi> and whatever were his
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66134:103"/>
Notions concerning the Power of the <hi>Deity,</hi> there is no one now can doubt of God's Power and Sufficiency.</p>
            <p>I need not endeavour to demonstrate that he is able to distinguish and to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together the confus'd and scatter'd Particles of our several Bodies, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever blended, and workt in with other Matter, and to range and mould 'em as they were before. I need not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to demonstrate that he is able to provide that the Particles which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the <hi>necessary</hi> Parts of one Man's Body, shall never belong to the <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> Parts of another, or that they shall not be the Particles of another at the time of his Death. He that created all the Particles that are in the Universe, He that made all the Bodies, that ever were, out of 'em, He <hi>in whose Book</hi> are all our <hi>Members,</hi> and our Particles, <hi>written,</hi> how can he be ignorant to what uses each Particle has been put, and where they are all reposited? He who first created our Bodies, and form'd 'em of the <hi>Dust</hi> of the Earth, how can it be difficult for him to raise up the <hi>Dust</hi> of the <hi>Grave,</hi> and make it <hi>declare his Truth?</hi> He that first commanded <hi>Man</hi> to come as it were out of Nothing, what can hinder but that he should be obey'd when he shall be pleas'd to command
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:66134:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>the Children of Men to come again?</hi> If so <hi>mean</hi> a Thing as a <hi>Loadstone</hi> can distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and gather together the little Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of <hi>Iron</hi> that lie confus'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguish'd in the Dust; how much more shall the <hi>Almighty Magnetism</hi> of Him that made the <hi>Loadstone,</hi> be able to distinguish and raise up together the confused and lost Particles of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? If <hi>Mercury,</hi> when dead and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd, can, even by the Power of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> be reduced and restor'd to its <hi>Life</hi> and Being, how much more shall the great <hi>God of Nature</hi> be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and restore our dead and dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Bodies to their former State? I shall not any longer insist on these things. There is no one can doubt of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection on the account of the difficulty of it, but such as with the <hi>Athenians</hi> worship an <hi>Unknown</hi> God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Objection is taken from the <hi>unworthiness</hi> of these our Bodies, and from their <hi>unfitness</hi> to be made the Habitation of the <hi>Soul</hi> in the next Life, which is to be in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.</hi> The Consideration of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pureness</hi> of these our Bodies made the Heathen Philosophers <hi>deride</hi> and <hi>abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> the Doctrine of the Resurrection.

            </p>
            <p>I shall not say, in answer to <hi>Celsus,</hi> that the Soul will ever desire to return to the Body purely for the Body's sake, Neither are we to regard what the Soul might perhaps desire, but what God has order'd to be done. Were the Soul to <hi>wish</hi> without any regard to the Will and Good-pleasure of God, I am apt indeed to believe she would hardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be re-conjoined to her Body. But neither would she wish to be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Body whatever: She would not be what she is, not a <hi>Soul,</hi> but a <hi>Seraphim.</hi> But is the <hi>Clay to say to the Potter, Why dost thou make me thus?</hi> The Ambition of the Soul must stoop to the Pleasure of God. Her Wishes and Desires must all con-center in the Will of her Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Maker and Preserver.

               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:66134:104"/>
which he shall think fit to assign her. When he shall be pleas'd to command her to return to her old Habitation, tho' it were as to a <hi>Prison,</hi> she must humbly and resignedly submit to his good Pleasure: <hi>Behold the Handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why should we imagine that the Soul, when she shall be remanded to her Body, will look upon herself as sent to a <hi>Prison?</hi> That <hi>House,</hi> which was once a <hi>Prison,</hi> may be turned to a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> and such a one too as the <hi>Owner</hi> of it would be glad to live in forever.

When God shall be pleas'd to raise it up out of the Grave, it will drop all its <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Restiveness,</hi> together with its <hi>Impurities,</hi> and carry up nothing with it but its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Gentleness,</hi> and a Will to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd. Those <hi>Traces,</hi> which sensible Pleasures had imprinted on it, will be all perfectly Obliterated, and the new <hi>Impressions</hi> which it will receive will be truly worthy of Heaven and Eternity. Had our Bodies heretofore many Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities? Were they <hi>sickly,</hi> or <hi>maim'd,</hi> or <hi>crooked,</hi> or <hi>old,</hi> or otherwise deform'd? These Infirmities and all Imperfections are now done away. The Body is <hi>new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast,</hi> the <hi>Mold</hi> work'd better, and the <hi>Mettal</hi> refin'd: The whole <hi>Figure</hi> comes out with Vast Improvements; though the same as to all the <hi>Ideal Rudiments,</hi> yet a much more curious and delicate Piece of Workmanship. Whatever it was heretofore, it has now no <hi>real</hi> Deformity, no <hi>Wrincle,</hi> or <hi>Blemish,</hi> but
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:66134:106"/>
all is turn'd to <hi>Comeliness</hi> and <hi>Beauty.</hi> At least we shall then have a truer No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Deformity,</hi> and that which now passes for <hi>Ugliness</hi> will then appear to be no such thing.</p>

               <hi>Hoec est vera resurrectionis Confessio, quoe sic gloriam carni tribuit, ut non aufe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat veritatem.</hi> So † St. <hi>Jerom.</hi> And that <hi>Confession</hi> we must stand to. Now, how far these Bodies of ours are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being exalted and glorified, so as still to continue truly <hi>Humane,</hi> I shall not presume to determine. I am not fond of walking in the Dark, especially when it is to little or no purpose: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you desire to know what my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents are concerning our future State, and are pleas'd to ask me that Question, <hi>How are the Dead rais'd up? And with what Body do they come?</hi> I must own my-self inclin'd to believe that our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in the Resurrection will be, as to their <hi>Purity, Constitution,</hi> and <hi>Liveliness,</hi> the same with that of <hi>Adam</hi> when first it came from the Hands of its Maker with the Stamps and Characters of the Divine Goodness and Wisdom fresh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. That was the true <hi>Exemplar</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> All the Difference, I think, will be this, That <hi>Adam's</hi> Body after
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:66134:106"/>
some little Time stood in need of Meat and Drink to supply its Evacuations, and was fitted to make him the Father of Mankind; Ours in the Resurrection will continue always the same, without <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,</hi> or any other Evacuation. The <hi>Springs</hi> will always have the same <hi>Bent,</hi> the <hi>Motions</hi> will all be equally <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> the same continual <hi>Round</hi> of the same pure vigorous Spirits, and the same Blood moving forever in a brisk but <hi>even</hi> Circulation. The Apostles Epithets' of <hi>Powerful,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Celestial,</hi> and <hi>Glorious,</hi> and all that the Scripture says of our Transformation into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine likeness, I take to signifie no more, than this <hi>even,</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>dispassionate,</hi> and <hi>incorruptible</hi> State of the Body, with a perfect Refinement of all our Faculties. This perhaps is much less than what some others are willing to allow to a <hi>glorified</hi> Body: But I see no Reason why we should expect any higher Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation. And if such be the State and Condition of it, I know no Reason why we should desire any higher. This Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Frame is enough to make us truly Happy and Blessed, no less than if our Bodies were <hi>Ethereal,</hi> and our Souls were carried in those fine <hi>Celestial Chariots</hi> which the Heathen Philosophers talk of.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:66134:107"/>
If <hi>Adam</hi> had not sinn'd, these very same Bodies had then been <hi>Immortal</hi> and wholly exempted from Death: Why then should we think it strange that the <hi>Immortal</hi> Bodies which God will bestow on us in the Resurrection, should be truly <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane?</hi> The <hi>Immortality</hi> of these Bodies was then intended as a Blessing; and shall we not think it a Blessing worthy of the Donor, to have the same Body restored to a better State than that from which it was fallen? Yes! This is enough, and This is all I desire, and This I hope to obtain. Let this my Body, this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same Body, be made pure, my Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wash'd away, my Passions subdu'd my Wants remov'd, my Understanding clear'd, my sense of true Pleasure enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd, let this be but done, and my Soul will desire no more. Her <hi>old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,</hi> when blessed with these hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Transmutations will be truely wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to her. Neither She nor the <hi>Angels</hi> will ever be asham'd of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Let this be but done, and I shall not think the grossness of it to be any Diminution of my Happiness. I shall not envy the Glory of <hi>Incorporeal</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but shall heartily thank God, that <hi>I am what I am.</hi>

A <hi>Fourth</hi> Objection is concerning the unfitness of a <hi>Humane</hi> Body to be plac'd in Heaven on account of its <hi>Gravity.</hi> How can a <hi>Humane</hi> Body, that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>heavy,</hi> be sustain'd in a pure <hi>Ethereal</hi> Heaven? I answer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If those Regions of Heaven, where the Saints are hereafter to have their Habitation, be all <hi>fluid</hi> and <hi>Ethereal,</hi> or even <hi>void Space,</hi> yet our Bodies may without the least difficulty, and without any Miracle, or particular Care of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence be there supported and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd. There is no such thing as <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> in Regions <hi>purely Ethereal</hi> which are above the <hi>Reach</hi> and <hi>Activity</hi> of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Orbs.</hi> There is no <hi>High and Low</hi> in such Places. Our Bodies will be there sustain'd, as the Globe of the Earth, and the several celestial <hi>Orbs,</hi> are now sustain'd in the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Ether.</hi> Which is not done by a <hi>Miracle:</hi> for they are <hi>Naturally</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd there, and there is not any Low to which they may encline. There is nothing indeed (properly speaking) <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> in its own Nature, as there is not any thing Light in its own Nature. And our Bodies even here in this World do not of their own Natures tend towards the Center of the Earth; but they are violently <hi>haled</hi> of <hi>push'd</hi> down. Had
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:66134:108"/>
there been no <hi>external Causes</hi> of what we call <hi>Gravity</hi> contriv'd by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, there would have been no such Thing, no <hi>High and Low,</hi> in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. This no one can deny that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders the <hi>System</hi> of the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the place in which we are to have our Abode in the next Life, is all pure <hi>Ether,</hi> or <hi>Immaterial,</hi> is perhaps not so true as generally suppos'd. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps after all, our <hi>Heaven</hi> will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a <hi>Heaven upon Earth,</hi> or some glorious solid <hi>Orb</hi> created on purpose for us in those immense Regions which we call <hi>Heaven.</hi> It seems more natural to suppose that since we have solid and material Bodies, we shall be placed, as we are in this Life, on some solid and material <hi>Orb.</hi> Neither is this a <hi>new</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but embrac'd by many of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.

            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> and last Objection, which is concerning the <hi>uselessness</hi> of a <hi>Humane</hi> Body in the next Life, and the <hi>unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sariness</hi> of raising up the <hi>same</hi> that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Our Adversaries perhaps are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to grant that there is no impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the Resurrection, and that the Body being purified and exalted to the highest degree of <hi>Humane</hi> Perfection,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:66134:109"/>
may be worthy of the Heavenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: But however, say they, it is not agreeable to the Divine Wisdom to raise up the <hi>same Humane</hi> Body. Why not? Why, he acts, says the <hi>Etherealist,</hi> in all things wisely, and for some <hi>end:</hi> But to what purpose should he raise up the <hi>same</hi> Body, when <hi>a new one</hi> will serve as well? and to what purpose should he again invest the Soul with a <hi>Humane</hi> Body, when the several Parts of it are <hi>useless?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In answer to this, its commonly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the same Humane Body must rise again, and be united to the Soul, that together with the Soul, it may be either rewarded or punish'd for the Good or Evil we did in this Life.

            <p>I desire as much as any Man to pay a just Deference and Regard to the Judgments of the ancient Fathers: But it must be confes'd, that tho' their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority be great in Matters of <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> yet the <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> which they produce to confirm their Doctrines, are not always convincing. If we se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously and impartially consider this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, we shall find it not to be true. My reasons, in short, are these. <hi>First,</hi> To speak properly, the <hi>Body</hi> is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable either of <hi>sinning,</hi> or <hi>doing well.</hi> It is only the <hi>Instrument</hi> of the <hi>Soul.</hi> And the <hi>Arm</hi> that <hi>stabs,</hi> sins no more than the <hi>Sword.</hi> 'Tis the Soul only that is the <hi>Murderer.</hi> Neither, <hi>Secondly,</hi> is the <hi>Body</hi> capable of any Reward or Punishment. 'Tis the <hi>Soul</hi> only that is <hi>sensible,</hi> and nothing but what is <hi>sensible</hi> can be capable of Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If it be Injustice in God
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:66134:110"/>
to punish the Soul alone without the <hi>Body</hi> in conjunction with which she committed the Sin, then all the <hi>Matter</hi> which constituted the Body when the several Sins were committed, must be rais'd again, and be re-united to the Soul. For if some, why not all? But what <hi>Monsters of Men</hi> should we be in the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> if all the Substance of which our Bodies consisted from our <hi>Childhood</hi> to our <hi>Deaths,</hi> should be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd together and form'd into a Body.</p>
            <p>'Twas the Opinion of some of the ancient Hereticks, That the Souls of Men <hi>Die,</hi> and are <hi>dissolv'd</hi> together with the Body, and <hi>revive</hi> and <hi>rise</hi> again with it in the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> Which Opinion sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the <hi>Soul</hi> to be <hi>material</hi> as well as the <hi>Body,</hi> which many of the ancient Christians, who were not look'd upon as <hi>Heretical,</hi> believ'd. <hi>Eusebius</hi>

               <hi>de Testimonio Animae: To enjoy everlasting Happiness, or to sustain everlasting Torments, it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that thou shouldest be restored to thy former Substance, because thou art not capable of feeling either Pleasure or Pain without Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this Opinion were true, That the Soul is not capable in its own nature, without an <hi>organiz'd</hi> Body, of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, (I take no notice here of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opinion concerning the <hi>death</hi> and <hi>dissolution</hi> of the Soul) we should not need to look any further for a reason why God has ordained that the Soul should be again united to a <hi>Humane</hi> Body; since it would not otherwise be capable after death of being either <hi>Rewarded</hi> or <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And it must be confess'd that this Notion is very consistent with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:66134:112"/>
of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and the general <hi>Judgment,</hi> which is to follow the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> But here lies the difficulty: I know not how to make it consistent with some other Places of the Scripture. The Scripture is plainly against it. When our Saviour tells the penitent Thief upon the Cross, <hi>This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise,</hi> He seems to intimate that he should be <hi>sensible</hi> of that happiness. That Wish of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1 <hi>st</hi> of the <hi>Philip.</hi> That he might <hi>depart and be with Christ,</hi> seems yet more clear and convincing. The Apostle seems plainly to intimate, that <hi>being with Christ,</hi> he should be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it. That St. <hi>Paul</hi> believed that the Soul after its Separation from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy remains <hi>sensible,</hi> and is capable of <hi>perceiving</hi> without any <hi>Organs</hi> of Sense, I inferr moreover from that Place where he speaks of his being rapt up into Heaven, which others (I think) do not usually take notice of. He says that <hi>he could not tell,</hi> whether he was rapt up into Heaven, and saw there those unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sights in the Body or out of the Body. Now he could not have doubted of that, if he had not believed that the Soul is <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> when <hi>out of the Body.</hi> To this we may add that Place of St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> where he says <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> that he saw in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book <hi>De Resurrectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Carnis,</hi> where he owns that <hi>separated</hi> Souls do not <hi>Sleep,</hi> but are <hi>sensible,</hi> and are actually punish'd or rewarded before the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> says <note n="a" place="margin">C. 17.</note> they are punish'd or rewarded before the <hi>Resurrection</hi> for those good or bad things which they did without the concurrence of the <hi>Body,</hi> as for good or bad <hi>Thoughts, Desires,</hi> and <hi>Contrivances;</hi> and he seems to intimate that tho' the Soul is in its own nature ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Rewards and Punishments, yet it is not in its own nature <note n="b" place="margin">Porro <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

must be punished or rewarded in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that the Pleasure or Torment may be perfect.

            <p>If it be not Presumption to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one to search into God's <hi>Counsels,</hi> and the Reasons of his <hi>Decrees,</hi> I should think that one Reason why he has been pleas'd to decree that the Soul in the Day of Judgment shall be again uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a <hi>Humane</hi> Body, may be this; That as we are <hi>Men</hi> when we <hi>sin</hi> or <hi>do well,</hi> so we may be <hi>Men</hi> when by
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:66134:114"/>
a judicial Sentence we are punish'd or rewarded for it. But we cannot be <hi>Men</hi> unless we have <hi>Humane</hi> Bodies. St. <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cor.</hi> c. 5. v. 10.</note> tells us, that we must all appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment-Seat of Christ, that every Man may receive the Things <hi>done</hi> in the Body, <hi>according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad.</hi> And as we are to give an account for what we did <hi>in the Body,</hi> so <hi>in the Body</hi> we shall give an account. If it be reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that we should be <hi>Men</hi> when we are punish'd or rewarded for what we did when <hi>Men;</hi> it seems much more reasonable that we should be then the same <hi>Men:</hi> But we cannot be the same Men unless we have the <hi>same Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi> 'Tis a great Mistake to imagine that the <hi>Identity</hi> or <hi>Sameness</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi> consists wholly in the <hi>sameness</hi> of the <hi>Soul.</hi> If <hi>Euphorbus,</hi> and <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> had had <hi>one and the same</hi> Soul, yet they would not have been <hi>one and the same,</hi> but Three distinct <hi>Men.</hi> In what the <hi>Identity</hi> or <hi>sameness</hi> of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> consists, that That of the <hi>Rising</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can consist in nothing else but in the Restauration of the same Numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Particles, which made up the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved</hi> Body, to their former Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I have already told you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:66134:114"/>
Another Reason why God has been pleas'd to ordain that the <hi>same Humane</hi> Body that died shall rise again and be reconjoin'd to the Soul, I take to be this: (and this indeed I take to be the First and the Chief Reason of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.) We had all been <hi>Immortal Men,</hi> if <hi>Adam</hi> had not sinn'd; 'twas God's design that we should never die, but that our Souls should remain for ever united to their Bodies. This gracious Design being frustrated by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, he was graciously pleas'd to ordain, that as in <hi>Adam</hi> all die, so by the Merits of Christ, the <hi>second Adam,</hi> we should all at last triumph over Death, and be restored to those <hi>Bodies,</hi> and that <hi>Humane Nature</hi> which he first design'd should be <hi>Immortal.</hi> By the Death and Resurrection of Christ our Losses are to be repair'd which <hi>Adam</hi>'s sinning occasion'd; but our Losses cannot be repair'd unless we are restor'd to those Bodies which by his sinning we lost.</p>
            <p>Will neither of these Reasons satisfie the <hi>Etherealist?</hi> Well, then I will give him another. I will give him a most certain Reason why God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store us to our <hi>Humane</hi> Natures, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:66134:115"/>
why he will raise up the very same Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. <hi>he will because he will.</hi> A very bad Reason to be given for the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Man,</hi> but a very good one for <hi>God's!</hi> He will because he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd. <hi>I am the Lord, and I have said it</hi> (says he) and <hi>who can say, What doest thou?</hi> There is nothing, that God does, but He does for a very good Reason: But who are We, that we should call him to an Account for what he does? His ways and his Counsels are many of 'em <hi>unsearchable</hi> to us, and as <note n="a" place="margin">33. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Job</hi> tells us, <hi>he giveth not account of any of his Matters.</hi> 'Tis his part to act, ours to admire and submit, and as long as our <hi>Reason</hi> and our Senses are not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradicted, we are only to enquire <hi>What,</hi> not <hi>How,</hi> or <hi>Why?</hi>

            <p>I would fain know of those who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Resurrection of the same <hi>Humane</hi> Body, because they do not know what use we can have of the particular Parts of such a Body in the life to come, whether they deny or doubt of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of all other things, the Reason of which they cannot comprehend? I should undertake to quiet all the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of those Men, and to satisfie all their <hi>queries,</hi> if they would be but pleas'd to undertake to answer a few
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:66134:115"/>
Questions of mine. I could ask 'em the Reason of a hundred Things both in <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Divinity,</hi> but to bring my Questions home to the Case before us; If they will not believe that in the Life to come we shall have <hi>Humane</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, because they cannot see to what uses our several Parts can then serve, let 'em tell me to what <hi>real</hi> Uses all the Parts of our Bodies serve here in this Life. By that time they are able to do that, I believe I may be able to assign them the uses of the several Parts of our Bodies in the Life to come. If they please to cast their Eyes down on their own Bodies, they may there see certain Parts of which there is no <hi>real</hi> Use; such as were bestowed on their Bodies for <hi>Resemblance</hi> Sake only. Why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might not God give us <hi>Humane</hi> Bodies in the next Life, meerly for this Reason (Suppose, if you please that there is no other) that they that <hi>Rise</hi> may <hi>Resemble</hi> or <hi>be like</hi> those that Died, or <hi>be such</hi> as they were? I would ask the <hi>Etherealist</hi> a Question or two more. Let him tell me for what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son God gave us a <hi>Body</hi> here in this Life, why he made us <hi>Corporeal</hi> Beings, since only to have created so many <hi>Souls</hi> or <hi>Spirits,</hi> might have conduced as much,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:66134:116"/>
or, for ought we can see, more, to His Glory, and our Happiness, than to make us, as he has done, of <hi>Body and Soul.</hi> Let him tell me for what Reason we shall have in the Life to come any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at all (as he himself grants we shall have an <hi>Ethereal</hi> one) since the <hi>Soul</hi> is in its own Nature, and without any sort of <hi>Body,</hi> Capable of Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments? In a Word, the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son God had for making us what we are, the same he will have for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us what we shall be, <hi>viz.</hi> His good Pleasure.<hi>—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>I fansie my-self talking <hi>(Philalethes)</hi> to a bold Refiner on the Promises and Decrees of God Almighty, one of those little <hi>Dothings</hi> that call themselves Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, who first form to themselves Notions and Idea's, then deal with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> as the <hi>Tyrant</hi> did with the poor <hi>Innocents</hi> on his <hi>Bed,</hi> either violently stretch it beyond its natural Reach, or chop off a Part to make it commensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to their Inventions.

the quite contrary Method. As a real <hi>Lover of Truth,</hi> and as becomes a true <hi>Christian Philosopher,</hi> you first search the Scriptures, and then the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, and on these agreeing together, as on a sure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Foundation, you raise and build the <hi>System</hi> of your <hi>Belief.</hi> Those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which you find clearly reveal'd, you do not endeavour to puzle with nice Objections and Scruples, nor pervert with anyp rivate <hi>Glosses</hi> and <hi>Conceits</hi> of your own: But as you find 'em so you embrace 'em. You firmly believe, and humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce, and leave the <hi>Contrivance</hi> and the <hi>Reasons</hi> to God. Concerning the Doctrine of the Resurrection of the <hi>same Humane</hi> Body, which, in Obedience to your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, I have endeavour'd to confirm and establish, I shall here, for the close of all, add, That among all the Doctrines of <hi>Christianity</hi> (you understand me of such as are grounded <hi>only</hi> on <hi>Revelation)</hi> there is not any one either more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliver'd in Scripture, or more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convey'd down to us by the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Primitive Fathers, or more universally receiv'd by the Catholick Church, than this is. 'Tis indeed so clearly deliver'd down to us and so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally

receiv'd, that to deny it, and yet at the same time profess the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> seems to imply a <hi>Contradiction.</hi> He that would preach the one must likewise maintain the other. We must do as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did at <hi>Athens: Preach Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and</hi> not only <hi>the</hi> but <hi>This Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
