         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>THE Famous History of Sir <hi>Iohn Hawkewood:</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times PRENTICE of LONDON.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout the beginning of the raigne of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third, there liued in the countie of <hi>Essex,</hi> in the towne of <hi>Henningham Syble,</hi> a man of honest report &amp; reputation; named, <hi>Gilbert Hawkewood,</hi> by his trade and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, a <hi>Tanner,</hi> who among other childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had a son named <hi>Iohn,</hi> a youth forward, and apt for any good impression, or matter which might be imposed on him: Him hee brought vp, in such learning, as might after stand him in steed, and such as those times affoorded, which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently applyed, insomuch as in writing, reading, and casting accounts, and other rudiments of great scollership he exceeded his equalls. So soone as hee came to reasonable yeers, and was fit for the Cittie, his Father brought him to <hi>London,</hi> and bound him apprentize to a Taylor, who were not then called Marchant Taylors, but Taylors, and linnen Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morers:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1917:5"/>
with this Taylor he remained, performing all such duties as others that were his fellow prenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vsed to doe vnto, and for their Masters, vntill the King hauing imployed many thousands of men in his conquest of <hi>France,</hi> and forced to plant and man many Garrisons, in Citties, Castles, &amp; towns, which he had wonne and taken, sent yet againe into <hi>England,</hi> for new supplie of Souldiers, pressing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny house-holders, &amp; seruants to supplie his Armies, and to mannage his intended conquest of <hi>France.</hi> Then was <hi>Iohn Hawkhood,</hi> albeit yong, thought meet and able to serue. Himselfe rather willing to be so imployed, then to sit all day on a shoppe boord making trusses, sowing stockins, or fashioning, or shaping of Garments. His spirit &amp; Genius leading him rather to follow Arms after the sound of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet and drumme, then be at the hand, at the call of his master or mistres. To <hi>France</hi> he went, as also many other prentises of his acquaintance and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars, He serued an Archer, with his bowe &amp; shafts, in no better place then a common Sentinell, or of the still watch, as it then was termed, and in short space, (such was his cariage, valour, and courage) that he was promoted to be a commaunder, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, after a Sergeant, then Ancient, after that Liuetenaunt, and last of all Captain, and serued with his company of two hundred and fifty men, all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, with such good and happy successe, as that he was euermore preferred to the best and most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous oppositions of the enemy. The black Prince his generall, hauing a watchfull eie of his behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and his valour, louing him, and esteeming him more then ordinary, oftentimes called him to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in weighty affaires, and found him to bee of an excellent sharp, and deep iudgement; and often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his aduise before others, who were esteemed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1917:5"/>
much more worthy, and were become famous for their councell: neither was his estimation only for councell, but for execution, he surpassed in speede &amp; forwardnesse his fellow Captaines. The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of his seruices are not recorded, but lie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, and couered in the names of chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannders and Generalls. Let this sufice, that for his valiant exploits and hardinesse hee was dignified with the honour of Knighthood. Albeit hee was thought the poorest Knight in the Army. He was in possibility of great preferment, and of great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, if those wars of <hi>France</hi> had continued: but the French ouerwearied, &amp; driuen to narrow straights, were right glad to conclude a peace, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and made in <hi>Brittaine,</hi> at or neer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Chartires,</hi> in thee yeer of our Lord 1360.</p>
               <p>The black Prince with the chiefest of his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were after imployed in the warres of <hi>Spaine,</hi> many returned for <hi>England,</hi> and others could not by any meanes be drawne from out of <hi>France:</hi> and from such places and preferments, as with their swords they had purchased. But <hi>Iohn Hawke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> ioyning himselfe and his company with such as were called the new men, or late commers, determined, to séek better fortunes, and raise his estate with the spoile of his enemies, and so with a setled resolution to passe through the East parts of France vnto <hi>Italy,</hi> to follow the warres there. Hee tooke his iorney in despight of any powres that could be made to resist him, through <hi>Champaigne, Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Daulphine,</hi> and came into <hi>Prouince,</hi> euen to the very gates of <hi>Auignion,</hi> where the <hi>Pope</hi> kéepes his Court, &amp; residence of Cardinalls: Great and exceeding rich were the spoiles which hee and his Followers gat in this iorney: but much more was the honour, fame, and renoune which he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1917:6"/>
Hee neuer attempted, but he conquered, nor neuer skermished, or fought battaile, but euermore hée bare away the victory. Hée was the sole and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Commander of all which followed him, which of their apparrell, which hée newly made for them, were called the white band, which consisted of fiue thousand horse, and one thousand and fiue hundred foote, whereof the most part were <hi>Englishe,</hi> and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>
               <p>Thus entred he into <hi>Lumberdy,</hi> and was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Marques of <hi>Mountferratto,</hi> a great Prince, who made vnto him large payment, and royall pay, to the full content of himselfe, his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and Souldiers: besides, rich spoiles, which they obtained and gat of the Marques enemies. In these wars he spent some time, to the great honour and fame of our <hi>English</hi> Nation.</p>
               <p>At this time <hi>Lionell</hi> the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> third sonne to King <hi>Edward,</hi> arriued in <hi>Italy,</hi> with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable company, to marry the Lady <hi>Violetta,</hi> daughter to Uicount <hi>Galeasius,</hi> Duke of <hi>Millan,</hi> which gaue vnto Sir <hi>Iohn Hawkewood</hi> occasion to take leaue of the Marques, and become a follower of the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> to the marriage: where, more<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like a Courtier, then a Souldier (trained vp as he was) he behaued himselfe with such commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and heroyicke carriage, as that hée deserued to bée beloued both of the Duke, and of his Father-in lawe <hi>Galeasius:</hi> but most of all, <hi>Barnabe,</hi> brother of <hi>Galeasius,</hi> a warlike Prince, admired his vertues, and knowing of his valor and resolution, neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to intreate the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> till he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained licence of him that Sir <hi>Iohn Hawkewood</hi> might with his companies serue him in his warres against the state of <hi>Mantua,</hi> which warres hée man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged in behalfe of <hi>Barnaby,</hi> in such sort, as that he

Thus was his glory, honour, and name more spread, and admired, his riches increased, and the more for that <hi>Barnaby</hi> was esteemed and accounted the most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and the worthyest Souldier of his time.</p>
               <p>But to the great wonder of all men, when the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> died at <hi>Alba,</hi> the English men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted from the friendship of <hi>Galesius,</hi> and <hi>Barnaby,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Hawkewood</hi> with his Army, ioyned with their enemies. By meanes of such alteration and change of affections (grounded vpon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions I doe not reade) I finde that many townes and Citties of <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> were spoiled and wasted by his powre: all <hi>Italy</hi> feared him, and well was that Prince which might giue him entertainement. But being yet out of pay, his order was to take one Citty or other, and with the spoile thereof pay his Souldiers, and men of warre. But if they would saue themseluos from spoile and ruine he ransomed them, and would somtimes sell them to such as were enemies to the owners of them. At these times hée tooke the Townes of <hi>Faensa,</hi> and <hi>Bagnacauallo:</hi> the one hee sould to the Marques of <hi>East,</hi> for two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Crownes. That of <hi>Bagnacauallo,</hi> he kept and held as his owne a long time; yet at last, <hi>Astrogian Manfredy</hi> gat it from him by treason. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1917:7"/>
weary of being out of pay &amp; wages, hee was sent vnto Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the twelueth, whose Citties in <hi>Prouince</hi> reuolted from him, whereupon hee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Sir <hi>Iohn Hawkewood,</hi> and made him his Generall: For whom he recouered all those Citties &amp; townes, which refused his obedience. For which seruice hee was besides his ordinary pay, well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, and by the Popes appointment, made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of fiue great townes. In these warres I reade that he by mischance was once taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but by the great valour and worthines of his Captaines and Souldiers, recouered from out the handes of his enemies, with whom he was most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably vsed and intreated. Hauing ended the warres for the B. of <hi>Rome,</hi> and vtterly refusing to be idle and out of pay, he was solicited by many frée Citties, and states of <hi>Italy</hi> to serue. Amongst whom the Citty &amp; State of <hi>Florence</hi> proffered him most, and them he serued, with great commendation and honour. From them hee went to the <hi>Pysans,</hi> with whom when he had serued a space, hee was againe solicited by the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who increasing his pay, and allowing better meanes to his Souldiers, and followers, obtained his good will againe: with whom hee serued a long time after, with such successe, and increase of his commendation, &amp; glorious renowne, that hee was held and estéemed to bee the onely, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, and the best Souldier that then liued: For hauing an excéeding sharp. ripe, and quick conceipt, hee had learned by long experience in the warres. hee had learned to force occasions, and politiquely to frame his resolutions. He was also speedy in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and whensoeuer occasion required, hée was as hot in fight, as notable in delaies. So that sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry great Captaines who after were most highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouned, procéeded from his schoole, as from an
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1917:7"/>
exact Master of martiall discipline. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits which he atchieued with good successe, were accounted as sure grounds and principles of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like discipline, as well amongst his enemies, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his owne followers. Thus waxed he old in the warres, and after an incomparable renowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all men for his vertues and true valour, hée departed this mortall life at <hi>Florence,</hi> and like a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier was most honourably buried in their Cathedrall Church: and in regard that he had in his life been a notable defender of their Common wealth. The Senate and Citizens in reward thereof, erected a stately Tombe and Monument, with the image of a man on horsebacke, as great as a mighty pillar, for a Monument and testimony of his prowes in warre, and his fidelity to them and their state.</p>
               <p>A great part of his riches and wealth was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>England,</hi> where also his executors, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise his friends at <hi>Hunningham Syble</hi> where he was borne, erected for him a tombe or Monument, arched ouer, and engraued the likenes of Hawkes in a wood flying. This was done in the Parish Church by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Rokeden</hi> Senior, and <hi>Robert Rokeden</hi> Iunior, &amp; <hi>Iohn Cooe:</hi> and to the memory of so worthy a man they builded and founded a Chauntry, whith with the rest is dissolued.</p>
               <p>Hée was by some called <hi>Gyouanno Agutho,</hi> by some <hi>Acutho:</hi> for that the Italians could not well pronounce his name in English. I haue read him called in English Sir <hi>Iohn Sharpe, Sir Iohn Acton:</hi> and <hi>Sir Iohn Hawkewood,</hi> which was indéed his name.</p>
               <p>The Chronicles of <hi>Italy</hi> doe make often and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mention of him, and our Histories doe also re member him: amongst which I haue thought good to set downe the words of <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Walsingham</hi>

And in <hi>Italy</hi> acted wonders, was most highly esteemed and honoured, of whose aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and worthy deedes, the Histories of Italys make large report, who at last there died, and in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia (as I remember hath a most worthy monument erected for him: of these captaines <hi>Hawkewood</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Italians was called <hi>Io.

               </p>
               <p>These captaines as also many others (according to the vse of conquerors) had giuen vnto them lands, offices, and preferments, as keeping of Eastles, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Townes, and countries, which in the behalfe and right of <hi>King Edward,</hi> they with great and stout

               <p>It happened at the same very time, that <hi>Peter</hi> the lawfull King of <hi>Castile,</hi> or <hi>Spaine,</hi> was expulsed his kingdome by his bastard brother <hi>Henry,</hi> and in the yéere 1380. came to <hi>Burdeaux</hi> to the blacke Prince, crauing aid and succor against his vsurping brother. This matter was furthered by the French, who were most desirous of his absence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well knowing that the English Captaines and souldiers would follow him as the Flowre of Chiualry: and the honor and glory of his time.</p>
               <p>The Prince accepted of <hi>Peters</hi> request, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with obtained licence of his Father, to transport or rather lead his Army into <hi>Spaine:</hi> where in a maine battaile fought at <hi>Nazers, Henry</hi> the Fastard was defeated, ouercome, his Army dispersed, and 6000: slaine, and 200. taken prisoners, amongst which the Earle of <hi>Deue</hi> and <hi>Bertrand Clakyn,</hi> were most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable, and men of speciall note.

               <p>Amongst these prisonors the Earle of <hi>Dene,</hi> being (as I said) the most remarkeable and of chiefest note albeit he was challenged by sundry men, whereof some were of the Nobility: yet this iust and wise Prince, who neuer vsed to suffer vertue and valour vnrewarded, nor would not for either fauour or feare doe a meane and priuate souldier any wrong, adiudged the said Earle to be the lawfull prisoner of two valiant Esquires, Souldiers and men of worth and reputation, named <hi>Robert Hall</hi> and <hi>Iohn Shaker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and thereof they obtained his Charter against all others that pretended claime or interest in him.</p>
               <p>The Earle not willing to go with them into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> made request to be ransomed, which was grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

So remained he still in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the youth who (as I can gather) was not then aboue 8. or nine yéeres of age came with these two Esquires into <hi>England,</hi> and in short space he learned the ready pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the English tongue or language; and likewise prospered in all vertue and good quallities, that he was so well beloued of his said Gaurdians or masters, as if he had béene their owne child: Hée on

the other part behaued himselfe houestly, louingly, and most kindly towards them, with such faith and fidelity in their manifold trobles, which for his cause they sustained as was most admirable, and hereafter shall be declared.

               <p>The black Prince the comfort of his Father, and ioy of <hi>England,</hi> shortly after this, departed this life, The good King his Father not able to sustaine the burthen of so great sorrow, liued not long after, but left the son of Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his Nephew to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in his Kingdomes and Crownes, by the name of King <hi>Richard</hi> the second.

               <p>The Duke hauing staid so long in making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision for his iorney, that diuers of his chiefest, Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers grew weary of their charges and expences, and knowing that the matter of this Earle bred his discontent, and was a speciall let and hinderance to his further proceedings, determined to set aside all religion and conscience, and make hreach of the sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, he wholy soeuer, and take from them their prisoner, or bring them back to the Tower: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fifty or sixty chosen men were armed, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly placed to break into the Abbay at seruice time and if no perswasions could preuaile, then with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to set vpon them.
