            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

directly to that portion of it, <hi>Christs Sermon in the Mount,</hi> which is here explaned in this Commentarie; endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring briefly to shew some notes of eminence in these <hi>three Chapters,</hi> for which they deserue among all the <hi>Lords Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies</hi> to haue the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>first three.</hi> And to omit the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> hereof, though <hi>Iesus Christ the Sonne of God,</hi> because the <note n="g" place="margin">2.

            <p>For the first: when the beloued Apostle saith of Christs sayings and doings, that <hi>many things were not written,</hi> and yet<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>some things were written</hi> for the ground and confirmation of our faith, none (I hope) will denie, but these things which were written, were by the H. Ghost iudged more behooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Church, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those which were omitted, whence by good collection it will follow, that things more largely penned were also deemed the more expedient: for why should the holy Ghost in penning be more copious, vnlesse the things propounded were (to vs at least) more pretious? Now search the holy records of Christ throughout, and see what Sermon is so fully registred as this is; vnlesse it were his <note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 14. 15. 16. 17. chapt.</note>

               <p>Before we come to the parts of this Sermon, three generall points are to be scanned, for the clearing of the doctrine following. First, the<note place="margin">1 Time.</note> 
                  <hi>Time</hi> when this Sermon was preached; to wit, in the second yeare of CHRISTS ministerie, vpon this occasion: when Christ <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 6. 7.</note> had wrought a miracle, in cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And when it was day, he chose the twelue Apostles: which done, he came downe into a plaine place neare to the Mount, where he wrought many miracles; but because the people thronged about him to touch him (for there went vertue out of him which cured them) therefore he withdrew himselfe out of the throng
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14013:6"/>
into the Mountaine againe, and there preached this Sermon vnto his Disciples soone after their election; no doubt for this ende, to teach them his will, and also to frame and instruct them so as they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come profitable teachers vnto others.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 Scope.</note>
                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> The <hi>scope</hi> and <hi>drift</hi> of this large Sermon: namely, to teach his Disciples, with all that beleeue in him, to lead a godly, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and blessed life. Although this be euident in the text, yet the Popish<note place="margin">Iansen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But they erre and are deceiued: for Christs intent is to cleare the true meaning of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, which was corrupted by the false glosse of the Iewish teachers; and not to adde any new Law or counsell thereunto, as <note n="b" place="margin">chap. 5. 17. and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Againe, there cannot be giuen vnto man a more perfect rule then <hi>Moses</hi> Law, the summe and scope whereof is, <hi>To loue God with all the heart, with all the soule, and with all the strength;</hi> then which there cannot be greater perfection in a creature. We therefore vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of this worthie ende, must labour to shew the greater care and conscience, to learne and doe the things propounded in this Sermon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3 Whether Matthew &amp; Luke set<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> downe the same Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>
                  <hi>III. Point.</hi> Whether is this Sermon the same, with that which is set downe by <hi>S. Luke,</hi> Chap. 16. v. 20. This question is necessarie, for if they be the same Sermon, then will the one giue great light vnto the other. Men indeede differ in iudgement touching this point: some say they are diuers Sermons; others say they are one and the same: and that opinion is most likely. For first, they haue one beginning and one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the same order of preaching, and the same conclusion, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of them together will plainely declare. Secondly, this Sermon recorded by them both, was made vpon the election of Christs twelue Apostles, a little after the curing of the man with the withered hand. This is plaine in <hi>S. Luke,</hi> and may well be gathered from the doctrine of this Sermon recorded by <note n="c" place="margin">chap. 5. v. 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Matthew,</hi> wherein Christ instructeth his Apostles particularly in their office and calling: which he would not haue done, if he had not formerly called them thereunto. If it be said, that <hi>S. Matthew</hi> recordeth their election afterward in the 10. Chap. <hi>Ans.</hi> In the writings of the Euangelists there be certaine <hi>Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> that is, some things are set downe after, which were done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and some things are set downe before, which were done after, as might easily be prooued by sundrie examples, and in the point in hand
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14013:6"/>
is euident: for the election of the Apostles is set downe by <hi>S. Matthew</hi> in his tenth Chap. vpon occasion of his recording their commission to preach: so that this circumstance of the Apostles election, doth nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prooue these Sermons to be one, <hi>S. Matthew</hi> setting downe the same more largely, and <hi>Luke</hi> more briefly.</p>
               <p>Their Reasons who hold them to be two distinct Sermons, are of no moment. They say, that the Sermon recorded by <hi>S. Luke,</hi> was made on the plaine; this of <hi>Matthew</hi> in the Mountaine: that of <hi>Luke</hi> was made by Christ standing; this of <hi>Matthew</hi> as he sate downe. <hi>Answ.</hi> But <hi>Luke</hi> saith not, that it was made by Christ in a plaine, or standing: onely this he saith, that Christ comming from the Mountaine stoode in a plaine place, and there wrought certaine miracles, and then preached: now all this might be done, and yet Christ might preach this Sermon in the Mount sitting, as <hi>S. Matthew</hi> saith: for the order of this storie is this. Christ beeing maligned of the Iewes, went into a Mount, and there praied; after long praier, he chose the twelue Apostles, and then came downe into a plaine and wrought Miracles, but by reason of the throng which pressed about him to touch him, he went into the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine againe, and there preached this Sermon to his Apostles, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that followed him.</p>
               <p>Thus much in generall. Now we come to the Sermon it selfe: which<note place="margin">Parts of this Sermon.</note> containeth three parts. A <hi>Preface;</hi> the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Sermon; and the <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Preface</hi> or preparation is contained in the two first verses of<note place="margin">I.

Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Author.</note> CHRIST the Redeemer and Mediatour of mankinde, who in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Sermon, must be considered two waies, euen as he is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: first, as <hi>the Minister of Circumcision for the truth of God,</hi> as the Apostle <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> speaketh: whereby thus much is signified, that Iesus Christ as he was man, borne among the Iewes, was vnto them a Prophet and Minister in his owne person, and with his owne mouth was to teach them the will of his Father: which thing was requisite for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing of Gods word, who had promised before to his auncient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by <hi>Moses,</hi> that he would raise vp vnto them a Prophet like vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 3 22.</note> 
                  <hi>whome they should heare in all things that he should speake vnto them:</hi> which prophesie was verified in this Sermon: wherein he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested himselfe to be the Minister of Circumcision vnto them. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, here we must consider Christ as a Prophet like vnto <hi>Elijah,</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha,</hi> who were as Fathers and masters to the rest of the Prophets: for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14013:7"/>
herein he doth not onely teach beleeuers among the multitude, but his own Disciples also, who were afterward to make Disciples vnto Christ, and to build vp further them that did beleeue; yea, this instruction of his Disciples, is the cheife scope of this Sermon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here is noted the <hi>Place</hi> where this Sermon was made, to<note place="margin">2. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Place.</note> wit, a <hi>Mountaine</hi> in <hi>Galile: He went vp into a Mountaine.</hi> This place he chose for two causes: First, to auoide the throng that pressed about him, while he stoode on the plaine, to see him and to touch him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 6. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>there went vertue out of him.</hi> Secondly, that he might haue a fit place, both for himselfe to sit and teach, and for his Disciples and the multitude attentiuely and orderly to heare and learne that wholsome doctrine which he deliuered.</p>
               <p>In this choice of the place, <hi>First,</hi> he sheweth great care and wisdome<note place="margin">1</note> to maintaine outward order in the dispensation of his word: whereby<note place="margin">The vses.</note> he teacheth vs, that in all holy ministrations, outward order is to be kept, and conuenient places chosen, where the word of God may be reuerently and profitably both spoken and heard. <hi>Secondly,</hi> herein he<note place="margin">2</note> sheweth speciall care to dispence his Fathers will when occasion was offered; yea, he declareth his diligence herein: so as it is true, it was <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>meate and drinke vnto him,</hi> thus by teaching the people <hi>to doe his Fathers will.</hi> And this his practise must be a president and example to all Gods Ministers. They must not preach by constraint, but of a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde; yea, they must reioyce and be glad when occasion is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they may dispence the will of God vnto his people. This <hi>Paul</hi> meant in his straite charge to <hi>Timothie,</hi> that <note n="h" place="margin">2. Tim. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>he should be instant, and teach in season, and out of season:</hi> that is, take all occasions to teach the word; following the example of Christ, who staied not, till he came to Ierusalem, or to some Synagogue, but hauing good occasion offered, taught the multitude in this Mountaine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here is noted that <hi>bodily gesture,</hi> which Christ vsed in this<note place="margin">

                  </hi> so when he preached in Nazaret, <note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 4. 16. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>he stood vp and read his text, and then sate downe, and preached vnto them.</hi> And when his Father and mother sought him at the feast, <note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 2. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>they found him in the Temple (sitting) among the Doctors, and asking them questions:</hi> and beeing apprehended, he said to the multitude, <note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 26. 55.</note> 
                  <hi>I sate daiely with you in the Temple teaching.</hi> Now Christ vsed to preach <hi>sitting,</hi> because it was the manner and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of that Church so to doe: <hi>The Scribes and Pharises</hi> (saith <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 23. 2.</note> Christ) <hi>sit in Moses chaire,</hi> where he noteth their gesture in teaching and expounding the Lawe. Whereby we are taught to bee carefull in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14013:7"/>
obseruing all seemely, commendable, and conuenient gestures, which are vsed in that Church, whereof wee are members. If any shall aske whether we may not preach sitting, as Christ did? I answer: if it were the custome of our Church, we might lawfully doc it; for these gestures be indifferent in themselues: but we doe it not, because our custome is otherwise. And so wee may say of preaching with the head couered, which is the manner vsed by the Ministers of the French Churches; but we vse it not, because wee haue no such custome in our Church.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, here are noted the <hi>parties</hi> whom Christ taught, namely<note place="margin">4. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: Heare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> his Disciples; for though he spake in the audience of the multitude, yet herein hee chiefly intended to instruct his Disciples: that is, all those whom he had conuerted by his former Ministerie, and among them principally the twelue Apostles, whom hee had newely chosen to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come teachers of others. This circumstance must be well obserued, for as it helpeth to cleare some points in the doctrine following; so it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth notably, to proue and iustifie the Schooles of the Prophets, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in some teach, and others heare and learne, for this ende, to furnish themselues with gifts, that afterward they may become good and able teachers in Gods Church: for what is this, but to followe the example of Christ, who in this place deliuereth doctrine and instruction to his twelue Apostles, the better to inable them to the faithfull discarge of their holy Ministerie.</p>
               <p>Lastly, in this Preface is noted <hi>Christs manner of speaking,</hi> in these<note place="margin">5. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Christs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</note> words: <hi>And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:</hi> which some doe take to signifie nothing else, but a full and euident kind of speech; as if the holy Ghost had said, <hi>he spake with his mouth:</hi> as wee vse to say in English, <hi>I heard it with mine eares.</hi> But this phrase hath a further meaning, for as <hi>Paul</hi> willing the Ephesians, <note n="n" place="margin">Eph. 6. 1o.</note> 
                  <hi>to pray to God for him, that a doore of vtterance may bee giuen him, that hee might</hi> open his mouth boldly <hi>to publish the secrets of the Gospel,</hi> doth there make that <hi>opening of his mouth,</hi> a more speciall kind of speaking, and of farre more waightie matter, then his ordinary communication; and as <hi>Elihu</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note n="o" place="margin">Iob <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>I will open my lippes, and will answer,</hi> doth thereby import, that his speech should be vpon due consideration, and sound knowledge: so the Euangelist saying, <hi>Christ opened his mouth,</hi> doth thereby meane, that vpon serious meditation vpon sundry points of heauenly doctrine, hee began to speake with liberty and authoritie, and to deliuer vnto them deep matter of waight and great importance: that this is the meaning, may appeare by the conclusion of this Sermon, where it is said, <note n="p" place="margin">Chap. 7. 29</note> 
                  <hi>the people wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred at his doctrine, because he taught as one hauing authority:</hi>

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in Christs addressing of himselfe to speake, all persons must learne<note place="margin">3.

And it may be diuided into 12. heads or places of doctrine: The first whereof, concerneth true <hi>happinesse</hi> or<note place="margin">1. Part: of happinesse.</note> 
                  <hi>blessednesse:</hi> from the 2. verse of this Chapter, to the 13. wherin are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded sundry rules directing men to attaine thereunto. The scope of them all must bee considered, which in generall is this: Our Sauiour Christ had now preached two yeares among the people, and thereby had wonne many to become his Disciples; and among the rest, his 12. Apostles: to all whom hee promised happinesse and life euerlasting, if they would continue in the faith and obedience of his word. Now though they beleeued in him, yet they still remained in the same state for outward things, and became more subiect to outward miseries then before; so as if they iudged of happinesse by their present outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, they might easily suspect the truth of Christs doctrine, and thinke he had deceiued them, because he promised them happinesse, and yet for outward things, their case was farre worse, then before they knewe

him. This our Sauiour Christ considering, doth here goe about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue this false conceit out of their minds; and for this purpose deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth this doctrine vnto them, in the first generall head of his sermon; <hi>that true happinesse before God, is euer ioyned, yea couered many times, with the crosse in this world.</hi> Whereby hee strikes at the roote of their carnall conceit, who placed true happinesse in outward things, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for outward peace and prosperitie vpon the receiuing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
               <p>As this is the scope of the doctrine following, so it stands vs in hand<note place="margin">1</note> to learne the same, and to finde experience hereof in our owne hearts,<note place="margin">The Vse.</note> that true comfort and felicitie is accompanied with manifold miseries in this life. Indeede, carnall wisdome deemeth them happie that enioy outward peace, wealth, and pleasure: but this conceit must be remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and Christs doctrine embraced, who ioyneth true happinesse with the crosse. Secondly, this serueth to teach vs patience in affliction; for it<note place="margin">2</note> is Gods will to temper happines and the crosse together: now this puts life into an afflicted soule, to thinke that Christ will haue his felicitie inioyed and felt in outward miserie. Thus much of this head of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in generall, now we come to the branches thereof.</p>

Indeed we haue many poore among vs, some that by excesse and ryot haue spent their substance, and others that through idlenesse increase their want; as the wandring beggars, a sinnefull and disordered people, who ioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to no Church: but none of these can by their pouertie make iust claime to true felicitie. The blessed poore, are poore in spirit, and this pouertie we must finde in our hearts, if we would knowe our selues to be truely happie; but after triall, this will be found much wanting: for first, if men liue outwardly ciuill, and keepe themselues from grosse sinnes, this thought of pride takes place in their hearts, that they are righteous; and they perswade themselues with the <note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 19. 20</note> 
                  <hi>young man</hi> in the Gospel, that they can keepe Gods commandements. Secondly, let worldly wants befall men, in body, goods, or name, and they are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; yea, their soules are full of sorrow: but for spiritual wants, as blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of minde, hardnesse of heart, vnbeliefe, and disobedience, their hearts are neuer touched. Now whence comes this, but from that pride of heart, whereby they blesse themselues in their estate, and thinke all is well with them in respect of their soules? so that true it is, pouertie of spirit is hard to be found. We therefore must search our selues, and labour to feele our spirituall wants; and looke how <hi>Lazarus</hi> lay for his bodie, at <hi>Diues</hi> gates; so must wee lie at Gods mercie gate in Christ, for our soules, abandoning this pride of heart, and acknowledging that there is no goodnesse in vs of our selues; for the straite gate of heauen cannot receiue a swelling heart that is puffed vp with pride.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, the true ground of this spirituall pouertie. Now, when they are once poore in spirit, they are in a blessed state in the iudgement of Christ. If a man bleed dangerously at the nose, the best way to saue his life, is to let him blood else-where, and so turne the course of the blood another way: euen so, when a man is oppressed with worldly calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, hee cannot finde any comfort in them, for in themselues they are Gods curses; yet if thereby he can bee brought to see his spirituall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, then of curses they become blessings vnto him: and therefore when we are in any distresse, wee must not onely fixe our eies vpon the outward crosse, but by meanes of that, labour to see the pouertie of our soules; and so will the crosse lead vs to happinesse.</p>

And thus much of the persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> Wherein the blessednes of these poore consists; namely, in hauing a right to the kingdome of heauen, <hi>For theirs is the kingdome of heauen.</hi> By <hi>kingdome of heauen</hi> (for the better conceiuing of this<note place="margin">Kingdome of heauen.</note> blessednes) we must vnderstand a state or condition of man, whereby he is in Gods fauour, and hath fellowship with God. The truth of this description is euident by the tenour of the new Testament. Now this estate of man is called <hi>a Kingdome,</hi> because herein God rules as king, and man obeies as Gods subiect: for no man can be in Gods fauour, nor enioy his fellowship, vnlesse God be his King, ruling in his heart by his word and spirit, and he Gods subiect resigning himselfe to be ruled by him: for this happie estate consists in Gods gracious ruling of man, and mans holy subiection vnto God. Indeede, fewe doe see any great happines in this estate, but the truth is, mans whole felicity stands herein: Rom. 14. 17. <hi>The kingdome of God is not meate and drinke, but righteousnes, peace, and ioy in the holy Ghost.</hi> Here the Apostle teacheth vs three things: namely, that when Gods spirit rules in a mans heart, then first, he is iustified, there is <hi>righteousnes:</hi> secondly, he hath <hi>peace with God,</hi> euen that peace of conscience which passeth all vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: thirdly, the ioy of the holy Ghost, which is all vnspeakable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, passing all worldly ioy whatsoeuer. And these three doe notably set out the state of an happie man: which will yet more plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by their contraries in Iudas, who beeing a wretched sinner, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteously betraied his master, and thereupon fell into the miserie of a guiltie accusing conscience, which was the cause of his desperate death, and also that his bodie burst asunder, and his bowells gushed out: now if an euill conscience be so fearefull, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ow blessed an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state is the peace and ioy of a good conscience? which a man then hath when God by his word and spirit ruleth in his heart. Againe, this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state is called the <hi>kingdome of heauen,</hi> because that man in whom Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> by his word and spirit, is alreadie himselfe in heauen, though i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> bodie he be yet on earth: for heauen is like a citie with two gates, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough both of which a man must passe, before he obtaine the full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

gate: the other remaines to be passed thorough at the time of death, which is the gate of glorie, and then he is in full possession.</p>
               <p>Doth true happines consist in this estate, where Christ ruleth and<note place="margin">The vse. 1.</note> man obeies? then here behold the errour of all Philosophers and wise<note place="margin">The error of the world touching happines.</note> men of this world touching happines: for some haue placed it in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, some in wealth, and others in ciuill vertue, and some in all these. But the truth is, it stands in none of these. A naturall man may haue all these, and yet be condemned: for the ciuill vertues of the heathen, were in them but glorious sinnes. Our Sauiour Christ hath here reuealed more vnto vs, then all the wise men of the world did euer know: and hereby we haue iust occasion to magnifie the bookes of Scripture, farre aboue all humane writings, because they doe fully set out vnto vs the nature and estate of true felicitie, which no humane workes could euer doe: we must therefore account of them, not as the word of man, but of the euerliuing God: yea, this must perswade vs to maintaine the bookes of Scripture against all diuellish Atheists, that denie the same to be the word of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hereby we are taught, from the bottome of our hearts, to<note place="margin">2</note> make that petition for our selues, which Christ teacheth in his holy<note place="margin">Pray for Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> prayer; namely, <hi>that he would let his kingdome come:</hi> that is, not suffer sinne, Sathan, or the world to raigne in vs, but by his word and spirit to rule in our hearts, giuing vs grace to be guided thereby in all our waies. We affect nothing more then happines, and therefore we must often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times most seriously make this request to God, preferring this estate with God, before all pleasures and happines in this world, and vse all good meanes to feele in our hearts the power of Christs kingdome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this should mooue vs to heare Gods word with all feare<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Heare Gods word.</note> and reuerence; for by this meanes, the kingdome of Christ is erected in vs: when the word of Christ takes place in our hearts by faith, and brings forth in our liues the fruits of righteousnesse, and true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then may we truely say, the kingdome of heauen is in vs.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Christ ascribing this happie title of his heauenly kingdom to<note place="margin">4</note> them that be poore, and of a contrite heart, doth herein minister a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne<note place="margin">Consolation to the poor.</note> remedie against all temptations, from outward pouertie and distresse: Doubtlesse pouerty is a grieuous crosse, not onely in regard of the want of bodily comforts; but especially because of that contempt and reproach, which in this world doth hang vpon it: wherevpon many doe esteeme their pouertie, as a signe of Gods wrath against them, and thereby take occasion to despaire, thinking the kingdome of darkenes belongeth vnto them. But here consider you poore, this sentence of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14013:11"/>
Christ, where he plainely teacheth, that if a man in outward distresse, can be brought to feele his spirituall pouertie, and the wretchednesse of his soule, by reason of his sinnes; then he is so farre from hauing iust cause to despaire of Gods fauour, by reason of his pouertie, that on the contrary, he may gather to his soule a most comfortable assurance, from the mouth of him that cannot lie, that the kingdome of heauen belongs vnto him.</p>

through his transgressions, he is vndoubtedly blessed: for Christ hath said it, whose word shall neuer faile, though heauen and earth come to nothing. A blessed text, which beeing well applied, will not onely support the heart in great distresse; but recouer the conscience from vnder deepe despaire. Secondly, put case a man were grieuously sicke,<note place="margin">2</note> and that he felt the very pangs of death without all ease to seaze vpon him, so as both speech and sight, with all outward comforts began to faile him; this state were lamentable: yet if in his soule he can truly mourne for his offences, euen in this extremitie, he is blessed. Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> put case a man were taken of his enemies, and his wife and children slaine before his face, hauing their braines dashed out vpon the stones, afterward himselfe put to a most wofull racke and torture: this were an estate more wofull then death: yet herein a man must not iudge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a cast-away, but with mourning for this miserie, he must labour to be sorrowfull for his sinnes, and then he neede not feare what flesh can doe vnto him, for he is blessed. Christs word must stand, let thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse be what it will, if vnder it thou mourne for thy sinnes, blessed art thou. We cannot conceiue while we enioy peace, of the worth of this rule in the euill day: neither doe we know how neere the time is, wherein we shall haue neede thereof; and therefore we must now learne this neuer to be forgotten, to season all other mourning with godly sorrow for our sinnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point. Wherein this blessednes consists;</hi> namely, <hi>in that their mourning shall haue an ende, and be turned into true comfort.</hi> That this is true happines will appeare by the contrarie: for the woe and sorrow that is here begun, and continued in the world to come, is the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the damned spirits, &amp; the portion of the Reprobate, which is endles miserie: &amp; therfore vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that mourne, it is true happines, that they shall receiue comfort. This promise of <hi>Comfort</hi> is accomplished<note place="margin">Foure waies of comfort.</note> foure waies. <hi>First,</hi> when God tempers and delaies the sorrowes and<note place="margin">1</note> afflictions of them that mourne, according to the measure of their strength: 1. Cor. 10. 13. <hi>God is faithfull, and will not suffer you to be tempted aboue that you are able to beare.</hi> This was promised to Dauid and his seede, that <hi>if they did sinne, he would correct them with the rodde of men: but not take his mercie quite from them.</hi> 2. Sam. 7. 14. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> when God remooues the griefe with the causes thereof: thus he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted <hi>Manasses,</hi> who for his abominable Idolatries and witchcrafts, was <hi>carried captiue into Babylon, and there laid in prison, fettered in</hi>

                  <hi>chaines of iron:</hi> yet when he did <hi>mourne vnder that affliction,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>humbled himselfe vnto God for his sinnes, the Lord comforted him, by</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:14013:12"/>
                  <hi>bringing him out of that captiuitie and prison, to Ierusalem into his owne kingdome. Thirdly,</hi> when God giues inward comfort to the heart and<note place="margin">3</note> conscience, by his word and spirit. In this case <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>we reioyce in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>afflictions, knowing that the loue of God is shedde abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost, which is giuen vs:</hi> yea, when he was exceedingly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted aboue his strength, so as he receiued the <hi>sentence of death in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi> hauing no hope of life, yet euen then he professeth, that <hi>as the sufferings of Christ abounded toward him, so his consolations through</hi>

                  <hi>Christ abounded in him. Fourthly,</hi> when God by death puts an ende to<note place="margin">4</note> all their miseries, and brings their soules to eternall life. Thus was <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> comforted, as <hi>Abraham</hi> saith vnto <hi>Dives,</hi> Luk. 16. 25. and thus doth Christ comfort the Theefe vpon the crosse (who with his bodily torment for his leud life, was vndoubtedly touched in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for his sinnes, and therefore desires Christ to remember him when he came into his kingdome) by telling him, that <hi>that day he should be</hi>

                  <hi>with him in Paradise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then we haue a notable remedie against the immoderate feare<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> of death, whether naturall or violent, and of any other iudgement of God: for when death it selfe, or any other miserie whatsoeuer, shall befall vs, if we can there with bewaile our transgressions, we neede not feare, still holding fast this promise by faith in our hearts, <hi>that we shall be comforted.</hi> Secondly, this promise well obserued, may teach vs to<note place="margin">2</note> auoide the perill of this false conceit; <hi>That true faith doth alwaies mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister present comfort.</hi> Many doe herewith perplexe themselues, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring their estate towards God, by that which they feele in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, so as if in time of trouble they finde not present comfort, they iudge themselues voide of faith, and cast out of Gods fauour: but herein they greatly wrong themselues: for though the apprehension of comfort from God in distresse, be a fruit and worke of faith, yet a man may haue true faith, that wants this sense and feeling of present comfort. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse none are blessed that want faith, yet many are blessed that want feeling: for here it is saide, <hi>they that mourne for sinne are now blessed:</hi> and yet it is not said, they are now comforted, but they <hi>shall be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> meaning afterward, in Gods good time.</p>

For the first: The parties blessed, be <hi>the meeke.</hi> That we may know aright who be <hi>meeke,</hi> I will somewhat lay open the vertue of meekenes, and briefly handle these foure points: first,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14013:12"/>
what <hi>meekenes</hi> is: secondly, what be the <hi>fruits thereof:</hi> thirdly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<note place="margin">Foure points touching meeknes. What meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is.</note> it must <hi>be shewed:</hi> fourtly, the <hi>cause</hi> and ground thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I. Point. Meekenes</hi> is a gift of Gods spirit, whereby a man doth moderate his affection of anger, and bridle in himselfe impatience, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and desire of reuenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> The <hi>fruits</hi> of meekenes are principally two: First, it<note place="margin">The fruit of it.</note> makes a man with a quiet and patient heart, to beare Gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts:<note place="margin">1</note> which is a worthie grace of God, and the greatest fruit of meekenes: Levit. 10. 3. When <hi>Aarons</hi> two sonnes <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with fire from heauen, which was a grieuous iudgement, he went to <hi>Moses</hi> to know the cause thereof, who told him, that God would be glorified in all that came neere him; which when <hi>Aaron</hi> heard, <hi>he held his peace,</hi> and was not mooued with grudging or impatience: So <hi>Dauid</hi> beeing in great distresse through the hand of God vpon him, doth notably shew forth this grace, saying, <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 39. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>I was dumbe, and opened not my mouth, because Lord thou diddest it.</hi> Secondly, meekenes causeth<note place="margin">2</note> one with a quiet minde to beare the iniuries men doe vnto him: yea, to forgiue and forget them; and to requite good for euill, referring all reuenge to God that iudgeth righteously. When <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 38. 12. 13. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Dauids enemies laid snares for his life, vttered sorrowes, and imagined deceit against him continually;</hi> yet by this vertue he suffered all patiently, <hi>beeing as a deafe man that heareth not, and as the dumbe which openeth not his mouth:</hi> so farre was he from priuate reuenge. And our Sauiour Christ sets forth himselfe a patterne of this vertue; saying, <note n="c" place="margin">Math. 11. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Learne of me, that I am meeke and lowly in heart:</hi> herein he left himselfe an example that we should follow his steppes, <note n="d" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 23</note> 
                  <hi>who when he was reuiled, he reuiled not againe, when he was buffeted, he threatned not, but referred all to the iudgement of him that iudgeth righteously:</hi> yea, <note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 23. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>he praied for them that crucified him:</hi> So did <hi>Stephen,</hi> Act. 7. 60. <hi>Lord, lay not this sinne to their charge:</hi> so Zachariah the sonne of Iehoida, beeing stoned, saide onely this; <hi>The Lord will see and require it at your hands.</hi> 2. Chron. 24. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. Point. Wherein must this meekenesse be shewed? Ans.</hi> Not<note place="margin">Wherein meeknesse must be shewed.</note> in the matters of God, when his glorie is impeached: for therein we must haue zeale as hote as fire: but in the wrongs and iniuries that concerne our selues. <hi>Moses</hi> was the <hi>meekest man</hi> vpon the earth in his time, Numb. 12. v. 3. and yet when the Israelites had made a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den calfe, in zeale to Gods glorie, <note n="f" place="margin">Exod 32. 19. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>hee brake the two tables of stone;</hi> &amp; <hi>put to the sword that same day, three thousand men,</hi> of them that had so dishonoured God. <hi>Dauid</hi> also, that held his tongue at his owne wrongs, <hi>did consume away with zeale against his enemies that forgat</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:14013:13"/>
                  <hi>Gods word,</hi> Psal. 119. 139. And our Sauiour Christ, who as <hi>a lambe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the shearer opened not his mouth</hi> for the wrongs done vnto himself; did yet in rescue of his fathers glorie, <hi>make a whip of cordes, and driue the buyers out of the Temple, who made his Fathers house a denne of theeues:</hi> Math. 21. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV. Point.</hi> The <hi>cause</hi> and <hi>ground of this meekenesse,</hi> is <hi>affliction and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ground of meeknesse.</note> 
                  <hi>pouertie of spirit,</hi> as the order of these rules declareth; where it is placed after <hi>pouertie of spirit,</hi> and <hi>mourning:</hi> and therefore Psal. 37. 11. whence these words are borrowed, the meeke person is called by a name that signifieth <hi>one afflicted;</hi> to teach vs, that hee that is meeke indeede, is one<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point. Wherein doth this blessednes of the meeke consist?</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in <hi>their inheriting of the earth.</hi> And this is a great happinesse, for a man to be Lord of the whole earth. But how can this be true? sith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods dearest seruants, haue beene <hi>strangers on this earth,</hi> thrust out of house and land, and constrained to wander in mountaines, and desarts, afflicted and miserable, yea destitute of conuenient foode and raiment, Heb. 11. 37, 38. <hi>Ans.</hi> The meeke are here called Inheritors<note place="margin">How the meeke inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the earth.</note> of the earth, not for that they alwaies haue the possession thereof; but first, because God giues a meete and conuenient portion of the earth,<note place="margin">1</note> either to them, or to their posteritie: thus hee dealt with <hi>Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> they had sufficient for themselues, and a promise of great possessions, which their posteritie did enioy. Secondly, if it fall<note place="margin">2</note> out, that meeke persons die in want, or banishment; yet God giues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> contentation, which is fully answerable to the inheritance of the earth: so <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himselfe, and other Apostles, <note n="m" place="margin">2.

                  <hi>they were as men hauing nothing, and yet possessed all things:</hi> meaning through contentation, with the peace of a good conscience. Thirdly, the meeke haue this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,<note place="margin">3</note> in regard of right, being the members of Christ, who is Lord of all.

And of this right, Christ here speaketh, when hee calleth the meeke inheritours of the earth: in regard whereof, the Turke, &amp; all vnbeleeuers and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persons, are but vsurpers of those things, which otherwise ciuilly they doe lawfully possesse.</p>
               <p>Here then is an excellent priuiledge of all the true members of<note place="margin">Vses.</note> Christ, that in him they be Lords of the earth: whereby first, wee may<note place="margin">1</note> see how farre most men doe ouershoote themselues in seeking earthly<note place="margin">The commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> errour in seeking wealth.</note> possessions; for the manner is, without all regard of Christ, to hunt after the world: but this is a preposterous course, these men set the Cart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the horses; for seeing all our right to the earth was lost by <hi>Adam,</hi> and is onely recouered by Christ, doubtlesse till we haue part in Christ, we cannot with the comfort of a good conscience, either purchasse, or possesse any inheritance vpon earth. In regard of certaintie, men desire to hold their lands <hi>in capite,</hi> that is, in the Prince, as beeing the best te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure; but if wee would haue a sure title, and hold aright <hi>in capite,</hi> wee must labour to become true members of Christ, and hold our right in him, for he is the <note n="o" place="margin">Reu. 1. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Prince of the kings of the earth,</hi> and Lord of all the world: and till we be in Christ, wee shall neuer haue an holy and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified right to any worldly possessions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this serues for a bridle against all immoderate care for the<note place="margin">2</note> world; for if wee be members of Christ, and meeke persons, then the inheritance of the earth is ours: what neede haue we then to carke &amp; care so much for worldly pelfe, as most men do, who neuer thinke they haue enough?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this serues for a iust rebuke of all those that seeke to enrich<note place="margin">3</note> themselues by crueltie, lying, fraud, and oppression: for if thou bee in Christ, thou hast right to the whole world; what neede then hast thou

               <p>Lastly, hence all Gods children may learne to comfort their hearts<note place="margin">4</note> against the feare of any punishment for the name of Christ; for keepe Christ sure, and whither soeuer thou art sent, thou art vpon thine owne ground: for the whole earth is thine, and in Christ one day thou shalt possesse it, when all Tyrants shall be banished into hell.

sanctified and made holy, hauing Gods image renued in him by the spirit of grace, which was lost by the fall of our first parents. And that this imputed and renued righteousnes may here be vnderstood, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by these reasons: First, in such places of Scripture where like sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are repeated, we must vnderstand not Ciuill righteousnes, but iustification, sanctification, and regeneration: as Isa. 55. 1. <hi>Hoe, euery one that thirsteth, come to the waters, and buie without siluer:</hi> and, Ioh. 7. 37. <hi>If any man thirst, let him come vnto me and drinke:</hi> and, Reuel. 21. 6. <hi>I will giue to him that is a thirst, to drinke of the waters of life freely:</hi> all which places are one in substance: for by <hi>waters,</hi> we must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>righteousnes,</hi> which is that spirituall grace of God the fountaine of all blessings, whereby sinners are iustified and sanctified. Secondly, that which is most of all to be desired, must needes be the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent righteousnes: but this righteousnes here mentioned is most to be desired; for Christ saith, men shall <hi>hunger and thirst after it,</hi> thereby expressing a most earnest and vehement desire: and therefore by <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,</hi> we must vnderstand Gods grace and mercie in Christ, absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a sinner from the guilt and punishment of his sinnes, with sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the fruit thereof, whereby he is purged from corruption. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<note place="margin">Spirituall hunger and thirst.</note> by <hi>hungring</hi> and <hi>thirsting,</hi> we must vnderstand two things: first, a sorrow and griefe of heart in regard of a mans owne sinnes, and vnrighteousnes; secondly, an earnest and constant desire of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of God, that is, of iustification and sanctification in Christ. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to these two things which are in bodily hunger and thirst, to wit, first a paine in the bottome of the stomacke for want of meate and drinke; secondly, an earnest desire and appetite after meat and drinke, to be satisfied therewith. And blessed is he that is so grieued for his owne vnrighteousnes, and withall hath an earnest desire after reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with God in Christ, and after true regeneration and sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the holy Ghost: for this is true spirituall hunger and thirst, whereto belongs this gratious promise, that in due time he shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and filled with plentie of Gods mercie and grace, wherein this happinesse doth consist, which is the second branch of this Rule. This I take to be the true and proper meaning of these words, whereupon the two former expositions depend; for he that is thus spiritually an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred, is oft depriued of his owne right among men, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so is said to hunger and thirst after that which is his owne in this world. Againe, such a man doth vnfainedly grieue at the iniquities that bee in the world, and withall, his heart doth most earnestly desire reformation thereof, both in himselfe and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:14013:15"/>First, this sentence must be remembred, as a storehouse of true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort<note place="margin">The vse. Comfort in Temptation. 1. from want of faith.</note> in all grieuous temptations, but especially, against these three; the <hi>want of faith,</hi> the <hi>smallnesse of sanctification,</hi> and <hi>despaire.</hi> For the first, many in Gods Church haue a true care to please God in all things, and to liue in no sinne against their conscience; and yet they finde in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues much distrust and despaire of Gods mercie, they feele more doubting then faith: whereupon they are brought to doubt of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and state of grace before God. Now how may such bee relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and be well perswaded of their good estate? <hi>Answer.</hi> The way is laid downe by our Sauiour Christ in this Rule; <hi>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousnesse.</hi> For here he teacheth, that those are blessed, who are displeased with their own doubting and vnbeleefe, if they haue a true earnest desire to be purged from this distrust, and to beleeue in God through Christ. Indeede this desire of faith, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, is not true faith in nature, but in Gods acceptance; for God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects them for this true desire, as if they had faith. And they are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, because they shall haue plentie of faith, and assurance of grace and fauour with God in Christ: for it is mercie and grace with God, to hunger after grace and mercie, when the heart feeles the want thereof: But yet such persons must be admonished, that they shew the truth of this desire, by a constant endeauouring in the meanes which God hath sanctified for the obtaining of a true and liuely faith in Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they may be satisfied.</p>
               <p>The second temptation is, from the <hi>smallnesse of sanctification.</hi> Many<note place="margin">2. from want of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> there be that endeauour to please God, making conscience of all sinne, and yet they finde in themselues an exceeding measure of rebellious corruption, much ignorance in their minds, peruersenesse in their wills, and frowardnesse in their affections; yea, a continuall pronenesse vnto all manner of sinne: and on the contrarie, they can perceiue but small fruits of sanctification; the olde man they feele rushing in them like a mightie Gyant, but the newe man so weake and seeble, that they can hardly discerne any spirituall life: and hereupon they are sore troubled with temptations, yea oftentimes driuen to doubt, whether they haue any true grace at all: This cannot but be an heauie case, and yet here is true comfort for them; for Christ calleth them blessed (not that are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with righteousnesse) but who hunger and thirst after it; that is, who feeling the want of righteousnesse in themselues, doe earnestly desire it in their soules. These persons therefore, that feele in themselues a sea of corruption, and scarce a drop of sanctification, must truely examine their owne hearts, how they stand affected to these things; for if they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14013:16"/>
be truely grieued for their corruption and rebellion, and withall doe earnestly desire grace and sanctification, vsing the meanes constantly, whereby they may be freed from the one, and indued with the other; then they haue wherewith they may comfort their hearts, for Christ calles them blessed: and so they are, for in due time they shall be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: and in the meane time, their will and desire is accepted of God in Christ for the deed it selfe.</p>
               <p>The third temptation is, to <hi>despaire;</hi> when a man after the breach<note place="margin">Comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire.</note> of conscience by some grieuous sinne, is plunged into this gulfe, that he thinkes verely hell is prepared for him, and he must needes be damned: what remedie now in such a case? <hi>Answ.</hi> Some thinke the onely way is to propound vnto him, the grounds of vniuersall grace; as that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is a man, Christ died for him, for Christ died for all: but this is a slender comfort, for the despairing conscience will thus replie; God indeed hath done his part, but I refused Gods grace, when it was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Therefore another way of comfort must bee sought; which is, by proouing vnto him out of Gods word, that he is within the couenant, and that the promises of grace and life doe belong vnto him: for the effecting whereof, one maine ground is here propounded; to wit, that though a man want all righteousnesse, yet if he truely hunger after it, he is blessed: and the right applying of this ground, is this; search must be made, whether the partie thus despairing, hath in him any sparke of true grace, or no; and this will be knowne by these two demands: first, whether he dislike his sinnes, because they are sinnes? secondly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he truely desire to be reconciled vnto God, to repent and beleeue in Christ? Now if his conscience tell him, that these things bee in him indeede, then is he brought within the compasse of this blessednesse here pronounced by Christ, and hath title to this promise, that he shall be satisfied: for he that is grieued for his sinne, because thereby he hath offended God, and withall hath an earnest desire of mercie and grace, to repent and beleeue, is truely blessed. And therefore it may bee said vnto him, seeing thou findest in thy heart, this griefe for sinne, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of grace, thou art blessed and shalt be satisfied. Thus may the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed soule receiue comfort; but as for them that liue in sinne, here is no comfort, for they haue no true dislike of sinne, no purpose or desire to repent thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as this rule of Christ ministreth comfort to some, so it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declareth<note place="margin">The miserie of the full.</note> the miserable estate of others; to wit, of all those that want this spirituall hunger after righteousnesse, for they haue no title to the promise of heauenly satisfaction by Gods mercie in Christ. And yet ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14013:16"/>
this is the state of men euery where: for after riches, pleasures, honours, and preferments men hunger and thirst, as the drought in summer doth after raine; but rare it is to finde a man that sauoureth the things of God, and thirsteth after his righteousnes, and yet such onely are blessed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this rule of Christ serues for sure direction, whereby we<note place="margin">How to know who are happie.</note> may know our estate before God, in regard of true happines: if we <hi>hunger and thirst after righteousnes, we are surely blessed:</hi> for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. Now this spirituall hunger is knowne by two things: first, by an vnfained heartie sorrow and griefe for sinne past; where this is wanting, true spirituall hunger and thirst is not: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by an earnest desire of Gods mercie in Christ, for the pardon of sinne, and for sanctification, testified by a constant endeauour in the vse of meanes to come thereby: he that hath these things in him, may assure himselfe that he is blessed, for these be the motions of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the true pledges of his grace. Hereby then we must trie our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, if these things be in vs we haue wherein we may reioyce; but if our hearts be dead, and hard, so as we haue no touch for our sinnes, no hungering after the blood of Christ, nor desire of sanctification, then are we voide of grace, and so most miserable: for the smallest mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of true grace that can be, is to hunger after grace in the want thereof.</p>
               <p>Lastly, this rule of blessednes must admonish vs, as we tender our<note place="margin">Labour for spirituall hunger.</note> saluation, so to labour for this spirituall hunger in our soules, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God in Christ for all our sinnes past, and for the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of our hearts and liues by his word and spirit: we may heare, read, and talke of Gods word, and yet all to no ende, vnlesse we be in heauines for our owne vnrighteousnes, and from our hearts doe sende forth sighes and grones after mercie and grace in Christ. For what auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it to haue wit and learning, honour and riches, if the soule be voide of mercie and grace in Christ? which doubtlesse it is, while this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall hunger is wanting in the heart. And to mooue vs to labour for this hunger, the reason annexed is very effectuall, namely, the Lords promise that they shall be filled, which also shewes wherein this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes doth consist. Now they that thus hunger are filled, partly in this life, by receiuing the testimonie of the spirit, touching their reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God in Christ, and some fruits of sanctification, whereby the old man is mortified, and the new man renued in them; but principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the ende of this life, when they shall be fully iustified and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and haue Gods image perfectly renued in them.</p>

               <p>First, <hi>Mercie is an holy compassion of heart, whereby a man is moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mercie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> 
                  <hi>to helpe an other in his miserie.</hi> First, I call it a compassion of heart, because it makes one man to put on the person of an other, and to be grieued for the miseries of an other, as if they were his owne: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called <note n="a" place="margin">Col. 3. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>the bowells of compassion,</hi> because when a mans heart is touched therewith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his very liuer and entralls doe stirre in his bodie, and are <hi>rouled within him,</hi> as the <note n="b" place="margin">Hos. 11. 8.</note> Prophet speaketh: and he is affected, as though the bowells of him that is in miserie were in his bodie. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I call it an (<hi>Holy</hi>) compassion, to distinguish it from foolish pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whereby a man doth vnlawfully tender him that is in deserued mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie: such was <note n="c" place="margin">1.

                  <hi>Ahabs</hi> mercie to Benhadad, and <note n="d" place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Sauls</hi> in sparing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag, whereas the expresse commandement of God was to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: but such mercie and compassion as God approoueth, is a fruit of his spirit, and a vertue commended and commanded in the word of God. Thirdly, this vertue of mercie stirreth and mooueth the heart to helpe an other that is in miserie: for helpe in miserie is a notable fruit of true compassion, neither can thes be seuered: for in the compassion of the heart, and in the acte of reliefe, stands true mercie: and therefore <note n="e" place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 17</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>He that seeth his brother in neede, and shutteth vp his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion from him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him?</hi> whereby also we may see, that no worke of mercie is shewed to any man in miserie, but that which commeth from compassion: and thus we see what mercy is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the duties of mercie are answerable to mans miserie: Now<note place="margin">The duties of mercie.</note> mans miserie is either in his soule, or in his bodie. The greatest miseries of man are in his soule; as ignorance, impenitencie, and trouble of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: mans bodily miseries are sicknes, thirst, nakednesse, &amp;c. and to these the works of mercie are answerable. Some therefore concerne the soule, and some the bodie. Mercie towards the soule is, when a man is carefull for the saluation of an other, vsing meanes to bring a man from spirituall darknes, vnto light, from the power of Satan, vnto God, from the state of sinne and the daunger of hell fire, to the state of grace in true faith and repentance, and so to life eternall. And looke how farre the soule is more excellent then the bodie, so farre doth this,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14013:17"/>
worke exceede any worke of mercy that concernes the bodie: Mercie towards the body is called <hi>Almes</hi> or <hi>Releefe,</hi> whereby a mans outward necessitie, for foode, raiment, or such like, is supplied: that this is a worke of mercie, is manifest, Isay, 58. 10. where the <hi>Releeuing of the hungrie,</hi> is <hi>the powring out of the soule vnto-him:</hi> and Saint Iohn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth<note place="margin">1.

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>And because this dutie is so necessarie and excellent, I will propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<note place="margin">Rules for the exercise of mercie. 1. Rule.</note> certaine Rules to be obserued for our furtherance herein. First, wee must exercise three of our senses; <hi>seeing, hearing, and feeling,</hi> in other mens miseries: for <hi>seeing,</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Deut. 15. 9</note> we must bee very warie it grieue vs not <hi>to looke vpon our poore brother,</hi> but wee must see and behold his miserie and distresse, whether it bee in soule or bodie. This is the Lords pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise. Israel is oppressed in Egypt, and the Lord saith, <note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 3. 7. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue surely seene the trouble of my people, and the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppresse them.</hi> And we must be followers of God, as deare children, and learne to visit them that be in miserie, either through sickenesse, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, pouertie, or such like; for sight will stirre vp in a man a sense and compassion of others miseries. Hence it is said, that <note n="p" place="margin">Math. 4. 14</note> 
                  <hi>when Iesus saw a great multitude, hee was mooued with compassion towards them.</hi> And who can see a poore distressed person to lie in strawe, or on the ground without needfull releefe, as many a one would not suffer his dogge to lie, and not be mooued with compassion? Secondly, if wee cannot come to see a mans miserie, then we must bee content to <hi>heare of it,</hi> and giue heed and credit to the true reports that others make thereof vnto vs. Thus did <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> hearing of the affliction of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of the captiuitie, <note n="q" place="margin">Nehem. 1. 3. 4. and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>he wept and mourned, fasted and praied, and sought for releefe for them at the Kings hands.</hi> Thirdly, for <hi>feeling,</hi> if
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14013:18"/>
the Lord shall afflict our bodies with sicknes, or our soules with temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, we must be willing to suffer the same patiently, that thereby we may be fitted to take more compassion vpon others in like case, and to comfort them the better. Paul saith of himselfe and Timothie, that in <note n="r" place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Asia they were pressed with affliction aboue measure passing strength, so as they altogether doubted of life, and yet</hi> (he saith) <hi>the Lord dealt mercifully with them; that they might be able to comfort others which</hi>
                  <note place="margin">vers. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>were in any affliction, with the same comfort wherewith God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we must make our particular callings wherein we liue, the<note place="margin">2. Rule.</note> instruments of mercie, and in doing the duties thereof shew forth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion towards others. This Rule is of great vse, and therefore it will<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> not be amisse to shew the practise of it in particular. The Magistrate must rule and gouerne in mercie: and the Minister must preach in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: euery sermon must be a worke of compassion towards the people, not onely for the matter which it containeth, but for the manner of his deliuerie, and in the scope and drift which he aimeth at: he which prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth otherwaies doth barre himselfe of all mercie, euen then, when he intreates of mercie vnto others. There is a carnall and humane kinde of preaching, which now adaies takes place, wherein nothing is so much regarded as the vaunting of wit, memorie, and learning, by fine contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued sentences, multiplicitie of quotations, varietie of allegations of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Schoole-men, and other learning: but herein is no mercie nor compassion to the poore soule. It is said indeede, that none condemne this kinde of preaching, but they that can not attaine vnto it. But the truth is, God will haue his word deliuered, <note n="s" place="margin">1. Cor. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>not in the enticing speech of mans wisdome, but in the plaine euidence of the spirit, and of power:</hi> and therefore a man can not with good conscience applie himselfe to such kind of preaching, els no doubt a man of meane gifts might finde it more easie to attaine vnto, then to the true preaching of Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Thirdly, euery priuate man must make the duties of his calling, works of mercie: the rich man must know himselfe to be, not a lord, but a steward of Gods blessings, and therefore must imploy and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence the same in mercie, by giuing and lending vnto the poore free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as God shall minister vnto him iust occasion. The trades man must buie and sell in mercie, dealing iustly with the rich, and shewing libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie to the poore. The master must thus in mercie vse the labour of his seruant; and the seruant thus in mercie doe seruice to his master, for conscience towards God. And happie were it with all estates, if this rule of mercie were obserued; the want whereof, is the bane of all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:14013:19"/>Thirdly, for the more chearefull practise of mercie, we must lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side some part of our goods, for the releefe of them that be in miserie.<note place="margin">3. Rule.</note> The Iewes were commanded to set apart the first fruits of their corne and cattell, for the Lords altar: but in the new Testament the altar is ceased, and the poore come in stead thereof; and therefore we must now bequeath some thing for their releefe. Many are giuen to great excesse in fare, and in artire; but they may doe well to abate some part thereof, and bestow it on the poore, for hereby will the rest be sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their more free and comfortable vse: nay, in case of necessitie, we ought to sequester some part of our owne necessaries, for the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the poore; so did the Church of <note n="t" place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Macedonia, euen beyond their power, giue to the releefe of the afflicted brethren.</hi> Men are exceeding cold in charitie, and one maine cause thereof, is want of obseruing this Rule, in setting apart some thing, according as God shall blesse vs in our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, for the releefe of the poore.</p>
               <p>The second point to be considered in this rule is, wherein this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes doth consist; namely, <hi>in the obtaining of mercie:</hi> he that shewes mercie, shall finde mercie, both with God and man. Where first, we<note place="margin">The vse. 1. Against ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s merits.</note> may see the errour of the Church of Rome in their doctrine of merits: for they make a speciall part of humane satisfaction, to consist in Almes deedes and releeuing of the poore, teaching that a man may hereby merit eternall life: but they or to grossely; for then Christ would not haue said, blessed are the mercifull, for they shall finde mercie: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus; they shall finde iustice: for that which comes of merit, is due by right. Secondly, hereby we may see what to thinke of our Church,<note place="margin">2</note> and Nation; in respect of true Title to Gods mercie, for onely the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull shall finde mercie. Now it were easie to goe through all orders and conditions of men among vs, and therein to shew abundance of vnmercifulnes and crueltie; so as we may be iustly called a cruell peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and therefore can not looke for mercie at Gods hands: for to <note n="u" place="margin">Iam. 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>the mercilesse shall be iudgement without mercie.</hi> This is euident by the Lords dealing with his owne people: for all their sacrifices and duties of religion were <note n="x" place="margin">Isa. 1. 11. 12. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>abomination vnto the Lord, because their hands were full of blood;</hi> and because they had no mercie, therefore they were led into captiuitie, as we may see at large, Ier. 5. 28. Euck. 9. 9, 10. and Zach. 9. 12. Now we beeing in the same case with them for vnmercifulnes and crueltie, haue no doubt deserued long since the same punishment; euen that the Enemie should depriue vs both of Gospel and peace, and of all our prosperitie and wealth: what then shall we doe? surely we must humble our selues by praier and fasting vnto the Lord, if not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14013:19"/>
yet priuately; euery man and euery familie apart, euen for this one sinne of vnmercifulnesse: and withall in this humiliation, begin to practise mercie, by bestowing that vpon the poore, which we spare fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our bodies in the daie of our fast.</p>

               <p>These words containe the <hi>sixt Rule</hi> of Christ, touching true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;<note place="margin">6. Rule.</note> wherein, as in the former, obserue two points: the persons bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and wherein their blessednesse consists. The persons blessed, are thus qualified; <hi>they are pure in heart.</hi> This is diuersly expounded: By <hi>pure in heart,</hi> some vnderstand those that are chasse; others, those that are simple hearted, voide of guile and deceit. But the words will beare<note place="margin">Who be pure in hart.</note> a more generall sense, &amp; betoken such as are holy in heart, hauing their hearts purged from the defilement of their sinnes, and be in part renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and sanctified by the holy Ghost: and that they are so to bee taken, may appeare, Psal. 24. 4. whence these words are borrowed; where also the Prophet expoundeth the pure in heart to be such, <hi>as haue not lift vp their minde to vaine things:</hi> to which purpose, the Author to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes<note place="margin">Chap. 12. 14.</note> saith, <hi>Follow peace with all men, and holinesse, without which no man can see God.</hi> Againe, the intent of our Sauiour Christ in this place, was no doubt to crosse the Pharisaicall conceipt of those times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men did content themselues with outward holinesse, as sufficient to true happinesse; and therefore he saith, <hi>Blessed are the pure,</hi> not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but <hi>inwardly in heart.</hi> Further, by <hi>heart</hi> we are to vnderstand the soule, with the parts and faculties thereof; that is, the <hi>mind,</hi> the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> the <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>affections.</hi> And that wee may yet conceiue more clearely of this point, we are to search out two things; first, in what <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> then in what <hi>measure</hi> the heart is made pure: For the first, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying<note place="margin">The manner of purifying the heart.</note> of the heart is by a two-fold Action of the holy Ghost; first, by creating in the minde a sauing faith, which vnites a man vnto Christ, &amp; as an hand applieth Christs puritie, that is his obedience, to the heart: so <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh of the Gentiles, in the Councell at Ierusalem, that <note n="y" place="margin">Act 15 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>by faith the Lord purified their hearts.</hi> Secondly, when a man is in Christ, the holy Ghost purgeth and sanctifieth the heart inwardly, by mortifying all the corruptions in the minde, will, and affections, and by putting into it inward holinesse, whereby the image of Christ is renued therein. And this our Sauiour Christ expresseth, Iohn 15. 2. when hee saith, <hi>that the father purgeth every one that bringeth forth fruit in him.</hi> Now vnto these the holy Ghost addeth an excellent grace of <hi>Christian Resolution,</hi> whereby a man hath a constant purpose not to sinne against God any way, either in thought, word, or deede; but in all things to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14013:20"/>
please God continually; so as if at any time he-sinne, it is against his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">The measure of purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> resolution. Now for the <hi>measure</hi> of this purification, it is onely in part in this life; for the grace of sanctification is not perfect till death, as the Apostle saith, <note n="z" place="margin">Rom 8. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>we receiue but the first fruits of the spirit:</hi> that is, not the Tenths, but as an handfull of corne to a whole field: the soule is freed from the punishment and guilt of sinne, and in some sort purged from corruption, but not wholly. This wee must obserue the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,<note place="margin">Concil. Trid. sess. 5. sect. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> because the Papists teach otherwise; to wit, that after Baptisme and regeneration, sinne is so taken away, that there is in man nothing that God can hate: but experience in euery childe of God, shewes this to be false. The chiefe ground of their opinion is this, that if sinne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called, should remaine in the regenerate, then God should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute a man to be iust, which is a sinner. But we answer, that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reputeth an impenitent sinner iust, but onely the repentant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, which are by faith in Christ, and so in effect are no sinners, because though corruption remaine in them in part, yet it is not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their persons. Besides, in the acte of their conuersion, corruption hath receiued that deadly wound, whereof it shall neuer recouer, but daiely die, till it be quite abolished, and therefore doth it not raigne in them. And thus we see in what manner and measure the heart is purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereby the <hi>pure in heart</hi> may be thus described: <hi>They are such, as</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pure in hart described.</note> 
                  <hi>beleeue the pardon of their sinnes in Christ, and be in part renewed in their soules by the holy Ghost, hauing their naturall corruptions mortified and abolished in some measure, and the graces of Gods image repaired in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and a godly resolution wrought in their hearts, not to sinne against God in any thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Considering that the <hi>pure in heart</hi> bee blessed, wee must search our<note place="margin">Vses. 1.</note> selues, and see whether our hearts bee qualified with this grace: As in former times, so at this day inward puritie is much neglected. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Iewes stood vpon their legall puritie and righteousnesse, and the Pharises after them, relied vpon their outward holinesse; and the holy Ghost foretold, that in <note n="a" place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>the latter daies should come perilous times,</hi> by reason of sundrie sinnes, wherof this is one, <hi>that men should content the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with a shadow and shew of godlinesse, and in truth denie the power thereof.</hi> And doth not experince shewe this to be true among vs? for the <hi>pure heart</hi> is so little regarded, that the seeking after it, is turned to a by-word, and a matter of reproach: Who are so much branded with vile tearmes of Puritans and Presitians, as those, that most indeauour to get and keepe the puritie of heart in a good conscience? Againe, the generall ignorance that euery where abounds, doth plainely argue the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14013:20"/>
want of this grace; for what can bee in the heart but impuritie and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, where there is no knowledge of the will of God in the minde? And for such as haue more knowledge then the rest, generally they are not answerable vnto it in practise; for take a view of all the markets in the land, and you shall hardly find a man that is to sell his graine, that will be brought to abate one iot of the highest price, no not vnto the poore that stand in extreame neede; which as it argueth a bloodie and cruell heart, so it sheweth our times to be euill da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es, wherein men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse much, and doe nought: which sinne will drawe Gods iudgment vpon vs, and cause the Gospel to be remooued, and giuen to a nation, that with profession, will ioyne the power of godlinesse in heart and life. What befell the <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 21. 19</note>

                  <hi>worke of God to purifie the heart,</hi> man of himselfe can no more doe it, then the Black-moore can change his skinne: but yet euery one that would feele in himselfe this worke of God, must vse the meanes, wherein the spirit doth purge the heart; first therefore, we must humble our selues vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly for all the sinnes and corruptions of our life alreadie past, and for the time to come, growe to a resolute purpose, not to finne against God in any thing: which we must testifie by a godly endeauour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him in all things; for a pure heart, and a purpose to liue in any one sinne, cannot stand together: but this constant purpose not to sinne, is a notable grace, and an infallible token of a renued and sanctified heart.</p>
               <p>The second point in this Rule is, wherein this blessednesse doth consist; namely in this, <hi>that they shall see God:</hi> for the vnderstanding hereof, two points must be handled. First, how God may be seene; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, how the seeing of God is true happinesse. For the first, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, <note n="h" place="margin">1. Ioh. 4. 12</note> 
                  <hi>no man hath seene God at any time:</hi> yea further, <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him, <note n="i" place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 16 How God may be seen.</note> 
                  <hi>King of kings, whom neuer man saw, neither can see.</hi> We must therefore know, that there is a two-fold sight in man, the sight of the eie, and of the minde; by the sight of the eie no man can see God in his essence and substance, which is most spirituall, and so inuisible, for the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14013:21"/>
eie seeth nothing but things corporall and visible: a man by his eie cannot see his owne soule, and much lesse the substance of God.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Moses</hi> saw God, for he appeared vnto them. <hi>Answer.</hi> They saw him not in his nature and substance, but in certaine created images and similitudes, wherein God for that time did testifie his presence vnto them: some indeed say, that though a man cannot see God in this life, yet in the life to come he shall see him with his bodily eies. But this opinion is not true, for though the body shall then be perfectly sanctified, and the eie sanctified, yea glorified, yet still it remaines a true body, and a true eie, and therefore cannot see the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, which is invisible to the eie of flesh.</p>

                  <hi>Obiect.

               <p>The second kind of sight, is of the <hi>minde,</hi> which is nothing but the knowledge or vnderstanding of the minde, and that is two-fold; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in this life, and perfect in the life to come. In this life, the minde knowes not Gods essence or substance, but onely by effects; as by his word and Sacraments, and by his creatures: and indeede, the speciall sight we haue of God in this life, is by these his effects to conceiue in our mindes how God is affected to vs; as that God is our Father, and Christ our Redeemer, and the holy Ghost our Sanctifier. The perfect vision of God, is reserued to the life to come, where Gods elect shall see him in regard of his substance: for <note n="m" place="margin">1.

                  <hi>we shall see him as he is.</hi> Yet that we be not deceiued herein, wee must knowe that perfect sight is two-fold, <hi>simple,</hi> and <hi>comprehensiue: Simple perfect sight</hi> is, when man sees a thing wholly as it is in it selfe, and thus God is not seene by the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14013:21"/>
minde of man. <hi>Comprehensiue sight</hi> is, when the Creature seeth God, so farre forth as it is capable of his knowledge; &amp; thus shall men see God in the world to come perfectly, and be filled therewith, though they knowe him not wholly, as he is in himselfe: euen as a vessell cast into the sea may be perfectly full of water, though it receiue not all the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Sea. But some will aske, how shall the minde see God? <hi>Ans.</hi> The manner is such, as neither eie hath seene, nor eare heard, neither can any man tell, but they onely, that haue fruition of it in heauen: yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely such it is, as shall giue full contentment to euery one that doth enioy it. But it shall be farre better for vs, to seeke for a pure heart, whereby we may be assured of this blessed sight of God, then curiously to search how we shall see him: for to them that be of a pure heart, God will reueale himselfe perfectly, to their ioy vnspeakable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second point</hi> is, how this seeing of God can be true happinesse.<note place="margin">How the seeing of God is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</note> 
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> A man that hath beene blinde, will count himselfe happie when he receiues his sight; and hee that hath long laien in a darke dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, will count it a blessed thing, to be brought out, to see the light of the sunne: now if this bodily light bee so comfortable, how endlesse is the ioy of that heauenly light, which commeth from God himselfe? The <note n="n" place="margin">1. Kin. 10. 8</note> 
                  <hi>Queene of Sheba</hi> counted those seruants blessed, that stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Salomon</hi> to heare his wisdome; then doubtlesse the sonnes of God must needs be happie, that stand before the Lord, hearing his wisdome and beholding his glorie: <note n="o" place="margin">Psal. 16. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>for in his presence is fulnesse of ioy, and at his right hand are pleasures for euermore. Moses</hi> is renowned with all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie for this prerogatiue, that God vouchsafed <note n="p" place="margin">Exo. 33. 23</note> 
                  <hi>to let him see his backe parts:</hi> and Christs Disciples were so rauished with a glimpse of Gods glorie in his transfiguration, that they would needs <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 17. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>abide there still.</hi> Oh then, what glorie is it to see him as he is? doubtlesse this sight of God is true happinesse. But then (will some man say) the diuels shal be happie, for they shall see him at the last day. <hi>Answ.</hi> Their sight shall be their sorrowe, for they shall see him as a terrible iudge, not as a Sauiour, with apprehension and approbation of his loue and mercie, which is the sight here meant: as the Apostle saith, <note n="r" place="margin">1. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>wee shall see face to face, and knowe as wee are knowne.</hi> So then the meaning of these words is this, they shall see God by his effects in this life, and perfectly in the world to come, with approbation of his loue and mercie.</p>
               <p>This gratious promise must be obserued as a ground of special com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort<note place="margin">The Vses. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

not be dismaied, for God will looke vpon them, and shewe himselfe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourably vnto them: <note n="s" place="margin">Isa. 66. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>he will appeare to their ioy, and their aduersaries shall be ashamed:</hi> therefore they must say with <hi>Dauid,</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Psal. 118. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>I will not feare what man can doe vnto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, is it true happinesse to see God? then in this world wee must striue to come as neere vnto God, as possible we can; for the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer we come vnto him, the more we see him, and the neerer we are to our perfect happinesse. Now that we may come neere vnto God, wee must set God alwaies before our eies; that is, wheresoeuer we are, and whatsoeuer we doe, wee must perswade our hearts that we are in his presence: this was <hi>Dauids</hi> practise, Psal. 16. 8. <hi>I haue set the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies before me:</hi> this perswasion will make vs to walke with God, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, who for this is said <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 11. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>to please God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this must allure our hearts towards all those meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God shewes himselfe vnto his children: the Lord reuealed himselfe in his sanctuarie vnto his people, and hereupon <hi>Dauid</hi> was rauished with desire to Gods courts; see Psal. 27. 4. and Psal. 48. 1, 2. And the like affection must we haue to Gods word and Sacraments, therein he shewes his beautie, as in his sanctuarie; and therefore we must labour therein to see the goodnesse and mercie of God towards vs, vsing them as pledges of his grace and loue in Christ: yea, we must endeauour to see him in all his creatures, as his wisdome, power, and goodnesse to vs wards: this is a notable steppe to our perfect blisse.</p>

               <p>Here is the <hi>seauenth Rule</hi> and precept of Christ touching true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse; wherein obserue first, who are blessed; secondly, wherein this<note place="margin">7. Rule.</note> blessednesse consists: The parties blessed are <hi>Peace-makers.</hi> By <hi>peace</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Peace.</note> we must vnderstand concord and agreement betweene man and man: Now peace is two-fold, Good, or Euill; <hi>Good peace,</hi> is that which stands with good conscience and true religion. This was among the conuerts in the Primitiue Church, <note n="x" place="margin">Act. 4. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>who liued together, and were all of one heart, and one soule. Euill peace,</hi> is an agreement and concord in euill, as in the practise of any sinne against Gods commandements: in a word, euill peace is such, as cannot stand with true Religion and good conscience. Hereof Christ spake, saying, <note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 10. 34</note> 
                  <hi>I came not to send peace, but the sword:</hi> that is, diuision by meanes of the doctrine of the Gospel. Now in this place, <hi>good peace</hi> is the qualitie of those parties that be blessed. Further, by Peace-makers, two sorts of men are to be vnderstood: first, all such as haue care, so much as in them lieth, to haue peace with all men, good
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14013:22"/>
and bad: secondly, such as not onely themselues be at peace with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but also doe labour to reconcile parties at variance, and to make peace betweene man and man; both these sorts are blessed, that is, they are in a happie state and condition, because this gift of <hi>Peace-making,</hi> is a grace of Gods spirit in them alone who are blessed: for where Gods spirit worketh peace of conscience towards God in Christ, there the same spirit doth mooue the partie to seeke peace with all men; as also to make peace betweene those that are at variance, so farre forth as it may stand with Religion and a good conscience. Yet here are certaine questions to be scanned touching peace, which will giue great light to the better vnderstanding of this Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest. I.</hi> Seeing Peace-makers are blessed, why should they be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med which seeke to make peace betweene Papists and Protestants, by reconciling these two religions? <hi>Answer.</hi> Because this is not good peace, for there is no more concord betweene these two religions, then is betweene light and darkenesse. Whereas it is said, they differ not in substance, but in circumstances, both hauing the same word, the same Creede, and Sacraments; we must knowe, that notwithstanding all this, yet by necessarie consequent of their doctrine and religion, they doe quite ouerturne the foundation of the Bible, of the Creede, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: as in the points of <hi>Iustification by workes,</hi> of <hi>humane satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> of <hi>worshipping Saints and Images,</hi> and their <hi>massing sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>Priesthood,</hi> may soone appeare. But they haue the same Baptisme with vs? <hi>Answ.</hi> Baptisme seuered from the true preaching of the word, is no sufficient note of a true Church; for the Samaritans had circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet the Lord saith, <note n="z" place="margin">Hos. 1. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>they were not his people.</hi> Againe, they hold the outward forme of Baptisme, but they ouerturne the inward power thereof, by denying Iustification by faith alone in Iesus Christ. Thirdly, Baptisme is preserued in the Church of Rome, not for their sakes, but for the hid Church which God hath kept to himselfe, euen in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of all Poperie: so that if they returne to vs, we shall accord; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we may not goe to them, lest we forsake the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest. II.</hi> If Peace-makers be blessed, how can any Nation with good conscience make warre? <hi>Answ.</hi> The Lords commandement to <hi>haue peace with all men,</hi> doth not binde men simply, but with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>if it be possible, and as much as in vs lieth:</hi> but when there is no hope of maintaining peace, then the Lord alloweth a lawfull warre, such as is for iust defence, or claime of our needfull due and right: for herein the case standeth with the body politicke, as it doth with the naturall body; while there is hope of health and safetie, the Physition
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14013:23"/>
vseth gentle meanes; but when the case is desperate, then he vseth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate meanes, and sometimes giues ranke poyson, to trie if by any meanes life may be saued. And so may the fafetie of a State be sought by warre, when Motions of peace will not take place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest. III.</hi> How can suit in law be maintained with good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, seeing it can hardly stand with this blessed peace? <hi>Ans.</hi> So long as meanes of agreement other waies may be had between man &amp; man, suits in law should not be taken vp; for <hi>Paul</hi> blameth the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, not onely <note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>for going to law vnder heathen Iudges,</hi> but because they lawed for light matters vpon small occasions: <hi>why rather</hi> (saith <note n="c" place="margin">Vers. 7.</note> hee) <hi>sustaine ye not harme?</hi> But if by priuate means we cannot get or holde our right, we may vse the helpe of law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest. IV.</hi> How farre forth may one man, or one people bee at peace with another? League or societie betweene man and man, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and people, is twofold; either of concord, or of amitie: The <hi>league of concord</hi> is, when men binde themselues in peace one with another; and this may be had betweene all men, beleeuers or vnbeleeuers, good or bad; <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 12. 18</note> 
                  <hi>haue peace with all men</hi> (saith the Apostle.) <hi>League of amitie</hi> is, when men or people binde themselues one to another in speciall loue, beside their outward concord: and this kind of peace ought one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be had with true beleeuers. Good king <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> is greatly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Lord, for making this speciall league with wicked <hi>Ahab, Wouldest thou helpe the wicked</hi> (saith <note n="e" place="margin">2.

                  </note> the Prophet) <hi>and loue them that hate the Lord? for this thing the Lords wrath is vpon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas Peace-makers are blessed, we are to be admonished, if it be<note place="margin">vses. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> possible to haue peace with all men, as much as in vs lieth; and within the compasse of our callings, to auoyd all occasions of contention and strife: Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> exhortation must here take place, <note n="f" place="margin">Epes. 4. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>we must hold the vnitie of the spirit in the bond of peace.</hi> To the effecting whereof, three vertues are there propounded for our practise; <hi>Humilitie, Meekenesse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vertues pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing peace. 1. Humilitie.</note> and <hi>Long suffering. Humilitie</hi> is a vertue, whereby one man thinkes better of another then of himselfe; for this makes a man thinke basely of himselfe in regard of his owne sinnes and corruptions, whereupon he is content to giue place vnto others, and to yeeld of his owne right, for the maintaining of peace: when as on the other side, pride causeth men to seeke for more then their due, and so causeth contention: as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <note n="g" place="margin">Pro. 15. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Meekenes.</note> 
                  <hi>onely by pride doth man make contention. Meekenesse</hi> is a vertue, whereby a man is gentle in behauiour towards euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, good or bad: this causeth a man to put vp iniuries, and to forbeare wrong<note place="margin">Long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</note>, when occasion of reuenge is giuen him. <hi>Long suffering</hi> is a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14013:23"/>
vertue, whereby a man doth beare with other mens wants, as morosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and hastinesse, and in bearing yeelds of his owne right, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of peace: thus dealt <hi>Abraham</hi> with <hi>Lot,</hi> when their heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were at variance, though he were the superiour both for age and place; yet for peace sake, he put <hi>Lot</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 13. 8. 9</note> 
                  <hi>to chose the place of his abode, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the right hand or on the left.</hi> Besides these, there are many other vertues propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the writings of the Apostles, for the maintaining of peace; to wit, <hi>Humanitie,</hi> when a man can so carrie himselfe towards<note place="margin">4. Humanitie</note> all others, that he can take well all indifferent sayings and doings, and construe them to the best part, if it be possible: This is a most needfull vertue for Christian peace, which we must follow, and hereunto frame our nature and affections, which are crooked and rebellious of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that so farre as is possible, we may haue peace with all men; for peace is the bond of euery societie, of families, townes, and common wealths, without which no state can endure; and Christian religion co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the same vnto vs, Iam. 3. 17. <hi>The wisedome which is from aboue, is pure, gentle, peaceable, full of mercie, and good fruits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if Peace-makers betweene man and man be blessed, then much more happie are they, who make peace betweene God &amp; man; and these are the faithfull ministers of the Gospel, which set themselues wholly to reconcile men vnto God: so <hi>Paul</hi> (speaking as a Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker) saith, <note n="i" place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 20</note> 
                  <hi>we beseech you as the Embassadours of Christ, that ye bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God:</hi> and therefore all those, that by Gods grace are set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for this worke, must in sinceritie set their hearts, and imploy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues diligently for this ende, to reconcile men vnto God, and to bring them to peace with God; and in their owne conscience, this shall bee a seale of the Lords mercie towards them, whereby they may assure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues that they be blessed: for howsoeuer vnto some, their miserie may be the sauour of death, yet they are alwaies a sweete sauour vnto God in Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hereby wee may see, what a blessed thing it is, in the day of Gods wrath against his people, to stand in the breach, and by earnest praier to staie his hand, and so to make peace betweene God and his people by praier. This was <hi>Moses</hi> practise many a time, for which hee is renowned with all posteritie, Psal. 106. 23. Exod. 32. 10, 11. And so did <hi>Aaron,</hi> Numb. 16. 47. 48. <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. Sam. 24. 17. and many others. This dutie concerneth vs, for God hath a controuersie with our Land, for the innumerable crying sinnes hereof, as blasphemie, oppression, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Religion, adulteries, and such like: now when we see the great mortalitie of our brethren, or heare of treasons and conspiracies,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14013:24"/>
and rumors of warres by enemies, who threaten our ouerthrowe; then must we knowe that God shakes his rodde at vs, and then especially is euery one to intreat the Lord more earnestly for mercie and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for this is a blessed worke of peace, to staie the Lord from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of his people: Read <hi>Isay</hi>

               <p>Lastly, if Peace-makers be blessed, the <hi>Peace-breakers</hi> are cursed: many there be of this sort, but aboue all, they are most notorious, who disturbe the peace of the Land, which by Gods mercy we haue for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares enioyed. It may bee thought wee haue none such among vs, but onely traitors, and such as plot with forraine enemies; but the truth is, all those doe disturbe our peace, that walke after their hearts lusts in sin and wickednesse, as <hi>idolaters, blasphemers, oppressours, drunkards,</hi> &amp; such like, these are peace-breakers, who cause the Lord to take away the blessing of peace: see Ierem. 16. 5. the Lord saith, <hi>Hee hath taken his peace from his people:</hi> the reason is, vers. 12. because <hi>euery one wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked after the stubbornenesse of his wicked heart, and would not heare him:</hi> and Leuit. 26. 23, 25. <hi>The sword of the enemie is sent of God, to auenge the quarrell of his couenant.</hi> It is then our transgression and rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, that will bring warre and rebellion into our Land; if this were not, our peace would continue for euer: for <note n="o" place="margin">Isay 32. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>the worke of iustice shall be peace, quietnesse, and assurance for euer.</hi> And againe, <note n="p" place="margin">Isay 54 14</note> 
                  <hi>in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse shalt thou be established, and be farre from oppression.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should mooue all vngodly persons to repent, and to breake off the course of their sinnes; vnlesse they will continue professed enemies to the peace of the state, vnder which they liue.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second Point,</hi> wherein this blessednesse of Peace-makers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists; namely, in that <hi>they shall be called the children of God:</hi> that is, they shall be esteemed and reputed for Gods children in this world, of God himselfe, and all good men; and in the world to come, fully manifested so to be. That this is true happinesse will soone appeare, by the view of the state of euery childe of God; for they are vnited vnto Christ by the spirit of grace, by which they are regenerate, and in Christ they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted for sonnes and daughters, and so enioy Gods speciall grace and

               <p>If this be true happinesse, to be called Gods children; then they that<note place="margin">The 1. vse.</note> liue after their owne wicked lusts, voyd of all care to keepe a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In this age men make much adoe to get good assurance of earthly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases; but what madnesse is this, so greatly to regard momentanie things, and to haue no care, in comparison, of our eternall inheritance, which we shall haue assured vnto vs, when wee become the children of God?</p>

               <p>Here Christ propounds his <hi>eight Rule</hi> touching happinesse, which he handles more largely then the former; for hauing laid downe the Rule, vers. 10. he expounds the same in a speciall application of it to his Disciples in the 11. and 12. verses. In the Rule it selfe, note two points; first, the parties blessed: secondly, wherein their blessednesse consists. The parties blessed, are <hi>they which suffer persecution for righteousnesse sake. Persecution</hi> properly signifieth pursuite, such as one enemie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth after another; but here the word must be taken generally, for all kind of persecution whatsoeuer. Now because it is a paradoxe, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd in humane reason, to thinke him blessed, that for any cause is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted; therefore Christ to verefie the truth hereof, repeats the same Rule in the nextwerse, where also he expounds euery parcell thereof, wherewith I will content my selfe, because Christ is the best interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his owne words.</p>
               <p>In the 11. verse therefore Christ sets downe three things, all pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the true exposition of this Rule: First, he explaines more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly<note place="margin">1</note> the parties that be blessed, saying to his Disciples, <hi>Blessed are yee.</hi> In the beginning of the Chapter, wee heard, that hee cast his eies vpon them, and spake vnto them; and now here he doth the like again: &amp; therefore this Rule must not be vnderstood of all men in the world that suffer, but of all Christs true Disciples; and generally it is not true, for the heathen and infidels doe often suffer for good causes, and yet remaine infidels, without the true God, and so are not blessed. Againe, a Chrstian professor may giue vp his life in a good cause, yet not of loue to God or his truth, but vpon ambition; and so not be blessed: for <note n="a" place="margin">1.

                  <hi>though I giue my bodie to be burned, yet wanting loue, it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> profiteth mee nothing.</hi> Secondly, Christ expoundeth particularly, what hee meaneth<note place="margin">2</note> by persecution, naming three parts thereof: first, <hi>slaundering and reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> which is the persecution of the tongue: Thus the Iewes persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Apostles, saying, <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 2. 13.</note> they were <hi>drunke, or full of sweete wine:</hi> Thus <hi>Festus</hi> persecuted <hi>Paul,</hi> making him <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 26. 24.</note>

                  <hi>children,</hi> for <hi>worshipping the head of an asse,</hi> for <hi>incest,</hi> and such like. To these three kindes of persecutions, S. <hi>Luke</hi> Chap. 6. 22. addes a <hi>fourth;</hi> namely, <hi>hatred:</hi> and a <hi>fift,</hi> called <hi>separation,</hi> wherby men were excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and cast out of the Temple &amp; Synagogues, for Christs sake and his Gospels. These are the seuerall kinds of that persecution, for the enduring whereof, Christ pronounceth men blessed, vers. 10. whereof Hatred is the roote, and the rest are the branches. Thirdly, Christ laies<note place="margin">3</note> downe the cause, for which, this persecution shall be inflicted; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>for my sake:</hi> or as S. <hi>Luke</hi> saith, <hi>for the sonne of mans sake:</hi> which expoundeth this phrase, for <hi>Righteousnes sake.</hi> v. 10. to wit, for profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, beleeuing, and maintaining the doctrine of the Gospel taught by Christ, touching remission of sinnes, and life euerlasting, to them that beleeue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The vses in generall:</hi> We see that Christ vrgeth this Rule of blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more largely then the former: this he doth for speciall cause; first, hereby he would teach his Disciples, and vs in them, that it is the will<note place="margin">Gods church must be afdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> of God, his Church in this world should be vnder the crosse, in such affliction and persecution, as their blood shall be sought, for the maintenance of the faith. And this hee will haue to bee the state of his Church, for speciall causes: First, that the members thereof, by their afflictions, may be acquainted with their owne wants and infirmities, which they would not much regard, if they were freed from the crosse. Secondly, that by affliction they may be kept from many grieuous sinnes, into which they would fall, if they liued in peace. Thirdly, that others seeing the correction of the Church for sinne, might learne thereby to hate and auoide sinne: and lastly, that the Church might glorifie God, in a constant and couragious maintenance of his truth vnto death; for euen in persecution is Gods truth preserued, against the reason of mans wisdome, <hi>patient suffering for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the truth, beeing faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witnes-bearing thereunto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ had newely called the Twelue out of all his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to be Apostles; whereupon they might thinke, that they should be<note place="margin">Luk. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> aduanced to some outward honour, ease, and peace: but Christ hereby calles them from that conceit, &amp; puts them in mind of affliction, which should befall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them in time to come; that when it came, they might the better indure it. And thus he prepares all churches to suffer affliction; yea, and we our selues, must hereby learne in time of peace, to prepare our selues against the day of triall, because his will is, <hi>that whosoeuer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>would liue godly in Christ Iesus must suffer affliction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, hereby Christ intends, to lay a ground of comfort to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples in their persecution, by a plaine and ful declaration of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines that suffer for righteousnes sake, in that they haue sure title to the kingdome of heauen; out of which estate no sound comfort can be had. And this same must we lay vp in store, against the time to come: for we liue now in peace by Gods mercie, but we know not how long it will continue; we haue beene threatened, and dangerously assaulted by our enemies many a time, beside the rodde of God shaken with his owne hand against vs; and wee may not thinke our peace will last al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, but seeing our sinnes increase, we may be sure our ioy and peace will one day bee turned into sorrow: and therefore it will be good to haue this Rule engrauen in our hearts, that <hi>they are blessed which suffer for righteousnesse sake.</hi> If therefore tribulation come for the defence of the Gospel, we must haue recourse to this promise of blessednesse, and that will be our comfort.</p>
               <p>

                  </note> Christ would let vs see that deadly hatred which the world beares vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods Church; for so much the word <hi>(persecute)</hi> importeth: The reasons of this hatred may be these; First, the Church of God in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie<note place="margin">1</note> of the Gospel, seekes the ruine of the diuels kingdome, who is the Prince of the world; the diuell therefore rageth, and inflames the hearts of his instruments, with malice against Gods Church, that they may persecute and quite destroy it, if it were possible. Secondly, Gods<note place="margin">2</note> Church is a peculiar people seuered from the world in profession, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and conuersation, and therefore the world hates them, Ioh. 15. 19. And this very point may serue to stay our hearts, when we shall bee persecuted for the profession and embracing of the Gospel of Christ; for the world doth hate Gods Church, and will doe to the end: there must be enmitie betweene the seed of the serpent, and the seede of the<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> woman: <hi>as then he that was borne of the flesh, persecuted him that was borne after the spirit, so is it now.</hi> Gal. 4. 29.</p>
               <p>Secondly obserue, that this hatred of the world, is not onely against the members of Gods Church, but euen against Christs holy religion; so Christ saith, <hi>for my sake:</hi> or, <hi>for my Religions sake.</hi> This is to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as a most excellent argument to perswade our consciences, that the Gospel of Christ which we professe, is the true and blessed doctrine of God, because the wicked world doth alwaies hate it; yea, it hateth vs also for the Gospels sake: now if it were a doctrine of men, it would fit their natures well, and they would loue it, for the world doth loue his owne. Ioh. 15. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:14013:26"/>Thirdly, if they be blessed that suffer persecution; then how may any man lawfully flie in persecution? <hi>Answer.</hi> A man may flie in persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with good conscience, these two things obserued: first, that he be<note place="margin">2. Caueats about flight in persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> not hindred by his particular calling: secondly, that he hath libertie offered by Gods prouidence to escape the hands of his enemies. The intent of this verse, is not to forbid flight, but to comfort such as are in persecution, and cannot escape; for the word signifieth such persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is by pursuite and oppression, which cannot be auoided.</p>
               <p>Lastly, seeing they are blessed that suffer for righteousnes sake, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they alwaies cursed that suffer deseruedly for an euill cause, for the contrarie reason is in contraries? <hi>Ans.</hi> They are alwaies accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, saue in one case; to wit, vnlesse they repent for their vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for which they are afflicted; but by true repentance they become blessed. The thiefe vpon the crosse had liued in theft, and was therfore attached, condemned, and crucified, and so he suffered for vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; but yet hee was saued, because hee repented, and beleeued in Christ.</p>
               <p>It is added, <hi>for righteousnesse sake:</hi> In this clause we are taught a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall lesson; namely, that when God shall lay vpon vs any affliction or persecution; as imprisonment, banishment, losse of goods, or of life it selfe; we must alwaies looke that the cause be good, and then suffer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. This is a necessarie Rule, for we must suffer affliction either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely or priuately, if we will liue godly in Christ Iesus. Now it is not the punishment, but the cause that makes a Martyr: and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Peter</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">1.

This censure was put in execution in their Synagogues; for besides the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ciuill Iustice, Ecclesiasticall matters were there handled.

               <p>Here then we may learne, what to thinke of the <hi>Popes Bulls,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by<note place="margin">1</note> he excommunicates Kings and Queenes, and particular Churches, for denying subiection to his chaire: namely, that they are the diuels instruments, where with Gods children are persecuted; and that all such as are thus excommunicated, for defending the truth of the Gospel, are blessed: for excommunication is not the instrument of a curse to them that suffer it for good cause. Secondly, hence we learne, that excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication<note place="margin">2</note> abused against Gods word, is no powerfull censure, though in it selfe, beeing vsed according to Gods ordinance, it be a most terrible thunderbolt, excluding a man in part, from the Church, and from the kingdome of heauen: and therfore all Churches must see, that this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure be not abused, for the abusers of it incurre the danger of the curse, and not they against whom it is vniustly pronounced.</p>

               <p>Now because it is a hard thing to reioyce in grieuous afflictions, therefore Christ doth giue two reasons to mooue them hereunto; first, from the Recompense of reward after this life, in these words, <hi>for great is your reward in heauen.</hi> This point I haue handled heretofore, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> this verse.</note> I will here onely shewe how the Papists abuse this text, to prooué the merits of mans workes of grace; for hence they reason thus, <hi>Where there is a reward, there is merit: But in heauen there is a reward for mans works of grace; and therefore in this life, there is merit by them.</hi> To this, it is answered diuers waies: I will touch the heads of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall. First, the word <hi>reward</hi> must not bee vnderstood properly,<note place="margin">1.</note> but figuratiuely; for Christs speech is borrowed from labourers, who after they haue done their worke, doe receiue their wages, which is the reward thereof: euen so, after Christs disciples and seruants haue suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red afflictions for the name of Christ, at the end of this life they shall receiue life euerlasting. Secondly, when wee read of wages and reward<note place="margin">2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> in Scripture, wee must not dreame of any thing due by right of debt and merit, but conceiue thereby, that which is giuen by promise, and of meere mercie; like as when an earthly Father promiseth to his sonne, to giue him this or that thing, if hee will learne; now the Fathers gift is not merited by the childe, but is freely giuen, the more to incite the childe to learne his booke. Thirdly, if we vnderstand reward properly,<note place="margin">3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> then we must referre it, not to our sufferings, but to the sufferings of Christ: for there is no proportion betweene our sufferings, and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall: <hi>the afflictions of this present life, are not worthy of the glory which shall be shewed vnto vs,</hi> Rom. 8. 18.</p>
               <p>The second reason is taken from the example of the auncient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; <hi>for so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi> In this Reason, Christ intendeth two things; First, to teach his Disciples and vs, that persecu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Prophets, who were of old renowned among men, and are now glori fied of God in heauen. Hereto wee must compare the words of <hi>Luke</hi>' spoken to the same purpose: <note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 6. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>for after this manner did the Fathers to the Prophets.</hi> By <hi>Fathers,</hi> we must needs meane the auncient people of the Iewes, for here hee speaketh to his Disciples and others that were Iewes by nation. Now hence obserue a strange point; to wit, that the auncient Prophets, who were most worthy men of God, were persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their time, not so much by forrainers and enemies to religion, as by those that were outwardly members of the Church of God, and professors of religion. This may seeme strange, that men liuing in Gods Church, should growe to this height of impietie, to become persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Gods Saints: but Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> giueth the reason hereof; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their <note n="k" place="margin">Act. 7. 51.</note> 
                  <hi>hard hearts,</hi> whereby <hi>they resisted the holy Ghost in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the word;</hi> for which God left them to themselues, so as they ran headlong to this height of impiety, to persecute Gods deerest seruants. The like we may see in these our daies; some that haue beene profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, after long hearing, breake forth into open Atheisme, calling this into question, whether there be a God: and among others, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to be seene as vile crueltie and oppression in their particular dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and as abhominable filthinesse, as is to be found among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, or Idolaters: all which, and many other enormous sinnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from this; that though men professe religion, yet they denie subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Gospel preached, so as it is not in them a Word of power: for which cause, God in his iustice giues them vp to hardnes of heart, to commit sinne without remorse. And therefore if wee would escape the fearefull iudgement of a reprobate sense, let vs labour with feare &amp; trembling, to become obedient to the word which we heare; for if we doe not glorifie God in the meanes wherein he offers grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, God will bee sure to glorifie himselfe in our deserued confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>

               <p>In this verse and the rest, to the 16. Christ propoundeth the <hi>second branch of his sermon,</hi> touching the office of the Apostles, and in them, of all Ministers; wherein, his intent is to mooue them to diligence in preaching the will of God to all people.</p>
               <p>The Coherence of this part with the former standeth thus: Christ had shewed before in diuers precepts, that many are blessed, whervpon some might aske, how they should attaine to this happines, and to those graces of the Spirit, which make them fit for that estate?
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14013:28"/>
Christ here answers, that the preaching of the Gospel is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall meanes to worke in their hearts those graces, to which true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is promised. And because it is an excellent priuiledge to bring men to this estate, therfore he exciteth his disciples to diligence in this Ministerie by two Reasons, drawne from the properties of this worke, &amp; propounded in two similitudes: The first is taken from <hi>salt,</hi> in these words: <hi>ye are the salt of the earth:</hi> &amp; amplified in the words following, to the ende of the verse. The second is drawne from <hi>light,</hi> ver. 14. 15.</p>
               <p>For the first: <hi>yee are the salt of the earth: yee,</hi> that is, you whom I haue called to be Apostles, and set apart for the worke of the Ministry, <hi>are salt;</hi> not properly, but by resemblance; yet not in regard of their persons, but of their ministerie; because hereby they were to sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son men for God, and to make them sauourie both in heart and life: <hi>Of the earth;</hi> not of Iudea only, but of the whole world, as may appeare by their commission, Math. 28. 19. <hi>Goe therefore and teach all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this description, both Ministers, and people, may learne their dutie. <hi>First for Ministers:</hi> by this title of <hi>salt</hi> heare giuen vnto them, Christ would teach them, first, how they ought to dispence the word<note place="margin">Ministers must seeke to expresse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of salt.</note> of God, both Lawe and Gospell; namely, so as they labour therein to expresse the properties of salt, whereto Christ alludeth in his Title: Now the properties of salt, applied to rawe flesh, or fresh wounds, are principally three; First, it will bite and fret, being of nature hot and drie: Secondly, it makes meats sauourie vnto our taste: Thirdly, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth meates from putrifaction, by drawing out of them superfluous moistnesse. The Apostles therefore and other Ministers being salt, must not onely in generall deliuer the word of God vnto the people; but withall applie the same particularly vnto mens hearts &amp; consciences, as salt is applied vnto meat: And that for three endes; first the Law must be applied, to rippe vp mens hearts, to make them see their sinns; it must fret and bite them by the curse thereof, to cause them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce themselues, and to crie with the Iewes, <note n="l" place="margin">Act. 2. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>Men and brethren what shall we doe?</hi> Secondly, the Gospel must be preached, that men feeling their corruption, like rottennes in their soules, may by the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the spirit be thereby seasoned with grace, and so reconciled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and made sauourie in his sight. This is the end of the Ministrie, 2. Cor. 5. 20. <hi>We are Embassadours for Christ, as though God did beseech you through vs, we pray you in Christs steed, that you be reconciled vnto God.</hi> Thirdly, both the Law and the Gospel must bee continually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed, that thereby sinne and corruption may be daiely mortified and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14013:29"/>
consumed both in heart and life; euen as superfluous humours are dried vp by salt; And this is the right dispensing of Gods word: for euery dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vpon a text of Scripture is not preaching, but he that so expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and applyeth the word, that his ministerie may be salt vnto his hearers, he it is that preacheth the word indeede.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ calling his Disciples salt, teacheth them and all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, that they themselues ought first to be seasoned by the word: for how can they fitly season others by applying this salt vnto their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, who neuer felt the biting of it vpon their owne? He that is vnsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned himselfe may speake Gods word, which God may blesse to the good of others: but yet in respect of himselfe, it is a riddle which can not be vnderstood.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this Title giueth good direction to euery Minister for his manner of preaching: for if the word of God alone be that sauory salt, wherewith mans heart is seasoned for the Lord, then it ought to be dispensed purely and sincerely, without the mixture of humane inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This was <hi>Pauls</hi> care, <note n="m" place="margin">1. Cor. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>my word &amp; my preaching</hi> (saith he) <hi>stood not in the entising speach of mans wisedome, but in plaine evidence of the spirit and of power, that your faith should not be in the wisedome of men, but in the power of God.</hi> Experience teacheth vs that salt by mixture with other things looseth of his sauour: and so is it with the word: In deede there is a place for Arts and tongues, and humane learning with euery dispenser of the word, wherein he may vse them with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, to witte, in his priuate preparation: but not in the publique dispensation whereby he seasoneth mens hearts vnto God; that the word of God alone must doe, for to it alone belongs the promise of the spirit. <hi>Isay.</hi> 59. 21. And therefore he must vse great discretion in this ministerie, and labour so to speake that the spirit may take delight to accompanie the same.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this Titile teacheth all Gods Ministers by patience to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse their soules, when the wicked doe fret and fume against them for their ministerie, for this is a testimonie that their ministrcie is salt, and bites their corrupt consciences as it ought to doe: therefore they are to goe on with chearefulnes, endeauouring more and more to season their hearers herewith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the people of God that heare his word, may learne good instruction from this Title: first, hereby euery one may see what he is by nature, namely, like vnto flesh subiect to corruption, nay, as vnsauory flesh, and stinking cation in the nostrels of God; for els what needed this salt? This therefore must mooue vs to lay aside all pride of heart,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14013:29"/>
whereby we thinke highly of our selues: yea, we must become base and lowly in our owne eies, in regard of the vnsauourie tast of our naturall corruption, else we shall neuer feele the seasoning vertue of Gods holy Ministerie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, euery one must hereby learne to suffer the word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, whereby his heart and conscience may be ripped vp, and his sores of sinne discouered: when we haue a cut or a wound in our flesh, we can be content to put salt vpon it, to drie vp the noysome humours, that otherwise would corrupt; now can we endure the smart of salt for the health of our bodies, and shall we not much more suffer the word of God to rip vp our sinnes, and to mortifie the same, for the saluation of our soules?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, euery one must giue all diligence to bee seasoned through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, with this heauenly salt, that the thoughts of his heart, the words of his mouth, and the actions of his life, may be all sauourie and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto God in Christ; yea, in his conuersation with men, hee must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to shewe the power of this seasoning: Coloss. 4. 6. <hi>Let your speech be gratious alwaies and powdred with salt:</hi> that is, seasoned by the word, that it may sauour of grace, to those that heare vs. If we liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ministerie of the word, and be not seasoned therewith, our case is dangerous; for therein it is of the nature of salt, which causeth bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennesse, where it seasoneth not: as we may see in the practise of <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> who sowed <note n="n" place="margin">Iudg. 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>But if the salt haue lost his sauour, wherewith shall it be salted: it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to bee cast out, and troden vnder the foote of men.</hi> Here Christ amplifieth the former reason, whereby hee mooued his Apostles to sidelitie and diligence in their Ministerie, by the danger of the contrarie infidelitie, which is as vnsauourie salt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable and vnprofitable, and so subiect to a fearefull curse; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (saith Christ) you had neede to bee faithfull in seasoning the world by your Ministerie. In this amplification we may obserue foure points: First, the ordinarie sinne that doth accompanie the calling of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie. Secondly, the danger of this sin. Thirdly, the vnprofitablenes of such a Ministerie. Fourthly, the iudgement of God due vnto it.</p>

Ministerie, and either doe not, or cannot dispense Gods word, for the seasoning of mens soules, that they may be acceptable to God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled vnto him in Christ.

                  <hi>whose words did fret as a canker, and destroyed the faith of many.</hi> And such are the <hi>Romish teachers</hi> at this day, and the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits and Seminaries among vs, who though they be qualified with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good gifts of learning, yet by mingling the word of God with their owne inuentions, and humane traditions, they rase the foundation, they become vnsauourie salt, and hereticall Teachers.

                  <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel,</hi> who much complaine, of <hi>sowing pillowes vnder the elbowes of the wicked,</hi> by preaching peace vnto them, when they should haue called to repentance by the discouerie of their sinnes, and the denunciation of Gods iudgements: as also, <hi>for making sad the hearts of those, whom God hath not made sadde:</hi> And such are those at this day, who haue sinooth tongues, in respect of sinne, and yet are full of bitter inuectiues against the better sort. By this meanes the word of God looseth his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimonie and sharpnesse, whereby the wicked should be awaked out of their slumber of securitie, and the godly further seasoned, and made more acceptable vnto God. Fourthly, they are vnsauourie salt, who<note place="margin">4</note> though they teach the truth, and generally applie it well, doe yet lead vngodly and scandalous liues: for an offensiue and vnsauourie conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation in the Teacher, doth hinder the seasoning vertue of the word of his Ministerie in the hearts of the people; and his doctrine cannot so much edifie, as his course of life destroyeth, because naturall men regard not so much what is said, as what is done. This beeing so, all Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and those also that destinate themselues to this calling, must
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14013:30"/>
haue speciall care, so to bee qualified for this worke, and so to preach the word of God, that it may be sauourie in the hearts and consciences of them that heare it. This is a matter of great importance, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Minister, as of the people; and thus shall it appeare, that they are not onely no vnsauourie salt, but euen such as doe season o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> The <hi>danger</hi> of this sinne, in beeing vnsauourie salt (that is vnfaithfull in the Ministerie) is very great, noted in these words; <hi>wherewith shall it be salted?</hi> Some referre this salting to the earth, as if Christ had said, wherewith shall the earth be salted? but it doth more truely belong to the salt it selfe, as Mark. 9. 5. <hi>Salt is good, but if the salt be vnsauourie, wherewith shall it,</hi> that is, <hi>the salt it selfe, be seasoned?</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the interrogation <hi>wherewith,</hi> imports a vehement deniall; as if Christ should say, If salt once loose his naturall propertie of saltnesse, it can neuer be recouered: now vnfaithfull and vnprofitable Ministers, are vnsauourie salt; and therefore their danger is exceeding great. And yet the comparison must not so be vrged, as thereby to prooue the state of Ministers to be incurable, if they once become vnfaithful: but Christs meaning is, to shewe that vnprofitable Ministers are very hardly, or sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome euer made sauourie againe; at least, if formerly they haue beene faithfull, &amp; after haue fallen from it. That this is the true meaning, may thus appeare; for notes of negation in <note place="margin">as no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>numbring the people:</hi> so Matth. 13. 57. <hi>A Prophet is not without honour</hi> (that is, very seldome) <hi>saue in his owne countrie;</hi> for sometime he may be dishonoured else-where: and sometime also, haue honour in his owne countrie: So in this place, this resemblance of incurablenesse in vnfaithfull Ministers, must bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, of great hardnesse and difficultie; not of an impossibilitie, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience also teacheth: for king <hi>Salomon</hi> was a Prophet of God, who by his adulteries and idolatrie, became wonderfull vnsauourie, and yet no doubt, he afterward recouered, and became sauourie againe by true repentance, whereupon he penned the booke of Ecclesiastes: so <hi>Peter</hi> by his deniall of Christ, became vnsauoury; but yet by Gods mercie, vpon his repentance, he was seasoned againe.</p>
               <p>This then is the danger, that Ministers declining from fidelitie, doe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14013:31"/>
seldom or hardly recouer: the reason is; First, because they want teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to instruct them, as they instruct the people: Secondly, the word in them is vnsauourie which should season them, and so there is no other meanes to recouer them ordinarily. Goe through all ages, and obserue the examples of false prophets in the olde Testament, of false Apostles in the newe, and of Arch heretickes in the primitiue Church; and hardly shall you find any that repented: yea, marke such Ministers as in our age incline to poperie, and for the most part they become irreuocable. Hereby then euery Minister is taught to learne and practise Pauls lessons to Timothie, <hi>To take heed vnto himselfe, and vnto learning, continuing therin, fighting a good sight, hauing faith and a good conscience.</hi> These things Paul doth notably vrge in that Epistle, giuing good direction to attaine therevnto: 1. Tim. 4. 13. 14. 16. and 6. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. Point.</hi> The vnprofitablenes of vnfaithfull Ministers, expressed in these words; <hi>It is thenceforth good for nothing:</hi> that is, as vnsauourie salt, becoming vnfit to season meate, is good for nothing; (for cast it on the ground, it makes it barren; nay, cast it on the dung-hill, and it hurts that also, which otherwise serues for good vse:) so it is with Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters that become vnfaithfull, they are of all other most noysome both to the Church and commonwealth; for Gods curse is vpon them, and they are good for no societie. This might be declared by many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, of such as hauing fallen to Poperie, from our Ministerie, haue after prooued not only deadly enemies to our Church, and to the truth, but the rankest Rebels &amp; Traitors vnto our Prince and State, of all others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi> Whether may such Ministers as become vnsauourie salt, by making Apostacie from the truth (as if a protestant Minister become a Masse-preist) be restored againe into the Ministerie of Gods Church, vpon their repentance? <hi>Answer.</hi> Some be of minde, that they may not be receiued at all into the Ministerie, after such apostacie: but I finde nothing in the Scripture, which should hinder their restitution, if their conuersion vnto God, and to his truth, may appeare to be true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained. It is alleadged, that the <hi>Priests</hi> vnder the Law, falling to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, <note n="t" place="margin">

                     </gap>2, 13.</note> were for euer debarred from the Priests office? <hi>Answer.</hi> That was for special cause; for the Priests were types of Christ, and their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward holinesse shadowed out the perfect integritie and holines of our Saiuour Christ; for which cause their was none chosen to the Priests of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, who had any blemish in his body. Now by such ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Idolatrie, they disabled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being figures of Christ, &amp; therfore were reiected. Again, we find that inferiour officers were not debarred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their office
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14013:31"/>
in the Sanctuarie, though they committed idolatrie, as the Priests did. It is said againe, that a Minister must be vnblameable; but a Masse-priest cannot be vnblameable. <hi>Answ.</hi> Without true repentance none is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable; but by true repentance, euen a Masse-priest may becom vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable. But such as fall away, become vnsauourie salt, which cannot be made sauourie againe? <hi>Ans.</hi> By the power of God it may; and so may an vnfaithfull Minister through Gods mercie be renued by repentance, and become profitable in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV. Point.</hi> The curse and punishment of vnsauourie salt: <hi>It is cast out, and troden vnder foote of men:</hi> whereby Christ signifieth, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull and vnprofitable Ministers, shall be condemned both of God and man: Hos. 4. 6. <hi>Because thou hast despised knowledge, therefore also will I despise thee.</hi> Mal. 2. 9. <hi>Therefore haue I made you to be despised and vile, before all the people; because ye kept not my way, but haue beene par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall in the Lawe.</hi> See the signe of the Lords contempt, in his fearefull iudgements vpon them; as on <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> Leuit. 10. 1, 2. <hi>Hoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> 1. Sam. 2. 34. And though they may escape his hand in this life, yet will Christ at his comming, <note n="u" place="margin">Matth. 24. 48, 49, 50.</note> 
                  <hi>cut them off, and giue them their portion with Hypocrites, where is nothing but weeping and gnashing of teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The consideration whereof, must mooue all Ministers to beware of vnfaithfulnesse in their calling, lest the curse of vnsauourie salt light vpon them. The Carpenters who builded <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues drowned in the flood; because neither <hi>Noahs</hi> preaching, nor their owne working did mooue them to repentance: And the like iudgement will befall vnfaithfull Ministers; though they haue the name of such as should season others, yet because of their vnfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they become vnsauourie; God himselfe at length will cast them out, and tread them vnder foote. If this were laid to heart, as it ought to be, it would driue many from their idlenesse, vanitie, and couetousnes, whereby they become vnsauourie vnto God.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>Here Christ laieth down the second reason, to induce his disciples, &amp; in them all Ministers, to preach the word of God faithfully; as if he should say; By calling you are the light of the world, and your
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14013:32"/>
condition is such, that all your sayings and doings are open to the eies of men: therefore bee carefull that yee glorifie God therein. The first part of this reason, is in these words; <hi>yee are the light of the world:</hi> the second is expressed by two comparisons, in the wordes following; <hi>A citie that is set on a hill, &amp;c.</hi> the conclusion in the sixeteenth verse.</p>
               <p>For the first part: <hi>ye are the light of the world.</hi> If Ministers be lights, why saith the Scripture, that <hi>Iohn Baptist was not the light of the world?</hi> Ioh. 1. 8. <hi>Answ.</hi> There be two kindes of lights, Originall, and Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: <hi>Originall</hi> is that, which is the cause of all light; and so <hi>Christ alone is the light of the world:</hi> and in this sense doth the Scripture denie <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist <hi>to be that light. Deriued light,</hi> is that which shineth forth, but yet is receiued from another; and so <note n="x" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn Baptist was a burning and a shining lampe:</hi> so were the Apostles lights, <note n="y" place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>for God that caused the light to shine out of darkenesse, shined into their hearts, to inable them to giue the light of knowledge in the face of Iesus Christ.</hi> And so must these words be vnderstood, that whereas the world naturally sits in darkenes, and in the shadow of death, the Apostles by the light of their ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie were to shine vnto them.</p>
               <p>The vse: First, this title of <hi>light</hi> giuen to Ministers, sheweth the right vse of the Ministerie of the word. The whole world lieth in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that is, in ignorance vnder sinne, and so subiect to damnation by nature; now God hath ordained the Ministerie of the word to bee a light, whereby this ignorance may bee expelled, and they brought to the knowledge of their sinnes, and of the way that leadeth vnto life: Act. 26. 18. <hi>Paul must preach, that both Iewes and Gentiles may come from darkenes vnto light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, by this Title, Christ sheweth how his word is to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; namely, so as it may be a light vnto mens minds and consciences, to make them see their sinnes, and their great miserie thereby; then, to let them see the remedie from that miserie, which is Iesus Christ: and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to shewe them that straite way of obedience in all good duties to God and man, which God requireth in the life of a Christian. Men may make long discourses vpon a text of Scripture; but that onely is true preaching, which giues this light of knowledge to the minde and conscience, which leadeth men to God.</p>
               <p>Againe, the hearers of the word must be admonished of their duties from this title; First, if Ministers be lights in regard of their Ministerie, then euery hearer must so apply his heart vnto the preaching of the word, that it may enlighten his conscience with the knowledge of his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14013:32"/>
sinnes, and of his miserie by reason of them; as also, with the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, and of the will of God, which may guide him in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: otherwise, this holy ordinance, turneth to his deeper condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, euery hearer must learne <hi>Pauls</hi> lesson, Ephes. 5. 8. <hi>Yee were once darkenesse, but now ye are light in the Lord, walke as children of the light:</hi> that is, looke what the word teacheth, which is this light, that doe: When the time is darke, wherein we walke, we vse torches and candles, that so we may see the right path; behold, the world is darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, we therefore must labour to haue the word of God to be a light vnto our feete, in all the steps of our callings wherein we liue; <hi>for hee that walketh in the darke, knoweth not whither hee goeth,</hi> Iohn, 12. 35.</p>
               <p>Lastly, there be many that liue in ignorance, as blind, as though they had neuer heard of Christ; and though they heare the word preached, yet still they remaine in darkenesse: but they must knowe, that their case is fearefull, for the Ministerie of the word is <hi>light:</hi> they therefore, hauing the benefit thereof, ought to be children of the light: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not enlightened, vndoubtedly a most fearefull iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God is vpon them; for marke what <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <note n="z" place="margin">2. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to those that perish, in whom, the god of this world hath blinded the eies of their minde:</hi> and therefore, such persons must labour to knowe and practise the speciall grounds and duties of true religion, that so in conscience they may be truely assured, that the word of God is become their light.</p>
               <p>The second part of this reason, is this; <hi>Your condition is such, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of your calling, that all your sayings and doings are seene of men:</hi> &amp; it is expressed by two similitudes: First, of <hi>a citie set on a hill, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hid:</hi> Secondly, of <hi>a candle put on a candlesticke,</hi> ver. 15. And thus it dependeth on the former part: Whereas Christ had called his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the <hi>light of the world,</hi> they might take it for a matter of some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward renowne: Christ therefore tels them, that his intent herein, is not to giue them titles of praise, but to make them acquainted with their hard condition, in which they were like to bee, by reason of their great and waightie calling; wherein they should become spectacles to all the world: for thus he saith, <hi>A Citie that is set on a hill, cannot be hid,</hi> but all that passe by may see it: and <hi>a Candle lighted and set on a candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giueth light to all that are in the house;</hi> euen so, you mine Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, by reason of your publike calling, shall haue all your sayings and doings manifest to the eies of the whole world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:14013:33"/>Because both these similitudes serue to expresse the same thing, therefore the points of instruction, which specially concerne Gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, shall bee propounded from the ioynt scope of them both. First,<note place="margin">1</note> whereas the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods ministers is such, to haue their whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation open &amp; manifest to the eies of the world; therfore they especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, aboue all others, (though it concerne euery man in his place) must haue care that their liues &amp; conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, both for sayings &amp; doings, be holy &amp; blameles: for their place is such, that by their well doing, they win many vnto the Lord; but by their bad conuersation, they carry ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a soule with them to destruction. 2. Hereby they must learne, not to<note place="margin">2</note> thinke it strange, if they lie open to manifold reproaches, and abuses, more then any other sort of men: for they, of all other, lie most open to the world; &amp; if their conuersation bee godly, it is the more distastfull to the world: as <hi>Cain hated Abel for his good works,</hi> 1. Ioh. 3. 12. 3. Hence<note place="margin">3</note> it appeareth, that men in this calling, cannot without great sinne, hide the gifts and talents which God hath giuen them; for they are as ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted candles, which must not be put vnder a bushell. Sundrie men haue heretofore offended this way, as those in the Primitiue Church, who beeing godly men, and well qualified for the Ministerie, did yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themselues from publike societies, to liue in solitary places; for by their gifts they were excellent lights, and therefore they ought to haue shined forth to others. And at this day, they offend this way, that will not abase themselues in their Ministerie, to speake plainely, to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitie of the simple: yea, they also put the light vnder a bushell, who beeing fit for this Ministerie, doe spend their daies wholly in the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersities, except it bee that they want a calling into the Church, and haue a lawefull calling for their staie in the Vniuersities: and though men haue not such meanes of calling forth, as were to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, yet they that liue in Schooles of Learning, ought to shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues willing to become lights abroad in the Church; saying with the Prophet <hi>Isaie,</hi> when his lippes were touched with a cole from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, <note n="a" place="margin">Isay, 6. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Here am I, Lord send me.</hi> In a word, all persons in this calling, that any way hide their gifts, are here blamed; for they are lights which should not be hidde.</p>
               <p>From these comparisons, wherein Christ sets out the open state of his Apostles to the viewe of the world, the Papists do gather, <hi>that the</hi>

selfe ouer these Westerne parts. Neither doth this place make ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, for Christ here speakes of his Apostles, and of their ministerie properly, which could not be hid; and not of euery ordinarie Minister, who are not lights of all the world, as the Apostles were, but onely in their particular standing. Secondly, the Ministerie is a light, yet not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies shining to the whole world; and therefore it is added in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond similitude, that <hi>it giueth light to them that are in the house:</hi> that is, in the Church of God. And so in the darkenesse of Poperie, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of the Gospel was hidde from the world, and yet it gaue some light to the hidden Church, the house of God, to shew them their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the meanes of saluation.</p>
               <p>Now, as these similitudes concerne the Ministers, so they may well be enlarged to euery Christian in his place: for in this regard the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister is a patterne to his people, and many times in Scripture others besides the Ministers are called lights, 2. Sam. 21. 17. <hi>Dauid</hi> is called <hi>the light of Israel;</hi> not onely for the comfort of his Regiment, but also as he was a King, by his vpright life he gaue light to the people, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was gouernour: And so answerably, all Superiours in their places must be lights; the publike magistrate, to the common wealth; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, to his seruants; parents, to their children; and euery Christian, to his brother: Philip. 2. 5. <hi>Shine as lights in the world, in the middest of a naughtie and crooked nation.</hi> This therefore is our dutie, if we be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; as we must labour to get the knowledge of Gods will into our hearts, so must we cause the power thereof to shine forth in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a good life, whereby others may be directed in the darkenesse of this world. But alas, here in the case of many is lamentable, who tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ignorance and disobedience, be yet in darkenesse; these must bee taken out of their places, as darke candles, and troden vnder foote, and so cast into eternall darkenesse; where they shall flame in woe for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>

For the first: Gods word must first be preached, that men may heare it: secondly, therewith must goe an vnblameable conuersation, bringing forth good workes, that men therein may see the will of God. Here then are two parts of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters<note place="margin">2. parts of a Ministers office.</note> office, <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>good life;</hi> and they must goe together in him that is a good Minister. Hee that teacheth to write, will first giue rules of writing to his schollers, and then set them copies to followe; and so doth euery master in his Art: there is no learning of any thing, vnlesse examples goe with rules. Againe, God will haue men to learne his will two waies; by Hearing, and Seeing: the Minister therefore, that is to teach Gods will, must not onely by doctrine instruct the eare, but by a godly life exemplifie his doctrine vnto the eie: 1. Tim. 4. 12. <hi>Be vnto them that beleeue, an example in word, and in conuersation.</hi>

               <p>Now, because Christ requires of euery Minister, besides teaching, the euidence of good workes in a godly life; therefore here I will handle this point of good workes: and first shewe what a good worke is: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<note place="margin">Of good workes.</note> the differences of good workes: and then obserue the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the dignitie, and vse of good workes.</p>

And so we may say of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of sundry auncient Prophets, who by extraordinarie instinct were mooued thereunto: and vpon this ground did <note n="i" place="margin">1.

                  <hi>on the head of our Sauiour Christ,</hi> was a good worke; and yet there was no commandment for it in Gods word. <hi>Answer.</hi> Maries fact was a worke of confession, whereby she testified her saith in Christ, and so was generally commanded, though not in particular.

                  <hi>she did it to burie him,</hi> (as Christ himselfe testisieth) because his buriall was so speedy after his death, in regard of the approaching of the sabboth, that they could not embalme him, as the manner of the Iewes was; now euery instinct of Gods spirit in the conscience of the doer, hath the force of a particular commandement.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the spirit of God (say they) mooues euery man to any<note place="margin">Obict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</note>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:14013:35"/>
good worke that is to be done; and therefore men need not a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar commandement for euery worke; for those that are carried by the spirit, cannot but doe well? <hi>Answer.</hi> True it is, the spirit mooueth men to good works freely, but yet this motion of the spirit, is in and by the word of God; and at this day, those instincts which are besides the word, are mens owne fancies, or illusions of the diuell. Many other reasons they alleadge to this purpose, for the Iustifying their vowes of Chastitie, of regular obedience, pilgrimages, trentals, and such like; but they are like to these, and notwithstanding them all, the truth is this; that for substance, a good worke is such a one, as is ordayned, appointed, &amp; commanded by God. And here by the way, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, that they are farre deceiued, who so much commend the times of Poperie for good workes; for the truth is, that all their oblations to Images, to Monasteries, and to Churches, for Masses, Pardons, and such like, were no good workes, but onely in their owne opinion; for God commanded them not: Now it is the Lords reuealed will, that must giue the goodnes to mans worke: Mich. 6. 8. <hi>he hath shewed thee O man, what is good, and what the Lord requireth of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next I adde: <hi>Done of a regenerate person.</hi> The Author of a good worke, is not euery one in the world, but that man or woman that is a member of Christ, borne a new by the holy Ghost: so Christ here saith, <hi>Let your light &amp;c.</hi> restraining his speech to the persons of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples. True it is, that among Turkes and Infidels, many a ciuill man will doe workes of mercie, of ciuill iustice, and liberalitie, and will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from outward sinnes, and liue orderly; now these, and such like, though in themselues they be good workes, so farre forth as they are required by the law of nature, or commaunded by Gods word; yet in an infidel, or an vnregenerate person, they are sins: for first, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an heart which is corrupt with originall sinne, and with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe (for the <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 12. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>heart</hi> is the fountaine of all actions) and also they are practised by the members of the bodie, which are weapons of vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse; and therefore must needs be like vnto water springing from a corrupt fountaine, and running through a filthy channell. Secondly, these workes are not done for Gods glorie, and the good of men. Thirdly, they are not done in obedience to God, according to the Rule of goodnesse, the will and word of God, and therefore cannot be good workes. And this must teach euery one that would doe good, to labour for regeneration by the holy Ghost, that so his person may be good, &amp; then shall his workes of obedience be good in Gods sight; for such as the tree is, such will be the fruit: <hi>An euill tree cannot bring forth good</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:14013:35"/>
                  <hi>fruite, nor a good tree euill fruite:</hi> Matth. 7. 18. Wee must therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be engraffed into Christ, for without him, we can doe no good thing; but beeing pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>Thirdly, I adde; that <hi>good workes must be done in faith:</hi> for saith is the cause of euery good worke, and without faith it is impossible to do any good worke. Now, in the doing of a good worke, there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold faith required: First, <hi>a generall faith,</hi> whereby a man is perswaded that God requires of him, the doing of that worke which he takes in hand: as when a man giueth almes, hee must be perswaded it is Gods will he should giue almes; and so for other good workes: for <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 14. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is not of faith, is sinne:</hi> that is, whatsoeuer proceedeth not from this perswasion in the conscience, that it is Gods will that such a thing should be done, or should not be done, is sinne; for he that doubteth of the thing he doth, sinneth therein, though the thing done be good in it selfe. Secondly, herein is required <hi>Iustifying faith,</hi> whereby a man is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded in his conscience, of his owne reconciliation with God in Christ: of this it is said, Heb. 11. 6. <hi>Without faith it is impossible to please God.</hi> This Iustifying faith hath a double vse in the causing of a good worke: First, it giues the beginning to a good worke; for by iustifying faith, Christ with his merits is apprehended, and applied to the person of the worker, and hee thereby is vnited to Christ, who renueth the minde, will, and affections of the worker, from whence the worke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth; and so it is as pure water, comming from a clensed fountaine. Secondly, faith couereth the wants that be in good workes, (for the best worke done by man in this life, hath it wants:) now faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth Christ and his merits, and applieth the same vnto the worker, whereby his person is accepted, and the imperfection of his worke co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in the sight of God; and this must prouoke vs to labour for faith.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I adde; the ende of a good worke; namely, <hi>Gods glory in mans good.</hi> The honour of God, must bee the principall ende of euery good worke: now Gods honour stands in reuerence, obedience, and thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse; so that when we doe any good worke, we must doe it in reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnto God, in obedience vnto his commandements, and in token of our thankefulnesse vnto him, for his manifold mercies. The good of man must herein also be respected; the Apostle saith, <note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 5. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>The Law is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in one word, thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe:</hi> how can this be, seeing to loue the Lord our God is the great commandement
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14013:36"/>
of the Law? It must therefore thus be vnderstood: that the lawe of God must be practised in the loue of our neighbour, and not apart by it selfe. Againe, the ende of a mans life, and of all his actions, is to serue God, in seruing of man, and by seruing of man, to serue God; as when we pray (which is a good worke) we must not onely respect our selues, but pray for others; as for the Church of God, and for our brethren, as well as for our selues: yea, and for our enemies. So we must heare the word, and receiue the Sacraments, that thereby we may be better able to further our brethren in the way of saluation: this our Sauiour doth here expresse, saying, (<hi>that they may see your good workes,</hi> and <hi>glorifie your father in heauen:</hi>) as if he should say, Glorifie you God, and also cause others to doe the same.</p>
               <p>First, here we may see what to iudge of the workes done by Papists:<note place="margin">The vse.</note> It is commonly thought that they abound with good workes, but it is not so; their best workes are sinnes before God, for they faile principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the maine ende of well-doing, which is to glorifie God, in the good of men: for a Papist doing a good worke, according to the Rules of their religion, doth it to <hi>satisfie</hi> Gods iustice, for the temporall<note place="margin">Tollet. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct. sacer. lib. 6. cap. 21.</note> punishment of his sinnes, and to <hi>merit</hi> heauen by it; and so erreth quite from the right end of a good worke, respecting therein, his own good, and nothing at all the good of others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hereby wee may see, for our selues, how farre wee come short in our good workes, for commonly wee faile in the maine ende thereof: men spend their daies and strength in labour and toile, but all is for themselues, for their owne pleasure, their owne profit and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without respect to the good of their brethren: now all such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions wherein men seeke themselues only, and not Gods glorie in the good of others, be sinnefull in the doer, though otherwise good in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. And therefore we must learne, in all our actions, to aime at the glorie of God, in the good of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> Thus we see what a good worke is: now follow the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences<note place="margin">Two sorts of good works.</note> of good workes. Good workes be of two sorts: First, those which God in his word hath directly commanded, as parts of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe;<note place="margin">1</note> such are praier, thanks-giuing, receiuing the Sacraments, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word, and releeuing the poore; and these are the more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall kinds of good workes. The second sort, are actions indifferent, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified<note place="margin">2</note> by the word and praier, and done to Gods glorie; as to eate, to drinke, and such like; for howsoeuer in themselues they bee neither good nor euill, beeing things neither commanded, nor forbidden; and therefore in respect of the things themselues, may with good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14013:36"/>
be either vsed, or refused: yet because God hath commanded the manner how they must be vsed; namely, by beeing sanctified by the<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 5.</note> word of God, and praier; and the ende thereof, to wit, Gods glorie; therefore when they are so vsed, they become good workes.</p>
               <p>Vpon this difference of good workes, obserue the largenesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, how farre they extend. There be three estates ordained of God, the Church, the Common wealth, and the Familie; and for the preseruation of them, there be sundrie callings required; some whereof, are prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of God, and others left to bee appointed by men; as all trades, and such like: now not onely the callings appointed by God, and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, are good workes; but euen all inferiour callings, appointed by men, for the good of these three estates; and the duties thereof, bee they neuer so base, if they bee sanctified by praier, and done to Gods glorie, are good works. <hi>Example.</hi> A man is called to be a shepheard, and doth willingly accept thereof; now, though the calling be but base and meane, yet the workes thereof beeing done in obedience to God, for the good of his Master, are good workes; yea, as good in their kind, as the best workes of the highest callings: and the same may be said of all lawfull callings, and the workes thereof, bee they neuer so base; for God iudgeth not the goodnesse of the worke, by the excellencie of the matter whereabout it is occupied, but by the heart of the doer. This point must be learned, for the Papists conceit doth sticke fast in mens hearts, That there are no good workes, but the building of Churches, and Hospitals, the mending of high waies, giuing of large almes, &amp;c. but we must learne, that euery action of a mans lawfull calling, done in obedience to God, for the good of men, is a good worke before God: and therefore we must so walke euery one of vs in our callings, that the duties thereof may be acceptable to God. Againe, this will hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that in these our daies, we may as wel abound in such works as be good indeed, as the Papists did in their superstitious. Thus much of the differences of good workes.</p>

                  <hi>III. Point.</hi> Now more particularly, in the text are further set down<note place="margin">1</note> three points touching good workes: the <hi>Necessitie,</hi> the <hi>Dignitie,</hi> and<note place="margin">Necessitie of good works.</note> the <hi>Vse</hi> of good workes. The <hi>necessitie</hi> of them appeareth by Christs commanding of them, saying, <hi>Let your light so shine, &amp;c.</hi> for hereby hee bindeth all Christians, after the example of his Disciples, to walke in good workes. If it be said, that Christ hath freed vs from the law, and therefore we are not bound to doe good works? I answer, Christ hath freed vs from the lawe, in regard of the curse and rigour thereof; but not as it is a rule of Christian obedience.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> How farre forth are good workes necessarie to saluation, or to vs that do them? <hi>Ans.</hi> There be three opinions touching the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<note place="margin">Bellar. de Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie. l. 4. c. 7.</note> of good workes: First, of the Papists, who hold them necessarie, as causes of our saluation and iustification; but this we haue confuted heretofore. Secondly, of some Protestants, who hold them necessarie, though not as principall causes, (for they say, we are only iustified and saued by Christ) yet as conseruant causes of our saluation: but the truth is, they are no causes of saluation, neither efficient, principall, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruant; nor yet materiall, formall, or finall, as hath else-where beene shewed. The third opinion is the truth, that good workes are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, not as causes of saluation, or iustification; but as inseparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of sauing faith in Christ, whereby we are iustified and saued; or as a way is necessarie to the going to a place. The <hi>dignity</hi> of good<note place="margin">2. The digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of good works.</note> workes is expressed in this, that they are called <hi>good:</hi> now they are <hi>good</hi> only in part, not perfectly, as I shew thus: Such as the tree is, such is the friute; but euery one regenerate is <hi>partly spirit,</hi> and <hi>partly flesh:</hi> that is, in part regenerate, and in part naturall and corrupt: this is true of his minde, will, and affections, which are the fountaine of all his actions; and therefore the workes that proceed thence must needes bee answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; that is, in part corrupt, as they come from nature; and yet good in part, as they come from grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how can God approoue of them, if they be euill? <hi>Ans.</hi> We must consider good workes two waies: First, in themselues, as they are compared with the law, and the rigour thereof, and so they are sins, because they answer not to that perfection, which the law requireth: for there bee two degrees of sinnes; <hi>Rebellions,</hi> which are acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons flatly against the lawe: and <hi>Defects,</hi> when a man doth those things that the lawe commandeth, but yet faileth in the manner of doing, and so are mans very best workes sinnes. Secondly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider good workes, as done by a person regenerate, and reconciled to God in Christ, and so God accepts of them; for in Christ the wants thereof are couered. But here wee must take heed of the Romish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">Bellar. de Iustif. l. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>7.</note> which teacheth that good workes are so farre forth good, that there is no sinne in them: their reasons are many to prooue this point, but they haue beene heretofore confuted: First, they say, good workes haue God for their Author, and therefore are perfectly good? <hi>Answ.</hi> This were true, if he alone were the author of them; but man is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther author thereof, from whom they take their imperfection. They say againe, that here they are called good, but if they had any sinne in them, they should be called euill; for euery sinne is perfectly euill? <hi>Ans.</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:14013:37"/>
Where sinne is vnremitted, it is perfectly euill; but when it is pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our Sauiour Christ, it is as though it were not. Thirdly, they obiect, that if good workes be sinnefull, then they must not bee done; and hereupon they say, that by our doctrine men are bound to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from all good workes. <hi>Answer.</hi> That which is euill must not be done, so farre forth as it is euill: now good workes are not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and absolutely euill; they are good in themselues, and in vs in part, comming from grace: and therefore they must be done, because God requires them at our hands; and for the imperfection of them, wee must pray for pardon in our Sauiour Christ. And here by the way, we may iustly taxe the prowd doctrine of the Papists, who teach, that men may bee iustified by good workes; when as the best workes of any man, in this life, are tainted with sinne, and are farre vnanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  </note> to that perfection, which the law requireth: wee must be of a farre other minde; namely, that for our best workes, God may iustly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs; because wee haue not done them as we ought: therefore Christ bids vs say of our selues, that <hi>when we haue done all that we can, we are vnprofitable seruants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>vse of good workes</hi> is here set downe by our Sauiour Christ, <hi>to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The vse of good works.</note> 
                  <hi>glorifie God:</hi> this is not the whole ende of good workes; and therfore I will propound the same more fully, out of other places of Scripture; for Christ here onely propoundeth that ende of good workes, which concerned his intended purpose.</p>
               <p>The vse and ende of good workes is three-fold; either concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">Three fold. 1. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God.</note> God, our selues, or our brethren. As good workes concerne God, they haue three vses: First, they serue as meanes whereby<note place="margin">1</note> wee giue vnto God testimonie of our homage, and obedience vnto his commaundements; for by creation, preseruation, and redemption, he is our Lord and our God, and so prescribeth lawes for vs to keepe: in which regard, wee owe homage vnto him; which, that wee may shewe forth and testifie, wee must walke in good workes, as hee in his word hath commaunded vs. Secondly, they serue to bee tokens of<note place="margin">2</note> our thankefulnesse vnto God, for our creation, redemption, and manifold preseruations, both in soule and bodie. Thankefulnesse indeede, is shewed in word; but yet true thankefulnesse stands in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: and our obedience is shewed by doing good workes. And therefore the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts vs, <hi>to giue vp our bodies, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and acceptable sacrifices vnto God,</hi> Rom. 12. 1. Thirdly, they serue to<note place="margin">3</note> make vs followers of God: we are commaunded <hi>to be holy, as he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 15. and to put in practise the duties of loue one towards
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14013:38"/>
another,<note n="r" place="margin">Eph. 5. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>as the Lord loued vs:</hi> and therefore we must walke in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Morall law, that therein we may imitate God: 1. Ioh. 3. 3. <hi>He which hath this hope purgeth himselfe, as he is pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the vse of good workes in regard of our selues, is foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold<note place="margin">1. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our selues.</note> especially: First, they serue to bee outward testimonies of the truth of our faith and profession; proouing that the grace of our hearts<note place="margin">1</note> is not in hypocrisie, but in truth and sinceritie. And for this cause,<note n="s" place="margin">Iam. 2. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham is said to haue beene iustified by workes;</hi> because his workes did testifie that his faith was true and sincere: for where the fire of grace is, there it cannot but burne; and where the water of life is, it cannot but slowe and send out the streames thereof, in good workes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they serue to be signes and pledges of our election, iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,<note place="margin">2</note> sanctification, and of our future glorification: as wee knowe a tree to liue, by the fruite and budde which it bringeth forth; so by keeping a continuall course in good workes, a man is knowne to bee in Christ, and to haue true title to all his benefits: and therefore when the Apostle willeth men, to <note n="t" place="margin">1. Pet 2. 5, 6</note> 
                  <hi>giue all diligence to make their calling and election sure,</hi> he propoundeth certaine vertues, wherein they ought to walke, as beeing the most euident tokens of election, that we haue in this life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they serue to make vs answerable to our holy calling: for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery<note place="margin">3</note> one that professeth the Gospel, is called to be a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Christ, and a new creature, whose dutie is to bring forth good workes, Eph. 4. 1, 2. <hi>Walke worthy of the vocation wherevnto you are called, with all humblenesse of minde, meekenesse, &amp;c.</hi> and Ephes. 2. 10. <hi>Ye are the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship of God, created in Christ Iesus, vnto good workes, which God hath ordained that wee should walke in them.</hi> Now this is a most excellent thing, for a man to bee answerable to his calling: When <hi>Dauid</hi> was a shepheard, hee kept his fathers sheepe, and liued as a shepheard; but when he was called to be a King, <hi>hee behaued himselfe like a King,</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Psal. 78, 72.</note> 
                  <hi>in gouerning Gods people:</hi> and so euery Christian ought to doe; beeing a newe creature, he must walke as Gods childe, and testifie his vocation by shewing forth the vertues of him that hath called him, 1. Pet. 2. 9.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, good workes serue to be a way, in which we are to walke,<note place="margin">4</note> that so wee may receiue the mercies of God promised to his children, and escape the Iudgements threatened against sinners: for Gods word is full of most sweet promises vnto the obedient, and of terrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against rebellion and iniquitie. Now a man by walking in good workes, eschewes the paths of wickednesse, wherein <note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Gods iudgements</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:14013:38"/>
                  <hi>light;</hi> and holdes the waies of righteousnesse, wherein Gods blessings are scattered, Prou. 3. 17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ende of good workes, <hi>in regard of our brethren,</hi> is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally this; that by our example in well doing, wee may winne some vnto God, and keepe others in the obedience of the truth, and preuent offences, whereby many are drawne backe. The contagion of a badde example, especially in men of superiour place, is such, that it wil not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cast their owne soules to hell, but also draw many with them. When <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the King sinned, <hi>hee caused Israel to sinne:</hi> 1. Kings 15. 34. And therefore wee must carefully looke to all our waies, in regard of others, and so liue according to Christs commandement in this place, that others seeing our good workes, may bee wonne to the truth, and so glorifie God which is in heauen. And thus wee see the endes of good workes.</p>
               <p>Now considering good works be of such excellent vse, we are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by admonished to exercise our selues therein, with all diligence; for hereby we benefit our brethren, wee helpe our selues, and we glorifie God: neither must any mans pouertie hinder him from this dutie, for not onely almes deedes, and large gifts to Churches, and high waies, are good workes; but also the speciall duties of euery mans lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, done in faith, to the glorie of God, and the good of men, bee the calling neuer so base: by the doing whereof, in faith and obedience, he may get sure testimonie of his election. This exhortation is most need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for so soone as men haue occasion to commit any sinne, then they shake off the yoake of all obedience, as there were no way of good workes to be walked in. The Papists indeed make the merit of iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and life euerlasting, the ende of good workes; but that hath bin sufficiently confuted heretofore.</p>
               <p>Hitherto wee haue spoken of the first point in this conclusion, touching <hi>the manner of teaching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second point herein contained, is the end of all teaching; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to turne men vnto God, and thereby to bring them to glorifie God. <hi>That men may see your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heauen:</hi> that is, so teach, that men may see your good workes, and be wonne thereby to the faith, &amp; so glorifie God. Our Sauiour Christ his Commission giuen to his Disciples before his ascension, bids them, <note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 28. 19</note> 
                  <hi>God, make all nations my Disciples:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <note n="z" place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 22</note> 
                  <hi>hee became all things to all men, that by all meanes hee might</hi> not onely instruct, <hi>but saue some.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereby then all Ministers, and all those that set themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14013:39"/>
for this calling, must learne to propound this vnto themselues, as the maine ende of all their studies and labours; namely, to turne men vnto God, that beeing conuerted they may glorifie God. Againe, the same ende of the Ministerie admonisheth all hearers so to yeelde themselues obedient to the Ministerie of the word, that it may take place in their hearts, to turne them vnto God, that after their conuersion they may glorifie God. This the people ought the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap> to yeeld vnto, because it is the maine comfort that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister hath of all his labours, to see his hearers conuerted, and so inabled to glorifie God. And to mooue them hereunto, they are further to knowe, that if they heare, and be not thereby conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that so they may praise and glorifie God, by their obedience; then this Ministerie will bee a Bill of Inditement against them, for their deeper condemnation at the last daie.

And to the ende the same might bee the better accepted, hee makes way thereto by a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Preface, verse 17, 18, 19, 20. Wherein hee seekes, as well to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent and to remooue the false opinion which the Iewes had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him, in respect of the Law; as also to procure all reuerence and loyaltie to bee shewed therevnto: For the Iewish teachers see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Sauiour Christ condemne and neglect the traditions of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and not so much to respect the ceremonies of the Law, as they thought hee should, did thereupon iudge him to bee a deceiuer, and one that went about to ouerturne the whole law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Moses.</hi> This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Christ confuteth by three arguments: First, from the ende of his comming, in this verse: The second, from the nature of the law, in the 18. verse; whereupon he infers two notable conclusions, to procure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence thereunto, verse 19. And thirdly, from the scope of his Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, verse 20.</p>
               <p>For the first: The Exposition. <hi>Thinke not that I am come, &amp;c.</hi> This comming of Christ, must bee vnderstood of the manifestation of the godhead in our nature: for otherwise, his godhead being euery where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be said to come properly; and as for his manhood, it had not<note place="margin">The law in generall.</note> beene in heauen. <hi>To destroy the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> The <hi>Law</hi> in generall, is that part
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14013:39"/>
of Gods word, which commaunds things iust, honest, and godly; and beeing thus conceiued, it is threefold; Ceremoniall, Iudiciall, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. The <hi>Ceremoniall law,</hi> is that part of Gods word, which prescribed<note place="margin">Ceremonial.</note> to the Iewes, ceremonies, rites, and orders, to be performed in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe of God: this law is laid downe in the bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Leuiticus. The <hi>Iudiciall law,</hi> is that part of Gods word, which<note place="margin">Iudiciall.</note> prescribed ordinances for the gouernment of the Iewes common wealth, and the ciuill punishment of offendours: The <hi>Ceremoniall lawe</hi> concerned the Iewes onely: the Iudiciall lawe did indeede principally concerne them; but yet so farre forth as it tendeth to the establishing of the Morall law, hauing in it common equitie, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth all people, in all times and places. What the <hi>Morall lawe</hi> is, I<note place="margin">Morall.</note> will describe in three points: First, It is that part of Gods word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning righteousnesse and godlinesse, which was written in <hi>Adams</hi> minde by the gift of creation; and the remnants of it be in euery man by the light of nature: in regard whereof, it bindes all men. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it commaundeth perfect obedience, both inward, in thought and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and outward, in speech and action. Thirdly, it bindeth to the curse and punishment, euery one that faileth in the least dutie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though but once, and that in thought onely: Galatians 3. 10. <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is euery one that continueth not in all things that are written in the law, to doe them.</hi> The summe of the Morall law is propounded in the <hi>Decalogue or tenne Commandements,</hi> which many can repeat, but fewe doe vnderstand.</p>
               <p>That wee may further conceiue aright the Morall lawe, wee must<note place="margin">Difference between the Law and the Gospel.</note> make a difference betweene it and the Gospel: for the Gospel is that part of the word which promiseth righteousnesse and life euerlasting to all that beleeue in Christ: the difference betweene them stands espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in fiue things.</p>
               <p>First, the Law is naturall, and was in mans nature before the fall; but<note place="margin">1</note> the Gospel is spirituall, reuealed after the fall, in the couenant of grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Law sets forth Gods iustice, in rigour, without mercy;<note place="margin">2</note> but the Gospel sets out iustice and mercie, vnited in Christ.</p>

                  <hi>but beleeueth in him that iustifieth the vngodly:</hi> not considering faith, as a worke, but as an instrument apprehending Christ, by whom we are made righteous.</p>
               <p>The Church of Rome in a manner confound the Law, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,<note place="margin">Tonens. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. Confes. lib. 2. cap. 6.</note> sauing that the Gospel, which is the new Law, reuealeth Christ more clearely then <hi>Moses</hi> Law did, which they call the old Law. But this is a wicked opinion, which ouerturnes all religion, beeing the cause of many grosse points in poperie, which could not stand, if they would acknowledge a true distinction betweene the Law and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. They say for their defence, that the precepts of both, are the same<note place="margin">Bellar. de Iustis. l. 4. c. 3.</note> for substance; that both require righteousnesse, both promise life, and threaten death; both commaund faith, repentance, and obedience; and therefore they are the same. <hi>Answer.</hi> First, the laws and precepts of<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Law &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel differ in precepts.</note> the Law and Gospel are not the same; for <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocencie knew the Law, but hee knewe nothing then of beleeuing in Christ: and though both require righteousnesse, promise life, and threaten death, yet the manner is farre different, as before was noted: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they differ in the commaunding of faith; for the Gospel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth faith, not as a worke done, as the Law doth; but as an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laying hold on Christ. Againe, the Law commaundes faith ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally;<note place="margin">2</note> as to beleeue in God, and to beleeue his word to be true: but besides this, the Gospel requires a particular faith in Christ the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, whom the Law neuer knewe. Thirdly, the Law commandeth not<note place="margin">3</note> repentance, for the knowledge of the Law was in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, when hee needed no repentance: true repentance therefore is a sauing grace, wrought and commanded onely by the Gospel. And fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> for obedience, though it bee commaunded both by the Law and the Gospel, yet not in the same manner: The Law commaundeth obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence euery way perfect, both in parts, and in degrees, and alloweth none other: but the Gospel commaundeth, and in Christ approoueth imperfect obedience; that is, an indeauour in all things, to obey and please God, if it be without hypocrisie. Againe, the Law commandeth obedience, as a worke to bee done, for the obtaining of saluation: but the Gospel requires obedience, onely to testifie our faith and thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse vnto God. The Church of Rome therefore erreth grosly, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the Law and the Gospel, which indeed are farre differing; &amp; so we must beleeue, if we would come into, &amp; hold the right way that leadeth vnto life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:14013:40"/>Now whereas Christ saith, <hi>Thinke not that I came to destroy the Law; by Law</hi> he meaneth principally the <hi>Morall law,</hi> and in the second place, <hi>the Ceremoniall law</hi> also: Next obserue the opposition that Christ maketh betweene the Law and the Prophets; thereby signifying vnto vs, that by <hi>the Law,</hi> hee meaneth that part of Gods word, concerning Righteousnesse, and Iustice, which <hi>Moses</hi> penned by Gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: and by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> hee meaneth that part of Gods word, which is contained in the writings of all the Prophets in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after <hi>Moses;</hi> which bookes of the Prophets, contained in them either an interpretation of <hi>Moses</hi> Lawe, or predictions of the state of the Church in the newe Testament. Againe, by <hi>destroying the Law,</hi> we must not vnderstand a breach of the Law, such as is made by mans sin; but such a dissolution, as taketh from it all vertue and power, whereby it is a Law: and so to <hi>destroy the Prophets,</hi> is to put an ende vnto them, so as they should nothing auaile, either to the interpretation of the Law, or to the foretelling of the state of Gods Church vnder the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.<note place="margin">Christ fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the law 3. waies.</note> 
                  <hi>But to fulfill them.</hi> Christ fulfilleth the Law three waies; by his <hi>doctrine,</hi> in his <hi>person,</hi> and in <hi>men.</hi> By his <hi>doctrine</hi> he fulfilleth the Law<note place="margin">1</note> two waies; both by restoring vnto it his proper meaning and true vse, as we shall see afterward, where he correcteth the corrupt interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, by the Pharises; as also, by reuealing the right way, wherby the Law may be fulfilled. Secondly, in his <hi>person</hi> he fulfilleth the Lawe<note place="margin">2</note> two waies; First, by becomming accursed to the Lawe, in suffering death vpon the crosse for vs. Secondly, by performing perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto the Law, doing all that the Law required, for the loue of God, or of his neighbour; in which respect he was said, <note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 4. 4. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>to haue beene vnder the Law.</hi> Thirdly, Christ fulfilled the Law in <hi>men;</hi> Men bee of two sorts, Elect, and Reprobates: In the <hi>Elect</hi> he fulfilleth the Lawe two waies; First, by creating faith in their hearts, whereby they laie hold on Christ, who for them fulfilled it: Secondly, by giuing them his owne spirit, which maketh them indeauour to fulfill the Law; which in Christ is accepted for perfect obedience in this life, and in the life to come is perfect indeede. In <hi>vnbeleeuers</hi> Christ fulfilleth the Law, when he executeth the curse of the Law vpon them; for that is a part of the Law, and the execution and enduring of the curse, is a fulfilling of the Lawe. And thus doth Christ fulfill the Law; so that the meaning of the words is this: Whereas you thinke that I came to destroy the Law and the Prophets, by making them of none effect, you are deceiued; nay, on the other side, know that the ende of my manifestation in the flesh, was to fulfill the law, both in my doctrine and person; and also,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14013:41"/>
in the persons of men both good and badde.</p>
               <p>In this Apologie of Christ, for his behauiour towards the Law; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue,<note place="margin">The Vse.</note> what malice some of the Iewes, especially the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, bare vnto him: for Christ was the Author of the Law, and yet they maliciously suspect and charge him with the abrogation therof; so as he is faine to cleare himselfe in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>The like hath beene the malice of wicked men in all ages, against the deerest seruants of God; Act. 6. 14. <hi>Stephen</hi> is accused to <hi>speake bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemous words against the Law:</hi> Act. 21. 28. <hi>Paul</hi> is charged with the same crime. And such is the malice of the Papists, against all Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call reformed Churches; because wee denie Iustification by workes, therefore they condemne vs for enemies to good workes: and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other points, they fasten vpon vs notes of reproach, for holding the truth. Yea, among our selues, the like malice doth appeare in those that brand their brethren with odious names, because they shew forth more care then others, of their dutie to God: but let all Gods children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of this Pharisaicall practise.</p>
               <p>Againe, obserue the Titles, vnder which he comprehendeth the<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> whole Scriptures of the olde Testament; <hi>The Law and the Prophets:</hi> Luke 16. 31. they are called <hi>Moses and the Prophets.</hi> Luke 24. 27. <hi>Christ beganne at Moses, and at all the Prophets, and interpreted vnto them in all the Scriptures:</hi> there <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> containe all the Scriptures of the old Testament.</p>
               <p>Here then we may note a propertie of the bookes of the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;<note place="margin">A propertie of the old Testament.</note> namely, that euery one of them was written either by <hi>Moses,</hi> or some other of the Prophets. And by this wee may knowe the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bookes of the olde Testament, and distinguish them from the bookes called Apocrypha: for the Apocrypha bookes were not pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any of the Prophets, who spake and writ in the Hebrew tongue, the natiue language of the Iewes; but by some other in the Greeke tongue, which was not the language of the olde Prophets. These bookes may bee regarded in sundrie respects, as containing many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Rules touching manners; in which regard, wee may preferre them before other writings of men, so farre forth as they are consonant with the Scripture: and so the Church of God hath of long time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced them; but yet they are no part of the Law, nor of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.<note place="margin">Concil.

some Hebrew letters; insinuating, that not so much as the least part of a letter in the Law should passe away. Now these things must not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken properly, for it hath beene, and may be, that in the Hebrew copies of the old Testament, some letters should bee changed, as may appeare by the diuers readings in sundrie copies; for that may be without the losse of any sentence: but Christs meaning is this; That not the least parcell or sentence in the Law shall passe away; making parts in the Law, to be as titles in the Alphabet. <hi>Till heauen and earth perish:</hi> that is, <hi>neuer;</hi> so much this phrase insinuateth: for though heauen and earth shall be changed in regard of their qualities, yet the substance of them shall neuer passe to nothing: and in this sense is the word <hi>Till</hi> vsed else-where, 1.

                  <hi>The Lawe is changed? Answer.</hi> The Law is threefold; <hi>Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, Iudiciall,</hi> and <hi>Morall,</hi> as hath beene said: now that place is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to be vnderstood of the <hi>Ceremoniall law,</hi> which indeede is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, in regard of the obseruation of it in Gods worship; but in the scope and substance of it, which is Christ crucified, with his benefits, whom it shadowed out, it remaineth still, and is now more plaine then euer it was. As for the <hi>Iudiciall law,</hi> though it be abrogated vnto vs, so farre forth as it was peculiar to the Iewes; yet, as <note n="k" place="margin">See Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sc. cap. 2. sect. 5.</note> it agrees with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon equitie, and serues directly to establish the precepts of the Morall lawe, it is perpetuall. If it be said, that Christ changed the Morall law, in changing the Sabbath day, from the seauenth day to the eight: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, Christ did so indeed by his Apostles, but that is no change of the<note place="margin">Of the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day.</note> substance, but of the ceremonie of the Sabbath: for the substance of that law is, the inioyning of a seauenth daies rest vnto the Lord. Now though the seauenth day from the creation be not kept, yet a seauenth
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14013:42"/>
day is kept still. If it be further said, that the Law it selfe is abrogated; for that euery one that breaketh the Lawe is not accursed, according to the sentence thereof, Deut. 27. 26. <hi>Answer.</hi> Wee must knowe that the Law is but one part of Gods word, and the Gospel another, reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling another part of Gods will, besides that which the Lawe made knowne; for it addes a qualification to the Law, moderating the rigour thereof, after this manner: <hi>Hee is accursed</hi> (saith the Law) <hi>that faileth in any commandement, except</hi> (saith the Gospel) <hi>he bee reconciled againe in Christ, and in him haue the pardon of his transgressions.</hi> And yet the Morall law remaines for euer a rule of obedience to euery childe of God, though he be not bound to bring the same obedience for his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification before God.</p>
               <p>Againe, this propertie of the Law, in beeing vnchangeable, and for euer to be kept, sheweth, <hi>that no creature may dispense with the Law of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">No creature may dispense with Gods lawe.</note> 
                  <hi>God.</hi> Mens lawes may be abrogated and changed, but Gods Law euen in the least parts thereof, must stand for euer, till it be accomplished to the full: but if it might be dispensed with, then not onely <hi>iots</hi> and <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi> thereof, but whole lawes might bee abrogated.

               <p>Thirdly, from this propertie of the Law, we may obserue, that it is not likely that any whole booke of Canonicall Scripture is lost; for not one sentence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Law shall passe till all be fulfilled; much lesse then can whole bookes perish. Sundrie men do thinke that whole bookes be loste; but that opinion cals into question the fidelitie of the Church, and Gods own prouidence, in preseruing his word: neither can it stand wel with this text, that saith, <hi>no title thereof shal faile.</hi> Those that seeme to be lost, were either humane writings, as bookes of lawes and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, such as our books of statutes or Chronicles be; or books of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie, such as Salomon writ: or else some of them are in the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scripture; for the bookes of Samuel and the Kings, were written by diuers Prophets: and therfore we may more safely hold, that no part of holy Scripture is lost, neither shall euer faile. For howsoeuer after the last iudgement the vse of the word written shall cease, yet the substance thereof shall remaine in mens hearts, and be kept for euer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this immutabilitie of the Law, containes a matter of great terrour &amp; woe vnto al impenitent sinners; for howsoeuer they may flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14013:43"/>
themselues with a presumption of Gods mercie, yet the curse of Law which is against them, shall stand for euer: and therefore while<note place="margin">A terrour to the wicked, moouing to repentance.</note> they goe on in sinne, they haue iust cause to houle and crie; for Gods iustice in that his Law is inuiolable: neither will <note place="margin">Pro. 11. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>gold or siluer pacifie Gods wrath;</hi> for though a man by his power and wealth were able to ouerturne heauen and earth, yet that would not helpe him: though heauen and earth be brought to nothing, yet euery part of Gods Law must stand for euer, and be fulfilled. And therefore whosoeuer doe lie in any finne, must in time repent, humble themselues, forsake their sins, and betake themselues vnto Christ, that he may fulfill the Law for them; or else the cuise thereof shall certainly be fulfilled in them, and they shall there lie howling vnder it eternally, where is nothing but weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, this immutabilitie of the Law, and so proportionably of euery<note place="margin">A comfort to the godly.</note> part of Gods word, as it prooueth the Scriptures to be the word of God, so it is a most excellent ground of comfort for all Gods seruants to stablish their hearts in the assurance of all his promises. A Christian heart is subiect to receiue many doubtinges of the truth of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, especially in the time of triall and temptation; but this must be remembred for euer, that the whole word of God is immutable; though mans promises may faile and their lawes be abrogated, yet no iot or part of Gods word shall passe vnfulfilled: and therefore they must constantly waite for the accomplishment thereof, for in due time it shall be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, we are hereby taught to put on patience in afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; for they<note place="margin">A ground of patience.</note> come by the speciall appointment of our God, who saith in his word, <note n="p" place="margin">Act 14. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Seauenthly, our Sauiour Christ in this propertie of immutabilitie,<note place="margin">The integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Law.</note> giueth vnto the whole Law, and vnto euery sillable and letter thereof, his proper force, vertue, and sense; so as there is nothing in it, not so much as one letter vaine or idle: for euery commandement reueales the perfect iustice of God, and euery letter serues to expresse the same comaundement. And herein the Law of God differeth from mens lawes; for in them bee many vaine and idle words, yea oftentimes

                  <hi>Search the Scriptures:</hi> that is, shake and sift them (as the word signifieth) search narrowely, till the true force and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of euery sentence, yea of euery word and sillable; nay, of euery letter and iotte therein, bee knowne and vnderstood; conferre place with place, the scope of one place with another, things going before with things that come after; yea, compare word with word, letter with letter, and search it throughly.

Afterward, God of his meere mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, put into the hearts of some men, to bee carefull searchers in the word of God, by which meanes the truth appeared, as light out of darkenesse.

Secondly, that our fulfilling of the law, must be in the obedience of Christ, for he onely was answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the whole law in all things; and therefore if we would come to heauen, we must not come in our owne righteousnesse, but in his; as <hi>Paul</hi> wisheth to be found of God, Phil. 3. 8, 9.</p>

               <p>Our Sauiour Christ hauing plainely propounded in his Apologie for himselfe, the stabilitie and eternitie of the whole law; doth here laie downe two notable conclusions, for the vpholding thereof: 1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Law is immutable and eternall, therefore he that breaketh one of the least of the commandements, and teacheth men so, shall be called least in the kingdome of heauen.</hi> 2. <hi>Because the Law is eternall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that keepes the commandements, and teacheth men so, shall bee called great in the kingdome of heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first; by <hi>least commandement,</hi> he meaneth the precepts of the Morall lawe, though in the former verse, by (Law) he vnderstood
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14013:44"/>
the whole law in three parts; Iudiciall, Morall, and Ceremoniall: And he calleth them <hi>litle,</hi> not simply in regard of themselues, as though<note place="margin">How some commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are little.</note> they were so indeede; for in it selfe euery commaundement of God is great and waightie: but hee speaketh according to the opinion of the Iewes, for the Scribes and Pharises had ordained certaine rites and ceremonies, according to the tradition of their Fathers; the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation whereof, they made a greater matter of conscience, then the keeping of some of Gods commandements: and so esteemed them little. Againe, saying <hi>these least commaundements,</hi> hee pointeth out what particular commaundements of the Morall law, the Iewes estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med lesse then the traditions of men; namely, those which afterward he expoundeth in this Chapter, touching <hi>Murther, Adulterie, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> and the rest: for they esteemed not all the commaundements of the law lesser then their traditions. <hi>Shal be called least in the kingdome of heauen:</hi> Here Christ sets downe the punishment of a false Prophet,<note place="margin">Punishment of a false Prophet.</note> which breakes Gods commaundements, &amp; teacheth men so; to wit, his base esteeme in the Church of God; for the kingdome of God is two-fold, the kindome of grace, and the kingdome of glorie: The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace, is the societie and companie of Gods faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes here on earth: The kingdome of glorie, is the blessed estate of all the Saints in heauen. Now here by kingdome of heauen, he meaneth the kingdome of grace, which is the militant Church on earth: and so Iohn Baptist calleth it, Math. 3. 2. <hi>Repent and amend, for the kingdome of heauen is at hand:</hi> that is, the Church of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is now abolished; and the Church of the new Testament is ready to take place by Christs comming: and therfore repent and amend: and Math. 11. 12. <hi>from the time of Iohn hitherto, the kingdome of heauen suffereth violence.</hi> So then the meaning of this first conclusion is this,<note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> Whosoeuer breaketh one of these least commandements of the Moral law (which afterward I shall expound) and teacheth men so to doe, he shall be contemned, and not counted worthie to bee a member of the Church of God in the new Testament.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>conclusion,</hi> in the practise of the Iewes, Christ setteth forth<note place="margin">The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Gods word.</note> two notable corruptions of an hollow heart, towards God: The first, to set little by the commandements of God, esteeming no more of them, nay lesse, then of mens lawes and traditions: but Saint <hi>Iames</hi>

gladly, and obeied his doctrine in many things, and so seemed to make some account of some commandements; yet because he would needs liue in incest, against the seaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th commandement, he did in effect contemne and breake them all: so at this day, there are many who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse religion, and giue testimonie thereof, by hearing the word, and receiuing the sacraments; and herevpon they would be counted louers of Gods lawe: yet in the course of their liues, and in their particular callings, they will not sticke to oppresse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the poore, and to deale vniustly for their aduantage; to prophane the Sabbath for a little profit or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and to sweare, and curse, when they are a little prouoked. Now howsoeuer such persons may make a glorious shew of profession out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, yet by these and such like particular actions, they shew plainly that they haue but Pharisaicall hearts, which indeed make little or no account of Gods commandements.

feare and obedience towards to the same: one cause why men do not so highly aduance the law of God, as they ought, is because they doe not sufficiently waigh the dignitie thereof. In euery commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefore, we must first deepely consider the waight thereof; then labour to vnderstand it aright: thirdly, learne to admire the wisdome and iustice of God therein: and lastly, endeauour to yeeld loyaltie and obedience thereunto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in this Rule our Sauiour Christ puts a difference between<note place="margin">Difference between a false prophet and a true.</note> a false Prophet, and a true: The false Prophet breakes the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God in his owne person, and also by his doctrine teacheth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to doe the like: But the true Prophet and seruant of God, in the Ministerie, endeauoureth the aduancement of Gods glorie, as well by integritie of life, as by soundnesse of doctrine.</p>

great mercie hath vouchsafed vs this fauour in this land, that we should<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> receiue, and embrace his holy word, to publish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and teach the same; and so esteemeth vs worthie to be accounted a member of his Church: wee are therefore to reioyce in this mercie, and to praise God vnfainedly for this vnspeakable blessing; and to shewe forth our thankefulnesse, not onely by teaching, and receiuing the truth of his word, but also by yeelding obedience in all things thereunto: yea, our earnest and daily prayer must be, because it is so great a blessing, to be counted worthie of his kingdome, that God would continue the truth of his will to vs, and to our posteritie for euer.</p>
               <p>The second Conclusion: <hi>Whosoeuer shall keepe them, and teach men so, the same shall be called great in the kingdome of heauen:</hi> that is, hee shall bee honoured in the Church of God, and esteemed a worthie member thereof, because by this meanes, he endeauoureth to keepe the law vnchangeable for euer. In this conclusion two points are<note place="margin">The office of a faithfull Teacher.</note> to be considered; the <hi>office</hi> of a faithfull Teacher, and his <hi>reward:</hi> his <hi>office</hi> is two-fold; First, in his owne person hee must be a doer of Gods commandements: Secondly, in his publike Ministerie hee must teach men so to doe.</p>
               <p>Here first obserue the order of these duties; <hi>Doing</hi> must goe before<note place="margin">Doe, and teach.</note> 
                  <hi>Teaching:</hi> This order Christ propounds, and that doubtlesle on speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grounds; First, because a man cannot with ioy and comfort fitly teach others, before himselfe bee a doer of the thing hee teacheth; for if a man teach others, from the instruction of the spirit, hee shall finde his owne heart inclined by the same spirit, to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the word he teacheth.</p>
               <p>Againe, the experience of the fruite and efficacie of the word, in his owne person, is the best Commentarie a man can haue, for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it vnto others: The writings of men, with the knowledge of artes and tongues, are excellent helpes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet if a man want the spirit of God, framing his heart to beleeue, and obey the word hee teacheth, whereby he should become a doer of it; doubtlesse the word wil seeme but a dreame or riddle vnto him, neither can he fitly apply the same vnto others, hauing neuer had experience of it in his owne soule. This then should mooue all Ministers, and such as set themselues to this calling, first and chiefly, to labour to become doers of the word themselues; other helpes of learning are to bee fought for with all diligence, to make them fit and able Ministers of so great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries; but especially, they must labour for the spirit of grace, to frame their hearts to embrace, and their liues to obey the word which

               <p>These words are commonly taken to bee a Reason of the former verse, by way of answer to a secret obiection, which the Iewes might frame there-from, to this effect; <hi>Thou saiest, whosoeuer breaketh one of these least commandements, and teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdome of heauen: But our Teachers the Scribes and Pharises, looke to haue chiefe place in the kingdome of heauen; and yet</hi> (if thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be true) <hi>they breake Gods commandements, and teach others so to doe.</hi> Now here-to Christ should answer thus; <hi>I say vnto you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi>

                  <hi>your righteousnesse exceedes theirs, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heauen.</hi> But if we marke well, the words may more fitly be referred to the 17. verse, as a third reason, to prooue that Christ came not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy<note place="margin">Scope.</note> the Law, or the Prophets, but to fulfill them; because he exacts at euery mans hands, a more perfect and exact righteousnesse, then that which the Scribes and Pharises either haue in themselues, or require in others; without which, no man can enter into the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>In this verse are three points to be handled: First, what these <hi>Scribes and Pharises</hi> were: Secondly, what was their <hi>Righteousnesse:</hi> and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what is that <hi>true Righteousnesse,</hi> whereby a man may enter into the kingdome of heauen, and stand iust before God.</p>
               <p>For the first: a <hi>Scribe</hi> is a name of office, whereof there were two<note place="margin">A Scribe. 1.

                  <hi>conformable to the law;</hi> but the inward righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of the heart they nothing regarded, thinking that perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes consisted in outward obedience, &amp; by that they looked to be saued; as it is said, Rom. 10. 2. <hi>neglecting vtterly the righteousnes of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these Scribes and Pharisies we may obserue, what is the naturall<note place="margin">Mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conceit of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes.</note> perswasion of man, touching righteousnes: to wit, that an outward righteousnes will serue the turne: and therefore euery man naturally contents himselfe therewith: and hence it is that men will bring their bodies vsually to the place of Gods worship to pray, to heare the word, and receiue the Sacraments; but few haue care to bring their hearts with them, that they may inwardly worship God in spirit and truth: so likewise, many are content to rest from their ordinarie labours on the Sabbath day, but few are carefull to consecrate their rest vnto God: men be carefull to abstaine from actuall murther, but few make conscience of malice, hatred, reuiling, and quarelling: many hate theft, that yet will not sticke to robbe their neighbours of their good name, by vile reports: many are ashamed to robbe openly, that make no bones to deceiue by false weights and measures, by glosses, and such like: and yet all these will blesse themselues with their outward righteousnes, and think all is well; not doubting but they shall be saued by it, though they haue no more: but this is Pharisaicall pride and folly: for all such outward righteousnes is here condemned, as vnable to saue the soule.</p>
               <p>Againe, here wee may see the palpable and grosse opinion of all<note place="margin">Ciuill hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the soule.</note> worldly men, euen of those who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly are called honest men: if they be told of their sinnes, &amp; of the danger of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, except they repent:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14013:48"/>
their answer is; they are no theeues, no murtherers, no grosse sinners, and therefore they hope God will saue them; for they liue orderly, and doe no man wrong: but let all such take heede, lest they deceiue their owne soules, for this <hi>ciuill honestis</hi> was the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharises, which could neither bring them, nor any other into the kingdome of heauen, as Christ the God of truth saith expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this place. To giue almes, to fast, to praie, and to deale vprightly with men, be very good things; but yet wee must labour for more then these, if euer wee meane to come to heauen: wee must get another righteousnesse of the heart, renouncing vtterly our owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in the matter of Iustification, and condemne our selues for our best actions, that so we may be fit to receiue that true righteousnesse, which will commend vs vnto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. Point.</hi> What is that true righteousnesse which will bring a<note place="margin">True righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</note> man to heauen? <hi>Answ.</hi> It is the righteousnesse of Christ, 1. Cor. 1. 30. for <hi>Christ is made vnto vs of God, wisedome, righteousnesse;</hi> yea, <hi>hee was made sinne for vs, that wee might be made the</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21</note> 
                  <hi>righteousnesse of God in him.</hi> This is that righteousnesse, which exceedes the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharises, and whereby a sinner doth stand iust before God: for when as by <hi>Adams</hi> fall wee all became guiltie of sinne, and thereby subiect to the curse of God, and to eternall condemnation, from which we could neuer haue deliuered our selues; then it pleased Christ to come from the bosome of his father, and to become our sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Sauiour, who in his life became obedient to the law for vs, and in and by death vpon the crosse, suffered whatsoeuer was due vnto our sinnes: which obedience and satisfaction beeing made by him that was both God and man, was alone all-sufficient, both to free vs from the curse of the law, and also to iustifie vs before God: and this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Christ, is that which exceeds the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharises, and is able to bring a man to heauen. Yet further<note place="margin">Parts of Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</note> for our Iustification, Christs righteousnesse hath three parts; the puritie of his humane nature, the integritie and obedience of his life, and the merit of his sufferings vpon the crosse; and all this must be ours, to answer for our corrupt nature, and sinnefull life, deseruing a cursed death.</p>
               <p>Here some make question, how Christs righteousnesse can be ours?<note place="margin">Obiect. 1. Bellar. de Iustific. l. 2. c. 7. Answ.</note> and how one mans righteousnes can saue so many thousands? <hi>Answ.</hi> Christs righteousnes is not the righteousnes of a meere man (for then it could saue but one at the most,) but it is the righteousnesse of that person, who is both God and man, and therfore is an infinit righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14013:48"/>
of merit sufficient to saue a thousand worlds. But some here say, If Christs righteousnesse bee ours, then we are as righteouse as Christ?<note place="margin">Obiect. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The same righteousnesse that is in Christ, is ours, but not in the<note place="margin">Answ.</note> same manner or measure; for Christ hath it by merit and action of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, we haue it onely by mercie and imputation: it is in Christ as a roote and fountaine, in vs by reception and application; like the light in the Moone, and in the Starres, which is not in them originally, but receiued from the Sunne, the fountaine thereof. Thirdly, it is said, If we<note place="margin">Obiect 3.</note> by Christs righteousnesse be iustified, and made the sonnes of God; then is Christ by our sinnes made vniust, and so the childe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell? <hi>Answer.</hi> We may safely say, that Christ was made a sinner by<note place="margin">Answ.</note> our sinnes, not actually, but by imputation: now hence it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that hee should bee the childe of the diuell, for that commeth by the acte and habite of sinning, after sinnefull conception; al which, our Sauiour Christ was free from: for at the very time when hee bare our sinnes, hee was in himselfe more holy, then all men, and all Angels. Fourthly, it is said, that if Christs righteousnesse bee made<note place="margin">Obiect. 4. Answ.</note> ours, then wee are made Sauiours? <hi>Answer.</hi> It followeth not; for Christs merits and righteousnesse are conuaied and applied vnto men, not as they are in Christs person, in whom they are sufficient to saue ten thousand worlds; but as they serue to saue and iustifie that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar person onely, to whom they are imputed: so that this remaines an vndoubted truth, that that righteousnesse which brings saluation, is Christs righteousnesse onely.</p>
               <p>Here some may say, How is Christs righteousnesse made ours, and<note place="margin">Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is made ours by faith.</note> wee assured of it? <hi>Answ.</hi> It is made ours by sauing faith, which the holy Ghost creates in the heart and soule, as an hand whereby wee may laie hold on Christ, and applie his righteousnesse vnto our selues, as hee is offered vnto vs in the promises of the Gospel. Some obiect, that if Christs righteousnesse be made ours, by our beleeuing it to bee ours; then if a man beleeue his neighbours house to be his, it is his also: and so for any other thing? <hi>Answer.</hi> There is not the like reason in these things; for it is a meere fancie and imagination, for a man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue his neighbours house to be his, hauing no ground for it, besides his owne conceit: but when a man beleeueth Christs righteousnesse to be his, he hath Gods commandement and promise, for his warrant and assurance, that it shall be imputed vnto him; and withall, that faith so grounded, maketh Christs righteousnesse as truely his, as any thing a<note place="margin">Sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goeth with Iustification.</note> man hath is his owne, beeing giuen him of another. Now this sauing faith, laying hold on Christs righteousnesse, for mans iustification, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14013:49"/>
seuered from sanctification by the spirit, with the fruits thereof, whereby the old man beeing mortified, and the new man in Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, according to his image, in knowledge, righteousnesse, and true holinesse, the whole person is turned vnto God, and made carefull to<note place="margin">

                  </note> please him, both in thought, word, and deede: and hereby doe wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue assurance of our iustification; for true sanctification is the earnest of the spirit of adoption in our hearts, whereby we are sealed vnto the day of our redemption.</p>
               <p>Doth that righteousnesse, whereby we must be iustified and saued<note place="margin">The vse.</note> in the day of our Lord, come from Christ onely, and not from our<note place="margin">1</note> selues? then we see what iust cause we haue to humble our selues, and to acknowledge our great vnrighteousnesse, and want of all goodnesse in our selues: and when wee can doe this vnfainedly, wee haue gone one steppe in the way to true happinesse. Secondly, we also must here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by<note place="margin">2</note> learne, to esteeme all things <hi>as drosse and dongue,</hi> with the <note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 3. 8, 9.</note> Apostle, in respect of Christ Iesus, and his righteousnesse; for he it is that brings vs to heauen, and therefore wee must honour him aboue all, and value his righteousnesse, as that most pretious iewel, which when a man hath found, hee will sell all that he hath, to get and keepe it, Matth. 13. 46. Thirdly, we must hunger and thirst after Christ, and his righteousnesse,<note place="margin">3</note> for it is the fountaine of all blessednes, and without it we are most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable: yea, though wee had all the world beside, yet without it wee<note place="margin">Matth. 16. 26.</note> loose our saluation. Now what will it profit a man to winne all the world, if he loose his soule? Fourthly, seeing Christs righteousnesse is<note place="margin">4</note> made ours by faith, &amp; we made assured of it, by sanctification of heart, and life; wee must labour for true faith, whereby our hearts may bee inwardly renued: we must not content our selues with an outward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, for that will neuer bring a man to heauen; but our endeauour must be for inward holinesse, whereby we shal be preferred with God, aboue all the Pharises in the world, and get assurance of eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And this faith wee must shewe forth in all holy exercises; as when we heare the word, wee must lend the inward eare of the heart, with the bodily eare; and when we fall downe to praier, we must bowe the knees of our hearts; and in fasting from meate, wee must abstaine from sinne: yea, in all things wee must be carefull to serue God, in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and truth; for which cause, wee must pray with <hi>Dauid, Lord renue</hi>

               <p>For the first: The Exposition. <hi>Ye haue heard:</hi> that is, you Iewes which now heare mee, whether Scribes, Pharises, or others; <hi>you haue heard, that it hath beene said of old:</hi> that is, by your auncient Teachers, the old Scribes and Pharises, who haue expounded this law vnto you: and that this phrase must be vnderstood of the ancient Iewish Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, may plainely appeare, because in the next verse hee opposeth his owne teaching thereunto, and would haue these his hearers, that before had learned a false interpretation of this law, from their old Teachers, now to learne of him, the true exposition thereof. The Law is this, <hi>Thou shalt not kill:</hi> The exposition of the ancient Iewish Teachers was this, <hi>for whosoeuer killeth shall be culpable of iudgement:</hi> that is, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer laieth violent handes on another, to take away his life (for they knew no other murther, neither did they extend this commandement to forbid any sin, but actual murther) <hi>shall be culpable of iudgement:</hi> that is, shall be held guiltie of murther, both in the courts of men, and also before the iudgement seate of God, where hee shall receiue the deserued punishment thereof. This was the interpretation of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>Here first obserue, that Antiquitie is no infallible marke of true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;<note place="margin">Antiquitie no infallible marke of truth.</note> for this exposition of this commandement was ancient, received from ancient Teachers; and yet Christ the doctour of truth, reiecteth it, as false and corrupt: and therefore the argument which the Papists vse, for the stablishing of their religion, drawn from Antiquitie, is of no effect.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by these words of Christ, <hi>ye haue heard, it hath beene said</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How the Pharises ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the law.</note> 
                  <hi>of olde,</hi> wee may easily gather, after what manner the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises expounded the law; namely, they left the Scriptures, and followed the interpretation of their ancient Teachers. But here Christ check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and reprooueth this manner of teaching; and therefore the like cannot be warrantable among vs at this day: whereby we see that kind
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14013:50"/>
of teaching reprooued, wherein euery point is stuffed out with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of Fathers, Schoolemen, and humane writers.

If we say that Fathers oft dissent, and the Church may erre, then they send vs to the <note n="k" place="margin">Hart. conf. with Rainol. chap. 2. div. 2.</note> Popes breast. But if this course were safe, then the Iewish teachers might haue had a good defence against this charge of Christ: for they had both Church and Fathers on their side, and the high Priest that was then in place. Indeede the Fathers must be reuerenced, as lights of the Church in their time, and their testimonies duly regarded, wherein they agree with the written word: but for the confirmation of the truth in mans conscience, and for the edifying of the soule in the graces of the spirit, the word of God hath the onely stroake: by it alone Gods children are begotten, and borne anew to a liuely hope, and by it alone they are fed and nourished in the faith, yea, by it alone they are confirmed and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the truth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in these Iewish Teachers, forbidding nothing as a breach of<note place="margin">Mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conceit of keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</note> this law, but the outward sinne of murther; and on the contrarie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing of those as keepers of this law, that kept their hands from this Actuall crime of blood, and by consequent worthie of life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting; behold a plaine picture of euery naturall man: for is not this the common opinion, that vnlesse a man kill an other, he breakes not this commandement? and so for the rest, if he abstaine from the outward actuall grosse sinnes of stealing, adulterie, and false witnes bearing, then he keepes those commandements, though his heart be neuer so full fraught with enuie, malice, lust, couetousnes, falshood, &amp;c. But let vs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue Christs reproofe of such erronious interpretations of Gods law, as a meanes to schoole our hearts from such vaine conceits.</p>

               <p>Here our Sauiour Christ propounds the true interpretation of this Commandement: <hi>But I say vnto you</hi>) that is, whatsoeuer you haue<note place="margin">Exposition.</note> heard the Scribes or Pharisies teach you from themselues, or from their fathers, it is nothing, let them not deceiue you: for I that am the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer and Doctor of my Church, and therefore best know the meaning of mine owne law, I say otherwise vnto you: <hi>whosoeuer is angrie with his brother, &amp;c.</hi> Here Christ laies downe three kinds of murther, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14013:50"/>
three degrees of punishments for the same. The first degree of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>Anger,</hi> not anger simply: but <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>indiser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>et anger</hi> towards<note place="margin">1</note> a brother: and by <hi>Brother,</hi> he meaneth, first, one Iew with an other, to<note place="margin">3. degrees of murther.</note> whome Christ spake; secondly, one neighbour with an other, whether Iew or Gentile: for by creation we are all brethren, hauing one father which is God, as Adam is called the sonne of God. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 38. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond<note place="margin">2</note> degree of murther, is <hi>calling his brother Raca.</hi> Some expound this word <hi>Raca,</hi> an idle or emptie braine: others, an euill man: others take it to signifie a loathsome man, one to be spit at, as we by spitting vse to shew our contempt: but these interpretations cannot so fitly stand: for then the third degree of murther and this second, should be one and the same: for to call a man emptie braine, euill, or loathsome, and to call him foole are equall in degree. Now Christs intent is to set downe distinct degrees of murther, as is euident by the distinct degrees of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment adioined thereunto. A more fit exposition is this, that <hi>Raca</hi> hath no perfect signification, but is onely an interiection of indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby a man doth not slaunder or reuile his brother, but onely in gesture shew the contempt and anger of his heart against him; as when in English we say, <hi>fie, tush,</hi> or such like: which words are not open raylings, but onely outward signes of the inward anger and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt concealed in the heart; so that the meaning is this: He that is angrie with his brother, and expresseth this his anger either in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture or countenance, by frowning lookes, gnashing of teeth, or by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect speech, as tush, fie, pish, or such like, he is guiltie of murther. The third degree of murther is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man doth shew his anger against<note place="margin">3</note> his brother by open raylings, and reproachfull names; expressed in these words, <hi>whosoeuer shall call his brother foole.</hi> And all these three degrees are beyond the interpretation of the Iewish Teachers, who onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned actuall killing by this commandement.</p>
               <p>Now to these seuerall kinds of murther, Christ addeth distinct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of punishment. The first is, <hi>to be culpable of iudgement</hi> for vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised anger. The second, <hi>to be worthie to be punished of a Councell,</hi> for outward signes of this anger. The third is, <hi>to be worthie of hell fire,</hi> for reproachfull names or raylings. And here we must vnderstand, that Christ speaketh not properly, in setting downe these degrees of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but figuratiuely alluding to the custome of punishing offenders<note place="margin">Courts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes, 3. P. Fagius in Deut. 16.</note> vsed among the Iewes: for they had three courts; The first was held by <hi>three men</hi> for meane matters, and other cases of small importance. The second was held by <hi>three and twentie men,</hi> wherein were determined matters of great importance, that could not be decided in the first
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14013:51"/>
court; as matters of life and death: and it was kept in the cheife cities of the land. The third court was held at Ierusalem onely, called the court of the <hi>Seauentie-two,</hi> from which none might appeale to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In it were all weightie and great causes determined, and this court is here called <hi>a Councell.</hi> Now Christ alluding hereto, saith to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: <hi>Look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Further, the words translated <hi>hell fire,</hi> are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>fire of Gehenna;</hi> for there was a place neere to the suburbs of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem called <hi>Gehenna,</hi> which is a compound Hebrew word, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Gehenna.</note> 
                  <hi>the valley of Hinnon,</hi> wherein was a place called <hi>Tophet,</hi> Ier. 7. 31. where the idolatrous Iewes, following the horrible superstition of the Nations about them, vsed to burne their children vnto Molech: for which fact the place became so odious to the godly, that to aggrauate the heinousnes of this crime, they vsed this name to signifie and beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the place of torment appointed for the reprobate: whereupon in Christs time, <hi>Gehenna,</hi> and <hi>the fire of hell,</hi> were in signification all one. Now in this valley the Iewes vsed to burne their malefactours; and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this kinde of iudgement Christ alludeth, meaning not simply hell fire, the torments of the damned, but a more grieuous and greater kind of punishment then the former, because it was a higher degree of sinne: so that Christs meaning is this; <hi>Howsoeuer your Scribes and Pharisies teach you, that there is no murther but actuall killing, and that it onely deserues condemnation: yet I which am the law-giuer say vnto you, that as you haue diuers punishments in seuerall courts for diuers offences, as hanging, stoning, and burning: so God he hath diuers degrees of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the seuerall breaches of this commandement: he that is rashly angrie, is worthie of iudgement: and he that giues out any shew of his anger in gesture, shall be punished more grieuously; but he that shewes forth his anger by rayling and reuiling, shall endure the most grieuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of all.</hi>

Veniall sinnes</hi> (say they) are light sinnes, as badde thoughts, vaine speeches, and such like, which doe not deserue damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but some temporall punishment onely, such as were alotted to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill courts among the Iewes: for here (say they) Christ onely makes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen rayling &amp; reuiling of our brother, such an heinous sinne as deserues hell fire. But this distinction cannot here be grounded: for Christ doth not appropriate condemnation to this tearme of hell fire: but he hath reference thereto in euery phrase that here imports a punishment; as, to be <hi>culpable of iudgement for vnaduised anger,</hi> is to deserue condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in hell fire; and <hi>to be punished by a Councell,</hi> for testifying anger by outward signes, <hi>is to deserue condemnation,</hi> but yet in a deeper degree: And <hi>to be worthie to be punished with the fire of Gehennah, for open ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> is to deserue condemnation also, but yet in a deeper measure then the former: for as among the Iewes by the sentence of their Courts, some offences were punished by beheading or hanging; greater offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by stoning, and the greatest by burning; all which punishments dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in degree, and yet euery one was death: so before God, lesser sinnes deserue lesser condemnation in hell fire, and greater sinnes dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per damnation; and yet euery sinne deserues damnation: for <hi>the wages of sinne,</hi> be it neuer so little, <hi>is death,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. so that Christ here makes degrees of punishments, according to the degrees of sinne; &amp; yet so, as euery sinne is mortall, deseruing da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, &amp; none venial in it self.</p>

                  </gap>ke, how we may discerne godly anger, from that which is euill and vnaduised: <hi>I answer:</hi> two waies, first, by the beginning of it: for good anger proceedeth from the loue of him with whome we are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie; now loue is the fulfilling of the law, and therefore anger procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from loue and guided thereby, cannot be a breach thereof: but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill<note place="margin">1</note> anger proceedeth from selfe-loue, from dislike or hatred of the partie with whome we are angrie. Secondly, we may discerne it by the<note place="margin">2</note> ende. Good anger is for Gods glorie against sinne, because God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is dishonoured; and for our brothers good: but euill anger wants these ends, and intendeth priuate respects. It is quickly mooued, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth long, and also carieth with it a desire of reuenge.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, seeing vnaduised anger, with the signe thereof, is a breach<note place="margin">Anger must be bridled.</note> of this law deseruing death; hereby we are admonished to beware of this headstrong affection of anger, and betime to restraine and bridle the same: it hath a bad beginning, and an euill ende, and thereby we become murtherers. Now that we may ouerrule it, so as it preuaile not<note place="margin">How.</note> against vs: first, we must lay to our hearts this commandement of God<note place="margin">1</note> forbidding rash anger, as a barre to stoppe it. Secondly, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,<note place="margin">2</note> how louingly and mercifully God deales with vs euery day, in forbearing and forgiuing vs: and therefore we ought to be like minded towards our brethren.

               <p>The second branch of sinne here condemned is, <hi>to say vnto our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Raca:</hi> whereby we may see that euery gesture expressing rash an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,<note place="margin">Signes of despite are degrees of murther.</note> and despite of heart towards another, is murther before God; as <hi>casting downe the countenance towards him:</hi> this God reprooued in Cain, Gen. 4. 6. <hi>frowning</hi> &amp; <hi>nodding the head,</hi> or <hi>shaking</hi> it in contempt,<note place="margin">1</note> as the Iewes did to Christ, Matth. 27. 39. also <hi>contemptuous laughter</hi>

Thirdly, <note n="g" place="margin">Eph. 4. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>crying</hi> also is here forbidden, whereby men or women<note place="margin">3</note> beeing at variance in priuate speeches, doe through choler and malice lift vp their voices, that they may be heard a farre off.

                  <note place="margin">5</note> and <hi>taunting</hi> others by priuie and close nipps, is here condemned, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be no open rayling: for thereby men seeke to disgrace their brethren, and to glad their owne hearts by grieuing others; which is more then to say, <hi>Raca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third degree of murther is, in <hi>Reviling tearmes,</hi> calling our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Reuiling tearmes forbidden.</note>

It is a breach of this sixt commandement, in that hereby we grieue and trouble our neighbour,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14013:53"/>
and so farre as a reproach can goe, make him wearie of his life.</p>
               <p>Vpon the ground of this degree of murther, be all grieuous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses<note place="margin">Grieuous practises here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note> of men against their brethren, iustly condemned for bloodie practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.

Hereby many are brought to great pouertie: reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tearmes doe nothing so much pinch the poore, as this oppression.

                  <hi>may gaine the more:</hi> these men make a priuate gaine of Gods common<note place="margin">Hoarding vp of corne.</note> iudgement vpon the poore. Indeede it is not vnlawfull in time of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to lay vp stoare against a time of dearth: but to doe it with the hurt of the poore, is to sucke their blood, and to eate vp Gods people; as when men keepe their garners full, and suffer the poore to starue; the peoples curse lies on such, Prou. 11. 26.

                  <hi>by priuate persons, or by others in their priuate causes:</hi> for they wound<note place="margin">Fighting.</note> or weaken the bodie of their neighbours, which is more then to grieue him by reuiling speeches. Fourthly, the <hi>detaining the foode of the soule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4</note> by those that cannot, or will not preach, is a damage against eternall<note place="margin">Soule-star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</note> life: and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> to cleare himselfe from blood in this behalfe, said, <hi>He kept nothing backe,</hi> Act. 20. 26, 27.

They are like lights in an hauen which guides the shippes that saile by night, which standing amisse, leade the shippes vpon rockes and sands, and so cause shipwracke.</p>
               <p>Hauing seene the true meaning of this Law expounded by Christ, let es here further obserue, how he restoreth the true vse thereof. We must not thinke, that he did onely here intend the rectifying of our iudgements for vnderstanding, and not also strike at the reformation of our hearts and liues for practise. Touching the vse of this law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">The true vse of this law.</note> Christ here teacheth vs two things: first, to descend into our owne hearts, and there to search how we haue broken this commandement:<note place="margin">1. Search our hearts.</note> as whether we haue borne in our hearts any malice against our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and whether we haue expressed the rash anger of our hearts by speech or gesture, or haue any way wronged him by reuiling tearmes, or other iniuries against his life: if we haue, Christ tells vs we are mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:14013:53"/>Secondly, Christ setting downe the curse to euery degree of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; teacheth vs, vpon due examination of our hearts, fuiding our<note place="margin">2. Iudge our selues.</note> selues guiltie in any degree, to cast downe our selues before the Lord, to accuse and condemne our selues, crying out that all shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion belongs vnto vs: this we must doe, that by the view of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, we may be mooued more earnestly to sue for mercie. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede if we examine our hearts, and our behauiours throughly, we shall finde, that we are all murtherers. For though we may be free from actuall killing, yet our consciences will tell vs, that the motions of wrath and malice, and the signes of vnaduised anger haue broken forth, both in our wordes and gesture: for who can say he neuer <hi>snuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed</hi> at an other by way of contempt or dislike? who can cleare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from <hi>deriding and disgracing</hi> others? now these things and such like, make vs guiltie of sinne against the law, and so subiect to the wrath and curse of God; which must needes be fulfilled, though hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth should passe away. This vndoubtedly is our miserable and wofull case in our selues. And there is no way to escape this curse, but onely this: we must humble our selues before God, and confesse against our selues the murther of our hearts, declared in our gesture, speech, and behauiour; then we must labour to be grieued for these sinnes: for which ende we must applie vnto our selues, Gods fearefull iudgements due vnto vs for them. Thirdly, we must earnestly sue vnto God for mercie and pardon, as for life and death, like as poore prisoners doe, when the sentence of death is to be pronounced against them: yea, we must crie with sighs and grones that cannot be expressed, and giue the Lord no rest, till he send into our consciences the comfortable mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of mercie and pardon by his good spirit. This done, we must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in our callings for the time to come, to procure and further the welfare and safetie of our brethren, as well as our owne: we must not seeke our selues, but the common good, eschewing those things that may grieue our brethren; and doing those that may be good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable vnto them: that so by new obedience we may shew forth thankefulnes for Gods mercie and fauour towards vs.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we haue ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled the three degrees of murther, which Christ condemneth by this law, beyond the doctrine of the Iewish teachers.<note place="margin">Actuall kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> Besides these, there is a fourth degree here condemned, which is <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all killing.</hi> This Christ doth not here name, because he taketh it for graunted, euen by the doctrine of the Scribes and Pharisies. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the main sinne of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, therfore here it is to be handled; which we wil doe thus: first, we wil shew when killing is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14013:54"/>
and when it is not: and then handle the kinds thereof.</p>
               <p>For the first: <hi>Killing</hi> is not alwaies murther, for sometime a man<note place="margin">When kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</note> hath power giuen of God to kill, and it is no sinne: now God giues a man power to kill three waies: I. by the <hi>written word:</hi> thus Princes and Gouerners, and vnder them executioners, are allowed to kill male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours<note place="margin">1</note> that deserue death: and thus souldiers are warranted to kill their enemies in a lawfull warre: II. by an <hi>extraordinarie Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> and so <hi>Abraham</hi> might lawfully haue killed his sonne, if the <note n="a" place="margin">Cen. 22. 2. 10, 11.</note> Angel of the Lord had not staied his hand: III. by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie<note place="margin">3</note> instinct, which is answerable to a speciall commandement: and so <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 106. 30, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Phinees</hi> slue <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbie,</hi> without guilt of murther. But killing is murther, when men of their own wills, without warrant from God, slay others: and this sinne is plainely and directly forbidden in this commandement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> The kindes of killing be two; either <hi>voluntarie,</hi> or <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The kinds of killing. 1. Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> 
                  <hi>Uoluntarie</hi> killing is, when a man killeth of <hi>purpose and intent:</hi> and this sinne is so hainous, that it <note n="c" place="margin">Numb. 35. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>defileth the land</hi> where the blood is shedde, till it be purged by the blood of him that shedde it. And this <hi>purpose to kill</hi> is twofold; either <hi>with deliberation</hi> and fore-desire of reuenge, as when a man hath caried a grudge in his heart long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: or <hi>without deliberation,</hi> when a man without all former malice is suddenly caried by furie and anger to slay his brother: and this second kinde of killing is distinguished from that which is vpon deliberation, by the name of <hi>manslaughter,</hi> and also fauoured by the lawes of some<note place="margin">Manslaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Countries, because it is not done of set purpose, but through sudden anger before the blood be cold: but Gods law maketh both of them murther, and admitteth <note n="d" place="margin">Num. 35. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>no recompense for the life of the murtherer:</hi> nay, beside it adiudgeth the murtherer to eternall death, both in soule and bodie. To this voluntarie murther, we must referre those that<note place="margin">2</note> giue commandement, counsell, or helpe vnto the murtherer: for he that commandeth is the principall Agent, and the murtherer is his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.<note place="margin">3</note> Againe, it is voluntarie murther to strike an other, though with purpose onely to wound, if death follow thereon: And that also which is committed by a drunken man: for his will is free, though sense and reason be blinded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Casuall killing,</hi> commonly called <hi>chance medlie,</hi> is when a man kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth<note place="margin">Casuall kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The signes thereof.</note> an other, hauing no purpose to doe him hurt. The presumptions of casuall killing be these: <hi>First,</hi> if a man kill an other, hauing no ill will or anger towardes him, nor to any other for his sake; neither is moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued<note place="margin">1</note> thereto by couetousnes, or any affection. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if he be doing<note place="margin">2</note>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:14013:54"/>
the lawfull duties of his particular calling. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if he be well occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, doing some lawfull worke beside his calling. And <hi>lastly,</hi> if he be<note place="margin">3</note> doing a thing which he ordinarily practiseth, keeping his vsuall place<note place="margin">4</note> and time. And albeit this kind of killing, if it be meerely casuall, is no sinne, yet the partie committing it, in old time was bound to come to his answer, thereby to purge and cleare himselfe from suspition of murther, as also to auoide the hatred and daunger of the friends of the partie killed; and lastly, to keepe and maintaine the hatred of murther among Gods people. Now this sixt commandement, is not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of casuall, but of voluntarie killing. And this also must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, that Christ giueth the name of murther, to all the occasions thereof, that he might breede in our hearts an hatred of them all, as of murther it selfe.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>Here Christ propounds a Rule of concord, by seeking reconciliation with them whome we haue wronged: and it depends vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verse as a consequent and conclusion drawne therefrom, as may<note place="margin">Coherence.</note> appeare by the first wordes, <hi>If then,</hi> or <hi>therefore:</hi> as if he had said, If rash anger and the testification thereof, either in gesture or reuiling speech be murther, and deserue condemnation, then we are with all diligence to seeke to be reconciled to our brethren, whensoeuer any breach of loue is made betweene vs and them.</p>
               <p>The Exposition. <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the Altar</hi>] Here Christ alludeth to the Iewes manner of worshippe vnder the law; which was, to offer in the Temple sacrifices vnto God both of propitiation, and thanksgiuing. And though Christ here onely name this one kind of ceremoniall worshippe, yet vnder this he comprehendeth all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of true outward worshippe, whether Legall or Euangelicall; as if he should say, <hi>If thou come to worship God any way,</hi> either by offering sacrifices, or by praying vnto God, by hearing his word, or receiuing the Sacraments; <hi>and remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee,</hi> that is, that thou hast any way wronged and offended thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: this appeareth to be the true meaning by the like wordes of <note n="a" place="margin">Mark. 11. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Marke, If thou hast ought against thy brother,</hi> (meaning for iniurie done vnto thee by him) <hi>forgiue him:</hi> and therefore our brother hath something against vs, when we haue wronged or offended him in word
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14013:55"/>
or deede, and he hath knowledge thereof, and iust cause thereupon to complaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leaue there thy gift before the Altar</hi>] Still he alludeth to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Iewes worshippe; who when they went to sacrifice to the Lord, brought their sheepe or bullocke vnto the vtter court; or as some thinke, tied it to the hornes of the altar, in token that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it vnto the Lord: now if at that very instant, they did remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that they had any way offended their brother, then were they to leaue their gift there, (not quite omiting this dutie, but onely suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or deferring it for a while) and goe seeke to be reconciled to their brother whome they had wronged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi> How could this departure be warrantable, seeing the Iewes had a law <note n="b" place="margin">Ezek. 46. 10.</note> that when the seruice of God was once begun, <hi>none might depart, no not the Prince himselfe, till it was ended. Ans.</hi> This Rule must be vnderstood of departure out of the vtter court of the Temple, whither the people brought their sacrifice soone after they had presented it, before it was begunne to be offered: for till the Priests had begunne Gods seruice, it was lawfull for the people to depart, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vpon this occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question II.</hi> But what if the partie offending, cannot possibly come to his brother whome he hath wronged, by reason of his absence in some farre countrey, his close imprisonment, or such like. <hi>Ans.</hi> He must testifie his endeauour to be reconciled vnto him; and if the act it selfe be necessarily hindred by Gods prouidence, God will accept the will for the deede, if there be a willing minde: for this is Christs mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that we should doe our vtmost endeauour to be reconciled vnto our brethren whome we haue wronged, shewing such care thereof, that we preferre the same before the outward actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Gods worship; not presuming to worship God, till we be reconciled to our brethren.</p>
               <p>Here we haue a notable Rule for the maintaining of loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie among men; namely, <hi>brotherly reconciliation.</hi> In the giuing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Christ still continues his exposition of the sixt commandement: for hauing condemned murther, and the prouocations thereunto, in the former verse; here he commandeth the contrarie vertue of brotherly loue, and the meanes to vphold the same; to wit, Reconciliation for offences giuen.</p>
               <p>Out of this Rule in generall we may obserue: first, a Third di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection<note place="margin">A third rule for expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> to the right expounding and vnderstanding of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; namely, <hi>where any vice is forbidden, there the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie vertue is commanded:</hi> and on the contrarie, <hi>where any vertue is</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:14013:55"/>
                  <hi>commaunded, there the contrarie vice is forbidden.</hi> This Rule must be obserued as a priuiledge of the law of God, aboue all humane lawes; for mens lawes are satisfied, by abstaining from the vice forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, though the contrarie vertue be not practised: as he satisfies mans law, forbidding Murther, that abstaines from the actuall crime, though he loue not his brother: But he transgresseth the law of God, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth not the contrarie vertue, though he abstaine from the vice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden: for though a man abstaine from killing, yet if he doe not loue his brother, hee is guiltie of the breach of this sixt commandement; which serues to confute the error of our ignorant people, who because they abstaine from Murther, Adulterie, and other outward sinnes, doe perswade themselues that they keepe the law, and that God will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be mercifull vnto them. But they must know, that though they should abstaine from the vices forbidden, yet they stand culpable of Iudgement, for want of doing the contrarie vertues; for it is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to abstaine from euill, but we must doe good, and therefore <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> saith, <note n="a" place="margin">Math. 3. 10</note> 
                  <hi>Euery tree that bringeth not forth good fruite, is hewen downe, and cast into the fire:</hi> and the sentence of damnation shall bee denounced against the Reprobates, for their omission of doing good: <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 25. 42</note> 
                  <hi>I was an hungrie, and ye gaue me no meate &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, by this Rule of Reconciliation, it appeareth that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance<note place="margin">God reiects sacrifice without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> of any outward seruice vnto God, is displeasing vnto him, if it be separated from the loue of our brethren: Isay 1. 11, 12. <hi>What haue I to doe with the multitude of your sacrifices, saith the Lord:</hi> and so hee proceedeth, reiecting in particular, all the seruice of the Iewes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they liued in enuie, debate, and oppression; <hi>Their hands were full of blood,</hi> Isay, 58. 5, 6. The Lord doth there reprehend the Iewes fasting from meates, because they did not withall abstaine from strife, and oppression; adding withall, that <hi>refraining from crueltie, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing workes of mercie, is the fast which hee requires:</hi> which serues to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe the naturall conceit of men, who thinke that the whole worshippe of God, standeth in the duties of the first Table. This was indeede the conceit and practise of the Pharises, whereupon they <note n="c" place="margin">Math. 15. 5.</note> taught the people, <hi>that if they gaue oblations to the Church, though they releeued not their poore parents, yet God was well pleased with them.</hi> And the like is the practise of the Church of Rome, who in cases of transgression, through want of brotherly loue, doe not appoint this Reconciliation, but Auricular confession, and Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall satisfaction, as matters well pleasing vnto Almightie God: yea, such is the conceit of our common people, that if they be present at
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14013:56"/>
diuine seruice, if they heare the word preached, and receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14013:57"/>
by <hi>prison,</hi> they vnderstand purgatorie: and by <hi>the vttermost farthing,</hi> veniall sinnes: as if this were the meaning, Agree with God whiles thou art in this life betweene this and the day of Iudgement, least thou come before Christ, and he cause his Angels to cast thee into Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and there thou remaine till thou haue satisfied for thy least veniall sinnes. This exposition they stand vpon the more, because hereupon they would build their doctrine of Purgatorie.</p>
               <p>But this cannot be the true meaning of this place, for the reasons<note place="margin">The consat.</note> following: First, these words depend vpon the former, and are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the rule of Reconciliation betweene man and man, and not betweene God and man. Secondly, their exposition ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the mediation and satisfaction of Christ for man to God: for if (as they say) man may and must satisfie for his veniall sinnes, euen to the vttermost, then Christ did not make a perfect satisfaction for man to God: for if he did, why should man satisfie for himselfe? Thirdly, by this exposition they confound the Aduersarie and the Iudge (for the Father and the Sonne are one) which in the Text are made diuerse and distinct. Fourthly, they make a Redemption and deliuerie from hell, from whence indeede there is no redemption. And lastly, in making a parable of this place, they set their Purgatorie on a sandie foundation: for from the words of a parable can no sound collection be made, but onely from the maine scope thereof.</p>
               <p>Others there be, that vnderstand these two verses of the partie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, for (say they) Christ had shewed before the dutie of the partie offending, <hi>to seeke for reconciliation:</hi> now therefore he laieth downe the dutie of the partie offended and wronged, namely, that when the partie offending comes vnto him and desires reconciliation, he must agree and be reconciled with him quickly. This exposition, how soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it is plausible and sit in reason, yet it cannot well stand with the wordes of the Text, which threaten to the partie that agrees not with his aduersarie betimes, <hi>to be caried before the Iudge, and cast into prison, there to lie till he haue paied the vttermost farthing:</hi> but there is no reason why the partie offended and wronged, should thus be cast into prison, and therefore it can not be vnderstood of him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, others expound these words, to be a parable, borowed from the courts of the Iewes; and hard it is to say, whether they be the words of a parable or not.</p>
               <p>But to leaue all these, A fourth Exposition, which I take most fit and<note place="margin">The trae ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</note> proper to expresse the true meaning of the place, is this. The words co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14013:58"/>
no parable, but are litterally and properly to be vnderstood: for Christ had before exhorted the partie doing wrong, to seeke to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with his brother, by acknowledging of his offence, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king recompense, according to the iniurie offered. But because men are obstinate and stiffe necked, and will not yeeld and submit themselues to this dutie; therefore he further vrgeth the partie offending, to the speedie performance of this dutie, by the danger ensuing vpon the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect here of; saying, <hi>Agree with thine aduersarie, &amp;c.</hi>] that is, vse means to become friends with him, with whom thou art at variance, (for an <hi>aduersarie</hi> doth not here signifie an open enemie, but any one, with whom we are at difference, who hath an action against vs in any matter by reason of our iniurie done vnto him.) <hi>Quickly</hi>] that is, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, stand not vpon thy supposed right, but rather yeeld from thine owne right, then ouer-long to deferre to be reconciled. <hi>Whiles thou art in the way</hi>] that is, (as we may plainely see, Luk. 12. 5. 8.) while thou art going with thine Aduersarie to haue the matter tried before the Magistrate. <hi>Lest thine Aduersarie deliuer thee to the Iudge</hi>] That is, lest thine aduersarie, hauing a good action against thee, doe conuince and cast thee, before the Magistrate. <hi>And the Iudge deliuer thee to the Serieant, and thou be cast into prison.</hi>] That is, lest after thou art conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of wrong doing, the Iudge commaund the Serieant to cast thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prison. And because it might bee thought a small thing, to bee cast into prison, for that he might quickly come out againe; therefore our Sauiour Christ addeth in the last place, <hi>Verely, thou shalt not come out, till thou hast paied the vttermost farthing:</hi> this <hi>farthing,</hi> was the least coyne vsed among the Iewes, called a <hi>quadrin,</hi> which containeth two mytes, as we may see, <note n="a" place="margin">Mar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The speciall points to be obserued in the words, are two; a Precept, and a Reason thereof: The <hi>Precept</hi> in these words, <hi>Agree with thine aduersarie quickly, whiles thou art in the waie with him:</hi> that is, vse all good meanes to become friendes with whomsoeuer thou hast any waies offended, before the matter come to bee tried before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14013:58"/>
that will ensue deferring of agreement, <hi>lest thine Aduersarie deliuer thee to the Iudge, and the Iudge to the Serieant, &amp;c.</hi> The Precept is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsall of the Rule of Reconciliation giuen in the former verse, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreement with those whom wee haue offended: which point, Christ stands the more vpon, because of the stubbornnesse of mens hearts, that cannot abide to submit themselues, either in yeelding a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of their owne right, or in making satisfaction for wrong done to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Now this precept is further set out, by two circumstances; First, of the <hi>time,</hi> it must be done quickly, &amp; not deferred vpon any pretence or shewe of our owne right: Secondly, of the <hi>place,</hi> in the way, as wee goe to the Court.</p>
               <p>In this Precept, our Sauiour Christ giues vnto vs a notable Rule of<note place="margin">How to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue peace.</note> equanimitie, for the maintenance of peace and loue, with those with whom we are to deale in the priuate affaires of our speciall callings; namely, <hi>to deale moderately,</hi> if the matter concerne our selues, without all rigour or extremitie: vnlesse our place bee such, wherein our silence may impeach the glorie of God, or the good of his Church, Phil. 4. 5. <hi>Let your patient minde be knowne vnto all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the practise of this Rule, many duties are required: First, we must<note place="margin">Rules. 1.</note> construe all mens sayings and doings in the best part; herein they fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e false witnesse against our Sauiour Christ, by applying his speech to the <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 26. 60. 61.</note> 
                  <hi>materiall Temple in Ierusalem,</hi> which hee spake of the Temple of his bodie. This mistaking and misconstruing of mens say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and doings, is the cause of much debate continually. Secondly, we<note place="margin">2</note> must learne to beare with, and to winke at our brothers wants, Prou. 19. 11. <hi>It is the glorie of a man, to passe by an offence:</hi> if the same onely concerne vs, and be not derogatorie to Gods glory; as if he be froward, hastie, angrie, reproachfull, and so forth; we must in Christian patience passe by the same, as though wee tooke no notice of it, till by our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe we may doe him good. Thirdly, though direct iniurie bee done<note place="margin">3</note> vnto vs, yet if the same bee priuate, and doe not impeach the glorie of God, our life, or good name, we must be content to beare it; 1. Cor. 6. 7. <hi>Paul</hi> doth sharply rebuke the Corinthians, for going to law about trifles; <hi>Why rather</hi> (saith hee) <hi>suffer you not wrong? why sustaine you not harme?</hi> And this by Gods grace a man shall doe, if first he duely &amp; equally consider his owne deserts, both of like iniuries from men, and of eternall damnation from God himselfe, whom he continually offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Secondly, if he haue an eie to the prouidence of God, in that thing wherein he is wronged, which disposeth all things for the good of his children. Fourthly, for the maintenance of peace, wee must yeeld<note place="margin">4</note>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:14013:59"/>
of our owne right: so did <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 13. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> vnto <hi>Lot,</hi> though hee were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue him both in yeares and authoritie, bidding him <hi>choose where hee would dwell, whether on the right hand, or on the left:</hi> and our Sauiour Christ, though he were free, beeing of the Kings stocke, yet <hi>for the</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 17. 26</note> 
                  <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding of offence, paid tribute for himselfe, and Peter.</hi> And obseruing these things with good conscience, we shall by Gods grace maintaine Christian concord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ commanding speedie agreement, condemneth that<note place="margin">Wrangling forbidden.</note> wilfulnesse and stubbornnesse of men, whereby, rather then they will submit themselues, and yeeld a little of their right, they will carrie eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trifling matter before the Magistrate. This is a common fault among vs in these daies of peace, for euery tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lie is made a law matter, which ought not to be among Christians; it plainely argueth great want of loue, and small regard to this commandement of our Sauiour Christ. I speake not this, to condemne the lawful vse of the law, but to reprooue the bad practise of carnall men, who make lawing the meanes of their priuate reuenge, and sometime of flat iniustice against their brethren, whom they doe not affect.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ here also noteth out the hardnesse and crueltie of<note place="margin">Mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall crueltie.</note> mens hearts, who will neuer let a man goe, if once they get him in the lurch: such cruell wretches are they that take the forfeitures of leases, bonds, and obligations: and such, for the most part, are our common v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers: but all these must know, that they are void of loue, and grace, whereby they should maintaine this concorde, which Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by this circumstance of time, <hi>(Agree quickly)</hi> Christ<note place="margin">Heart bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in suits vnlawfull.</note> would teach vs to keepe our hearts cleare from grudging and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning, euen then, when wee haue occasion of suite or controuersie with others; for this rancor of heart, will cause further debate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, like to an angrie humour in the veines, which sets the whole body in burning fits.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, if wee must vse speed in seeking agreement with men whom<note place="margin">Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God must be sought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</note> wee haue offended, before we come to the trial of a mortall Iudge; then much more must we giue all diligence to be reconciled vnto God, for our daiely sinnes, whereby we offend him; and that with all speed, euen in this life, before we come to his tribunall seate: for howsoeuer in the courts of men, wee may goe vpon sureties; yet at the barre of Gods Iudgement, none can answer for vs. If we be not before hand reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God in Christ, this vndoubtedly will be the issue; wee shall bee cast into vtter darkenesse, and there remaine till we haue fully satisfied
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14013:59"/>
the Iustice of God, which will neuer be. Let all estates &amp; degrees think on this, and especially the yonger sort, who deceiue themselues by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring repentance, when as indeed, they as wel as others, are euery day going forward to the barre of Gods iudgement.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, as in seeking Reconciliation, so in doing euery good worke<note place="margin">Vse speed in well-doing.</note> that concernes Gods glorie in the good of others, we must vse all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient speed; <note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>while we haue time wee must doe what good we can vnto all,</hi> for death and the last iudgement come suddainly: <hi>Say not to thy neighbour</hi> (saith <note n="f" place="margin">Pro. 3. 28.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Thus much of the Precept: The Reason followeth, <hi>Least thine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie deliuer thee to the Iudge, &amp;c.</hi>] which is thus much in effect, If thou shew extremitie, thou shalt finde extremitie shewed vnto thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, euen by the Magistrate. They that deale stifly and rigorously, shall bee rewarded in their kinde: God in his iust iudgement will haue men measured vnto, as they measure vnto others, Matth. 7. 2. 6. Mark. 4. 24.</p>
               <p>Here then we are taught to deale in equitie and moderation with all men, in the priuate affaires of our callings, euen as we would haue them to deale with vs; and then God will cause others to deale well with vs: but if we deale ill with others, God will reward vs in the same kinde. This point all Vsurers, Ingrossers, Trades-men, &amp;c. should well obserue, who thinke they may doe with their owne, what they wil; but we must knowe, wee are but Stewards, and our account will bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here wee see, Christ alloweth of the Magistrate, and his<note place="margin">Magistracie approoued.</note> Iudgement seate: 2. Of his proceeding against the guiltie, in deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to the Officer: 3. Of the office of the Sergeant: 4. Of casting guiltic persons into prison: 5. Of suing at the law, when right cannot be gotten by any other lawfull meanes; but law must not bee the first course we take, in seeking our right, we must rather suffer some wrong, &amp; seeke to end the matter by friends: &amp; vse law, as Physitions vse poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, when gentle physicke will not serue the turne; then in case of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, they doe minister stronger physicke; yea, sometime poison it selfe: so when we cannot otherwise procure our peace and right, then we may lawfully take the benefit of the law.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>Here our Sauiour Christ goeth about to restore the seauenth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, touching <hi>Adulterie,</hi> to his true sense and meaning, and so to his proper and right vse, by purging it from the false and erroneous interpretation of the Iewes; for which ende, he first laies down the false interpretation of the Scribes and Pharises, verse 27. and then adioyneth the true sense thereof, verse 28. especially; yet so, as he continueth the same in the verses following.</p>
               <p>For the first; before the interpretation of the Iewes Teachers, hee prefixeth this Preface: <hi>Yee haue heard that it hath bin said of olde time;</hi> or, <hi>of the ancient Teachers,</hi> the meaning and vse whereof, wee haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shewed, verse 21. Then after follow the wordes of the seauenth commandement, <hi>Thou shalt not commit Adulterie;</hi> which are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per words of the H. Ghost; yet here must not they be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that sense, which the Scribes and Pharises gaue vnto them: for the better concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing whereof, this one thing especially must be opened; namely, what is Adulterie here forbidden. <hi>Adulterie</hi> properly, is the breach of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke<note place="margin">Adulterie.</note> by such parties, some one whereof, at the least, is either maried, or espoused: I call it <hi>the breach of wedlocke,</hi> to note the propertie of this sinne, which is not in any other sinne, vnlesse it be of this kinde, though the sinne bee farre more grieuous. Idolatrie is a more hainous sinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> then Adulterie, beeing a breach both of the first and second commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, of the first Table; and yet it comes short of Adulterie, in this qualitie of breaking wedlocke: for wedlocke may bee kept of those which are Idolaters. Secondly, I say, <hi>betweene any parties, if one bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried;</hi> meaning the husband as well as the wife, to confute the opinion of some Iewes, and by some lawes also maintained, that the man hath a priuiledge aboue the woman, so as hee breaketh not wedlocke, when he goeth in to another woman, besides his wife; which is false: for though he haue a prerogatiue ouer his wife, in beeing her head; yet hee hath no priuiledge to free him from matrimoniall fidelitie, but is as much bound to keepe himselfe vnto his wife, as she is to keepe her selfe to him. The preheminence of superioritie cannot free the husband fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bond of mariage, the husband is bound to the wife, as much as the wife is to the husband; and shee hath power ouer his bodie, as much as he hath ouer hers, 1. Cor. 7. 4. Thirdly, I say, <hi>or espoused,</hi> because A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie is not onely committed by such parties, whereof one or both, be fully maried; but also by them, whereof one is single, and the other contracted onely; and therefore is the same <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 22. 22, 23, 24.</note> punishment alotted to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14013:60"/>
both: for contract in right is mariage. Thus wee see the sinne here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly forbidden, according to the letter of the Law. Now, though the Lord vnder this one includes all the sinnes of the same kind, as we shall anone perceiue; yet the Pharises tooke this litterall signification, for the whole meaning, and taught that the sinne here forbidden, was bodily adulterie onely; and so made the adulterie of the heart to be no adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; which exposition Christ here confutes.</p>
               <p>First, here obserue the fraud and cunning of these Pharises; they<note place="margin">The vse. Fraud in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scripture.</note> would seeme faithfull interpreters of the Law, in that they keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so close to the words, that they will not passe one iot beyond the litterall sense: but yet in the meane time they omit the full meaning and true vse of this Law. The like hath beene the practise of heretiks in all ages; as the Arrians, who denied that Christ was God, stucke fast to these words of Scripture, <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 14. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>the father is greater then I,</hi> and to such like. And the Papists to vphold their breaden God, by transubstantiation, will needes keepe tke litterall sense of these words of Christ, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> whereby they ouerturne the nature of that sacrament. And the<note place="margin">Rhem. Mat. 26. sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, here obserue how grieuous a sinne Adulterie is, in that<note place="margin">Adulterie a grieuous sin.</note> Christ by name doth expresly forbid it, among all the sinnes of this kind; yea, the very Pharises doe euery where condemne it: for though they would easily dispense with <note n="c" place="margin">Math. 15. 4, 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>disobedience to Parents;</hi> yet the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taken in Adulterie must be put to death, Iohn 8. 4, 5. The greatnes of this sinne might be shewed by many arguments; for if he be <note n="d" place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 8.</note>

But this sinne is little regarded, and made a small matter with many, who can bee content to come with Christian eares into the assemblies, and yet will bring with them idle and curious, yea adulterous eies: but such persons, which so abuse their sight, to the dishonour of God, must know, that they are adulterers before God: &amp; howsoeuer they may perswade themselues, that grace enters into their hearts by hearing, yet vndoubtedly by their idle and curious eies, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than enters into their soule, and keepes out Gods word, whereby the soule should be renued.

This ought to bee regarded; for light and forraine attire is a secret profession of an vnchaste heart. Fourthly, mixt dauncing of men and women, in<note place="margin">4</note> time and measure, for therein is more occasion and prouocation vnto lust, then by the bare beholding of each other with the eie.

                  <hi>Euill conuersings, corrupt good manners:</hi> which may well include that vnseemely conuersing of men with women, not warranted either by the generall, or particular calling. Sixtly, the<note place="margin">6</note> pampering of the bodie with daintie meates, or strong drinkes; this was the sinne <note n="i" place="margin">Ezek. 16. 49.</note> of Sodome: and it is much more an occasion of lust, then the bare sight of the eie. Seauenthly, Idlenesse and lazinesse, in not<note place="margin">7</note> imploying the bodie in some honest calling, for thereby also is lust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the meaning of this commandement, forbidding all occasions to adulterie, vnder a lustfull eie.</p>
               <p>Now considering that a man is guiltie of adulterie, that vseth the occasions thereof; hereby we may see, that we cannot excuse our selues from the breach of this law: for though we be cleane from the bodily outward facte, yet who can say, <hi>My heart is cleane?</hi> who is free from the occasions thereof? as from a wanton eie, vaine apparell, wanton speech, intemperance, and the rest; all which makes vs culpable of this sinne: and therefore wee must laie our hands vpon our mouthes, and condemne our selues of guilt before God; we must humble our selues, acknowledging our sinnes, and breaches of this commandement: and lastly, we must take heede of all occasions, that may mooue or incite vs vnto lust or wantonnesse.</p>
               <p>The second point which our Sauiour Christ propoundeth, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of this law, is this; that the lust of the heart, though it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come into acte, is Adulterie: now that we may know what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ meaneth by <hi>lust,</hi> sundrie points are to be handled: First, how lust can bee a sinne, considering it is onely a hidden desire of the heart: Secondly, how <hi>lust</hi> can bee a sinne of the seauenth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, seeing it is forbidden in the tenth: and thirdly, how great a sinne lust is.</p>
               <p>For the first, that lust is a sinne, is thus prooued: Gods Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth<note place="margin">Lust is a sin.</note> obedience of the whole man, both in soule and bodie, and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery part, facultie, and power thereof; <hi>Thou</hi>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14013:62"/>
that obedience which commeth not from the whole man, is sinnefull. Now when a man conceiueth vnchast thoughts in his heart, then his soule, and mind, &amp; his affections, haue not done their dutie vnto God; and so he sinneth in lusting.</p>
               <p>Yet this doctrine was neuer receiued of all, but some haue still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted against it, and their principall reasons are two: 1. They say, lust<note place="margin">Pelag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> is a naturall inclination, desire, and appetite, which was in <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, and so cannot be a sinne? <hi>Ans.</hi> Lust or appetite in the heart, is not simply a sinne; for so it is a naturall desire, which was in our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in their integritie: but to lust after that which God forbiddeth, that is the sinne; as for a man to lust after a woman, or a woman after a man, not beeing man and wife, which we see here Christ condemneth. 2. They say, God blesseth adulterers and fornicators in their lust, with the issue of seed in child-bearing, as well as man and wife, in lawful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and therefore it cannot be a sinne? <hi>Ans.</hi> In adulterie two things may be considered; the vnlawfull lust of the heart, and the acte of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: now when God giues issue to adulterers and fornicators, it is no approbation of their sinnefull lust, but onely a common blessing of naturall generation, which is his owne ordinance by creation: for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer God approoues not of our sinne, yet he preserues nature in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workes. And thus we see that lust is a sinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> How can lust be a sinne of the seauenth commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, seeing it is directly forbidden in the tenth, for in this briefe decalogue there is no needlesse repetition of any thing? <hi>Ans.</hi> Lust is two-folde, either without consent of will, as when vnchaste desires come into the minde and heart, and are not entertained of the will, but bee speedily checked so soone as they arise; and such lust is forbidden in the tenth commandement: or with consent of will, when a man is willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine and cherish the vnchast thoughts that come into his minde; though he neuer put them into practise, and these are forbidden in the seauenth commandement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. Point.</hi> The greatnesse of this sinne of lust: This is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed<note place="margin">Lust of the heart a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous sinne.</note> by Christ, calling it Adulterie before God; as if he should say, Looke how great a sinne bodily adulterie is before men, who punish the same with death; euen so great and hainous a sinne before God, is the inward vnchast lusting of the heart, whereto a man giues consent of will, though he neuer bring it into action; for this he stands culpable of adulterie before God, and shall therefore be condemned, vnlesse hee repent.</p>
               <p>The vse of this <hi>Third Point is manifold:</hi> First, hereby we may learne
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14013:63"/>
how to examine our selues by this seauenth commandement; for our Sauiour Christ here teacheth vs, that they which willingly retaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaste<note place="margin">How to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the heart by the 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> desires with delight, though they neuer giue their bodies to the outward acte, are Adulterers before God: and therefore when wee would examine our selues by this commandement, wee must search our hearts, whether we haue willingly retained therein any lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thoughts; and if we haue, wee must know that we are guiltie of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie before God. And because none of vs are free from this sinne, it must humble and cast vs down before God, as breakers of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the lust of the heart be Adulterie before God, then wee must with care and diligence learne the Apostle <hi>Pauls</hi> lesson, 2. Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians 7. 1. <hi>To purge our selues from all vncleannesse both of flesh and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Motiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst lust.</note> 
                  <hi>spirit:</hi> that is, wee must labour to keepe our hearts and mindes pure and chaste, as well as our bodies. And to induce vs herevnto, consider the Reasons following: First, we all desire to see God, and to know his<note place="margin">1</note> loue in Christ, for our comfort in this life, and saluation for euer: but without <hi>holinesse and puritie</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 12. 14</note> 
                  <hi>of heart, wee can neuer see God,</hi> nor knowe the comfort of his loue: for when a man defiles his minde, with vnchaste thoughts, hee depriues himselfe of the taste of Gods fauour, and of the experience of his loue. Secondly, consider the state and<note place="margin">2</note> condition of mans heart, by effectuall calling; it is the dwelling place and Temple of the holy Ghost, (for when a man is in Christ, hee liueth in Christ by faith, and Christ in him by his spirit:) now then looke, as men vse to trimme vp their dwelling houses, for the receiuing of some noble guest, so ought wee to keepe our hearts pure and cleane from vnchaste lustes, that they may bee fit habitations for the blessed spirit of God; but by vnchaste lustes, we make the heart a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the deuil, and a cage of all vncleane spirits. Thirdly, if wee suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer<note place="margin">3</note> our hearts nowe to burne with fleshly lust, we make an entrance in them, for the burning of hell fire for euer: for these two alwaies goe together, burning lust, and hell fire, (vnlesse repentance come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene.)<note place="margin">

                  </note> And therefore, if wee would escape hell fire, wee must quench the fire of lust, and cleanse our hearts from this vncleannesse. Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> by profession we seeme to be the members of Christ; and if we would be so indeed, then we must take heed of vnchaste lusts, for thereby wee pull our hearts from Christ, and knit them to an harlot.

               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:14013:63"/>First, the minde must be filled with godly meditations, and the word of God must dwell in our hearts plenteously: for vnchast lusts<note place="margin">1</note>

Thirdly, we must vse sobrietie in meat,<note place="margin">3</note> drinke, and apparell: for vngodly lusts are kindled, fedde, and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with too much pampering of the bodie: Sodome and Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, Admah and Zeboim sinned most grieuously in this kinde through fulnesse of bread; and therefore we must vse a moderation in these things, that grace may be strengthened, and all euill lusts weakened in vs. Fourthly, we must alwaies be doing some good thing, either in<note place="margin">4</note> our generall calling of a Christian, or in our particular calling: yea, in our lawfull recreation we must intend and practise good: for when men are idle, Satan fills their hearts with euill thoughts, and so defiles the same. Fiftly, men and women must not priuately conuerse toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">5</note> without warrant so to doe, either from their generall, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar calling, so as with good conscience they can say, the Lord doth call them so to conuerse: for the mutuall conuersing of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is the cause of many noysome lusts: and therefore neither men nor women without good warrant, should thrust themselues into such occasion of temptations. Remember what the Apostle saith, <note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Euill conuersings, corrupt good manners.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> felt tho smart of this boldnes, though in an other case: for comming to warme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in Caiphas hall, without good warrant so to doe, when a silly maide demanded of him, whether he was not one of Christs companie, he denied him flatly, and that with cursing: and so many men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men conuersing without warrant where they should not, doe fall into many noysome sinnes; and when they thinke themselues most strong, then with <hi>Peter,</hi> haue they the greatest falls.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14013:65"/>
for whereas other creatures haue but foure muscles in their eies, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their eies are turned round about, man onely aboue them all hath a<note place="margin">Columb. l. 5. cap. 9.</note> fift muscle, whereby his eie is turned vpward towards heanen. And this which is said, for the well ordering of our eies, must bee obserued in the rest of the senses, and in all other partes of the bodie; they must all be imployed and set a worke in obedience to God, and continually obserued, that they become not the weapons of sinne, but the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his glorie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this Exhortation of Christ, must teach vs to auoyde all the<note place="margin">Auoid all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of sin</note> occasions of euery sinne, though it bee with great losse vnto our selues, in the things of this life. This is the chiefe point that our Sauiour Christ aimeth at in this place, and therfore it ought with speciall regard to be learned, and remembred. Mans nature is like vnto drie wood, or towe, which will burne so soone as fire is put vnto it; giue a man the least occasion of any sinne, and hee is as readie to commit it, as drie wood is to burne, though thereby hee doe as much as in him lieth, to cast away his owne soule for euer. Looke therefore, as Mariners on the Seas, haue constant and continuall care to auoyd both rocks and sands, whereby they may suffer shipwracke; so must wee most warily auoyde the occasions of euery sinne. A most worthie example hereof we haue in <hi>Moses,</hi> who was brought vp in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, till hee was fourtie yeares old, where he enioyed all earthly pleasures and honours that his heart could wish; and so might haue continued if he would, for hee was the adopted sonne of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter: but yet <hi>Moses</hi> left them all, and <note n="g" place="margin">

This is a great occasion of impietie among vs; if neighbour would admonish neighbour, and one brother an other, sinne would not be so rife as it is. But this dutie is not onely neglected of priuate men one to another, but of publike persons, who are more bound vnto it. The Magistrate is negligent in punishing, and the Minister in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing sinne: and the master of the family carelesse in reforming those that are vnder him, which causeth sinne to abound.</p>
               <p>The fift occasion giuen, is <hi>euill Example in the practise of any sinne</hi>

The truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of appeares among vs: for let any one man or woman take vp a new fashion in attire, and presently the same is generally receiued: let a man inuent or sing a leud song, and presently it is learned of all, euen of little children that can scarse speake: whence also comes it, that crawling infants should sweare roundly, and frame themselues to all impietie, when they cannot speake readily, but from the bad example of their Elders, with whome they are brought vp? Now among all men, their bad example is most dangerous, who make the greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Religion. They are like false lights vpon the shoare, which lead the shippesvpon the sands. And therefore such as shew any care or forwardnes in holy practises of religion, must haue speciall watch ouer all their waies, that (if it be possible) they may be blamelesse both in word and deede: for all men haue an eye at them, and the wicked would gladly spie holes in their coate.</p>
               <p>The last occasion giuen is, <hi>the priuate slandering of Gods Ministers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6</note> 
                  <hi>and the disgracing of their Ministerie:</hi> this is an offence as generall as<note place="margin">Slandering Gods mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> the rest, and it causeth many to contemne the meanes of their saluation. When men meete together, their common talke is of the Ministers, and of their doctrine, not to be edified by mutuall conference, but onely to disgrace their persons, and to make their ministerie contemptible; but they little know what mischiefe this causeth, and therefore it ought to be auoided.</p>

                  <hi>the roote of all euill.</hi> This drawes mans heart so much to the world, that he can spare no time for the meanes of his saluation; herewith he is so choked, that he neuer thinketh of repentance, till the last gaspe. Such an other occasion of sinne, is <hi>pride of heart,</hi> whereby many giue themselues so much to the garnishing of their bodies, that they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their soules altogether. The like is <hi>selfe-loue,</hi> whereby men ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening their gifts, thinke not themselues honoured according to their desert, and so through discontent giue themselues to plotte and practise much mischiefe, for the aduancing of their estate. Of this sort are the Romish Priests and Iesuits, as their manifold dangerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts against our Church and State doe euidently declare. And thus we might runne through all the affections of mans heart, shewing that the corrupt motions thereof are the cause of much sinne vnto him, and a most dangerous meanes for the ruine of his soule.</p>
               <p>In regard whereof here also we must snew, how <hi>this eye may be pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi>

graue, as the Apostle shewes at large, Rom. 6. 3, 4. &amp;c. Now when this perswasion shall take place in our hearts, it will by Gods grace keepe vs from yeilding to corrupt motions and desires, and mooue vs to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to subdue them daily: for herein stands our assurance that wee haue fellowship with Christ, when we haue fellowship in his death. And therefore as we see malefactours to cease from stealth and robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie when they are once hanged; so we beeing crucified with Christ in respect of the old man, must not suffer the same to rule in our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to haue force in our members: knowing (as the Apostle <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 6. 6.</note> saith) <hi>that our old man is crucified with Christ, that the bodie of sinne might be destroied, that henceforth we should not serue sinne:</hi> and, <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The second kind of occasions of sinne which a man giueth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,<note place="margin">Offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising from mans mind.</note> arise from his <hi>minde and imagination:</hi> And they are many, I will onely note three.

               <p>The way to cut it off is this; the vaine man that is puffed vp with<note place="margin">Remedie.</note> this conceit, must <hi>examine himselfe touching his knowledge, whether it</hi>

                  <hi>be sufficient to his saluation.</hi> And for this ende he must make inquirie in himselfe for these two things; <hi>first,</hi> whether he see his owne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall<note place="margin">1</note> blindnes, and whether he be mooued thereby to labour for the knowledge of God and of his will; where this is wanting, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a vaine conceit of knowledge: <hi>Secondly,</hi> whether his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<note place="margin">2</note> be ioyned with conuersion of heart from sinne vnto God, and with reformation of life from euill to good. This change of heart and life goeth with all sauing knowledge. Now if these be wanting (as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly they are in all vaine persons) then is their knowledge so farre from beeing sauing knowledge, profitable to saluation, that it rather turneth to their deeper condemnation.</p>

First, from the Scripture: secondly, from the doctrine of the Church drawne out of Scripture: thirdly, from the state of the Church: and fourthly, from the state of the wicked. For the first: though the word of God be most perfect euery way, both for matter and style, yet hence doe many take offence, and that two waies prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally; partly from the plainnesse and simplicitie of the Scripture, and<note place="margin">1. From the plainnes of it.</note> partly from the contents thereof. For the first, it is most true, that the Scripture style and phrase in many things, is plaine and familiar euen to the capacitie of the simple; yet this is no disgrace to Scripture, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an honour, which more setteth out the Maiestie of Gods word. And yet hereby many take occasion to contemne it, esteeming the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Scripture too base and shallow, and the knowledge thereof, too plaine and familiar for their fine wits; whereupon some giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to other studies and courses, which might glorifie God in this calling. Others also, though they addict themselues vnto Diuinitie, yet they more imploy themselues in the writings of men, for their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate studies, then in the word of God; and in their publique Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, they more affect the ostentation of humane wit, eloquence, and learning, in multiplicitie of reading, and set words and phrases, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers languages, then that plaine euidence of the spirit, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <note n="a" place="margin">1.

                  <hi>Paul</hi> so much commends. This also is a great fault in many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, that they are more delighted with the vaine conceits of men in preaching, then with the pure and plaine word of God, counting base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that Sermon, wherein the Prophets and the Apostles are onely quoted, but highly aduancing that Sermon for deepe learning which is stuffed out with Fathers, Schoolemen, Poets, and such like.</p>
               <p>To cut off this offence: First, the will of God must be considered, for

                  <hi>Bible;</hi> as when they read of the Miracles wrought by the Prophets, by Christ and his Apostles; they say, the like may be done by Magicke, and so blasphemously doe father vpon the Scripture that most wicked practise of sorcerie; like to the malicious Iewes, who said of Christ, that he cast <hi>out deuills by the power of Beelzebub,</hi> Luk. 11. 15. Others denie the Historie of <hi>Moses</hi> to be true, by reason of <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, which (they say) as it is described for quantitie could not containe a couple of euery kind of creatures, with prouision and fodder for them, for a whole years space: of this opinion was <hi>Appelles</hi> an auncient heretike in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church: and many vpon these occasions haue become Atheists, denying the truth of Gods word to their damnation. To these I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; first, for the Miracles, that no creature, men, or Angels, is able to doe such works, as are recorded in Scripture, to be done by the power of God: Ioh. 9. <hi>Christ opened the eyes of one that was borne blind.</hi> The
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:14013:69"/>
deuill by his skill, and man by Arte can doe much in curing blindnes, caused by wounds and diseases, but no power of nature, nor of magick, no not all the power of all Angels, is sufficient to procure sight to one that was borne blind; that must be done by a power creating, which is in no creature. Againe, as Histories record, the deuill is able to enter into a dead bodie, and cause it to mooue, and can speake in it; but to raise vp one to life that had beene dead foure daies, as <note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Christ did La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> is a worke that all the deuills in hell, nay all the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, are not able to doe. And for <hi>Appelles</hi> the heretike, who tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion from Noahs Arke to condemne the bookes of Moses: the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer<note place="margin">Origen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hom. 2. on Gen. de sab. ica arcae.</note> made to him in the Primitiue Church may serue the turne; to wit, that it was in quantitie sufficient to containe couples of all kindes of creatures, and prouision for them for a whole yeares space: for to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the height and breadth of it; it was <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 6. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>three hundred cubits long,</hi> and euery cubit (according to the auncient measure) contained nine foote, which in all came to the length of halfe a mile and more. Againe, others say, that though euery cubit had beene but one foote and an halfe long (as our cubits are) yet hauing <note n="o" place="margin">v. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>three lofts,</hi> it was of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent bignesse to containe all kinds of creatures by couples, and prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them for a yeares space. But yet put the case that we could not tell, how an Arke should be made great enough, to containe couples of all kinds of creatures, and prouision for them; should we thereupon take occasion to condemne the bookes of God that record the same, and the thing it selfe? God forbidde: nay rather, we must hereby learne to acknowledge and confesse our owne blindnesse, and the shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low reach of our vnderstanding, and so admire the wonderfull worke of God.</p>
               <p>The way to cut off this occasion of offence, taken from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Remedie. 1. Rule.</note> is, first to obserue, <hi>that (howsoeuer nothing is more repugnant to our nature then the word of God) yet the same word of God hath more preuailed with many mens hearts, to winne the same vnto it, then any thing in the world besides could euer doe.</hi> Humane writings are farre more plausible to naturall men, then the holy Scriptures of God: for the wisdome of God in Scripture is esteemed <hi>foolishnesse</hi> to mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reason; and yet who did euer cleaue so fast to the writings of men, as Gods children haue done to the word of God, for the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie whereof they haue beene and are content, to liue and die? This thing argueth plainely, that there is in Scripture a diuine power, for if it had beene from man, and against his nature as it is, man would haue contemned it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:14013:70"/>Secondly, this must be considered, that the penmen <hi>of holy Scriptures, both the Prophets and Apostles, haue recorded their owne faults in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rule 2.</note> 
                  <hi>of it,</hi> which plainely argueth that they were penned by holy men of God, according to the direction of the holy Ghost, and are not the inuentions of politique heads to keepe men in awe: for then the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and penmen thereof, would rather haue concealed their owne faults, then haue published the same in their owne workes to their discredit. Lastly, consider the subiect and matter of the whole Bible:<note place="margin">Rule 3.</note> to wit, <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who therein hath professed himselfe to be the Sonne of God: now if Christ had not beene very God, and yet should haue taken that honour vnto him, then the like iudgements would haue befallen him that befell others for the like offence: for none euer tooke that honour vnto them, who were not grieuously punished. As was <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 3. 17. 23.</note> Adam in Paradise, for seeking to be like vnto God: and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, for receiuing and applying to himselfe, the blasphemous praise of the people, crying, <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 12. 22, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>The voice of God, and not of man:</hi> but howsoeuer most fearefull iudgements befell Gods enemies, that thus sought to robbe him of his honour; yet Christs ende was glorious and blessed: which may mooue vs to thinke highly of Scripture, as of the word of God.</p>
               <p>The Second head from whence offences are taken, is <hi>the doctrine of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Head of offences ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church.</note> 
                  <hi>the Church, grounded on the word of God.</hi> The offences hence taken are manifold: first, from a supposed newnesse of our doctrine: this is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Papists, and especially of our owne Recusants: for they say our doctrine is but of fourescore yeares continuance, since the daies of<note place="margin">1 From suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed newnes.</note> 
                  <hi>Martin Luther:</hi> auouching also that for the space of fourteene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares, we cannot bring record of any Church that held and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the doctrine, which we now teach and hold.</p>
               <p>Now for the auoiding of this offence, two points must be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred:<note place="margin">Remedie.</note> I. that the doctrine of our Church for the substance thereof, is the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, Act. 2. 42. the doctrine taught by the Apostles concerning Christ, is made the foundation of the Church, and looke where this doctrine is rightly helde and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, there it is an infallible note of a true Church. Againe, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to iustifie their doctrine, had recourse to Moses and the Prophets, as we may see in the Acts of the Apostles in sundrie <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 26. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> places: now the doctrine touching Christ held and receiued in our Churches, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the testimonies of the Prophets and Apostles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for substance and doctrine is theirs. Secondly, we must knowe,<note place="margin">2</note> that for the ground and foundation of Religion, our Churches agree
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14013:70"/>
with the Churches after Christ, which continued for the space of sixe hundred yeares: for wee doe not onely allow of the Apostles Creede, but of the foure generall Councells, and of their Confessions and Creedes, and that in the same manner and sense which they did; so as the religion of our Church is vniustly slaundered to be new.</p>
               <p>The second offence taken from the doctrine of our Church, is from<note place="margin">II. From supposed strictnes.</note> the supposed strictnesse and rigour thereof: we teach indeede, that a Christian man must wholly denie himselfe, his owne will and desires, and resigne himselfe wholly vnto Christ, to be guided by his spirit, according to the direction of his word. Now hence some would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that our doctrine permits not a man to laugh, or be merrie, or to doe any thing for his owne delight; and hereupon they grow to contempt of Religion, counting the profession and practise thereof precisenesse; and therefore will not be bound vnto it, but liue as they list: and this is common among vs.</p>
               <p>The way to cut off this occasion of offence, is twofold: 1. we<note place="margin">Remedie.</note> must know, that by the doctrine of our Church, <hi>it is lawfull for a man</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Rule.</note> 
                  <hi>to be merrie, so it be in the Lord:</hi> Philip. 4. 4. <hi>Reioyce in the Lord alway</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>againe I say reioyce:</hi> Psal. 104. 15. <hi>God causeth wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oyle to make his face to shine, and bread to strengthen his heart.</hi> Againe, God doth put most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous colours, and delightsome smells into the flowers of the field, no doubt for this ende that man might take his delight therein: yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the skill of musicke, God hath giuen to many a man, a voice more sweete and pleasant then is the sound of any musicall instrument, which were to no ende, if a man might not therewith cheere vp his heart in a moderate delight: nay, laughter it selfe is the gift of nature, which was in Adam before his fall, and therefore is lawfull. But yet I say, <hi>mans reioycing must be in the Lord,</hi> to cut off many abuses of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: for first, there be many that cannot be merrie, but in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of some sinne; if there be a thought of God or of his word, all their mirth is quasht. But we must endeauour our selues so to reioyce, that God may approoue thereof. Againe, I say, <hi>in the Lord;</hi> because sinne will soonest preuaile with a man, when he giues himselfe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleasures.

We are desired <hi>by the mercies of God, to giue vp our selues, both soules and bodies vnto God:</hi> whereby we may see, that we haue iust cause to bewaile the case and condition of all such, as count religion precisenes: for they are like vnto <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphyra,</hi> who brought part of the sale of their possession vnto the Apostles, and said it was all: so these men looke to be saued by Christ, they heare his word, and receiue his Sacraments, and therin make as high a profession as any can doe; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they will giue themselues wholly to Christ: but when they are out of the assemblies, they shew themselues to haue dissembled with God: for they practise no such thing as they made shew of: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may iustly feare, least that befall them in their soules, which befell <note n="f" place="margin">Act. 5. 5. 10.</note>

               <p>The way to cut off this occasion of offence is this, we must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">Remedie.</note> that <hi>the crosse endured for the Gospel sake, especially if we profit by it, is an infallible marke of a child of God.</hi> Heb. 12. 17. <hi>If ye endure chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, God offereth himselfe vnto you, as vnto sonnes: for what sonne is it, whome the father chasteneth not?</hi> In reason we finde this to be true: for say that two children be fighting in the streete, and there comes a man who taketh one of them and beateth him, but the other he lets alone: will not all men say, that the man is father to the child whome he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth? euen so the Lord for our nurtering, will send crosses vpon vs, when we imbrace his Gospel: now if we shall profit by his corrections, and learne thereby to humble our selues vnder his mightie hand, then we begin to receiue assurance of his fatherly dealing towards vs his sonnes and daughters: and therefore we must be so farre from beeing hindred in the course of our holy profession by reproches and crosses, that they must be meanes to incourage vs therein. Iam. 1. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>As from the doctrine of the Church in generall, so from the parts<note place="margin">Offences ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from particular doctrines. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination.</note> thereof, doe many both learned and ignorant take occasion of offence; as first, <hi>from the doctrine of Gods predestination,</hi> whereby we teach that God hath decreed the condemnation of some. This doctrine
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14013:71"/>
many doe renounce, as a doctrine of crueltie, and thereupon frame vnto themselues priuate opinions, which will not stand with the word of God.</p>
               <p>The way to auoyde this occasion of offence, is this; First, to graunt<note place="margin">Remedie. 1 Rule.</note> vnto God himselfe so much in this case, as we will yeeld to mortal man in the like. Among our selues we allow of this libertie one to another, that a man may kill a flie, or a worme; and for his lawfull vse and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, kill sheepe, oxen, and other creatures, and yet be a mercifull man: shall we not then allow vnto God, that he may glorifie his name, in the iust and deserued condemnation and destruction of his creature? This is lesse then we grant to men, for a worme is something vnto man; but a man is nothing in respect of God. Againe, among our selues, in some things we giue libertie one to another to doe as we will, and yet thinke the action iust and lawfull; much more then ought we to giue freedom of will vnto God in all his actions, without conceit of crueltie in any one of his workes; for <hi>all his workes are done in equitie.</hi> Secondly, it must<note place="margin">2. Rule.</note> be remembred, that we teach not, that God doth simply ordaine some men to hell fire: but touching reprobation, our doctrine is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God hath decreed and purposed to glorifie his name, in the due and<note place="margin">Doctrine of Reprobation</note> deserued condemnation of some: for in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> reprobation? God hath two actions: First, he decrees to passe by some men, without shewing his eternall mercie vnto them, and onely to declare his iustice vpon them; then after hee decrees, when they are by themselues fallen into sinne, to inflict vpon them deserued condemnation for the same.</p>
               <p>The vnlearned also, from this doctrine of Predestination, take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of most fearefull falling; for thus they reason: If I be predestinate to saluation, I am sure to be saued, let me doe what I will; and if I bee predestinated to condemnation, I am sure to be condemned, though I liue neuer so godly; for Gods decree changeth not, and therefore I will liue as I list. Thus doe desperate persons imbolden themselues to sinne, and to cast away their soules.</p>
               <p>The way to cut off this offence is this; they must remember, that <hi>in</hi>

                  <hi>Gods decree, the ende, and the meanes that bring men to that ende, goe alwaies together:</hi> and therefore, that such as are ordained to saluation, are ordained to the means thereof; namely to vocation, iustification, &amp; sanctification, Rom. 8. 30. The end and the means in Gods decree must neuer be seuered: Now righteousnes and holines in Christ, is the means whereby God hath decreed to bring men to saluation: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they sinne grieuously, that vpon the immutabilitie of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, take occasion to liue profanely. <note n="a" place="margin">Isay 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The second speciall doctrine of the Church, whereat some take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion<note place="margin">2. Of the fal of Adam.</note> of offence, is <hi>concerning the fall of Adam:</hi> for we teach, that God in some sort decreed his fall: whereupon some obiect, that we make God the author of sinne, considering his decree is vnchangeable. Now to preuent this offence, two Rules must be remembred: I. that Gods<note place="margin">Remedie. I. Rule.</note> will may be distinguished. It is either <hi>generall,</hi> or <hi>speciall.</hi> Gods <hi>generall will</hi> is that, whereby he willeth that sinne shall be, by his iust permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But <hi>Gods speciall</hi> will, is the approouing will of God, whereby he taking pleasure in any thing, will haue the same done and brought to passe. Now we say not, that God willed Adams fall by his approouing will, but onely by his permitting will; because it was good in regard of God, that man should fall. II. We must remember, that Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree<note place="margin">II. Rule.</note> went before Adams fall, onely as an antecedent, not as a cause thereof: for the vnchaungeable decree and will of God takes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the libertie of mans will, or of the second causes, but onely inclineth and ordereth the same, as the first and highest cause of all.</p>
               <p>The Third speciall doctrine of the Church, whereat offence is taken,<note place="margin">3. Of mans inabilitie of himselfe to doe good.</note> is this, <hi>That man of himselfe can doe no good, but all goodnes and grace in man come from God.</hi> Hence our common people take occasion of loosenesse of life: for tell them that they must repent and beleeue, if they will be saued; their answer is, that they doe it so well as God will giue them grace; all goodnes (say they) must come from God: yea, the wiser sort amongst vs will not sticke to lay the fault of their loose life on God, who giues them no more grace. But for the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this occasion of offence, we must know; that when we are not<note place="margin">Remedie.</note> able to doe our duties as we ought, and to pray, to repent and beleeue as God requireth, the fault is in our selues, and not in God: for we were created righteous in Adam, and in him, had power and grace to haue done whatsoeuer God required at our hands: but Adam lost this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14013:72"/>
through his owne default; and we in him lost it also: and therefore our inabilitie commeth from our selues. Againe, we must consider that God giues grace indeede, yet not miraculously in Ale-houses and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes, but then when men vse the meanes to come by grace, and doe that which by nature they are able; that is, come and heare the word attentiuely, endeauouring to beleeue and to obey the same: for though the good vsage of the gifts of nature cannot merit any grace, yet ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily we may obserue, that in the vse of meanes is grace receiued: Act. 2. 41. <hi>At one sermon there were conuerted three thousand soules, among the rebellious Iewes:</hi> Act. 16. 14. <hi>Lidias heart was opened in hearing Paul preach:</hi> and ordinarily men are conuerted in the meanes: for <hi>faith commeth by hearing the Gospel preached,</hi> Rom. 10. 17.</p>
               <p>The last point of doctrine, from whence many take occasion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,<note place="margin">4. Of Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> is <hi>the doctrine of Iustification by faith alone, without workes.</hi> Hence the Papists condemne our Church as an enemie to all good workes: and many hereby take occasion of a leud life, because good works must not iustifie them before God. Now to cut off this offence, we must<note place="margin">Remedie.</note> hold and know, that good works and faith are disioyned in the worke of our Iustification before God; but they are conioyned in the whole course of our liues and conuersation, both before God and man. No worke in man but faith is required to his Iustification, though in God there be respect to his owne free mercie, and to Christs merits: but in our liues faith and works must goe hand in hand together. Now that these may thus be well distinguished, I shew it plainely: In the fire is both heate and light, yet in the warming of the bodie the heate hath force onely, and not light, though to many other vses it serue necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; euen so in a child of God are required both faith and workes, but to iustifie him faith onely is required, though works be necessarie tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough his whole life: for they iustifie vs before men, and winne vnto vs a testimonie of our iustification before God, not onely in our owne hearts, but from the Lord, Iam. 2. 21. and therfore we must not content our selues with a faith in speculation, voide of workes; but within the compasse of our callings, doe what good we can for Gods glorie, and the comfort of our brethren.</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14013:73"/>
Church of God. To preuent this occasion of sinning, three Rules must be obserued: first, <hi>that to beleeue and confesse the doctrine of saluation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Remedie. I. Rule. A true note of the Church. Gods church described.</note> 
                  <hi>taught and deliuered by the Prophets and Apostles, is an infallible and inseparable note of a true Church of God:</hi> for Gods Church is nothing els, but a companie of Gods people, called by the doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles vnto the state of saluation. This doctrine is the <hi>seede of regeneration,</hi> whereby men are begotten vnto Christ; and it is that <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The way is this; <hi>we must beleeue and remember, that out of the church</hi>

               <p>The fourth offence taken from the Church is, <hi>from the Apostacie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. From the Apostacie of some.</note> 
                  <hi>of some that liue in the Church;</hi> for ordinarily in Gods Church are many Apostates, as in this our Church, many that were in times past Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, are become Papists, some Arrians, Sabellians, and some open A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists, and blasphemers. Hence many, fearing their falls (as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) dare not ioyne themselues to the truth, and the profession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But to cut off this occasion, two rules must be remembred; First,<note place="margin">Remedie. 1. Rule.</note> 
                  <hi>that the falling away of any man, from the truth, is the worke of God, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering an hidden hypocrite,</hi> 1. Ioh. 2. 19. <hi>They went out from vs, but they were not of vs, for if they had beene of vs, they would haue continued with vs: but this is come to passe, that it might appeare they were not all of vs.</hi> Secondly, consider that the beginning and continuance of our<note place="margin">2. Rule.</note> religion &amp; saluation, stands on Gods free election, which is vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14013:74"/>
and hereupon must we staie our selues touching our estate, when we see others fall away. 2. Tim. 2. 19. <hi>Paul</hi> comforteth the Church, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the feare of griefe which they might conceiue, by the Apostacie of <hi>Himeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> which were two pillars amongst them, by this Rule; <hi>The foundation of God remaineth sure, and hath this seale: the Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> Now because some might say, God indeede knows it, but we doe not: to this (I take it) the Apostle answers, when he saith, <hi>and let euery one that calles vpon the name of the Lord, depart from iniquitie:</hi> as if he should say, Looke that you call vpon God for grace, and make conscience of all sinne, and by this you shall know your selues to belong to God; which thing when once you know, then staie thereon, for Gods calling is vnchangeable.</p>
               <p>Againe, as these occasions are taken from the whole Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,<note place="margin">More speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all offences in the church</note> so more especially, some take offence from seuerall things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; as first, from the <hi>wants that be in Ministers, both for iudgement and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>doctrine.</hi> Hence politicke carnall men plead thus; Preaching is full of<note place="margin">From want in Ministers doctrine.</note> imperfection, therein men publish their owne errors; but the written word containeth in it the sermons of Christ, and of his Apostles, which are most perfect: and therefore it is best to content our selues with the Scripture read, and to heare no preaching by men.</p>
               <p>To cut off this offence, wee must remember, that the preaching of<note place="margin">Remedie.</note> the word, though it bee by sinnefull man, is Gods holy ordinance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed and enioyned as solemnely, as any morall precept is, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst murther, or adulterie: for from the beginning, till the Iews came to mount Sina, God himselfe preached to his Church, which was then contained in some fewe families. But from that time, <note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>6</note> 
                  <hi>because the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could not abide the voyce of God himselfe,</hi> it pleased him to ordaine the Ministerie of the word, by the hand of sinnefull man. Now it bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods owne ordinance, vnlesse we will make our selues wiser then God, we must subiect our selues thereto, with all reuerence, albeit it be deliuered by sinnefull man. Thus <hi>Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elius</hi> did, Act. 10. 33. and the Thessalonians, 1. Thess. 2. 13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, many are offended at the liues of Ministers, and from the<note place="margin">2. From the liues of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note> wants that be in them, whether in deed, or in suspition onely, many take occasion to contemne their doctrine; thinking, as the Rulers of the Iewes said to the blind man; <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 9. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art altogether borne in sinne, and doest thou teach vs?</hi> Now to cut off this occasion, two things must<note place="margin">Remedie.</note> be remembred. First, we must distinguish of euery Minister, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">1</note> in him a double person; both that he is a sinnefull man, subiect to many infirmities, as we our selues are; and also that he is the Lords
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14013:75"/>
Ambassadour, sent in Gods name to deliuer his will vnto vs. Now looke, as we honour the Embassadour of a Prince, though his person be vile and base; so much more ought wee to reuerence the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of God himselfe, and receiue his doctrine, as from God, though for his person, he be subiect to manifold infirmities. Secondly, we must consider, that it is Gods wil and commandement, that though ministers be manifestly faultie and sinnefull, yet their ministerie must be receiued and obeyed carefully. Math. 23. 2. <hi>The Scribes and Pharises sit in Moses chaire</hi> (saith Christ,) <hi>all therefore that they bid you obserue, that doe, but after their workes doe not.</hi> Phil. 1. 15. <hi>Some preach Christ of enuie</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>and not in sinceritie, but yet the Apostle reioyced therein, because Christ was preached euery manner of way,</hi> verse 18. And therefore, as we doe not refuse meate for our bodies when wee bee hungrie, though a wicked person haue dressed it, so must wee not refuse or contemne the word of God, the food of our soules, for the sinnes of the party that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, many take offence at the lenitie of the Church, towards of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,<note place="margin">3. From leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towards offenders.</note> and for the presence of wicked persons at the Lords table, doe refuse to communicate with the Church: now albeit men should not be admitted hand ouer head, to the Lords Table, but scandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons ought to be restrained; yet the want thereof, ought not to keepe the godly from this Sacrament: for another mans euill conscience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not defile thy good conscience, another mans sinne cannot hurt thee, vnlesse thou doe some way communicate with him therein. Christ was more carefull in his dutie, then euer man was, and yet hee communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the wicked Iewes, Scribes, and Pharises, in the seruice of God, vnder the Law.</p>
               <p>The fourth head from whence offence is taken, is <hi>the state of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. Generall head of offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces taken. From the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of the wicked.</note> 
                  <hi>principally in regard of their prosperitie.</hi> Hence some holy ones su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect their owne estate and religion, as either not good, or not regarded of God. This befell <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psal. 37. when hee sawe the prosperitie of the wicked, and their increase in riches, with peace, and ease, hee said, <note n="g" place="margin">Vers. 13</note> 
                  <hi>Certainly, I haue clensed mine heart in vaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd washed my hands in innocencie.</hi> Hence also <hi>Ieremie</hi> reasons with God, <note n="h" place="margin">Ier. 12. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>why the way of the wicked should prosper, and they bee in wealth that transgresse rebelliously.</hi> Hence vndoubtedly at this day, many call into question the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God. Now the way to cut off this offence, is to <note n="i" place="margin">Psal. 73. 17</note> 
                  <hi>enter into the sanctuarie of God,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> did; that is, to come to the assemblies of Gods people, where the word is preached, for there a man shall see the manifold reasons, why God will haue his owne people afflicted, &amp;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14013:75"/>
also the fearefull end of the pleasures of the wicked; namely, a fitting of them to further destruction. Againe, from this same ground, doe many rich men take offence; for hauing the world at will, they blesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with this perswasion, that God loues them, and thereupon take occasion to condemne all religion, and to goe on in the pursuite of worldly profits and delights. And this is one maine cause, why among the rich, we haue so few good and sound Professors; because that from a false ground of outward things, they perswade themselues of Gods loue &amp; fauour. But to cut off this offence, we must remember that mans<note place="margin">Remedie.</note> case is the more fearefull, when he wants all crosses; for <hi>God chasteneth euery child whom he receiueth,</hi> Heb. 12. 6. &amp; it is a marke of Gods child, to be in affliction, if he profit thereby: the stalled oxe commeth sooner to the slaughter, then the oxe that is vnder the yoke; and the sheepe that goeth in fat pasture, commeth sooner to the shambles, then that which goeth on the bare commons: so oftentimes God fatteth the wicked with the blessings of this life, as hee did <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 16. 25.</note> the rich glutton, that he may more iustly condemne them in the world to come. Lastly, we must remember what <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <note n="g" place="margin">Eccl. 9. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>No man knoweth loue or hatred, of all that is before him:</hi> that is, of all outward things: <hi>all things fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vnto all, both good and bad:</hi> &amp; therfore no man must so blesse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with his outward estate, that he be drawne to esteeme of religion, as a thing needlesse or superfluous.</p>

               <p>Our Sauiour Christ proceeding further, to restore the seauenth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement to his perfection, doth here confute a false interpretation of a Politicke law of <hi>Moses,</hi> giuen by the Scribes and Pharises. For this ende, first he laies downe the wordes of <hi>Moses</hi> politicke law; but yet so, as containing in them the false interpretation of the Iewish tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, ver. 31. then hee opposeth the truth of God, against their false interpretation, and maintaineth the first institution of mariage, v. 32.</p>
               <p>For the first, <hi>Moses</hi> politicke law was, <hi>That hee which put away his wife, should giue her a Bill of diuorce.</hi> This law the Iewish Teachers did falsly interpret; for the better perceiuing wherof, these three points are to be handled, touching <hi>Moses</hi> politicke law: 1. what kinde of law it was: 2. the straitnesse of that law: 3. what effect and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14013:76"/>
force it had. For the first, the law is set downe, Deut. 24. 1. <hi>when a man marieth a wife, and she finde no fauour in his eies, because he hath espied some filthinesse in her; then let him write her a bill of diuorce, and put it in her hand, and send her out of his house.</hi> This law was not morall, but ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, or politicke, for the good ordering of the common wealth. Now among their particular lawes, some were <hi>laws of toleration, and permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> which were such as did not approoue of the euill which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, but did onely tolerate and permit that euill which could not be auoided, for the preuenting of a greater euil, which otherwise would fall out. As when the sea hath made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> breach into the land, if it cannot possibly be stopped, the best course is, to make it as narrow as may bee. Such was the law concerning vsurie, Deut. 23. 20. permitting the Iewes to exercise it vpon a stranger, but not towards a brother: and the like was the law touching polygamie, Deut. 21. 15. If a man had two wiues, the one hated, the other loued, and they both haue borne him children; if the first borne be the sonne of the hated (though shee were maried to him the latter) yet her seed was legitimate, and her sonne had the right of the first borne. In both which lawes were tolerated, that which God condemned, onely for the preuenting of a greater euill. Vnder this sort comes our law of vsurie, for taking tenne in the hundred, not approuing<note place="margin">Bellar. de Amiss. grat. &amp; stat. pecc. lib. 2 cap. 18. Harding co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fut. of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polog. part. 4 chap. 1. div. 1.</note> but permitting so much, for the auoyding of greater vsurie. Vnto this kind, the Papists would reduce their law of permitting Stewes, for the preuenting of greater sinnes; but that law can haue no title to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission: for a law of permission, is to diminish that euill, which by man cannot possibly be cut off altogether: now that sinne which they would preuent by their Stewes, might be cut off among them, if they would giue allowance to Gods owne ordinance of lawfull mariage, vnto all sorts and sexes. So likewise this law of <hi>Moses</hi> for diuorce, was a law of permission, not approouing of the giuing a bill of diuorce for euery light cause, but tolerating of it, for the preuenting of greater mischeife, euen of murther: for the nature of the Iewes was this; if a man once tooke dislike to his wife, he would neuer be at rest till he had shed her blood, if they might not bee parted asunder. Now this law of diuorce, was giuen to restraine this great euill, for hereby a man was tolerated to put away his wife, when shee found no fauour in his eies, lest hee should kill her; yet so, as he gaue her a bill of diuorce, wherein hee must set downe the cause why hee put her away: whereby also, many were restrained from putting away their wiues, because it was a great shame, for a light occasion, so highly to transgresse Gods holy institution, who made them by mariage, one flesh. The truth of this may appeare by the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14013:76"/>
Lords owne complaint, against his people, to whom he speaketh, as to a wife that had forsaken her husband, without a cause on his behalfe, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say 50. 1. <hi>Where</hi> (saith he) <hi>is that bill of your mothers diuorcement, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I sent her away?</hi> As if he should say, I gaue her no bill, but her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture and separation from mee, is by her owne sinnes: which phrase sheweth what was the custome of the Iewes in this case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> The <hi>straitnesse of this law</hi> appeares in this, that the man onely was permitted to giue this bill vnto his wife, but the wife might not giue it to her husband; for <hi>Moses</hi> saith, Whosoeuer shall put away his wife: neither is there any place in Scripture, to prooue that the wife had this libertie, so to deale with her husband. If it bee asked, whether the wife in a iust cause, as for adulterie, had not the like libertie: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, If we respect Gods institution touching mariage, the right of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce is equall to them both; for in regard of the bond of mariage, they are equally bound one to another. Here indeed this libertie is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely to the man, by this politicke law, not that he had more right, but to preuent the euill, of the hardnesse of his heart, who taking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spleasure at his wife, would rather spill her blood, then continue with her. If it be alleadged, that <note n="a" place="margin">i. Cor. 11. 3</note> 
                  <hi>a man is the womans head:</hi> I answer, that is for regiment and direction in her place, but not in regard of breaking the bond of mariage, whereby he is bound to his wife, as well as she to him, as the Apostle teacheth, 1. Cor. 7. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. Point.</hi> The <hi>force</hi> and <hi>effect of this law</hi> was this, It made the Bill of diuorcement for any cause giuen, to be tolerable before men; &amp; mariage after such a diuorce, lawfull and warrantable in the Courts of men, Deut. 24. 4. But yet in the court of conscience before God, the diuorcement it selfe, and second mariages made thereupon, were both vnlawfull; <hi>for God hateth this separation,</hi> Mal. 2. 15. And whether partie soeuer marieth another vpon this diuorce, commits adulterie, Matth. 19. 9. This must be remembred, for the true vnderstanding of this law of <hi>Moses;</hi> the first words whereof, are a permission, to this effect; If a man do conceiue such a dislike against his wife, as that he wil not abide with her, but will needes put her away, then he may; but yet so, as hee giue her a bill of diuorce: which doth not acquit him before God, but before men onely.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus shewed the true meaning of this law, it remaineth now to see what the Pharises taught touching diuorce. Their doctrine was this, that hee which gaue a bill of diuorcement vnto his wife, for any light occasion, was thereby acquitted from her before God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon might marie another, without the guilt of adulterie: and also
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14013:77"/>
that another man might lawfully marrie her that was thus diuorced. That this was their meaning, may appeare by the contrarie answer of our Sauiour Christ, wherein he crosseth and confuteth this their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, in the words following.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>Here Christ answereth not to <hi>Moses</hi> law, but to the corrupt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Scribes and Pharises, whereby they depraued that law. By <hi>fornication</hi> Christ meaneth, not euery sinne of that kinde, but onely the sinne of <hi>adulterie;</hi> or that which is greater in that kind, namely <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest.</hi> Adulterie, is a sinne that is committed by two parties, one whereof is either maried, or espowsed, as hath beene shewed before. <hi>Causeth her to commit adulterie:</hi>] That is, giueth her occasion to marie againe, and so to commit adulterie; because their first bond remaineth stil: <hi>and he that marieth her that is diuorced:</hi>] that is, for any small cause, &amp; not for adulterie, he also commits adulterie.</p>
               <p>Here then two points are set downe; First, <hi>that he who puts away his wife for any light cause, causeth her to commit adulterie.</hi> Secondly, <hi>hee that marieth her that is diuorced, committeth adulterie.</hi> Yet vnto both these, Christ putteth an exception in the case of adulterie. The <note n="a" place="margin">Rhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. on this place.</note> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and some others, would restraine the exception to the first part of the sentence, and make it a negation, to this effect; <hi>He that puts away his wife, beeing no fornicator, &amp;c.</hi> But the truth is, that the exception be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the whole answer of our Sauiour Christ, denying diuorce, saue onely for adulterie; and permitting no mariage after diuorcement, saue onely where the diuorce is for adulterie.</p>
               <p>First, whereas our Sauiour Christ opposeth vnto this politicke law<note place="margin">The vse.</note> of <hi>Moses,</hi> concerning diuorce, the law of nature, touching mariage, Ge. 2. 24. He giueth vs an excellent distinction between all politicke laws, and the law of nature, which is the morall law; for that is a law of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall equitie, commaunding good, and forbidding euill simply, without respect of man: but politicke lawes are tempered according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, and though they doe not approoue, yet sometimes they permit euill, for the auoyding of greater mischiefe: yea, they tolerate that, which before God, and in conscience is condemned. This point must teach vs, not to content our selues with performing obedience to the politicke lawes of men, for the lawes of men may tolerate that which Gods law doth condemne: so the law of this Land in practise tolerates vsurie, but vsurers must not hereupon thinke that all is safe &amp;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14013:77"/>
well with them, and that they sinne not in taking ten in the hundred, because the law of the land permits it; for our law tolerates that, for the preuenting of greater vsurie, when as the law of God doth vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the same. Againe, our laws are open for men to goe to law at the first, vpon euery light occasion, without seeking former means of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but yet such men as doe so, are guiltie of sinne before God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their libertie by our politike lawes. Some politike lawes also tolerate contracts of mariage, made without consent of parents; yet such children sin against the law of God, for herein God requires chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens subiection to their parents and gouernours. And the like might be shewed in many other points, so that it is no sufficient iustification of our actions, to say the lawes of men allow vs so to doe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hence we may learne, that a man cannot lawfully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with good conscience put away his wife, except it be for adulterie; the text is cleare both heare, and also Math. 19. 7. which confuteth the ciuill laws of some countries, &amp; the <note n="a" place="margin">Concil.

                  </gap> 19. 29. Here (say they) is diuorce for religion allowed. <hi>Ans.</hi> Christ by <hi>forsaking,</hi> meaneth not that separation which is made, by giuing a Bil of diuorcement; but that which is caused by imprisonment, banishment, or by death.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1. Cor. 7. 15. <hi>If the vnbeleeuing depart, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not bound in such things.</hi> Here (say they) is another cause of diuorce. <hi>Ans.</hi> The malitious and wilfull departing of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuer, doth dissolue the mariage; but that is no cause of giuing a bil of diuorce: onely adulterie causeth that. Here the beleeuer is a meere patient, and the diuorce is made by the vnbeleeuer, who vniustly forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and so puts away the other.</p>

Secondly, it hindreth not, but that the bond of mariage may remaine sure and firme, though one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be cut off from the Church; <hi>for the beleeuing husband must not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake his vnbeleeuing wife, if shee will dwell with him:</hi> 1. Corinthians, 7. 12.</p>

                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:14013:78"/>4. <hi>Obiect.</hi> After mariage, one partie may haue a contagious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable disease, which may cause the other to giue a bil of diuorce. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi> A contagious disease may cause a separation for a time, but no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce; and if that disease bee incurable, and disable the partie from the dutie of mariage, then such parties must thinke themselues, as it were, called of God to liue in single life.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But maried persons may seeke to spill the blood one of another, and therfore it is good to giue a bil of diuorce, to preuent that euil. <hi>Answer.</hi> Such enmitie may cause a separation for a time, till recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation be made, but the bond of mariage must not therefore bee bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Obiect.</hi> Death maketh a diuorce. <hi>Ans.</hi> Death indeede endeth mariage estate, and setteth the partie liuing free, to marrie in the Lord, where he or shee will; but this comes not by diuorce giuen of either partie: so that the conclusion still remaineth firme, that a man with good conscience cannot giue a bill of diuorce for any cause, but for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie: and therefore those lawes which permit diuorce for other causes, are greatly faultie before God. If any shall aske, whether mens laws may not make more causes of diuorceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then this one? I answer, no; for mariage is not a meere ciuill thing, but partly spirituall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, and therefore God onely hath power to appoint the beginning, the continuance, and the end thereof. If any yet aske, why Idolatrie &amp; Magycke, which be greater sinnes then adulterie, may not breake mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age? <hi>Ans.</hi> They are greater indeede, against God, but not in this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of mariage; for the sinne of adulterie, breaketh onely the bond of mariage, which may remaine still betweene two parties, though one be an idolater, a witch, or an Atheist. Now considering that Adulterie is so great a sinne, that it cuts of the knot off mariage, aboue all things, those persons that are called to this estate, must take heede of all sinnes, so of this especially.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here may be asked, whether after diuorce for adulterie, the parties diuorced may marrie againe, without committing adulterie? This point hath bin diuersly discussed, wee will consider the reasons on both sides; First, for the lawfulnes of it, especially to the party innocent.</p>
               <p>1. From <hi>Christs doctrine</hi> in this place; for in his answer to the false interpretation of <hi>Moses</hi> politicke Law, touching diuorce, hee first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds a generall rule, and then puts an exception thereto: the nature of which exception is, alwaies to implie and put downe the contrarie to the generall rule. As in this place; the generall rule is, <hi>Whosoeuer putteth away his wife, causeth her to commit adulterie; &amp; hee that marieth her</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:14013:78"/>
                  <hi>committeth adulterie.</hi> The exception then must bee contrarie; namely, that in the case of adulterie, hee that puts away his wife, lawfully conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thereof, causeth her not to commit adulterie; neither he that mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her that is diuorced, doth commit adulterie. If it be said, that Christ propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth two rules, one for the case of diuorce, the other for the case of marying after diuorce; &amp; applyeth his exception <hi>for adulterie</hi> only to the case of diuorce, and not to the case of mariage after diuorce. <hi>Ans.</hi> As the exception <hi>for adulterie,</hi> is here in this chapter ioyned with the case of diuorce; <hi>he that putteth away his wife, except it be for fornication, &amp;c.</hi> so in the 19. cha. v. 9. the same exception for adulterie, is expresly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only to the case of diuorce, but also to the case of mariage after diuorce; saying, <hi>Whosoeuer shal put away his wife, except it be for fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and marie another, committeth adulterie:</hi> so that if in this place the exception make the diuorce lawfull for adulterie, then in the 19. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it maketh it lawfull to marie againe after such diuorce, without the guilt of adulterie. 2. The innocent partie is not to bee punished for<note place="margin">2</note> the wilfulnesse of the offender, and therefore the partie that is fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse may with good conscience marrie againe, after lawfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce. 3. God hath prouided mariage to bee a remedie against<note place="margin">3</note> incontinencie for all persons, 1. Corinth. 7. 2. But if parties lawfully diuorced, might not marie againe, then they should want this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and bee depriued of this benefit. If it be said, they may reconcile themselues each to other, and so haue remedie. <hi>Answer.</hi> But what if the partie offending liue in adulterie still, then the partie innocent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in conscience ioyne him or her selfe to the other, and reunite the bond of matrimonie; for that were too much lenitie, towards so foule a crime: and a sinne against God, for want of Christian reconciliation, which requireth that this revniting should bee in the Lord, and not in the flesh alone. 4. The phrases of Scripture vsed by the <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 24. 1, 2, 3. Math. 19 9. Luk. 16. 18. Bellar. de Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Reasons alleadged on the other side. First, Christs generall saying, <note n="b" place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 10. 11</note> 
                  <hi>Whosoeuer putteth away his wife, and marieth another, committeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie.</hi> Hence some inferre, that there may be no mariage at all after any diuorce. But they abuse that Scripture, for though <hi>Saint Marke</hi> put downe no exception; yet <hi>Matthew</hi> hath made supply therof in two places, Chapter 5. 32. and 19. 9. Now the Gospels were penned by seuerall men, that that which was not fully expressed by one, might bee supplied by another, that so by conferring writer with writer, the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14013:79"/>
whole truth might be made manifest.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Matth. 19. 6. <hi>Whom God hath coupled, let not man put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder:</hi> Therefore after diuorce, they stil remaine man and wife, before God, and may not marrie to others. <hi>Ans.</hi> The partie offending breaks the bond of mariage, and so sinneth grieuously against that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: but the partie innocent marying againe after lawfull diuorce, only taketh the benefit of that libertie, whereto God hath set him free, through the vnlawfull breaking of the bond, by the partie offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Rom. 6. 2. <hi>The woman is bound to the man while he liueth,</hi> and therfore may not marrie againe after diuorcement. <hi>Ans.</hi> That place must be vnderstood of the state of mariage, continuing vndissolued till death: but in the case of adulterie, the bond of mariage is broken; and therefore that hindreth not, but mariage may bee after lawfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, 1. Corinth. 7. 10, 11. <hi>Let not the wife depart from her husband, and if shee depart, let her remaine vnmarried, and be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto her husband, and let not the husband put away his wife.</hi> Here (say they) is a plaine place against mariage after diuorcement. <hi>Answer.</hi> The Apostle speaketh of departure, and putting away, for other causes then adulterie; as for hatred, dislike, &amp;c. which indeede are no sufficient causes of diuorce, and therefore they that separate therupon, ought not to marrie.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The bond of mariage, is a resemblance of the coniunction that is betweene Christ and his Church, which is inseparable and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; and therefore mariage also is inseparable. <hi>Answer.</hi> That resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance stands not in euery thing, but in this, <hi>That as in mariage two are made one flesh, so spiritually Christ, and euery true member of his Church become one;</hi> and that <hi>as Eue was taken out of Adams side, and made flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone; so the Church springeth as it were out of Christs bloode, which issued from his side:</hi> for else, if their reason were good, wee might say that mariage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should be eternall, in the life to come; because the vnion of Christ with his Church, is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: which we know to be false, for <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 22. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>in the resurrection men mary not, but are as the angels of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, If parties diuorced might mary again, their children should be miuried, hauing step-fathers or step-mothers in stead of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall parents. <hi>Ans.</hi> This reason is not sufficient to disallow diuorce, or mariage after it; for by the same reason we might delude all the iudicial lawes of <hi>Moses,</hi> and of all countries, which impose death for sundrie
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14013:79"/>
crimes, because thereby some children should loose their parents; but Iustice must be iustice with all men, though the posteritie haue hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by the execution thereof. <hi>Quest.</hi> But what if the lawes of some countries forbid mariage after diuorcement? <hi>Ans.</hi> Yet the libertie of conscience remaineth still, for this beeing giuen of God cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by men; and therefore when men haue freedome from the Magistrate, they may with good conscience marie againe after lawfull diuorce. And yet here we must know, that diuorcement, or mariage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Againe, there<note place="margin">2</note> be some particular causes which may iustly hinder mariage after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce: as first, if the parties reunite their bond againe by reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>for the knot broken by adulterie, may be reunited by the consent of the partie innocent.</hi> Secondly, when the one partie is a manifest cause of the Adulterie of the other, and so becomes an accessarie to the others offence: for it seemes vnequall, that he who hath put his hand to the committing of a sinne, should reape any benefit or priuiledge by the same. And therefore I say the partie innocent hath freedome in this case.</p>

Deut. 5. 11. <hi>Thou shalt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare thy selfe, but shall performe thine oathes vnto the Lord:</hi> which are not here taken in that true meaning wherein Moses set them downe, but in the false interpretation of the Iewish teachers: whereof that we may the better iudge, let vs search out the true meaning of Moses law concerning an oath: for which ende we must <hi>first</hi> see what periurie is; then propound the <hi>kinds of periurie;</hi> and lastly, shew the <hi>grieuousnes</hi> of this sinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I. Point.</hi> In <hi>periurie</hi> there must be two things: <hi>First,</hi> a man<note place="margin">Of peri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

must affirme or auouch something against his owne minde, his owne meaning, purpose, intention, or perswasion. When a man knowes a thing to be true, and saith it is true; or knoweth a thing to be false, and saies it is false, and swears thereto, this is no periurie, because his speech is answerable to that which is in his minde: but when a man knowes a thing to be true, and auoucheth it to be false; or knowing a thing to be false, auoucheth it to be true, vpon his oath; this is periurie: because in so doing, he speakes against his minde and perswasion. Secondly, in periurie there must be an oath; it is not periurie to speake a thing that is false, vnlesse he also sweare to the thing he speaketh falsly, against his minde: and yet euery oath maketh not direct periurie, vnlesse it bee a binding oath; for a man may sweare to a thing that is vnlawfull, and after alter his minde, and not performe his oath, without the guilt of periurie: as if a childe beeing vnder age, doe binde himselfe by oath to marrie without his parents consent; but comming to riper yeares, doth better consider of the matter, and subiects himselfe to his parents di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposing, who marrie him to another. Now though he sinned in so swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, yet he is not periured, because the oath was not a binding oath; for a childe vnder yeares hath not power to take an oath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> That wee may yet better iudge of this sinne, wee must<note place="margin">Kinds of periurie.</note> knowe that there be three kindes of periurie: First, <hi>when a man confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by oath, that which he knowes, or thinkes to be otherwise;</hi> as when<note place="margin">1</note> hee takes an oath that a thing is true, which he knowes to bee false; that a thing was thus, which hee knowes was otherwise. Secondly, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>swearing is periurie,</hi> when a man, either about things past, or to come, sweares contrarie to the true knowledge and purpose of his owne minde. Example of this wee haue in the Romish Priests, who both defend in writing, and practise in action, this deceitfull swearing; for beeing brought before the Magistrate, and made to sweare to this demaund, or such like; <hi>Whether they said Masse, or knewe where Masse was said at such a time?</hi> They answer vpon their oathes, <hi>That they did not, or knewe not,</hi> (though indeede they did) which is according to their doctrine, <hi>That vnto dangerous Interrogatories a man may frame a safe</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Toll. summa Cas. consc. lib. 4. c. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>meaning vnto himselfe, and sweare to it:</hi> as in the former instance, they sweare they knewe not where Masse was said, meaning, <hi>to reueale it to the Iudge.</hi> But this is flat periurie; for their oath is giuen them to answer according to the meaning of the Magistrates demaund: and if a man might lawfully frame a meaning to himselfe, in swearing, hee might easily delude all truth, and so <hi>should not an oath for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be the ende of strife;</hi> but the breeder thereof, through surmise of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14013:80"/>
false meaning in him that sweareth. The third kind of periurie, is <hi>The breaking of a binding oath;</hi> as when a man vpon his oath promiseth to<note place="margin">3</note> doe a thing that is lawfull, and doth it not: yet this is not alwaies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie; as First, If God after the oath taken, make the thing promised, impossible to be done: as if a man sweare to make another his heire, of such and such lands; now dwelling by the Sea side, the Sea breaks out, drownes all his land before he dieth; Is this man periured, because he performed not his promise bound with an oath? no verely; for God made the thing impossible. Secondly, if a man be bound in conscience to breake his oath: Thus <note n="a" place="margin">1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Dauid swearing rashly to slaie Nabal, and his familie,</hi> was yet staied from so doing, by <hi>Abigals</hi> counsell, and brake his oath, and <note n="b" place="margin">Vers. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>gaue God thankes for it;</hi> for indeed his oath was vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, beeing the bond of iniquitie, and the doing of it had beene the doubling of his sinne.</p>
               <p>Here it may well be demanded, whether those that are sworne to the Statutes and lawes of societies and incorporations be periured, if they breake the same? <hi>Ans.</hi> The Statutes of incorporations bee of two sorts; some are of the foundation of societies, without which the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration cannot stand, and these (not beeing against the word of God) cannot be broken without the guilt of periurie: others, are Statutes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of outward order and decencie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as touching apparel, gesture, and such like: as in some incorporations the Statutes require, that euery man therein should weare the round cap: hereunto many are sworne, who alwaies weare it not: now (though I say not that they are faultlesse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together) yet they are not periured; because this Statute of order, binds not a man simply, but either to obedience, or to paie the mulct; which if a man be content to paie, he satisfies the Statute, and benefits the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, as much as if he kept the Statute.</p>
               <p>Hauing shewed what periurie is, with the kinds thereof; let vs see whether we be free from it. After examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it will appeare, that mens liues are full of periurie; for where is much swearing vsually, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be much periurie: because they that sweare in their common talke, doe forget their oathes, as they doe their communication. But say we are cleare from periurie, yet are wee in danger of Gods heauie iudgements, for the breach of our vow in baptisme; wherein wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to beleeue in God, &amp; to serue him, forsaking the world, the flesh,<note place="margin">Militiae sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crati propter iuramentum dicebantur milites.

               <p>
                  <hi>III. Point.</hi> The grieuousnesse of this sinne of periurie, which here<note place="margin">Grieuousnes of periurie.</note> the Lord forbids, appeares by these three sinnes which are contained in it. First, the vttering, or maintaining of a lie. Secondly, the calling on God to be a witnesse vnto a lie; wherein men doe, as much as in them lieth, set the diuell himselfe, the father of lies, in the roome of God, and so greatly robbe him of his honour and maiestie. Thirdly, in periurie a man praies for a curse vpon himselfe, wishing God to bee a witnesse of his speech, and a iudge to reuenge, if he sweare falsly; so as herein a man is his owne vtter enemie, &amp; as much as in him lieth, doth cast both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and soule to hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Seeing this sinne of periurie is so great, whether may such a man be put to his oath, as is certainely thought will periure himselfe, if he be put to sweare? I answer, men that put others to sweare, are either priuate persons, or publike Magistrates: a priuate man for his owne priuate cause, may not put such a man to his oath; for hee should haue greater care of Gods glorie, and of the other mans soule, then of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate gaine: and therefore ought rather to depart from his temporall right, then suffer his brother so to dishonour God, and to hurt his owne soule. But if a Magistrate bee to put such a man to his oath, as is verely thought will periure himselfe, he may lawfully doe it; but yet he is first, to aduertise the partie of the waight of an oath, and of the fearefull sin of periurie; and then, if the order of Law and Iustice so require, he may minister an oath vnto him, leauing the euent to God: for the execution of iustice must not staie on mans misdemeanour, nor waite, till they make conscience of sinne; for if it did, no common wealth could stand, no warre could bee made: <hi>Moses</hi> and the Leuites executed<note place="margin">Exod. 32. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14013:81"/>
former law of <hi>Moses,</hi> gathered by the Iewish Teachers; which colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though it be not expresly set downe, yet is it the very sense of the Law: for if a man cannot without periurie breake a lawfull binding oath, then that Law which forbiddeth periurie, bindeth man to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all that he hath lawfully sworne vnto God.</p>
               <p>Here then in this collection of the Iewish Teachers, is set downe an<note place="margin">The straite bond of an oath.</note> excellent point, touching the <hi>straitnesse of the bond of an oath.</hi> In euery lawfull oath, there is a double bond; First, it bindes one man to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the performing of the thing hee sweareth to doe. Secondly, it bindes a man vnto God, for he that sweareth, inuocates God as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and a Iudge of the truth of his assertion; and hee stands bound vnto God, till the thing sworne vnto, bee performed, if it bee lawfull and possible. And herein the Pharises are good Teachers, and from this their collection, we learne sundry points.</p>
               <p>First, that if a man take an oath, though hee were constrained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">A constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned oath of things lawful bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>des.</note> by feare, yet it must bee kept, if it bee of things lawfull and possible; because in an oath a man stands bound vnto the Lord: as if a man sweare vnto a Thiefe, for the sauing of his life, that hee will bring him some money, or other bootie, of his owne goods; this he is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, because the losse is but priuate; but if hee were sworne further, not to detect the Thiefe, that were a bond of iniquitie, tending to the hurt of the common wealth: and therefore such an oath a man ought not to take; and if he doe so sweare, yet he must not keepe it, but repent of his rash oath.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if a man be brought to sweare by error, beeing ouertaken<note place="margin">An oath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>or</note> by another, yet if it were of things lawfull, within his power, it must bee kept: so did <hi>Iosuah</hi> to the Gibeonites, and the breach thereof by <note n="e" place="margin">Iosh. 3. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Saul was grieuously punished,</hi> as we shewed before.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if a man sweare vnto a lawfull promise, and it fall out, that<note place="margin">An oath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaging.</note> the keeping of his oath procure him great temporall losses; yet the oath must be kept, because therein hee is bound vnto God: This <hi>Dauid</hi> noteth for a propertie of him that <hi>must rest in Gods holy mountaine, to keepe his promise whereto he is bound by an oath, though it turne to his owne hindrance,</hi> Psal. 15. 4.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, here wee may see, that the <note n="f" place="margin">Azo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14013:82"/>
least equall to God himselfe. The Pharisies doctrine was farre better, who taught that mens oathes must be performed vnto God, without dispensing therewith. And therefore our English Priests who before haue sworne to the Supremacie of this state, and now are reconciled to the Pope, are statly periured persons, and so to be held.</p>
               <p>But howsoeuer the Pharisies make this one good collection, yet they erre grossely, in their further meaning and expounding of this law: for when as God forbiddeth a man to forsweare himselfe, hence they gather; first, that it was lawfull to sweare ordinarily in common talke, euen by the name of God, so that they sware truly, and did not forsweare themselues: that this was their meaning, will appeare in Christs answer. Secondly, hence they gathered, that the law spake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of indirect oathes: for they made two kinds of oathes: <hi>direct</hi> by the name of God, and <hi>indirect</hi> by the creatures. And as they held that a man might sweare directly by the name of God without sinne in common talke, so they taught, that swearing indirectly by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as by heauen, by the temple, the head, Altar, and such like, was nothing; neither the breaking thereof was any periurie, as <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 16.

               <p>vers. 34. <hi>But I say vnto you, sweare not at all, neither by heauen, for it is the throne of God, &amp;c.</hi> Here Christ confuteth the false interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Iewish Teachers. And his answer is propounded, first, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; <hi>sweare not at all:</hi> then particularly in the words following to the 38. verse. The wordes of his generall answer are somewhat hard, and peruerted by many; therefore that we may come to the true sense thereof, two points are to be considered. First, what it is to sweare: then, how farre forth Christ forbiddeth swearing. For the first, we shall best conceiue of an oath by the parts thereof. In an oath be two things:<note place="margin">Of an oath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>Confession,</hi> and <hi>Imprecation. Confession</hi> is threefold; though for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forme the words of an oath be few. 1. A man confesseth, that<note place="margin">1</note> that which he sweareth is true in his conscience: 2. that God is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<note place="margin">Confession.</note> not onely of the outward action and speech, but also of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular conscience: and 3. that God is an omnipotent Iudge of all, and of him that sweareth, able to iustifie him if he sweare truly, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to condemne him eternally if he sweare falsly. <hi>Imprecation,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond<note place="margin">2</note> thing in an oath, is a prayer to God for two things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First, that<note place="margin">Imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> God would be a witnesse with him that sweareth, to testifie that he sweareth truly, and according to his conscience: so Paul did, Rom. 9. 1. <hi>I</hi>

                     </gap> bearing me witnesse in the holy Ghost.</hi> Secondly, a man praies, that God would become a Iudge to curse him with eternall wrath, if he swore falsely: so 2. Cor. 1. 23. <hi>I call God for a record vnto my soule:</hi> and the forme of swearing in old time, was the vsing of this imprecation: <hi>God doe so to me, and more also, if I doe not thus and thus.</hi> 2. king. 6. 31.</p>
               <p>We see what it is to sweare. Now we come to shew, how farre forth<note place="margin">How farre Christ for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> Christ forbiddeth swearing, in these words; <hi>Sweare not at all.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists gather hence that all swearing is forbidden, and so did some <note n="a" place="margin">Pelagians &amp; Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> Heretikes in the primitiue Church; yea and <note n="b" place="margin">Hierome, Theophyl. Chrysost. in Matth. 5.</note> some of the auncient Fathers (that otherwaies deserued well of the Church) thought that the Lord in the olde Testament did onely permit swearing, as he did some other things that were euill, which he approoued not, and that now Christ did quite take away the same. But this opinion is false and erronious: for swearing is <note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 10. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>commanded</hi> as a part of Gods worship: now if Christ should here forbid it, he should be against himselfe, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that which himselfe approoued.

                  <hi>strife.</hi> Others (as the Papists) say, that Christ here sets down a counsell of perfection, not forbidding all swearing, but rather wishing that men could so liue in faith, loue, and truth, that there should be no vse of an oath. But this can not be true: for Christs wordes are not perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue, but prohibitorie, expressely forbidding swearing. And yet we must know, that Christs meaning is not here to forbid all swearing simply, but all swearing after the Iewish manner and custome; that is, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talke and communication, as is plaine in the last words of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, when he saith, <hi>Let your communication be yea, yea.</hi> For this is a Rule to be obserued in the interpretation of Scripture, <hi>that things ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally spoken, must particularly be vnderstood, according to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the present matter in hand:</hi> as when <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <note n="d" place="margin">1.

               <p>Here two questions must be skanned: first, when may a man law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully sweare, and when not? for Christs speach forbidding ordinarie swearing, seemes to graunt, that there is a time wherein a man may lawfully take an oath. There be two times and cases wherein a man<note place="margin">Two cases wherein an oath is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> may lawfully take an oath. First, when the magistrate ministreth an oath vnto a man vpon a iust occasion: for the magistrate hath the power of God in this case, and therefore when he iustly requires it of man, then may he lawfully sweare. Secondly, when a mans owne calling generall or particular, necessarily requires an oath; and that is in foure cases: I. when the taking of an oath serueth to maintaine, procure, or winne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God any part of his glorie, or to preserue the same from disgrace. In this regard, <hi>Paul</hi> mooued with a godly zeale, vseth an oath in sundrie of his Epistles, for the confirmation of his doctrine, that the Churches to whome he writ might be stablished in the truth, and so glorifie God the more. II. When his oath serueth to maintaine or further his owne or others saluation, or preseruation in soule or bodie; in this case <note n="a" place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 23</note> 
                  <hi>Paul calls God for a record vnto his soule, that he came not to Corinth to spare them.</hi> And <hi>Dauid,</hi> to further himselfe in the way of saluation, <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 119. 106.</note> 
                  <hi>bound himselfe by an oath that he would keepe Gods commandements.</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:14013:84"/>
III. When the oath serues to confirme and stablish peace and societie betweene partie and partie, countrey and countrey, kingdome &amp; king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Thus did <hi>Abraham and Abimelech sweare each to other,</hi> Gen. 21. 23. and <hi>Iacob and Laban,</hi> Gen. 31. 53. and by vertue hereof doe subiects bind themselues by oath in allegiance to their Princes, and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to their Gouernours. IV. When a man by oath and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, may either free himselfe from temporall losses, or procure to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe temporall benefits which be of great weight and moment: for an oath for confirmation is among men the ende of all strife: now we know that much strife and controuersie doth arise about worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. And in this regard a man by oath may lawfully purge himselfe of infamie and slander. In these foure cases, a man may lawfully sweare, not onely publikely before the Magistrate, but also priuately, so it be with due reuerence and good conscience. But in common talke, or on light occasion, a man cannot lawfully sweare, either by small or great oath, for that is to take the name of God in vaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Quest.</hi> How must a man take an oath, when by iust occasion he is called to sweare? <hi>Ans.</hi> To this question the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, chap. 4. 2. <hi>Thou shalt sweare the Lord liueth, in truth, in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Vertues in an oath.</note> 
                  <hi>and in righteousnes:</hi> where three vertues are required in an holy manner of swearing. First, <hi>truth,</hi> and that respecteth two things, as<note place="margin">1</note> well the <hi>matter</hi> whereto we sweare, for God may not be brought for a witnesse to a lie; as also the minde of him that sweareth: for his oath must be according to his minde, without fraud or deceit, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent<note place="margin">2</note> to performe that truly which he promises thereupon. Secondly, <hi>Iustice</hi> or <hi>righteousnes,</hi> which also respecteth two things; first, the thing sworne to, that must be iust and lawfull and according to Gods word: secondly, the conscience of the swearer: for a man must not sweare for a trifle, though the thing be true, but either by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Magistrate, or vpon some necessarie cause of his lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: and against this vertue doe those sinne, that sweare vsually in their common talke, though the thing be true: for trifles and light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not a iust cause of an oath. Thirdly, <hi>iudgement</hi> as well of the<note place="margin">3</note> oath, as of his owne person: for the oath; he that sweareth rightly, ought to know the nature of an oath, and be able to iudge of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereabout he sweareth, and also discerne rightly of the persons before whome, of time, place, and other circumstances. And for his owne person, a man that sweareth, ought to see in his conscience that he is fit to take an oath, and thereby to worship and glorifie God: for he that sweareth ought to haue his heart smitten with feare and awe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14013:84"/>
towards God, as in all other parts of his worship: Deut. 10. 20. <hi>the feare of God,</hi> and <hi>swearing by his name,</hi> are ioyned together: and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane man that hath no feare of God in his heart ought not to sweare. And thus much of Christs general Answer, to their false interpretation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither by heauen, for it is the throne of God:</hi> v. 35. <hi>Nor yet by the earth, for it his footestoole: neither by Ierusalem, for it is the citie of the great King, &amp;c.</hi> Here our Sauiour Christ commeth particularly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid swearing in foure seuerall kinds of oaths vsed among the Iewes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he includeth all indirect oathes by the creatures: and withall obserue, that he addeth seuerall reasons in prohibiting these seuerall kinds of indirect oathes; as <hi>that a man must not sweare by heauen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the throne of God, &amp;c.</hi> Now as I take it, Christ doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly forbid swearing by the creatures in this place: for his intent is to forbid ordinarie swearing in common speach, whether it be by God, or by the creatures; which here he nameth, because the Iewes counted them but light oathes.

                  <hi>Whether it be lawfull at any time to sweare by the creatures.</hi> Sundrie Papists, and those of the best account both for learning and deuotion, make two kinde of oathes, in swearing by the creatures: First, when a man sweares by the creature, and puts it in the place of God, making it a Iudge and witnesse to his conscience of the truth of the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he sweareth: and this doe all condemne as wicked and vnlawfull, both Protestants and Papists. Secondly, when the creature is named, but yet the oath is directed to God in the minde of the swearer, vnder the name of the creature, as the creature is in relation to God a signe of his presence: and this kind of swearing is taken for lawfull, not onely of all Papists, but of many Protestant Diuines which be of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in our age. Yet with reuerence to them all, I see no reason in the word of God, to warrant this kind of swearing by the creature, with direction to God in the minde of him that sweareth. Indeede a man may name the creature in his oath (as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>I call God to record to my conscience</hi>) and yet sweare by God: for it is one thing to name the creature in swearing, and an other thing to sweare by the creature.</p>
               <p>Reasons against this forme of swearing by the creatures, are these.<note place="margin">Reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by the creatures.</note> First, an oath is part of Gods worship, as hath before beene shewed: now euery part of Gods worship must be referred to God directly; so we pray and giue thankes vnto God directly, and not in the creature, and so we ought to sweare; but in indirect swearing by the creatures, the oath is directly referred to the creature, and indirectly vnto God, namely in the creature; which is not lawfull. Secondly, a man must

                  <hi>sweare</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 6. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>by him that is greater then himselfe,</hi> and therefore <note n="b" place="margin">v 13.</note> 
                  <hi>God sware by himselfe because there was no greater to sweare by;</hi> where it seemeth, the holy Ghost takes it for graunted, that there is no lawfull swearing by the creatures; because they are not greater then man, and so there must be but one onely direct kind of swearing, by God himselfe. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Deut. 6. 13. <hi>Thou shalt sweare by my name:</hi> there it seemeth he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth<note place="margin">3</note> such a forme of swearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein the name of God in some plaine manner is expressed; but in indirect oathes, an other besides him that sweareth, cannot tell whether he sweare by God or not, because the oath is by the creature, and directed to God onely in the minde of him that sweareth. Fourthly, Math. 13. 16. <hi>He that sweareth by the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>Temple, sweareth by God:</hi> whence I gather, that an indirect oath is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, because it is sufficient that a man sweare by God onely, and not by the creature also.</p>
               <p>By these reasons I haue beene mooued to dislike of indirect oathes: now let vs see what is said in the behalfe of them. First, it is saide, that <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 42. 16</note> 
                  <hi>Ioseph</hi> a man commended for his faith, <hi>sware by the life of Pharaoh:</hi> therefore men may sweare by the creatures. <hi>Ans.</hi> It may be well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; not to be an oath, but an asseueration to this effect, <hi>as surely as Pharaoh liueth:</hi> but say it is an oath, yet this fact prooueth not the lawfulnes of this kind of swearing: for no man is so good, but he may be tainted with the impieties of the place wherein he liueth, especially beeing so wicked a place as Pharaohs court was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14013:85"/>
the Lord, Isa. 1. 2. but when a man sweareth by a thing, the same is made a witnes to his conscience, which no creature can be.</p>

                  <hi>Reason IV.</hi> Paul (say they) sware by <note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>their reioycing,</hi> which is a gift of God. <hi>Ans.</hi> Those words, are not an oath, but an obtestation, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the constancie which he shewed in his ministerie, and they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the confession of their faith: now a testimonie may be drawne from a creature, as we shewed before. But (say they) the word there v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, is a note of an oath. <hi>Ans.</hi> Not alwaies: for sometime it betokens an asseueration, as in other authors might be shewed: so that I take it, there ought not to be any indirect oathes wherein Gods name is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and the creature sworne by made a pledge of Gods presence.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the reasons, for which Christ forbids these indirect oaths: the summe of them in generall is this, <hi>because Gods name, which must not be taken in vaine, is set in euery one of his creatures, euen in the least haire of a mans head,</hi> (for therein a man may see the wisdome and power of God) <hi>therefore we may not sweare in our common talke, no not by the least creature that God hath made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we learne sundrie instructions. 1. That it is not lawfull to<note place="margin">Instructions.</note>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> sweare by <hi>faith, troth, bread, drinke,</hi> and such like: for faith (to insist in<note place="margin">Swearing by faith, troth, &amp;c. vnlawful.</note> one) is a gift of God, which beareth Gods name in it: for the matter of our faith is Christ, so as when we sweare by it, we sweare by Christ, whose name we may not take in vaine, and therefore may not sweare at all by any such oathes. Againe, God hath set his name on euery creature, he hath imprinted in them the signes of his power, wisdome, iustice, and mercie: Rom. 1. 20. <hi>The inuisible things of God are seene by his workes:</hi> and, Act. 14. 17. <hi>Raine from heauen, and fruitfull season, were witnesses vnto the Gentiles of Gods goodnes vnto them:</hi> which serueth first to condemne the world of great ingratitude: for we haue set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, we daily tast and handle the good creatures of God; yet who beholds in them his wisdome, mercie, and goodnes, that thereby he might take occasion to praise his name? for men are like to bruit beasts, who vse the benefit of the creatures, but yet neuer think on God the creator; and like vnto the swine, who eateth vp the mast, but neuer looketh vp to the tree from whence it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth; yea, some are so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, that they denie God by their works, though not in word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this teacheth vs carefully to meditate vpon the creatures<note place="margin">2</note> of God, labouring therein to see Gods wisdome, iustice, mercy, and the<note place="margin">Meditate on Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> rest of his attributes; that hereby we may take occasion to praise his name: Psal. 139. 14. <hi>I will praise thee, for I am wonderfully and fearefully made: maruelous are thy works, and that my soule knoweth right wel:</hi> here
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14013:86"/>
the Prophet doth professe: First, that he did meditate on the creatures of God seriously; then, that his meditation made him to feare and to be astonished: and thirdly, to praise God. Psal. 92. 5, 6. <hi>Oh how glorious are thy workes?</hi> therein importing, that he did meditate thereon: <hi>but the vnwise man</hi> (saith he) <hi>knoweth it not, and a foole doth not vnderstand this:</hi> where he sheweth, that it is a great point of folly to see Gods creatures, and not to behold the wonderful power and goodnes of God in them. Psal. 145. 5. <hi>I will meditate vpon all thy wondrous workes:</hi> and, v. 10. <hi>All thy works praise thee, O Lord.</hi> His example we should follow. And whereas Gods iudgements are among vs, we must labour in them to see Gods indignation against our sinnes, and his mercy in chastening vs for our amendment, that we might not be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned with the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if euery creature carie in it some stampe of Gods name, then<note place="margin">3</note> what should the reasonable creature doe? should not men much more beare Gods image? yes verely, both in thought, will, affection, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: we must therefore seeke to repaire in vs Gods image decaied in Adam: and aboue all things take heede, we carie not about vs the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the deuill in any sinne: for if we doe, we are farre worse then the dumbe creatures.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas euery creature beares about some part of Gods i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,<note place="margin">4</note> this serues to strippe the ignorant sort of their false plea; who<note place="margin">Plea of the ignorant co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>And lastly, seeing God hath set his image in euery creature, we must<note place="margin">5</note> labour to vse them all in an holy manner; as meat, drinke, apparell, and<note place="margin">Vse the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now I come more particularly to the seuerall reasons annexed to the seuerall prohibitions. The first particular prohibition is this, <hi>Thou shalt not sweare by heauen:</hi> and the reason followeth, <hi>for it is the throne of God.</hi> This reason is to be scanned. A Throne is a chaire of estate, wherein earthly Princes vse to sit in iudgement, and shew themselues in glorie and maiestie. Now heauen is not properly a Throne, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14013:86"/>
because that God doth in heauen, and from heauen shew his glorie and maiestie vnto men. In heauen the Saints and Angels behold the vnspeakable glorie of God. And from heauen doth God shew his exceeding power, euen in spreading the heauens like a curtaine aboue the earth, in setting therein the Sunne, the moone and starres, most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious creatures; in giuing particular motions vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: by sending raine from heauen with stormes, lightnings, and thunder. Againe, he sheweth his iustice from heauen, by powring downe his iudgements thence: As the <note n="c" place="margin">2. Pet. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>flood vpon the world of the vngodly, and fire and brimstone vpon So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Gomorrah:</hi> as the Apostle saith, Rom. 1. 18. <hi>The wrath of God is reuealed from heauen, against all vngodlinesse and vnrighteousnesse of men.</hi> Againe, Gods mercie and goodnes is daily manifested from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, <hi>thence commeth euery good gift,</hi> Iam. 1. 17. yea, thence our Sauiour Christ descended for the worke of our redemption: thence also the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost descended in Christs baptisme; and the Fathers voice was heard from thence, pointing out that lambe of God which taketh away the sinnes of the world: and thence shall Christ come againe in glorie at the last day, to be glorified in his Saints: all which doe magnifie vnto vs the glorie of this Throne.</p>
               <p>Is the Throne of God in heauen &amp; not on earth? the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must we learne<note place="margin">The vse.</note> to conceiue of God, as of an heauenly King: in the chapter following we are taught to call him <hi>our heauenly Father,</hi> v. 9. and therefore when we speake or think of God, or doe worship vnto him in praier or tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, we must not conceiue of him in any carnall sort, but in an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly manner. The second commandement forbidding the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God in any similitudes, may teach vs, that we must not conceiue of God after any earthly or carnall manner. Indeede the Popish church approouing of the images of the Trinitie (as before was shewed) doe thereby teach the people to conceiue of God, as of an old man sitting in heauen, with a crowne vpon his head, because he is called <note n="d" place="margin">Dan. 7. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of daies;</hi> but all such carnall conceits of God are here forbidden.</p>
               <p>That we may then conceiue aright of God, two Rules must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.<note place="margin">How to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue aright of God.</note> First, we must not frame in our minds any image of God at all, as that he should be like vnto man, or any other creature: but we<note place="margin">1</note> must conceiue of him both in his works, as our creator, gouernour, and preseruer; and also in his properties, as most wise, most iust, holy, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and such like. Secondly, we must conceiue that God is one in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,<note place="margin">2.</note> and three in person: we must not confound the persons, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the substance, but conceiue of one God in three persons; and three persons in one and the same godhead. These two Rules beeing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14013:87"/>
well obserued, wil keepe our hearts from those vaine conceits of God, which many frame to themselues when they thinke of him in their mindes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, seeing Gods throne is in heauen, therefore <hi>our conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>must be there also:</hi> for where God is and his throne, there ought our hearts to be. Now we shall haue our conuersation in heauen by doing two things: first, by a continuall eleuation of our minds vnto heauen, morning and euening, and at all times when we haue occasion: 1. Thess. 4. 17. we are commanded <hi>to pray continually,</hi> and that we doe, so oft as in the duties of our ordinary calling, we desire in our hearts the blessing and assistance of God: for the sighs and grones of the soule, are praiers approoued before God: we must therefore lift vp our heart to God, as Dauid did, Psal. 25. 1. Secondly, we must set all our affections on God, and on heauenly things, as our loue, our ioy, and feare, yea our care must be of comming to heauen: for where can we be in a more happie place then before Gods throne in heauen, where God sets out his glorie and maiestie to his creature?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hence we may learne, to conceiue aright of the prouidence<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.</note> of God: for God sitting in his maiestie in heauen, and beeing infinite in wisdome, power, and greatnes, doth by a most carefull prouidence see, know, and gouerne all things that are done vpon the earth: this is nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly set forth vnto vs, Psal. 11. 4. <hi>The Lords throne is in heauen, his e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, his eye lids wil try the children of men:</hi> the words are very sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, importing that God from heauen doth most narrowly see into all mens dealings and affaires: which teacheth vs, when we shall be in any distresse, either in bodie, minde, goods, or friends, to behaue our selues in an holy manner, for God sees our case: and therefore first we must make our moane vnto him, and humbly intreat for that grace and mercie at his hands whereof we stand in neede. Dauid maketh this a ground of much comfort in affliction: Psal. 102. 19, 20. <hi>Out of heauen</hi> (saith he) <hi>did the Lord behold the earth, that he might heare the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the prisoner, and deliuer the children of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, this serueth to terrifie euery sinner: for the Lord sits in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen<note place="margin">A terror to sinners.</note> with a piercing eye, beholding all thy doings whatsoeuer thou art; and therefore when a man sinneth, though he may hide the same from men, yet the Lord sees him, and will reprooue him, and iudge him: let vs therefore make conscience of all sinne, and feare to not euill, either by thought, word, or deede, seeing we are euer before the Iudge that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>its vpon this throne.</p>
               <p>The second particular prohibition is, <hi>against swearing by the earth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">vers. 35.</note>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:14013:87"/>
the reason is, <hi>because it is the Lords foot-stoole.</hi> The earth is the Lords footestoole, not properly, but by resemblance; because as the footstoole is nothing in glorie to the throne, no more be those glimpses of glorie, which God shewes here on earth, comparable to that surpassing digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and glorie, wherein God manifests himselfe in heauen.</p>
               <p>Is the earth the Lords footstoole? then is he not included in heauen,<note place="margin">Instruction.</note> but is present also vpon the earth: God is not in one place alone, but<note place="margin">1</note> he is euery where at one and the same time. Here then we haue a plaine<note place="margin">Gods omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> proofe of Gods infinite greatnesse and omnipresence, in regard of his essence and godhead; for Christ compares him to a king, who is of that bignesse that he fils heauen with his glorie; and of that height, that the earth below is his footstoole, according as he saith, Ierem. 23. 24. <hi>I s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The consideration whereof teacheth vs,</p>
               <p>First, to vnderstand aright that saying of <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 17. 28. <hi>In him we</hi>

               <p>Secondly, this teacheth vs to conceiue aright of Gods holy proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <note place="margin">A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </note> to wit, that God in regard of his substance, is in euery place, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beeing, life, and moouing to all things that be, liue, and mooue, preseruing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; killing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at his pleasure, &amp; doing whosoeuer he wil.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this consideration of Gods essentiall presence, serues to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle<note place="margin">3</note> in our hearts that feare of God, which is the ground of true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<note place="margin">A ground of feare and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</note> in all estates. If God shall laie vpon vs any affliction, either in body or minde, friends, or goods, let vs then consider the essentiall presence of God, laying that crosse vpon vs, and it will strike into our hearts a reuerent feare of God, and mooue vs to patience, meeknes; &amp; contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yea, it wil cause vs to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble our selues vnder his hand: for the cause why men flie not to God, by humbling themselues in their afflictions, is because they thinke God is farre off. Again, if in prosperity we consider Gods essentiall presence with vs, giuing vnto vs all good things, it will make vs thankefull; so much we doe vnto man, when we bee in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence that hath bestowed a fauour vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, we readily addresse our selues to thankefulnes: and shall we not doe so to God? In a word, this holy meditation of Gods presence, will make vs to humble our selues vnto God, and to rest contented with his good will and pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:14013:88"/>Fourthly, if God in essence be present euery where, then it is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to make choice of places in regard of holinesse, for the worshippe<note place="margin">4</note> of God, for one place is no more neare to God then an other: which<note place="margin">No difference of place for worship in regard of holines.</note> confutes the vanitie of Popish Pilgrimages to cheife places for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worship: and it checketh also the blind opinion of many among vs, who thinke the Church is the onely place of praier and other parts of Gods worship; whereupon they neuer regard to pray in their priuate houses. But God is in thee, and in thy house, as well as in the Church, and therefore thou maist lift vp pure hands vnto God in all places, and must pray at home, as wel as in the Church (alwaies prouided that thou honour Gods ordinance in the publike assemblies.)</p>
               <p>Fiftly, if God be euery where, then we must labour to haue hearts<note place="margin">5</note> affected with this perswasion, that wheresoeuer we be, God is present<note place="margin">Thinke on Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</note> with vs. This lesson God taught <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17. 1. <hi>Walke before me and be vpright:</hi> and this <hi>Enoch</hi> had learned long before, Gen. 5. 24. and therfore <hi>was reported of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he had pleased God,</hi> Heb. 11. 5. now where this perswasion taketh place, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Oh that this thought did run in our minds in the time of temptation, then by Gods grace we should feare to sinne, and endeauour to walke before God in all holy obedience, as his seruants haue done. Many are shamelesse in sinning, which comes from the want of this perswasion of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which should strike this feare into their hearts, as we may see, Gen. 20, 11. Psal. 10. 3. 4. 11. and 94. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, this knowledge of Gods presence serues, to quiet and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then<note place="margin">6</note> their hearts that are troubled with feare of the deuill: thus they<note place="margin">A helpe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the feare of the deuill.</note> must reason with themselues; the Lord my God is present with me, both in power and essence, he can bind Satan, and he will keepe those that trust in him from the snare of the hunter, wherefore then should I be afraid?</p>
               <p>Secondly, is the earth the Lords footestoole? then while we liue here<note place="margin">II. Instruct. A ground of an humble and penitent life.</note> vpon the earth, <hi>our liues ought to be a daily practise of humiliation and repentance:</hi> when good subiects come before the chaire of estate, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the Prince be present, then they bowe their bodies, to testifie their loyall subiection vnto their Prince; shall man doe this to man, and shall not we, whose dwelling is at the Lords footstoole, much more humble our selues?

But if we walke proudly before him in the practise of sinne, being at his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole, let vs know that <hi>he hath feete like vnto fierie brasse burning in a furnance,</hi> Revel. 1. 15. vnder which he will trample all his enemies, and make them his footestoole. Psal. 110. 1.</p>
               <p>The third inhibition, is <hi>from swearing by Ierusalem:</hi> the reason is, <hi>for</hi>

Now here obserue, that at this time <hi>the Temple was made a denne of theeues,</hi> and many of the Scribes and Iewish tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers were notable Heretikes, erring against the foundation of religion; yea, the people were rebellious and wicked, as Steuen plainly telleth them, Act. 7. 51. and yet Christ here calleth Ierusalem the citie of God; and so the people, Gods people; though they for their parts had forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<note place="margin">When a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cease to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The reason hereof is this, because neither the Iewes, nor any other doe then presently cease to be the people of God, when they by sinne cut off themselues from God and forsake him; but then doe they cease to be Gods people, when God forsakes them and cuts them off from him: like as in the state of matrimonie, when either man or wise commits adulterie, that partie breakes the bond of mariage, and as much as in him lieth cuts off himselfe from the other: but yet while the partie innocent retaines matrimoniall affection towards the partie offending, and giues not a Bill of diuorce, they still remaine man and wife. This appeares in these Iewes, whome neither Christ himselfe did then forsake, when they reiected him (for he praied for them when they crucified him) nor yet his Apostles, till they saw in them manifest signes of incurable obstinacie. Act. 13. 46.</p>
               <p>This point must be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, as seruing to rectifie our iudgements touching the state of a Church or people, that haue many grieuous wants and faults among them, both for doctrine and manners: for though a people doe what in them lieth, to cut off themselues from

God, yet till God cut them off from him, they cease not to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and therefore we must not iudge them to be no people of God, till we see that God hath cut them off.

This is graunted of those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this forme of swearing: but a man may not lay down any creature, as a pawne before God, and appoint the Lord to punish him therein; because the creature is not in mans power, euery treature is the Lords, and we may not appoint him how he shall punish vs for our periurie. If it be saide, that the oath made by the creature, is a binding oath, which must be kept, for Christ calls it an oath, Math. 23. 20. and therfore a man may lawfully vse it. <hi>Ans.</hi> The reason is not good: for that oath bindeth and must be kept, because indirectly a man sweares by God, and so in substance it is an oath; but yet the manner of it is vnlawfull, because an oath, beeing part of Gods worship, ought to be directed vnto God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately: when an Infidel sweares by his false gods (as <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 31. 53</note>

Thirdly, the wearing of long haire is another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse thereof, in the yonger sort; it began indeed among the aged, but now it is become a tricke of youth, and is the badge of a proud heart: for how can they say they glorifie God therby, when the Apostle saith, <hi>It is a shame for a man to haue long haire.</hi> Well, sith God hath set his name therein, we must beware how we make it an instrument of sinne. If it be said, to weare long haire is our English fashion: I answer, It is not our auncient English fashion, but indeede it is a forraine tricke, and therefore as vnlawfull as forraine attire, which God condemnes, Zeph. 1. 8. Our auncient English fashion (except it were among the aged) was to weare short haire; and in euery countrie, the most auncient and graue fashions ought to be followed; not onely in the vse of the haire, but in apparel also, that therein men may shew the grace of their heart: for mans attire is Gods ordinance, borrowed from his creatures, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath set his name, and therefore we ought not to deface it, with the stampe of pride and vanitie; but rather shew therein, that libertie and modestie, that may honour Gods name.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>This verse containeth two parts: A rule for the framing of our<note place="margin">A rule of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> speech in common talke; and a Reason thereof. The Rule is this, <hi>Let your communication be yea yea, nay nay:</hi> where he sheweth, that though men may not sweare in their common talke, yet they may vse a simple affirmation, or negation to the thing they speake. This Rule is diuersly expounded; some take it to respect the truth of our speech, as if Christ had said; Whatsoeuer you affirme in speaking, affirme it truely, &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer you denie in speaking, denie it truely. But by the circumstances of the place, it rather seemeth, that Christ here propoundeth a Rule
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14013:90"/>
for the very forme of our common talke, to this effect; If you would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme any thing in your ordinarie speech, let your affirmation bee yea; and if you would denie any thing, let your negation or deniall bee no, and in your ordinarie communication say no more, though you bee vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereto. So must we take <hi>communication,</hi> for ordinarie common talke; for in some cases it is lawfull to sweare, as hath beene shewed.</p>
               <p>First, by this Rule is condemned the adding of inuocations to our<note place="margin">Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

In some cases, and at some times these may be vsed; but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie and familiar communication, these inuocations are abuses of Gods name. An earthly Prince will not suffer his name to bee tossed in euery mans mouth; &amp; much lesse will the Lord, who herein is iealous of his glorie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here note, that asseuerations may not be ordinarily vsed in<note place="margin">2. Asseuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> common talke; as <hi>verely yea, no in truth,</hi> and such like; these are more then simple affirmations and negations, &amp; therefore in common speech may not be vsed. Our Sauiour Christ, the patterne of pietie, neuer vsed them, but in waightie matters, which were carefully to be remembred; and then he said, <hi>Verely verely, I say vnto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, here is condemned the vse of <hi>execrations,</hi> when we affirme<note place="margin">3. Execratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</note> or denie a thing in our common talke; as to say, <hi>yea, or else I would I were dead,</hi> and such like.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>ordinarie swearing</hi> is here againe plainely forbidden, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">4. Ordinarie swearing.</note> it be by the name of God, or by other creatures. Some to auoide swearing (as they thinke) in their common talke, for yea, and nay, vse to say, <hi>by yea, &amp; by no:</hi> but herein they offend, for these phrases are oathes, as well as <hi>by faith,</hi> and <hi>by troth:</hi> and in a word, all speeches in common talke, added to confirme our speech, aboue <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> are abuses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Rule of Christ, for ordinary communication.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For whatsoeuer is more then these,</hi> that is, whatsoeuer exceedeth a simple affirmation or negation in common speech, <hi>comes of euill:</hi> that is, of the euill one, the diuel: so Chap. 6. 13. <hi>Deliuer vs from euill:</hi> that is, from the deuil, that euil one. This is a most excellent reason, to mooue men to put in practise this Rule; for all abuses of oathes, asseuerations, inuocations, and deprecations, in common speech, are abuses of Gods name, and they come from the diuel, he is the schoolemaster that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men to vse them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether doth euery temptation come from the diuel? <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi> Euery temptation to euill, is of the diuell; so much this Text prooueth: and Math. 4. 3. the <hi>diuel</hi> is called the <hi>Tempter,</hi> because hee
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14013:91"/>
giues himselfe to tempt all men, by all meanes, at all times. True it is, that some temptations come from our corrupt hearts, but yet the diuel hath an hand in them to further them. <hi>Quest.</hi> How can this be, seeing the diuel is but one, and can be but in one place at once? <hi>Answ.</hi> There is indeede one head of wicked spirits, called <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and <hi>the diuell,</hi> who hath innumerable wicked angels ministering vnto him, as may be gathered, Matth. 25. 41. where <hi>hell is said to be prepared for the diuell &amp; his angels:</hi> and it is not vnlike, but they are moe in number, then all the men vpon the earth; for where can any man bee in this life, but some wicked spirit will be ready to tempt him vnto sinne? doth he not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the filthie person to vncleannesse, and euery man to such sinne, whereunto he is most inclined? And say the euill motions arise from our owne corruption, yet the diuels helpe is neuer wanting to bring it into action.</p>
               <p>This serueth to confute the follie of our common people, who neuer<note place="margin">Vse 1. Devils oft about vs though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene.</note> feare the diuell, but when hee appeares vnto them in some shape; they thinke he is neuer neere them, but when they see him: but they must know, that the diuel by his wicked spirits, is alwaies about them day &amp; night, and in all places; and therefore they must learne more to feare his temptations, then his appearance; for that is not so terrible to the sight, as his temptations are hurtfull to the soule. Secondly, this presence of<note place="margin">2</note> the diuell with euery man, to tempt him at all times, must teach vs, to keepe straite watch against all sinne, and the occasions thereof: we are easily perswaded to watch against thieues that would depriue vs of our temporall goods, or naturall life; now the diuel our spirituall enemie, is daily about vs, to seeke the ruine of our soules, and therefore wee must alwaies haue an eie to his temptations. And indeede, if wee would well consider his presence, and malice against vs, it would make vs watch &amp; feare, lest he should take vs in his snare.</p>
               <p>But why is the diuel called the euill one? <hi>Answ.</hi> By a kinde of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie<note place="margin">Why Satan is called the euill one.</note> of speech; for these reasons: First, because he is euill in excesse, his sinnes are in the highest degree; for it is like, his first sinne was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly<note place="margin">1</note> against the holy ghost, which may be one reason, why God chose not angels, but men, on whom hee would shew mercie after their fall. Secondly, because he commits euil and wickednesse continually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note place="margin">2</note> ceasing, and therefore is compared to an <note n="a" place="margin">1.

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">3</note> because he practiseth sinnes of all sorts and degrees, in himselfe, and by his Ministers; for the sinnes that be in the world, be all from him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther originally, or by furtherance. The vilest man that is, doth abstaine from sinne sometime, yea by nature he hateth some sinnes: the proud and prodigall man cannot abide couetousnesse; and the drunkard may abhorre idolatrie; but the deuil continually practiseth sinnes of all sorts, and therefore is iustly called the <hi>euill one.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Why we are called the children of wrath and of the deuill.</note> 
                  <hi>and of the deuil by nature:</hi> namely, because by nature we carrie in vs, &amp; about vs, as liuely an image of the deuil in sin, as any childe doth of his naturall father. For first, in our corruption we are guiltie of <hi>Adams</hi> sin, in eating the forbidden fruit. Secondly, our nature is stained with origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne, which is (not a practise) but a proneness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> vnto all manner of mischiefe and wickednesse, that is committed in the world. Seest thou a man kill his father, or mother, or betray his Master, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did to Christ, though it may be, thou abhorrest such sinnes, yet doubtlesse the seed thereof is in thee; yea, if God in mercie did not keep vs from it, our corruption would carrie vs to the blasphemie against the Spirit. And thirdly, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this naturall corruption, do arise innumerable euil thoughts, words, and deeds, in the course of our liues, in all which we beare the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the deuil, till God bring vs to repentance; and therefore iustly may we be called the children of wrath, and of the deuill by nature, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the same corruption in vs, that is in the deuil, though not in the same degree and manner.</p>
               <p>Hence we learne, First, to be ashamed and confounded in our selues,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> yea to hang downe our heads; for what cause hath hee to be puffed vp with selfe loue, that is by nature in himselfe like to the deuil. Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> this teacheth vs aboue all things, to labour to haue the image of God renued in vs, in righteousnesse, and true holinesse, which was lost in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> that so the deuils image, in sinne and wickednes, may bee defaced. Thirdly, this must cause vs to make no account of any worldly thing,<note place="margin">3</note> that pertaineth to vs; but all our ioy must be in Christ, hee must bee our wisedome, and righteousnesse, our riches, and all things else, because by him we are renued, from the deuils likenesse to the image of God.</p>

But the Iewish Teachers expounded this law of priuate reuenge; as though God had said to euery priuate man, If thy neighbour plucke out thine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the Iewish people were mightily giuen to reuenge, by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall disposition, as may appeare by the law of the Cities of Refuge, and by mentioning of the Reuenger of blood: which plainely imports, that the Iewes would haue blood againe of him that shed blood, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they met with him. Now the Iewish Teachers framed their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the common disposition and behauiour of their people, and so falsified the truth of God, as many times it fals out, that the common

               <p>In the person of these Iewish Teachers, we may see the policie of the<note place="margin">Vs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 1. Tempering religion to mens humors a Satanicall policie.</note> deuil, whose intent is, and hath beene in all ages, to ouerturne religion: and to this end, he endeauours to cause men to temper religion to their naturall disposition and common opinion in outward manners; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ouerturneth both religion and people. This appeares in other points among the Iewes, as well as in this case of reuenge: They were a people giuen much to couetousnesse, as may appeare by the law of toleration for taking vsury of strangers, and by their hardnesse of heart, so much reprooued by all the Prophets. Now the deuill perceiuing this to be their naturall disposition, makes Gods doctrine of saluation, seeme to them a doctrine of earthly benefits; for hee caused them to dreame of an earthly king, for their Messias, and of an earthly flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing kingdome vnder him. Thus also hath the deuill dealt with other heathen people: The Romans in Italie haue beene euer grosly addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to superstition, sorcerie, and idolatrie, as heathen writers doe testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. Now though God vouchsafed them his true Religion in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, yet the deuil perceiuing their naturall disposition to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, hath so tempered the truth of God among them, with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and superstitious religion, that now they abound as much in ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie and superstition, as euer they did when they were heathen. The like malitious practise doth the deuil shew among the Protestants, where the Gospel is truely preached; for though hee cannot (as hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires) corrupt religion in the mouthes of the Teachers, yet hee weakens<note place="margin">Formall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</note> it greatly in the hearts of men, both Teachers and hearers, causing them so farre forth onely to receiue it, as it is sutable to their nature and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition: but where it crosseth their humours, there to leaue it. Is not this euident? for he that embraceth the truth with his heart, will frame his life according to it; but generally the entertainment of religion is onely formall: for though men professe it, yet they liue in their sinnes, they make it to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whereby we must be aduertised, to take heed of this policie of the deuil, and whereas he labours to transforme reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to mens dispositions, wee on the contrarie, must endeauour in all things to transforme our selues into religion, obeying <hi>that forme of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whereunto we are deliuered,</hi> Rom. 6. 17.</p>

desire to requite like for like in priuate cases, when wee are iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
               <p>Now that wee may see more into this sinne, we are to knowe that priuate reuenge is two-folde, Inward, and Outward; <hi>Inward priuate</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Kinds of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat reuenge. 1. Iaward.</note> 
                  <hi>reuenge,</hi> is a purpose in the heart, to doe a man an euill turne; this is commonly called the bearing of a grudge, and it is here condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Outward reuenge,</hi> is when the spite of the heart comes into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">2.

Hereto also we may referre an ordinarie bad practise of some Magistrates and Superiours, though (it may be) few thinke it to be a fault; to wit, when the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate doth aggrauate the punishment vpon a malefactour, for some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate grudge he beareth to him, for then hee vseth priuate reuenge: as also when Parents or Masters correct their seruants and children in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and rage; for though they be publike persons in this regard, yet to giue correction in a chollericke moode, is to ease the heart by way of reuenge.</p>
               <p>Here then wee must learne, that wee may not requite euill for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> in thought, word, or deede, to those that doe vs wrong, any manner of way, but must rather suffer iniurie, and referre the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge vnto God that iudgeth righteously. And because this dutie goes against our naturall disposition, I will vse some reasons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade<note place="margin">Reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst priuat reuenge.</note> our hearts to yeeld vnto it: First, the Apostle teacheth out of Deuteronomie, that <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 12. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>vengeance is the Lords:</hi> if then we shal priuately<note place="margin">1</note> reuenge our selues, we rob God of his right, &amp; so sinne against the first commandement. Secondly, in the next words he addeth, <hi>and I will repay saith the Lord:</hi> where God takes vpon him to be our debter in the case<note place="margin">2</note> of iniustice, and therefore when we are wronged, wee must not be rash to reuenge our selues, but must waite with patience vpon the Lord, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe our iniurie at his feet; for he will repaie in due time, to them that haue wronged vs. Thirdly, consider the examples of worthie men<note place="margin">3</note> in this case; for our Sauiour Christ neuer sought reuenge, but bare <hi>wrong patiently, committing all to him that iudgeth righteously, leauing vs an example to doe likewise,</hi> 1. Peter, 2. 10. Yea, when hee was cruelly and vniustly crucified, he <hi>praied for his persecutors,</hi>

                  <hi>his heart smote him, for cutting off the lap of his coate:</hi> so farre was he from seeking reuenge. Fourthly, in the fift petition wee pray, <hi>Forgiue vs our sinnes, as we forgiue our trespasses:</hi> but if wee carrie grudging in our<note place="margin">4</note> hearts, we praie God not to forgiue vs, but to condemne vs; for we will not forgiue, but be reuenged on them that offend vs. Now this is a most fearefull case, that a man should pray for vengeance vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Fiftly, it is not meete in common reason, that the same partie<note place="margin">5</note> should be the accuser and the Iudge; and yet, if a man might reuenge himselfe, this should be so: and therefore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f wee would be Christs Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, we must arme our selues with patience, in suffering wrong, and referre reuenge to God that iudgeth righteously.</p>
               <p>Yet some will say, If we alwaies put vp and suffer wrong, wee shall neuer bee in quiet, but still be abused. <hi>Answer.</hi> Though in our own person we may not reuenge our selues, yet wee may craue the helpe of the Magistrate, either for the preuenting, or for the punishment of wrong done vnto vs; for the Magistrate is Gods Liuetenant, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the oppressed, and to execute vengeance on malefactours: thus did <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 23. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul send to the chiefe Captaine,</hi> to preuent a conspiracie that the Iewes intended against him, and <note n="o" place="margin">Act. 25. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>appealed to Caesar,</hi> to auoyde the danger of the Iewes at Ierusalem: and yet when wrong is done vnto vs, wee must beare it patiently, without seeking priuate Reuenge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the wrong were doubled or trebled vpon vs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, our Sauiour Christ here calling the wrong doer <hi>an euill</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wrong do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of an euil man.</note>

                  <hi>Disciples,</hi> for seeking to execute this extraordinarie reuenge vpon the Samaritans; and therefore when we haue a conceit hereof in our selues, wee may iustly suspect what spirit it is that mooueth vs. <hi>Ordinarie reuenge,</hi> is<note place="margin">Ordinarie.</note> that which men ordinarily put in execution, in the Church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, according to Gods will, beeing thereto called by God: &amp; it is twofold, Lesser, or Soueraigne. <hi>Lesser reuenge,</hi> is the inflicting of lawfull correction vpon offenders, in word or deede, not reaching to the case of life and death; this kinde of reuenge is committed to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ouer their children, and masters ouer their seruants, to schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters ouer their schollers, and Tutors ouer their pupils. <hi>Soueraigne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,</hi> is that whereby the Magistrate may lawfully punish men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their offences, in bodie, goods, or life it selfe; this I call soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, not simply, but because it is the highest that agreeth vnto man, beeing of life and death. This reuenge is executed partly in peace, and partly in warre; In peace, by the confiscation of goods, by imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, banishment, and (if the offence deserue it) by taking away of life, for the good of the state publike. In time of warre, when as (not for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry case) but for the iust repelling or requiting of wrongs, warre is made against the enemies of the state. Now though it belong to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate only, to execute publike reuenge, yet euery priuate man may haue the benefit hereof, &amp; may vpon iust causes vse the Magistrates helpe for his reuenge: as first, if his cause be waightie wherein he is wronged: 2. if<note place="margin">Wherein we may seek to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.</note> it be necessarie: &amp; 3. if it be for his iust defence, for the common good, &amp; the punishment of the offender; and the Magistrate in these cases may lawfully, nay he must put in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, reuenge for priuate men: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, neither church, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, nor any society could stand.</p>
               <p>Thus we see what iust reuenge is; now considering it is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, this must admonish vs to eschewe all outward offences, that we may so escape the iust reuenge of the Magistrate; and also to make conscience of all sinnes, that so we may auoide the vengeance of God. And thus much of the generall rule.</p>
               <p>Now because this generall rule might seeme to bee hard, therefore Christ explaines the same in 3. particular examples, wherein hee shewes<note place="margin">1. Example of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14013:95"/>
for vsually men strike with the right hand, which directly should light on the left cheeke, and if the right cheeke be smitten it is commonly with the backe of the hand, which is a blow with contempt: now, say a man is abused in his bodie, euen by blows of contempt, yet he must not reuenge himselfe, but <hi>turne the other cheek also:]</hi> which words must not simply be vnderstood, but by comparison, thus; <hi>rather then thou reuenge thy selfe, and resist the euill one that hath stricken thee on the right cheek, turne to him the other:</hi> for this particular example comprehendeth in it the generall rule of not resisting euill by priuate reuenge: and that it may not simply be taken may herby appeare: first, because Christ should then command the sufferer, to giue further occasion of wrong doing to the euill man, which is not his meaning: againe, Christ himselfe who gaue this rule, did not so practise it, when he was smitten by the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of the high Priest. Ioh. 18. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>First, by this example Christ condemneth the common practise of<note place="margin">The vse. Chalenging the field vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</note> chalenging the field for personall wrongs, and of taking that chalenge when it is giuen; as also the fighting the single combate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Christ teacheth, that a man must take many wrongs, before he seek to reuenge himselfe by any such course: if it be saide, it is a disgrace to refuse a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge; we must know, that true grace and credit standeth in yeilding obedience vnto God, and not in sinning against him for the sauing of our reputation with men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the common practise of <hi>fighting</hi> and <hi>quarelling,</hi> is here<note place="margin">Fighting, &amp; quarelling.</note> condemned: many hold it vnlawfull to giue the first blow, but yet if an other strike them, then they thinke they may strike againe: but this Christ here condemnes, and his owne example is against it: for when he was smitten before the high Priest, he <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>smote not againe:</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 23. 3.</note> was smitten, he onely defended himselfe in word, but smote not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And Christ checketh <hi>Peter</hi> for taking the sword, to resist the officers that apprehended him in the garden; indeede he permitted his Disciples to weare weapons, yet not for reuenge, but for their iust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense onely.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ here condemneth their opinion, that make it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of praise for a man that he will not turne his face from any man. It is indeede the praise of the Magistrate to be couragious, and not to feare the face of man. But yet a priuate man, be he neuer so strong, ought to turne his face from the aduersarie, vnlesse it be in the case of his necessarie defence: for a man must suffer double or treble wrong, rather then defend himselfe. If any shall thinke this to be a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, still he must remember, that our chiefest honour consisteth
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14013:96"/>
in approouing our selues vnto God, by obeying his wil, who here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth vs rather to turne our backs and flie, then to resist in our own reuenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question.</hi> But what if a man be assaulted, either on the high way, or<note place="margin">What a man may doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> in his house, may he not then resist to saue his life, and his goods? <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi> In such a case he may doe two things: First, hee may to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of his power, defend himselfe and his goods; for this Text spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not against defence, but against reuenge. Secondly, if a man can see no way to escape, either by flight, or calling for helpe of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, then he is to stand so farre in his owne defence, that hee is rather to kill then be killed; for in this case, God puts the sword into a priuate mans hand, and makes him a Magistrate, to execute reuenge vpon his aduersarie: and thus might a man lawfully <hi>kill a thiefe in the night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the guilt of blood,</hi> Exod. 22. 2.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, hence obserue, that no priuate man may lawfully kill a<note place="margin">Priuate mens dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants.</note> Prince, though he should tyrannically destroy both Church &amp; commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth; for this Rule must square the actions of priuate men, they must rather beare double and treble wrong, then by way of priuate reuenge resist the euill one. The reuenge of euill Magistrates must be referred to God, to whom it iustly belongeth, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, 1. Sam. 26. 10. and Psal. 43. 1.</p>
               <p>Lastly, in this first example of particular iniurie, we may see one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie<note place="margin">Quarrelling notes an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil person.</note> of an euill man; namely, to be giuen to fighting, quarrelling, and contending: such a one may thinke himselfe a goodly fellow, but yet he that vseth his strength to ordinarie quarrelling, and wrong doing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is here made an euill one, by the sentence of our Sauiour Christ: and therefore such as excell in strength, if they would be approoued of Christ, must make conscience of quarrelling and fighting, and offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to no man.</p>

               <p>Here Christ propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds the second example of wrong done vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">2. Example of suffering wrong.</note> wherein he forbids the party wronged to reuenge himselfe; to wit, being iniuried in his goods, either priuatly, or vnder colour of law, for both these may here well be vnderstood. By <hi>coate</hi> properly is meant <hi>the inner garment;</hi> &amp; by <hi>cloake</hi> the outward: but here the words are not so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but indifferently for any diuers garments; for in <hi>Luke</hi> they are thus set downe, <hi>And him that would take away thy cloake, forbid not to take thy coate also.</hi> And Christs meaning is this; If one vniustly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with thee, to take from thee one garment, let him haue another al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14013:96"/>
whether coate, or cloake, or such like thing. And yet this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is not simply, but comparatiuely to bee vnderstood; to wit, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a man should seeke priuate reuenge, he must not onely suffer the losse of one garment, but of moe, and so of other temporall goods.</p>
               <p>Out of this example, wee may learne these Instructions; First, that<note place="margin">1</note> Christians must be quiet and patient, and not giuen to contend, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Contenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Cor. 3. 3. and chargeth the Philippians, <hi>that nothing be done among them by contention,</hi> Philip. 2. 3. which is a notable rule; for though men be at difference, yet there ought to be no contentions either in word or deede, all things ought to bee done in loue, and so strife shall cease: that wrangling spirit is not of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men striue to put downe others in words: when a man hath spoken his minde, hee ought to cease, for multiplying of words is against Christian ciuilitie, and euery where condemned in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here is condemned, not the lawfull, but the common vse<note place="margin">2</note> of lawing, whereby men for euery trisle will trouble the Courts. This<note place="margin">Common vs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of lawing nought.</note> argues a contentious spirit, and a minde that is giuen to reuenge, which beseemeth not Christians, as <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, 1. Cor. 6. 1, 2, 5, 6. and yet it is the common practise in these our daies, from whence come such vnchristian speeches as this, <hi>I will be reuenged on him, or else I will spend all that I haue.</hi> But the truth is, that rather then a man should goe thus to law, he ought to suffer a double and treble losse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here Christ teacheth, that in all our dealings we must haue<note place="margin">3</note> a principall regard vnto charitie, and rather seeke to maintaine this grace in our hearts, then our outward worldly goods.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we are here taught to preferre our owne peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">4</note> before our temporall goods; yet not simply, but in this respect,<note place="margin">How wee ought to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme of peace.</note> that hereby wee may haue fitter time with quietnesse to imploy our selues in the worship of God, and to edifie our selues in holinesse and pietie: this dutie concerneth them especially, which haue much dealing in the world, and thereupon many occasions of anger and vexation, for such vnruly passions make a man vnfit for Gods seruice; it is the meeke and lowly heart that receiues the blessing from the Lord, Matthew, 11. 29.</p>

Secondly, it often falls out, that Land-lords, and men of wealth, oppresse the poore, by inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of common lands, and such like; now hereupon the poorer sort vse to raile against them, and to curse them: but this practise is also here forbidden by our Sauiour Christ; for albeit the rich men sin grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously in oppressing the poore, yet the poore must suffer rather a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or treble wrong, then by cursing speeches seeke priuate reuenge.</p>
               <p>Againe, in this example we may see a third kinde of wicked men; to<note place="margin">A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14013:97"/>
viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, if they look to escape to be iudged as euil ones at the last day.</p>
               <p>Thus we see the three particular examples of wrongs, wherein men<note place="margin">Christianity a state of suffering.</note> may not reuenge themselues priuately. Now from them all ioyntly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, we may note two points; First, that the calling of a Christian is a state of suffering, 1. Pet. 2. 20, 21. <hi>If ye take it patiently when yee suffer wrong for well-doing, this is praise worthie, for yee are hereunto called:</hi> &amp; therefore if wee would declare our selues to bee the true members of Christ, wee must shew forth patience in bearing wrongs, without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reuenge. This was Christs lesson to his Disciples, for hauing tolde them of afflictions to come, hee bids them to <note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 11. 19</note> 
                  <hi>possesse their soules with patience:</hi> so when the spirit of God sets downe the afflictions of the Church, he addes this as an <hi>Item,</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 10. &amp; 14. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>here is the patience of the Saints.</hi> We therefore must labour to repell all malice and rancour when we suffer vniustly, remembring this rule of Christ, that rather then wee offer pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate reuenge, we must suffer the doubling and trebling of the wrong. It is true indeed, this is hard for flesh and blood to doe; but if wee bee but flesh, that is, naturall men, why doe we professe our selues to be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? for <hi>he that hath not the spirit of God, is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. And if we be in the spirit, wee must obey the motions thereof, and learne of Christ who was meeke and humble, and following him wee shall finde rest for our soules.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when Christ sets downe these three examples of suffering wrong, he applies himselfe to the present outward estate of the Iewes, which was this; For one man to suffer wrong of another in his bodie, and in his goods, and yet to rest contented, without reliefe or amends: Now the cause of this their miserable condition, was their seruitude to the Romane Emperour, who a little before Christs comming, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued the Scepter from Iuda, &amp; made Iuda a Prouince tributarie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rome, so as they were ruled not by a Prince of their owne, but by a forraine enemies Deputies.</p>
               <p>In this estate we may see the miserable condition of any people that<note place="margin">Forraine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment a grieuous thing.</note> are in bondage to a forraine enemie, their liues are euery way misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for besides their personall bondage, they are constrained to suffer losses and wrongs, in goods, and in their names, without all remedie or reliefe. The consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereof must teach vs, First, to be heartily tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto God, for the happie outward peace, which with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Gods grace we now enioy vnder our dread Soueraigne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free from subiection vnto any forraine power. Secondly, to praie earnestly vnto the Lord, for the good estate, life, and health of our Prince, by whom vnder God, we enioy such ioy and prosperitie;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:14013:98"/>
as also for the continuance of Gods holy hand of protection to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the whole land against all forraine power whatsoeuer. Thirdly, to repent vnfainedly of all our sinnes, that so we turning vnto God from them, he may continue vnto vs those happy daies of peace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we haue freedome from subiection to forraine tyrannie: for our sinnes are our greatest foes, they lay open the ports of our lands, and the gates of our cities to the spoyling enemie; they will put downe our strong walls, and take away the strength of our armed men: no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can doe vs so much harme as our owne sinnes: and therefore we must humble our selues for them, and if we haue not repented, now we must beginne; and if we haue begunne, we must proceede and renew the same more and more. If we had felt the miserie of subiection to foraine power, as these Iewes now did, it would touch vs: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before these euills come vpon vs, let vs meete our God by true repentance, that so he may keepe from vs this fierce wrath.</p>

               <p>Christ hauing forbidden priuate reuenge, doth here command the<note place="margin">Doe good for euill.</note> requitall of good for euill, in two particular examples of well-doing, taken from giuing and lending: by both which, though not expressely, yet in sense and meaning Christ would teach his hearers thus much: <hi>Let the man be what he will, doe thou good vnto him for euill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first, <hi>Giue to him that asketh, &amp;c.</hi> These words must not be taken simply, but in this sense: <hi>Giue to him that asketh on a iust cause beeing poore, though be cannot requite thee againe,</hi> nay, though he had done thee wrong, and were thine enemie. This exposition is plaine, Luk. 6. for hauing set downe his commandement for giuing, v. 30. he renders this reason thereof in effect; <hi>because they cannot requite thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,</hi> v. 33. which plainely imports that it must be to the poore.</p>
               <p>Here now first obserue, the forme of Christs words, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, <hi>Giue to him, &amp;c.</hi> whence I gather that a man is bound in<note place="margin">Almes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a duti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Christ adiudgeth some to hell for the neglect of this dutie: now there could be no such course, if there were no commandement that did bind their conscience to doe that, for want whereof they are condemned. Againe, in the sixt commandement, we are bound to doe all duties that may preserue our neighbours life, of which sort is giuing releefe vnto the poore, without which they cannot liue.

                  <hi>I counsell thee to buie of me gold, &amp;c.</hi> Againe, Daniel v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this forme of speech to the King, <hi>Let my counsell be pretious vnto thee;</hi> not because it was no commandement, but because he would so temper his speech, that it might better take place in the stout heart of this proud king. And when as <hi>Paul</hi> (2. Cor. 8. 8.) speaking of Almes saith, <hi>he speaketh not by commandement,</hi> it is to be vnderstood not simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Almes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giuing, but of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> measure thereof, as the former verse doth plainly shew.</p>
               <p>Here then wee see those men confuted which say, they may doe<note place="margin">Vse 1. We may not doe with our owne what we will.</note> with their owne what they will: this is not so, for mens goods are not their owne simply, but Gods also; and they indeede are but the Lords stewards to dispose of them as he commands: now his will is, that part thereof should be giuen to them which want.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we see here also that those men sinne grieuously who are so<note place="margin">Parcimonte condemned.</note> couetous, that they will giue nothing to the poore; sell they will, and lend also, vpon a good pawne, for their owne aduantage: but by free gift they will part with nothing. These are miserable persons, who doe what they can to condemne themselues: for Gods commandement binds men in conscience to giue vnto the poore, and that freely. Yet here we must know, that not onely they who giue f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eely doe a worke<note place="margin">Lending and selling may be works of mercie.</note> of mercie; but also they who lend and sell, when as their lending and selling will as much profit the poore as giuing: this in effect is almes deedes here also commanded: and therefore is Ioseph commended, not onely for giuing, but for selling corne to the Egyptians and others in the time of dearth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this beeing a commandement binding conscience, must stirre vs vp to doe all good duties of releefe with cheerefulnes, that so meete and decent prouision for the poore may not onely be begunne, but also continued: for it is acceptable vnto God.</p>
               <p>A second point here to be obserued is, what kind of commandement this is; <hi>Giue to him that asketh.</hi> Gods commandements be of two sorts, Affirmatiue and Negatiue; and in the Morall law the one is alwaies comprehended in the other: now this commandement is affirmatiue,<note place="margin">Negatiue precepts more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue.</note> which must be noted, because negatiue precepts lay a straighter bonde vpon the conscience then the affirmatiue: and therefore are the precepts of the Morall law for the most part propounded negatiuely: for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue precept binds a man to obedience alwaies, and to all and euery time; as when God saith, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> a man is neuer exempted from obedience hereunto: but an affirmatiue commandement, though
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14013:99"/>
it binde alwaies, yet not to all times, as this of Christ for giuing almes, it binds not all men, but onely those that are inabled to giue; nor yet the rich to all times, but then onely when iust occasion of giuing is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: and the same may be said of euery affirmatiue commandement, as of keeping an holy rest vnto the Lord, it bindes a man for euer, but not at all times, onely for the seauenth day, and such like.</p>
               <p>Yet further to lay open this commandement touching Almes, we<note place="margin">Of Almes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giuing eight points.</note> will herein handle eight points: I. who is to giue: II. what is to be giuen: III. to whome we must giue: IV. in what order: V. how much: VI. in what place: VII. at what time: VIII. in what manner we must giue.</p>
               <p>For the first: the person that is to giue, is not euery one, but such as<note place="margin">1</note> God hath set apart for this dutie: for, Matth. 25. 42, 43. some are there<note place="margin">Who must giue.</note> made to receiue, as the <hi>hungrie, thirstie, naked, sicke, &amp;c.</hi> and others are made fit to giue <hi>clothing, foode, comfort,</hi> and such like. And S. <hi>Iohn</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs who is made fit to giue, namely, <note n="c" place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>he that hath the goods of this world:</hi> not onely he that hath abundance, but euen he that hath but a small portion of worldly goods: and therefore the theefe that stole for want, is <hi>forbidden to steale, and commanded to labour,</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Eph. 4. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>that he may haue to giue to him that wanteth:</hi> and the poore widow is commended of Christ, that <note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 21 2, 3 Properties in a giuer.</note> 
                  <hi>of her penurie gaue to the treasurie but two mites.</hi> Now in a giuer there must be two things: first, a right vnto the goods he giueth: for a man may not giue that which is not his owne: secondly, a present full proprietie in the things he giueth, (vnlesse it be in the case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie:) and by this are children and seruants excluded from giuing, vnlesse they haue some things of their owne, or doe it by command.</p>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether may the wife giue releefe vnto the poore, without<note place="margin">Of almes-giuing by a wife.</note> her husbands consent? An <hi>auncient answer</hi> is this, that many wiues in giuing are <hi>Abigails</hi> in regard of their husbands, who are like vnto <hi>Nabal;</hi> and therefore may giue: and yet some other auncient Diuines<note place="margin">August. epist. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>9.</note> adde this, that the wife cannot giue, where all consent of her husband is wanting, because both shee and all her possessions belong vnto him principally: yet here we are to know, that there is a double consent of the husband, <hi>expressed in open words,</hi> whereupon there is no question, but the wife may lawfully giue: and <hi>secret,</hi> which is threefold; first, when the husband doth not dissent; secondly, when he giues consent generally, as when he allows her to giue, but names not any particular; thirdly, when the wife hath a probable coniecture and presumption, that if her husband doe know, he would allow of her giuing. And in these cases of secret consent, the wife may also giue: but if shee haue
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14013:99"/>
not his consent any of these waies, shee may not lawfully giue, vnlesse in these cases: 1. that shee hath something priuate of her owne, either by exception before, or by graunt after mariage: 2. that her giuing serues to preserue the life or good estate of her husband and family, as <hi>Abigails</hi> did when shee gaue to Dauid: 3. that the necessitie of the receiuer requires present releefe, for extreame necessitie dispenseth with proprietie.</p>

For the first, <hi>Almes is a free gift, tending to preserue the temporall life of our neighbour:</hi> first, I call it <hi>a gift,</hi> vnderstanding it largely, because forgiuing to them that are not able to pay, is an almes deede. Secondly, I say <hi>free,</hi> to distinguish it from subsidies to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Tenthes-giuing for the stipende of the Minister, and such like. These are gifts, but not free gifts: for the people receiue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the Magistrate for their subsidies, and instruction from the Minister for their Tenthes. Thirdly, I say, the ende of Almes is <hi>to preserue temporall life;</hi> to distinguish it from spirituall gifts, which concerne the soule: the Papists make all workes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, whether they concerne the bodie or soule, to be almes; but almes properly, are gifts that tende to preserue this naturall temporall life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Question. Whereof are almes to be raised? Ans.</hi> First, of our<note place="margin">Whereof must almes be raised.</note> owne goods: for a man ought not to giue that which is an other mans: and therefore those that owe more then they are worth, cannot giue almes, but are rather fit to receiue, for all that they haue in right and conscience belongs to some others. Secondly, <hi>our Almes must be of</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Prov. 9. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>our first fruits:</hi> things holesome and good, and such as are fit for the person releeued. They must not be the refuse of our goods, which we know not else what to doe with: Nehem. 8. 10. <hi>Part of the fatte, and of the sweete must be sent to them, for whome none is prouided.</hi> Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> Almes must be of <hi>goods lawfully gotten:</hi> for euill gotten goods must be restored, either to the owner (if he be knowne) or to some of his kinred, or to the Magistrate: which shewes, that the Vsurer ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to restore, then to giue almes of his gaine for vsurie. Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Temporall goods distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</note> our Almes must be giuen of our owne, with <hi>difference and discretion:</hi> euery mans goods for the most part may be distinguished into foure degrees: first, some are necessarie to preserue life, without which a man<note place="margin">1</note> and his family cannot liue: secondly, some are necessary to a mans estate,<note place="margin">2</note> as those goods by which a man putteth in practise the duties of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14013:100"/>
such are bookes vnto the Student, and tooles vnto the trades man: a third sort are such, as are requisite for the decencie of a mans estate,<note place="margin">3</note> and such are those that make a man walke in his calling with comfort, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>en a man can liue without receiuing Almes, but yet very hardly: the second is, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame want,</hi> when a man withoat releefe cannot possibly maintaine life: now in common want we must giue of our abundance; that is, both of our superfluitie, as also of our riches that serue for decencie: Luk. 3. 11. <hi>He which hath two coates, let him part with him that hath none:</hi> now he that hath two coates, is not he that hath a coate and a cloake, for so had <note n="g" place="margin">2.

                  <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet retained them both lawfully for his vse: but Christs meaning is, that he which hath things necessarie, and besides some thing ouer, seruing for decencie and superfluitie, must giue thereof to him that lacketh. And in extreame necessitie, he must giue of those goods which pertaine necessarily to his life and estate: for our neighbours life must be preferred before our owne temporall goods, and outward estate: <note n="h" place="margin">2.

                  <hi>sold their possessions for the releeuing of the poore brethren in extreame want:</hi> rather diminishing their owne temporall estate, then suffering the poore to want that were in extreame necessitie. This Rule ought alwaies to be regarded and practised, especially in times of want: as for those that make aduantage of a dearth, and enrich themselues by Gods iudgement on the poore, they are most miserable and wretched people, quite voide of euery sparke of that gratious disposition which was in Christ, who beeing <hi>rich,</hi> euen king of heauen and earth, <note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>made himselfe poore, that though his pouertie, he might make others rich.</hi> It is the will of God, that we should beare one anothers burdens, and helpe to lift vp the poore that are pressed down with the iudgement of God; which we shall doe, when we giue not onely of our abundance in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon want, but euen of our necessaries in the extreame want of the poore.</p>

Releeuing wandring beggers a great disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Reasons. 1.</note> place we must know this; that it is a disorder not beseeming Gods Church, to giue releefe to wandring beggers at our doores: this may appeare by these reasons: I. It is Gods commandement, <note n="s" place="margin">Deut. 15. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>that among his people there should be no such beggers:</hi> if any man aske, how the poore were then releeued? I answer, God tooke sufficient order for their prouision: for first, the husbandman <note n="t" place="margin">Lev. 19. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>must not gather his grapes cleane, nor yet his corne field, but leaue the after-gathering and gleaning for the poore.</hi> Secondly, besides the <note n="u" place="margin">Num. 18. 26</note> 
                  <hi>yearely Tenthes for the Priests and Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>three yeares tenthes were to be gathered and kept for the poore, and for strangers.</hi> Thirdly, euery seauenth yeare the land was to rest, and all that it brought forth that yeare, with the fruit of vineyards and oliues was for the poore. Exod. 23. 11. Againe, in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <hi>Apostles ordained,</hi> that in euery Church there should be <note n="y" place="margin">Act. 6. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Deacons;</hi> that is, men of wisdome and discretion, who were to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the poore, and likewise to dispose of that which was giuen, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:14013:101"/>
as euery man had neede: in which very order of prouision for the poore, the Lord forbids all wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring begging. II. These wandring<note place="margin">2</note> beggers, are the shame and reproch of the people where they are suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for it argueth want of care of good order in gouerners, and want of mercie in the rich, that they gather all to themselues, without regard how the poore should liue. III. In releeuing these wandring beggers,<note place="margin">3</note> there is this double want in the giuer; he cannot tell what to giue, nor how much; because he knowes not the state of the partie that beggeth. Now in almes deedes there ought to be a double discretion: the giuer ought to know both his owne abilitie, and also the necessitie of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers. IV. Common releeuing at mens doores makes many beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,<note place="margin">4</note> and maintaines a wicked generation: for these wandring beggers are for the most part flat Atheists, regarding nothing but their bellie, separating themselues from all congregations: and from begging many fall to stealing; or els they take such pleasure therein, that they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue it, no not for a yearely rent. This is knowne to be true by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. All which things duly considered, must moue the Magistrates and euery other in their place, to see that better order be obserued for the poore then doore-releeuing to all that come. And sith good lawes are made in this behalfe, men ought in conscience to see the same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and kept; neither can any man without sinne tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgresse the same. Indeede if good order were not prouided for the poore, it were better to releeue them in their wandring course, then to suffer them to starue: for so dealt Christ &amp; his disciples with the poore, when good order fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led among the Iewes, they releeued them in the high waies &amp; streetes.</p>

                     </gap>g. Rules. I.</note> Scripture speaketh little, yet this may be gathered thence: First, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe must be giuen when present occasion requireth: therfore <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 3. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Say not to thy neigbour, Goe and come again to morow, if thou now haue it.</hi> Secondly, that the Sabbath day is a fit time for the giuing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe<note place="margin">2</note> for the poore: for the <note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 16. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Apostle commanded the Corinthians,</hi> that each one should lay aside vpon that day, according as God had prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him the weeke before, that which he would giue for the poore: where by the way, it may be obserued, that daily giuing at mens doores was not allowed by the Apostles. Also touching Trades-men this may be added: from this, that the Apostle makes contribution for the poore <hi>a Sabbath daies worke;</hi> that wheras they vse to imploy part of the Lords day, both morning &amp; euening in seruing their customers for their own priuate benefite, this can not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14013:102"/>
necessitie, and then they may not make a priuate gaine of their sale, but must turne that worke to a worke of mercie for the poore, either selling without gaine if it be a poore bodie that buies; or giuing the gaine of that which they sell to the rich, for the releefe of the poore. This indeed will hardly be obtained at trades-mens hands, but yet they must know that the whole Sabbath day is the Lords, wherin he wil be worshipped with delight, neither ought men to doe therein their owne workes, nor seeke their owne wills, nor speake their owne words. Isa. 58. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VIII. Point.</hi> In what manner must Almes be giuen? <hi>Ans.</hi> Hereof<note place="margin">The manner of Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</note> more is to be spoken in the chapter following: yet from this text these things may be obserued: First, that Almes-giuing must be free; the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">1</note> must neither looke for recompence at the hands of man, nor thinke to merit any thing thereby at the hands of God. That Popish conceit depriues a man of the true comfort of the spirit in this worke of mercy: none but Christ by his obedience could euer merit at Gods hands. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, our hearts in giuing must be touched with charitie, and the<note place="margin">2</note> bowels of compassion; we must giue with cheerefulnes: for <hi>without loue all that we giue is nothing,</hi> 1. Cor. 13. 3. and <hi>the Lord loueth a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full giuer,</hi> 2. Cor. 9. 7. now if we consider the poore as our owne flesh, and see Gods image in them, this will mooue vs to pitie. Thirdly, in<note place="margin">3</note> the person of the poore we must consider Christ Iesus, and giue vnto them as we would giue vnto Christ. This will mooue vs to giue, and that chearefully: for in the day of iudgement Christ will make it known that he comes for releefe to the rich in the person of the poore: to the mercilesse he will say, <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 25. 45.</note> 
                  <hi>In as much as ye did it not to them, ye did it not to me:</hi> but to the mercifull thus, <note n="c" place="margin">v. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>In as much as ye did it vnto one of the least of these my brethren, ye haue done it vnto me.</hi> Fourthly, our almes<note place="margin">4</note> must be giuen as a pledge of our thankefulnesse vnto God for the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings we enioy: for all we haue commeth from God; <note n="d" place="margin">1. Chr. 29. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>and of his hand it is, whatsoeuer we giue:</hi> now he professeth, that when men <hi>doe good,</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 13. 16</note> 
                  <hi>and distribute to the poore, he is well pleased with such sacrifices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hauing seene what this dutie of Almes-giuing is, and how it must be performed; we must now stirre vp our selues to put the same in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise: and to mooue vs hereunto consider the reasons following. I. We<note place="margin">1</note> all desire to be counted religious; now if we would be such indeede,<note place="margin">Mouues to Almes-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</note> we must <hi>visit the fatherlesse and widowes,</hi> we must <hi>doe good, and giue almes to the poore:</hi> for <hi>this is pure religion and vndefiled before God,</hi> as <note n="f" place="margin">Iam. 1. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Iames</hi> saith. To come to the Church and heare the word, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacraments are good things, but without mercie to the poore they are not regarded, but hated of God, Isa. 1. 13, 14, 15. II. If a<note place="margin">2</note>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:14013:102"/>
man should offer vnto vs a peece of ground to manure and till for our owne reaping, we would take it kindely and bestowe both paines and seede vpon it; behold the poore are sent of God to the rich, as a peece of ground to be tilled, and when they giue to the poore, they sowe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground: now as <hi>Paul</hi> saith in this case, <note n="g" place="margin">2. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>looke as a man soweth so shall he reape:</hi> we therefore must sow liberally, that we may also reape liberally. III. Prov. 19. 17. <hi>He that hath mercie vpon the poore, len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>vnto the Lord:</hi> we would easily be mooued to lend, if we had an honest man to be suretie vnto vs, for returning of our owne with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage: well, the Lord offers himselfe to the rich to be suretie for the poore; who then will feare to lend hauing so good a debter? IIII.<note place="margin">4</note> If these promises will not mooue vs, let vs consider the fearefull curses threatned against the mercilesse and hard hearted: for as <hi>he that giueth to the poore shall not lacke, so he that hideth his eyes from them shall haue many curses,</hi> Prov. 28. 27. <hi>and he that stoppeth his eares at the crying of the poore, he shall crie and not be heard:</hi> Prov. 21. 18. and the woefull sentence of condemnation shall be pronounced vpon the wicked for the neglect of this dutie. Matth. 25. 41, 42.</p>
               <p>Further, from the words, <hi>Giue to him that asketh</hi>] we may learne, that<note place="margin">Proprietie of goods lawfull.</note> it is the will of God, that among his people there should be <hi>a proprietie of goods,</hi> and that all things should not be common in that behalfe: for the Lord would haue some to haue to giue, and some to want that they might receiue; which would not be, if all things should be common both for vse and proprietie, as some haue fondly imagined. If any man thinke it was so in the primitiue Church, because it is said, <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 4. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>they had all things common,</hi> he is to know, that that communitie was in such things onely, as men had then freely giuen for the common good. And yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then, none was compelled or bound in conscience to giue all his substance in that sort: for there <note n="i" place="margin">Act. 5. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter tells Ananias that his possession, while it remained vnsold, appertained to him, and after it was sold, the price thereof was in his owne power to dispose of as he would. Obiect.</hi> 2. All things belong to beleeuers, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>All things are yours,</hi> 1. Cor. 3. 21. and therefore they ought to be common. <hi>Ans.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle meaneth, that they had right in Christ to all things, and did enioy them by hope; but yet the fruition of them in actuall proprietie, is not had before the day of iudgement.</p>
               <p>Againe, if giuing to the poore be a dutie of euery one, whome God<note place="margin">Vowed po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</note> iuables hereunto, then no man may voluntarily disable himselfe from it; whereupon the Popish practise of vndergoing voluntarie pouertie falls to the ground, as vnlawfull: for thereby they disable themselues vnto

               <p>Lastly, in this commandement see the error of those men, that giue themselues wholly to gather riches to themselues, beeing like to the moule which is alwaies digging in the earth: for God requires, that a man should giue as well as get, nay he must get to giue, and not to keepe: for God is more glorified by giuing, then by keeping: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his children resemble their heauenly father, who receiueth nothing of any man, and yet <hi>giueth liberally to euery one that asketh, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching any,</hi> Iam. 1. 5.</p>

For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderstanding whereof we are to know, that in humane Societies<note place="margin">3.

First, such poore as are vnable to prouide for themselues things necessarie, by reason of some impotencie, as sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enes,<note place="margin">1</note> age, lamenes, or such like; and these are commonly called beggers. A second sort are those, which beeing poore haue yet a trade, wherein<note place="margin">2</note> they can prouide for themselues some part of their maintenance, &amp; yet by reason of their pouertie. still want some things necessarie, which of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues they cannot procure. The third sort are rich men, such as haue<note place="margin">3</note> worldly goods in abundance, not onely sufficient for their necessaries, but much ouerplus: now to each of these belongs his peculiar due. To the first sort of poore that haue the <hi>shaking hand</hi> (as Moses <note n="k" place="margin">Leu. 25. 35</note> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) almes are due, and they must be releeued by giuing freely, as we
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:14013:103"/>
haue shewed in the former precept. To the second sort of poore, belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs lending properly, specially then, when their necessitie requires. To the rich, neither gift nor loane is due; but on the contrarie, they ought to giue and lend to the poore, maintaining themselues by the honest la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and industrie of their lawfull callings.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Point.</hi> In what manner must men lend? <hi>Ans.</hi> With a <hi>willing mind,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Manner of lending.</note> without any shew of grudging, either in speech, or by turning away the head or bodie; as it is here said, <hi>From him that would borrow of thee turne not away:</hi> which propertie in the lender, is yet further expressed by <hi>Luke,</hi> saying, <hi>Lend, looking for nothing againe:</hi> where Christ doth not simply forbid men to looke for that which they lent; but his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, to shew with what affection &amp; disposition of heart men ought to lend: namely, hauing respect onely to the good of the partie bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing, and not to the restitution of the thing lent: as when a poore man comes to borrow, wee must not reason thus with our selues; This man is poore, and it may be will not paie me againe, therefore I wil not lend; nor thus, This man is painfull though he bee poore, and is like to paie me againe, &amp; therefore I will lend. This (saith Christ) <hi>is the practise of sinners,</hi> who lend, <hi>because they looke to receiue the like.</hi> Be thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mooued to lend vpon a good desire to helpe the poore, and let not thy mind be running vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the losse, or safe return of the thing lent. Thus is that clause of Christ, <hi>looking for nothing againe,</hi> to be vnderstood, and not to bee applied to the game of vsurie, wherea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Christ aimeth not in this place.</p>
               <p>First, here obserue, that to lend vnto the poore, is a commandement<note place="margin">Vses. 1. Lending is a dutie.</note> of God, binding the conscience of the rich: it is not left free to the rich mans choice, whether hee will lend or not, but if the poore mans case require, he sinnes against God, if he doe not lend; for he breaks this commandement. <hi>Dauid</hi> therefore makes it the propertie of a <hi>good man to be mercifull, and to lend:</hi> Psal. 112. 5. where wee see that wretched practise of many rich men condemned to the pit of hell, who are so far from lending to the poore, that they hoard vp their store, till a time of dearth, that then they may inrich the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues by poore mens want; &amp; thus they increase Gods iudgement vpon the poore, and as it were, <note n="l" place="margin">

                  <hi>tread vpon them,</hi> as the holy Ghost speaketh. But they shall one day find, that they ought to haue lent vnto the poore, in their necessities; yea, and when the hand of God in common want lieth more heauie vpon the poore, they ought then to open their hands more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally towards them. It is an vsuall &amp; common practise, that when a man beginnes to decaie in his estate, no man will lend him any thing; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

because he beginnes to decay, therfore they withdrew their helpe, least he should not pay them againe. But this ought not to be so: its Christs commandement, that the rich by lending should sustaine such a one as by reason of want, is readie to fall into decay.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand of Christ binds the Rich not onely to lend, but<note place="margin">2</note> to lend freely without taking any increase: for they must lend, not loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<note place="margin">Free len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> for any againe: yea, Exod. 22. 25. the Lord expressely forbids to take increase of the poore: where we see the common practise of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers condemned to the bottome of hell, who lende vnto the poore vpon bonds for increase: these are they, that liue on the blood and life of the poore, whose sinne is euery where condemned, and ought to be hated as bloodshed it selfe. But the rich will say, they are intreated so to doe, and are greatly thanked for so lending. <hi>Ans.</hi> This excuse will not serue the turne: for Sauls armour bearer was a murtherer for kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his master, though Saul earnestly besought him so to doe. 2. Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. 9. 16.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here further learne, that a man must lend, and yet not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies<note place="margin">3</note> take againe the principall: indeede he may require, and receiue<note place="margin">Forgiuing of that is lent.</note> his owne, els there should be no lending but all giuing, which two are here distinct: but yet when the poore that borowed, is fallen in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, some may here aske (seeing Christ <hi>bids o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>nothing againe</hi>) whether may a man at no time with good conscience receiue increase for his lending? <hi>Ans.</hi> Lending is twofold: of due, or of curtesie: lending of due is the loane of the rich vnto the poore, when his necessitie compells him to borrow: and for this a man cannot with<note place="margin">1</note> good conscience take any increase. Lending of curtesie is, when one<note place="margin">2</note> rich friend lends vnto an other; this is not forbidden in the word of God, but is left to a mans owne libertie and discretion, neither hath it any promise of reward. Now in this case of curtesie, I doe not finde in Scripture that all taking of increase is simply condemned; nay, in some cases, both the law of nature, and the lawes of all countries doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it: As first, when the increase is giuen onely in way of thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">1</note> as a blessing to require in kindnes a good turne receiued: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude<note place="margin">Cases where in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may receiue in- crease for lending.</note> is abhorred of all, and the low of nature requires to doe good for good: and all Diuines almost both Protestants and Papists doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:14013:104"/>
this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> kinde of increase. Secondly, when a man sustaineth dammage by his lending, he may receiue increase by way of satisfaction for his losse. Thirdly, when a man is contented to aduenture his principall in<note place="margin">3</note> the hand of him that borroweth, then also may he take increase; like as a man may receiue hire for his hourse, or for the vse of any other goods standing to their losse. Exod. 22. 14.</p>
               <p>Thus we see what the will of God is for giuing and lending vnto<note place="margin">Duties of the poore.</note> the poore: now hence the poore may receiue instruction. First, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by<note place="margin">1</note> all may learne, that God will haue some poore among his people<note place="margin">Contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to receiue and borrow of the rich: which may serue to perswade the poore to be contented with their meane estate, esteeming it to be the best for them, because God in his wisdome and prouidence hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it. Secondly, the poore must take occasion from their outward<note place="margin">2</note>
                  <note place="margin">Seeke to be rich in grace</note> pouertie to seeke to be rich in God through grace: Iam. 2. 5. <hi>Hath not God chosen the poore of this world, that they should be rich in faith?</hi> Herein they may match, and goe beyond the richer sort; which is a matter of great ioy: Iam. 1. 9. <hi>Let the brother of low degree, reioyce in that he is exalted:</hi> that is, with God, who counts them rich.

                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:14013:105"/>In these Iewes we may obserue two manifest abuses of Scripture which ought not to be in any Teachers: to wit, <hi>misinterpretation,</hi> and a <hi>false collection.</hi> The word they misconstrue is <hi>Neighbour,</hi> which in<note place="margin">Neighbour, taken two waies.</note> the olde Testament is taken two waies, either strictly and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for a familiar friend and acquaintance, in which sense it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken; or more generally, for any one that in any kind of socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is neare vnto vs, as by consanguinitie, habitation, office, traffique, or beeing onely in the same place with vs: for so is the <hi>Samaritane</hi> saide to be neighbour to the man that fell among theeues, <hi>because he found</hi>

                  <hi>him lying in the way where he traueiled, and had compassion on him.</hi> Now the Iewish teachers leaue the generall signification of the word, which expressed the true meaning of the holy Ghost, and take the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall signification, and so restraine this law of loue to friends onely. Whereby we see how necessarie it is, that the tongues wherein the Scriptures were penned, should be well knowne and vnderstood: for the mistaking of the signification of a word by the Iewish teachers, caused a manifest errour to be taught among them for truth. And this<note place="margin">Schooles of learning ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued.</note> maketh greatly for the honour of the Schooles of learning, where the studies of the Tongues is professed. And herein also an other thing may be noted in the Iewish teachers, that in the time of Christ they were ignorant in their owne tongue, and therefore no maruell though at this day they knowe not the proprieties thereof, seeing their Common-wealth is decaied, and they dispersed among all people.</p>
               <p>Their second fault is, a false collection and consequent, that because a man must loue his friend, therefore he must hate his enemie: this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rules of Arte, for vnlesse the contraries be equall, a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent will not thence follow in this sort.</p>
               <p>Here then obserue the necessitie of the studie of humane Artes, and<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> among the rest, especially of the Arte of Logicke, whereby we may discerne betweene true and false collections.

               <p>Here our Sauiour Christ propounds his Answer vnto the former false doctrine of the Iewish Teachers, for <hi>the hating of an enemie.</hi> Wherein first he laies downe a generall Rule, containing the summe of his whole answer, saying, <hi>Loue your enemies:</hi> then he expounds that Rule in the same v. and after prooueth it, v. 45, 46.

               <p>For the first, <hi>Loue your enemies.</hi> In this Rule two things must be knowne: I. what is an enemie: II. what it is to loue our enemie: both these are euident in the words following, wherein Christ expounds this rule, <hi>Blesse them that curse you, &amp;c.

               <p>Secondly, from the ground of this reason we are taught, that wee<note place="margin">2</note> ought principally to imploy our selues to those things, by the doing<note place="margin">The exercise of a Christi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let vs therefore practise those things, whereby this ground of comfort may be treasured in our hearts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, note here the style and title of honour, which Christ giueth<note place="margin">3</note> vnto God; he calles him not onely <hi>their father,</hi> but <hi>their father which is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Whereto Gods glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous titles serue.</note> 
                  <hi>in heauen:</hi> this hee doth, to stirre vp reuerence in his hearers towards God, and so haue Gods children done, Dan. 9. 4. before that holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet powres out his praier vnto God for his people, hee sets out the Lord with most glorious titles, <hi>O Lord God, great and terrible, which keepest couenant and mercie, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Ieremie</hi> praying vnto God, spends three or foure verses, in setting out Gods great power and Maiestie, Chap. 32. 17, 18, 19. So <hi>Hezekias</hi> in his praier for the people, calles the Lord, <hi>the good God;</hi> which no doubt he did, to stirre vp reuerence in his owne heart, and in the people, towards God. Whereby we are taught, when we haue occasion to mention the name of God, to doe it with all reuerence, and to vse some titles of honour therewithall, to stirre vp our selues and our hearers, to a gratious awe of heart towards Gods maiestie. But lamentable is the practise of the world in this behalfe, for euery where the name of God is tossed in mens mouthes like a tennis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball; some in the middest of their laughter vse <hi>O God, O Lord,</hi> for brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing words: but others spare not to make Gods glorious name, the ensigne of their rage and furie, in bloodie and blasphemous oathes: but void of grace are all such.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:14013:108"/>
Wherein first obserue, the manner of Christs speech; he saith not, <hi>Hee hath caused the sunne to rise,</hi> and <hi>hath</hi> sent raine, &amp;c. but speaking of the time present, <hi>he doth now cause the sunne to rise, and sendeth raine;</hi> so likewise Iohn 5. 17. <hi>My father yet worketh, and I worke together with</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.</note> 
                  <hi>him.</hi> In which phrase is expressed a notable worke of Gods heauenly prouidence; namely; that after the creation of all things, whereby God gaue beeing vnto the creatures, and power and vertue to doe the things, for which they were created, he doth by his prouidence still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue that beeing, and so in euery particular creature. It is God that gaue beeing to the sunne at the beginning, and it is hee that euer since continueth the beeing of the sunne, with the light and vertue thereof; &amp; the same is true of all creatures, and of ourselues: <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>for in him we liue, moone, and haue our beeing:</hi> hee is not like a Carpenter who buildes a house, and then leaues it, but still he preserues the things hee hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Herein we may well be compared to a spring or fountaine, which causeth the riuers to flowe while it sendeth out waters, but when it is stopped, they are dried vp: euen so, while God continueth the beeing and vse of creatures, so long they are; but if hee with-hold his hand from them, they cease to bee, and the vse of them continueth no more. Thus it is with vs, both in regard of our soules and bodies, with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, powers, and graces thereof; for <note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now hence we must learne these duties; First, to seeke to know him<note place="margin">Duties from Gods preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> that is daily about vs, and preserueth vs in soule and in bodie, from houre to houre. Secondly, to cleaue vnto God with our hearts, and to set our affections of loue; feare, ioy, and hope, wholly vpon him, because he is the author and continuer of our beeing, what euer it be. Thirdly, to obey our God in all things; for shall he giue beeing to our bodies &amp; soules, and shall we dispose of them after our pleasures, to offend him, who doth wholly support vs, and that continually?</p>
               <p>Secondly, here note Christ saith, <hi>his sunne,</hi> not <hi>the sunne,</hi> teaching vs,<note place="margin">The sunne is the Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> that the sunne which shineth in the firmament, is Gods sunne, not mens; God himselfe is the sole author and gouernour thereof, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth that beeing which it hath, and the power and vertue which it sheweth forth. And the same thing by proportion, must be vnderstood of all other creatures both in heauen an earth, the moone and starres, all beasts and cattell, yea and we our selues are Gods creatures, and hee is our creator, our Lord, and gouernour: Psal. 50. 12. <hi>The whole world is mine, and all that is therein.</hi> Now hence we must learne two things;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:14013:109"/>
First, not to abuse any creature to our lust, as food, raiment, &amp;c. but to vse whatsoeuer we enioy to Gods glorie, according to his wil. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to endeauour to bee lead by the creatures which we enioy, to the knowledge of our creator, for they are his: but alasse, the practise of the world is otherwise, men suffer themselues by the creatures to be drawn from God: for some make their bellie their God; to others, riches and pleasures are their God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christs saying of the Father, <hi>that he maketh his sunne to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise on the euill and on the good,</hi> doth shew vs that common bountie which God vouchsafeth to his creatures, both good and bad; for the rising and shining of the sunne, is an excellent worke of God, by which<note place="margin">The benefits of the sunne</note> many other blessings are conuaied to the creatures: For first, euery<note place="margin">1</note> thing vpon the earth receiueth heate and warmnesse from it, <hi>nothing is hid from the heat thereof</hi> Psal. 19. 6. In which regard it may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note place="margin">2</note> the <hi>vniuersall fire of the whole world.</hi> Secondly, the sunne serueth notably for the distinction of times, by daie and night, weekes, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, quarters, and whole yeares, whereby wee know the tearme of times from the beginning, and so may doe till the ende of the world; in regard whereof, it may well bee called, <hi>the clocke of the whole world.</hi> Which things considered, may make vs to blush and bee confounded in our selues, for that light regard we haue had of so excellent a creature, whereby God conuaies so manifold blessings vpon the earth; let vs therefore learne to blesse God for the sunne, and to expresse our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse by all good duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And sendeth raine on the iust and vniust.</hi> Here is noted the second<note place="margin">Rain a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God.</note> common blessing bestowed of God vpon the world; to wit, the falling of the raine vpon the ground, both of good and bad. Now here first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the forme of speech vsed by Christ, saying, <hi>God raineth;</hi> see Deut. 11. 14. <hi>The Lord giueth raine in due season, the first and latter raine.</hi> This worke is attributed to God, for waightie causes; First, to shew that<note place="margin">Why God is said to raine.</note> the same God, who ordained in the beginning, that the clouds should<note place="margin">1</note> water the earth, doth by his owne power vpholde the continuance of the same blessing vnto this daie: and indeede, if he should not will the continuance hereof, it would for euer cease to raine vpon the earth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<note place="margin">2</note> to teach vs that God disposeth of the raine that falleth, restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and enlarging it at his pleasure, either for the blessing, or the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the place whereon it falleth, and that many times without the helpe of the second causes. Leuit. 26. 3, 4. <hi>If yee walke in mine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, I will send you raine in due season:</hi> and verse 19. <hi>But if you will not obey me, I will make your heauen as yron, and your earth as brasse.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:14013:109"/>
4. 7. <hi>I haue with-held the raine from you, and caused it to raine vpon one citie, and not vpon another; one peete was rained vpon, and that which was not rained vpon, withered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then we learne first, that wee ought to pray vnto God for his<note place="margin">Vse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> raine of blessing; that is, for fruitfull seasons; and also to be thankfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for seasonable weather when we receiue it, because hee sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it.</p>
               <p>2. This must teach vs to obey &amp; serue God, for he hath the clouds<note place="margin">2</note> in his hands like a spunge, &amp; when he wil he presseth out the raine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: now, if we obey him, he wil cause it to fall vpon the earth for a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; but if we rebell against him, he will either hold it backe, or powre it downe vpon vs for a curse.</p>
               <p>3. Seeing God sendeth down the raine, we may gather that no man<note place="margin">3</note> can certainly tel, by the course of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the particular season of the<note place="margin">Astrological prediction of raine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> weather day by day. If the raine depended wholly vpon the celestiall bodies, then should it fall alike in all places, that be of like position to the heauens; but that is not so, for God ordereth it according to the state of the people, vpon whom it falleth, either for a blessing, or a curse, as we haue heard.</p>
               <p>4. Hence we may gather, that neither witches by the help of Satan,<note place="margin">4</note> nor yet Satan himselfe can cause raine, as many thinke; for it is God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies<note place="margin">Witches ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>5. Doth God raine vpon the earth? then we may well consider,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Vnseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble raine gods punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> why the land is so often plagued with vnseasonable raine: it is no doubt for our disobedience, as we haue heard, Leu. 26. 19. &amp; the contempt of the word, among other sins, is one maine cause of this iudgement.

               <p>The last point to bee here obserued is this; in what tearmes our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour<note place="margin">God friends and enemies</note> Christ expresseth, who bee the friends of God, and who bee his enemies.

Secondly, true conuersion of the whole man vnto God, from all sinne, so as his heart must be renued and disposed to please God in all things. And because these things are inward and secret, therfore to make them knowne, there is further required, that a man carrie in his heart a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and constant purpose, from time to time, neuer to sinne against God: and this purpose of heart he must testifie by a godly and cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>loue.</hi> Perfection in generall, is twofold: of the Law, and of the Gospel. Perfection of the law, is when a man loues God and his neighbour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rigour of the law. This is in no man in this life, but this shall be in Gods elect in the life to come. Perfection of the Gospel, is<note place="margin">Euangelical.</note> that endeauour of obedience which God accepts in Christ, at the hands of his children. This distinction the Apostle maketh, Philip. 3. for first he saith, <hi>he hath not attained to perfection,</hi> v. 12. meaning, the perfection of the law: and yet after he speaketh of himselfe and others, as beeing perfect, v. 15. <hi>Let vs</hi> (saith he) <hi>as many as be perfect be thus minded;</hi> that is, as many as be perfect according to the Gospel. Thus were Noah, Abraham, Iob, Zacharie, and Elizabeth perfect, that is, syncere and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right before God both in heart and life: and this is that perfection which Christ here requireth.</p>
               <p>Further, this Euangelical perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath 2. parts; either of mans nature,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:14013:112"/>
or of his actions. The perfection of mans nature is by regeneration; for as in original sinne, is both guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne imputed, &amp; corruption<note place="margin">Parts of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall perfection.</note> inherent, which is the seed of all sinne: so in regeneration, which is the renuing of mans corrupt nature, there is an abolishing of corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; a<note place="margin">1</note> restoring of grace in euery part &amp; sacultie of the soule: for look how far coruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spread it selfe by <hi>Adams</hi> sin, so far doth grace extend by rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.

               <p>But it will be said, a man may haue both these, and yet want much of<note place="margin">Perfection in parts, and in degrees.</note> perfection. <hi>Answer.</hi> A thing is said to be perfect two waies; either <hi>in parts,</hi> when it hath all the parts of perfection, though in weake mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; or <hi>in degrees,</hi> when it hath a full measure of perfection in euery part. A child newe borne is a perfect man in regard of his parts, hauing all the parts and members of a man; but it is not perfect in degree, till euery part grow vp to his perfection. Now the child of God when hee is regenerate, hath all the parts of perfection in soule &amp; bodie, though in weake measure; but in this life, he is not perfect in degrees, which is that full measure the law requireth. 2. Chron. 15. 17. <hi>The heart of Asa is said to be perfect towards God all his daies:</hi> and yet the high places were not taken away; yea he failed in seeking to the Physition, and not

vnto God, chap. 16. 12. <hi>Asa</hi> then had perfection of parts, but to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of degrees he attained not in this life, &amp; therfore he failed in these particulars, through the weakenesse of sanctification, which here is not finished till death.</p>
               <p>So then it is plaine, there is a perfection in the child of God, though ioyned with much weakenesse, euen in this life; his nature is perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renued in soule to sound iudgement, to an honest heart, and a good conscience: his actions are perfect in Gods acceptance through Christ, while he bewailes his imperfection, and endeauours sincerely to please God in all things. This is that which Christ enioynes to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, this we must labour for, if we wil resemble our heauenly father, we can get no higher in this life; but let vs attaine to this, and in the life to come we shall bee perfect in degrees, for then our regeneration shall be accomplished.</p>
               <p>But herein men faile and come short of their dutie; as first, all those<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Who faile in seeking perfection.</note> that spend their strength and wit to get the things of this world; these men little thinke of this perfection which the Lord requires in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; it may be they will heare the word, but yet their hearts are so glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the earth &amp; earthly things, that they sauour not of regeneration, they know not what it meanes: but if they will be Gods children, they must follow <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> 2. Chro. 17. 6. who <hi>lift vp his heart to the waies of the Lord;</hi> for that is the meanes to come to perfection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, those also are reprooued, that content themselues with a<note place="margin">2</note> small measure of knowledge, and doe not striue after perfection, as Christ requireth: how can they haue a sound iudgement, which studie not to know the doctrine of the Scripture?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that generall want of Christian perfection is here reproued,<note place="margin">3</note> when men content themselues, to yeeld respect to the outward duties<note place="margin">The general want of Christian perfection.</note> of the first Table, that concerne Gods worship, and yet neglect the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the second Table, that concerne their brethren in generall, and pertaine to their functions and callings in particular. This is a common fault in Magistrates, Ministers, Parents, Masters, Seruants, &amp;c. they will be Christians in the Church, but they neglect to shew the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in their callings; but this is a grieuous want of sincerity, which makes them farre vnlike their heauenly father: for hee is euer like himselfe, and therefore looke what men professe in Gods worship, that must they practise in their callings. A magistrate must be a Christian vpon the Bench, as well as in the Church; in the administration of iustice, as well as in the Congregation: and so must Ministers, Masters, and all estates. God allowes not of their seruice in the Church, that serue

their wicked lusts at home, Ierem. 7. 9, 10. Gods sacrifices vnder the law must be whole and sound, not halt and lame, or maimed; and such should our obedience be vnder the Gospel, with sincere respect to all Gods commandements. It profited <hi>Herod</hi> little to heare <hi>Iohn</hi> gladly, and to doe many things, so long as he kept his brothers wife; nor <hi>Iudas</hi> to follow Christ, while his heart was vpon the bagge.

And then exemplifieth it by a particular example of a corrupt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of giuing Almes, borrowed from the ambitions practise of the Scribes and Pharisies, v. 2. The second commandement touching Almes giuing, is in the 3. verse; whereof he renders a reason in the 4. verse.</p>
               <p>For the first commandement, <hi>Take heed, &amp;c.</hi> This may seeme to bee repugnant to that precept giuen before, Chap. 1. 16. <hi>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes.</hi> But here is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie, if we marke well; for in the former chapter wee are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to doe good workes before men, that they may see them, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God for the same. Now here wee are not forbidden simply to doe good workes before men, but to doe them before men for this ende, <hi>to haue our praise of men,</hi> that we might be glorified for doing them, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it went with God.</p>
               <p>Before we come to the Rule, the words are somewhat to bee scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;<note place="margin">A diuers reading.</note> for whereas we read them thus, <hi>Giue not your Almes before men, &amp;c.</hi> Some ancient Churches, after other copies and translations read them thus, <hi>Doe not your righteousnesse or iustice before men:</hi> which must not seeme strange, that in Gods booke there should be diuers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; for in former ages, before Printing was inuented, the Scriptures of God were conuaied from hand to hand, by meanes of writing: now they that writ out the copies of Scripture, did now and then mistake some words and letters by negligence, or ignorance, and put one thing for another, whereupon doe come these diuers readings: yet wee must not thinke, that the word of God is hereby maimed, or made imperfect, for the true sense of the holy Ghost, remains sound &amp; perfect, though it may be we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not discerne of the right reading.

                  <hi>Gods expresse commandement:</hi> so as vnlesse he giue in some sort, he plaies the thiefe, &amp; robs the poore, by keeping backe that which is their due.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:14013:114"/>In regard whereof we must learne: first, to acknowledge that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding of maintenance for the poore, is not a worke of freedome or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,<note place="margin">Prouision for the pore a dutie.</note> left to mens choise, whether they will doe it or no, but a matter of iustice, and the not doing of it is iniustice, against the law of God and of nature, which require that the poore should be maintained at home without begging abroad. Secondly, this should mooue vs, to lay aside some portion of our goods to giue vnto the poore, for the poore haue interest into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; for this cause we ought to cut off our superfluities in feasting, in attire, in sports and pleasures, that so we may be better ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to doe iustice in giuing vnto the poore, for hereby commonly men are disabled to doe this part of iustice. Thirdly, this should teach vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our places, to see those good orders well maintained and set forward, which are prouided for the conuenient releefe and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the poore: for the neglecting of them is iniustice, and a kind of theft against the poore.</p>
               <p>Secondly, obserue the word translated <hi>Almes:</hi> it is very pithie, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>mercie</hi> and <hi>pitie;</hi> whence we may learne: first, what it is that<note place="margin">What makes giuing to be almes.</note> makes our giuing to the poore to be Almes: it is not the thing giuen, but the <hi>mercifull</hi> and <hi>pitifull heart of the giuer,</hi> be the thing neuer so small, as was the poore widows mite: and therefore all our almes must proceede from a pitifull heart. Secondly, it sheweth what a one that partie must be that is to be releeued, namely, such a one as is to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not our lustie beggers, but infants, orphanes, the lame, blind, weake, maimed, and aged persons.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the words: now followeth the commandement it selfe. <hi>Take heede that you giue not your Almes before men to be seene of them.</hi> This commandement tendeth to this ende, to teach men how to<note place="margin">Scope.</note> auoide the vnlawfull manner of giuing Almes: for a good thing may be done in an ill manner, and vsually men offend this way in their good deedes. Now this commandement prescribes a double circumspection in giuing Almes: first, touching the ground: secondly, touching the ende of almes giuing. The <hi>ground</hi> of our Almes must not be the pride<note place="margin">A bad groa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of our almes giuing.</note> of our hearts: this Christ forewarnes vs of, if we looke it should be good and acceptable in the sight of God. This is a point of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and therefore for the better obseruing of it, I will here shew two points: I. what this pride is: II. why it must be so carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided in our almes deedes. By <hi>pride,</hi> I meane not outward pride in<note place="margin">Pride of heart.</note> apparell, but that which is inward in the soule, consisting partly in the minde, and partly in the will and affections, <hi>Pride of minde,</hi> is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt<note place="margin">Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:14013:114"/>
more excellent then indeede he is: this was the sinne of the <hi>Pharisie,</hi> who boasted vnto God of his owne goodnesse, Luk. 18. 11, 12. And hence it came that the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Rev. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>gloried in her selfe,</hi> saying, <hi>I am rich, and increased in wealth, and lacke nothing; when as indeede shee was poore, and blind, and miserable, and naked.</hi> This conceit is most dangerous, especially in the point of grace, causing many to deceiue their owne soules, by thinking they haue grace when they haue none,<note place="margin">Pride in will.</note> and ouerweening that which they haue. <hi>Pride</hi> in <hi>will,</hi> is an inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, whereby a man is not contented with that estate wherein God hath placed him, but desires a better. This befell <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Adam and Eue,</hi> who sought to be <hi>like vnto God himselfe;</hi> and this taketh hold of most<note place="margin">Practise of pride.</note> men in euery age. Now from these two proceedeth that <hi>practise of prìde</hi> in mans life, whereby he endeauours to doe whatsoeuer he can for his owne praise and glorie. This <hi>pride</hi> is not in some few persons alone, but in euery man naturally that comes of Adam, Christ Iesus onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And where it takes place it is so strong, that it will not be crossed: for rather then a man will not haue his will in this, he will commit any sinne. This caused <hi>Absalon</hi> to banish his father out of his owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and <hi>Achitophel</hi> to hang himselfe, when his counsell was refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;<note place="margin">Sylvest. 2. Platina: and fasc. Temp.</note> and some Popes (as histories makes mention) to bequeath their soules vnto the deuill for the obtaining of the Popedome. And this is that inward corruption which Christ here forbids to be the ground of our Almes deedes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> The reasons why this inward pride must be carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided,<note place="margin">Why pride must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided.</note> be these two. First, because whatsoeuer outward good worke the child of God can do by grace, the same may a wicked man do tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough pride; as conceiue a prayer, preach the word, and practise the outward duties of repentance, of loue, and such like: for pride is a sinne that will counterfeit grace, and man cannot discerne it, but God onely. Secondly, many other sinnes preuaile in the wicked, but pride is the sinne that troubleth the children of God, and when other sinnes die, then will pride reuiue, yea it will arise out of grace it selfe: for the child of God will be proud, because he is not proud: therefore <hi>Paul</hi>'<note n="c" place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 7.</note> must be <hi>buffeted by the messenger of Satan, least he should be puffed vp with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of reuelations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the way to auoide this daungerous sinne stands in two things:<note place="margin">How pride may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided.</note> first, we must be carefull <hi>to know the pride</hi> of our owne heart, for euery man hath it in him more or lesse, and the more we see it, the lesse it is; but the lesse we see it, the more it is in vs indeed: and though we know nothing by our selues, yet let vs suspect our selues hereof, and labour to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14013:115"/>
see it in our hearts: for he that is the most humbled, is not altogether free from this inward pride; Secondly, when we see ouer pride, we must labour to <hi>subdue it;</hi> which we shall doe; first, by considering the Iudgements of God vpon this sinne: were not our <hi>first parents</hi> cast out of Paradise when they would needes be as Gods, and <hi>Herod</hi> was <hi>eaten vp of wormes</hi> when he tooke vnto himselfe the glorie due vnto God; Act. 12. 23. Therefore <hi>Peter</hi>

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Pet 5. 5.</note> saith, <hi>God resisteth the proud, and giueth grace to the humble.</hi> A man that would begge an almes, must not goe in proud apparell; and so he that would procure the fauour of God, must not come with a proud heart. Secondly, we must search into our selues, and labour to see our owne wants and corruptions, as our blindnes of minde and ignorance, our vnbeleefe, &amp;c. and the sight of our sinnes will be a meanes to humble vs: for they that feele no wants in themselues cannot choose but be puffed vp. Thirdly, we must medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vpon the death and passion of Christ, which he endured for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; how he sweat water and blood, and suffered the wrath of God both in soule and bodie for our sinnes; now how can a man thinke that Christ endured all this for him, and yet be not cast downe with the sight of his owne sinnes, which had a part in the cause of all the curse that caused Christ to crie; <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second branch of circumspection in Almes giuing here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,<note place="margin">An ill e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d in Almes-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</note> respects the ende thereof: <hi>We must not giue Almes to be seene of men,</hi> that is, to get praise and fame among men. This caueat Christ giues for waightie cause: for the corruption of mans nature through the instigation of the deuill, causeth euery one almost to doe all good works for wrong endes: why doe many men toyle themselues so much in their ordinarie callings? is it not partly for honour, partly for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, partly for profit? and doe not the most men propound this ende to themselues herein, to maintaine their families? But though this be a good and commendable thing, yet neither that, nor the rest are the right ends for which man should labour and trauell: the <hi>right ende</hi> of all, is the glorie of God in mans good, or the good of man in Gods glorie; now when our good workes proceede from an humble heart, which syncerely intends the glorie of God in mans good, then is the worke pleasing vnto God. Other endes or beginnings doe prophane mens labours: and therefore Christ giueth this caueat, to looke both to the beginning, and the ende of our Almes deedes.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the commandement; the reason of it is this: <hi>Or els ye haue no reward of your father which is in heauen:</hi> so the words are, <hi>ye haue</hi> no reward; and they are very significant, importing thus much:
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:14013:115"/>
If you doe your good workes from an humble heart, for Gods glorie in mans good, then you haue a reward laide vp for you in heauen; which though it appeares not presently, yet it is as sure as if you had it alreadie in possession: but if you doe not so, you haue no reward laide vp for you by your heauenly father.</p>
               <p>From this reason in general we may gather, that he which hath grace to doe, if it be but one good worke (as to giue Almes) vpon a good ground, and for a good ende, shall neuer perish, but shall receiue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life: which may be a notable motiue to prouoke euery man to doe good works: as also it prooues that the child of God can neuer perish or finally fall away; for nothing is lost that is laide vp with God.</p>
               <p>More particularly, first obserue that the word <hi>reward</hi> is not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but by resemblance, thus; like as a labourer after he hath done his worke receiueth his wages; so the child of God hauing don that which God commandeth him, receiueth a reward. Secondly, it it is said <hi>of your father,</hi> to signifie that this reward is not merited, but is the free gift of a father vnto his children. Lastly, Christ saith <hi>your Father,</hi> speaking to all his hearers, among whom was Iudas, whom els-where he calls a deuill, and others, whom he knew to be none of Gods children, &amp; yet beeing here a preacher and <hi>Minister of Circumcision</hi> (as the Apostle<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 15. 8.</note> speaketh) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e leaueth the secret iudgement vnto God, &amp; following the iudgement of hope and charitie, taketh all his hearers, to be the children of God: which is a notable president to all Gods Ministers, for Christ here prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of loue, practiseth it; and so ought his seruants doe. This also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the practise of those, that vpon a litle falling out will not stick to call others damned wretches, or reprobates; there is no charitie in such censures, for loue alwaies hopeth the best. 1.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, but a shew of that goodnes outwardly, which indeede is not in the heart. Now in this instance is included a second reason of the former commaundement touching the manner of Almes-giuing, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to make all Christs hearers circumspect, both for the ground and ende of their good workes: and the reason stands thus: <hi>That which hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites doe, you must not doe: but they doe their Almes to be praised of men,</hi> as is plaine in this example: <hi>and therefore you are not to giue almes to be seene and praised of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of this example we may learne these Instructions. First, that<note place="margin">A propertie of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</note> it is the propertie of an hypocrite to doe good workes for false endes; as, <hi>to be seene of men, and to be praised of men:</hi> for indeed an hypocrite in his heart makes choise not of God, but of men to be the Iudges and approouers of his good workes. And this is grosse hypocrisie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hereby the honour due to God is taken from him and giuen to men, for God ought to be the Iudge and approouer of all our actions.</p>
               <p>Now as Christ laies this sinne vpon the Scribes and Pharises, so<note place="margin">We make men, not God, the iudge of our actions.</note> ought euery one of vs to lay it on ourselues, considering our selues as we are by nature out of Christ; for so we make not God, but men the Iudges and approouers of our actions: this will hereby appeare euidently, for when we doe a good thing, and yet thereby incurre the dispraise of men, are we not more grieued thereat, then when by sinne we offend God himselfe? which could not be, but that our hearts doe more respect the censure of men, then of the Lord. And to cleare this point yet further; consider this, that the roote of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie and of Atheisme is in our nature, whereby naturally wee doe these three things, wee <hi>Loue, feare,</hi> and <hi>trust</hi> in men more then in God, and therefore doe make men the Iudges of our actions. 1. for
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:14013:116"/>
                  <hi>Loue,</hi> are wee not greeued when we our selues or our freinds are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonoured, and on the contrarie, when wee our selues or our freinds are praised, are we not glad and reioyce? but when God is dishonoured, who is greeued? or whose heart doth leape for ioye, when God is glorified? which argues plainely that our affection of loue is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined towards our selues and to our freinds then vnto God. 2. for <hi>feare;</hi> are not most men more afraide when they offend a mortall man like themselues, then when they offend the euerliuing God? 3. for <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> in the time of affliction, most men are more comforted if some friend promise them helpe, then they are by all the promises of God himselfe in his word. But men will say, that they <hi>loue</hi> and <hi>feare,</hi> and <hi>trust</hi> in God aboue all: This indeede is the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie profession of ignorant people; but the truth is, that by nature we refuse God to be our iudge and our approouer, and appeale vnto men: and therefore we must labour to see and feele and to bewaile this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, and to be indued with the contrarie grace whereby we may simply and sincerely seeke to be approoued of God in all our actions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in this example note one euident cause of the disorder<note place="margin">A maine cause of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beggers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Iewes.</note> which was among the Iewes in respect of their poore: for they begged in the high waies, in the streetes of the cities, and gates of the Temple, flat against Gods commandement, <hi>who would not haue such a begger in Israel:</hi> other occasions there were of this abuse; but one principall cause is here noted; namely, that priuate persons were permitted to giue their priuate almes vnto the poore with their owne hands in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like places. This was a great disorder, and the cause of many beggers: for priuate men could not discerne the particular wants of all that begged so; and therefore God had otherwise prouided for them in the old Testament, as he shewed before. And in the new Testament there were chosen faithfull men called <hi>Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ons</hi> in euery congregation, who were to looke-vnto their poore, to collect for them, and to distribute to euery one according to their necessitie. It is not vnlawfull for a priuate man to giue Almes in publike place if neede require: but where the poore are no otherwise prouided for, then by such priuate releefe, it is a great disorder: like as it is in a family, where the children and seruants know not where and when to haue their dinners: for the poore are Gods children in his family, and ought to be prouided for in better sort then by such priuate releefe: and therefore where good order is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for prouision for the poore, it ought in conscience to be begunne, and where it is begunne, men must carefully maintaine and continue the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:14013:117"/>Thirdly, in this example of a corrupt manner of Almes-giuing, see the concurrence of sundrie sinnes. First, here is noted <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> which<note place="margin">Sinne goes not alone.</note> were enough to condemne a man; but yet with this there goes <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and with both, an <hi>open contempt and breach of good order</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding for the poore: which shewes euidently that no sinne goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but ordinarily hath his companions: for sinnes are so infolded one in an other, that he which commits one, is not free from any other: this may plainly be shewed by many examples. In Adams sinne there was the breach of the whole law in euery commandement, either directly or by consequence: for he shewed euident want of loue to God, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing Satan more then God; therein he chose Satan for his God; he worshipped Satan, and tooke Gods name in vaine; he shewed also eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent want of brotherly loue, for hereby he became a murtherer not onely of himselfe, but of all his posteritie: and thus doe sinnes concurie in euery wicked action, in which regard it may be said with <note n="g" place="margin">Iam. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Iames,</hi> that <hi>he which faileth in one commandement, is guiltie of all:</hi> which must admonish vs to make conscience of euery sinne: for we cannot liue in any one, but we must needes runne into many other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uerely I say vnto you, they haue their reward.</hi> These words containe the reason of the former prohibition, wherein we may see the vanitie of this giuing of Almes: for the praise of men is all their reward; they haue none with God, as we shewed in the former verse.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="verse">

                     <p>But when thou doest thine Almes, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth:</p>

                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>These words containe Christs second commandement touching the <hi>manner</hi> of Almes-giuing, with the reason thereof. The commandement is in the third verse, and it beareth this sense; that if the left hand could<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> vnderstand, yet it should not know what our right hand gaue; and therefore much more must we conceale the same from men. Yet here Christ forbids not all giuing of Almes in open place, or in the sight of men, but his meaning is to restraine the ambition of the heart after the praise of men: the giuer must not intend or desire that men should see him giue Almes, that they might praise him: but his heart must simply and sincerely seeke to approoue it selfe vnto God. This will appeare to be the right meaning of our Sauiour Christ, by comparing this verse with the first: for here Christ renueth the commandement there giuen, and forbiddeth the corrupt desire of the heart after vaine glorie in the giuing of almes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:14013:117"/>Now for our better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnderstanding of this commandement, first, we will shew what is here forbidden; and secondly what is commanded. Here are two things forbidden; first, all desire or intention of mens beholding of vs, when we giue our Almes: secondly, all respect and intent to please our selues in Almes-giuing: for the left hand must not know what the right hand giueth: The thing here commaunded is this, that he which giues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Almes, must doe it simply intending and desiring onely to please God, and to approoue his worke vnto God without all by-respects of mens praise or approbation.</p>
               <p>Here then first is condemned the doctrine of the Church of<note place="margin">Vse. 1. Rhem. on Matth. 6. sect. 2.</note> Rome, which teacheth men to doe good workes, with opinion of meriting life euerlasting thereby at the handes of God; for that is farre more then to doe them for this ende to get praise of men, which yet is here forbidden; and therefore the other must needes be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>
               <p>Secondly, seeing in our weldoing we must simply intend to approoue<note place="margin">2</note> our selues vnto God, it shall not be amisse here to shew, how we<note place="margin">How to doe good works well.</note> may so doe our good workes that God may approoue thereof. Hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to foure things are required; <hi>faith, loue, humilitie,</hi> and <hi>sinceritie</hi> or <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie.</hi> For the first, in euery good worke there must be a two-fold faith: <hi>Iustifying faith;</hi> and <hi>a generall faith. Iustifying faith,</hi> whereby<note place="margin">1. in faith.</note> the person doing the worke must be reconciled to God, and stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God a true member of Christ: for of this it is said, <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>without faith it it is impossible to please God.</hi> And Christ saith, <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>every bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch that beareth not friute in me, the father taketh a way: and without me yee can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> where it is plaine, that whosoeuer would doe a worke accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, must first be in Christ: and the reason is euident; for first the person working must be acceptable to God, before his worke can be approoued: but no mans person is approoued of God, before he be in Christ; and therefore iustifying faith whereby we are vnited vnto Christ is cheifely necessarie. By <hi>generall faith</hi> I meane that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man beleeues that the worke he doth is pleasing vnto God. Hereof <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 14. 23</note> saith, <hi>Whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne.</hi> A worke may be good in it selfe, and yet sinnefull in the doer, if he want this generall faith. Now vnto this are two things required: first, a word of God commanding the worke, and prescribing the manner of doing it: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a promise of blessing vpon the doing of it: for euery good work hath his promise, both of the things of this life, and of a better: these things must be knowne and beleeued: vpon these grounds we must pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giue Almes, and doe euery good worke, and so shall they be
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:14013:118"/>
approoued of God. Now by this double faith required in euery good worke, we see, how those that are bound to practise good works, (as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one is more or lesse) ought to labour to be acquainted with the word of God, that they may doe their works in faith: for els though the worke be good, it may be sinne in them because it is not of faith; which is the miserable state of ignorant persons, who through want of faith, cannot doe good workes in a good manner.</p>
               <p>The second thing required, in the doing of a good worke, is <hi>loue;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. in loue.</note> loue (I say) ioyned with faith; for <hi>faith worketh by loue: Gal.</hi> 5. 9. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed faith doth some things of it selfe; as apprehend, receiue, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie Christ and his righteousnes to the beleeuer, which is the proper worke of faith. But other things it doth by the helpe of an other: and so faith bringeth forth the workes of mercie, and performeth the duties of the first and second table; not properly by it selfe, but by the helpe of loue: and therefore here I say, that in euery good worke is required that loue whereby faith worketh. Now the kinds of loue, required in wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing are two: first the loue of God in Christ, for as we know God in Christ, so must we loue him: secondly, the loue of our bretheren, yea of our enimies: for howsoeuer in our vnderstanding these two may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, yet in practise they must neuer be seuered: but must alwaies goe hand in hand, to mooue vs to doe the workes of mercie, and all the duties of our calling; as Paul saith of himselfe and the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <hi>The loue of God constraineth vs to preach the Gospel,</hi> 2. Cor. 5. 14.</p>
               <p>The third thing required in doing a good worke well, is <hi>humilitie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</note> whereby a man esteemeth himselfe, to be but a voluntarie and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able instrument of God therein. This vertue will make a man giue the honour of the worke to the principall Agent, that is to God himselfe: who worketh in vs both to will and to doe of his good pleasure.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing required in wel-doing, is <hi>simplicitie,</hi> or <hi>singlenes</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. in simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</note> 
                  <hi>of heart;</hi> whereby a man in doing a good worke intendeth simply and directly to honour and please God, without all by-respects to his owne praise, or the pleasing of men. This is a speciall vertue directing a man to the right ende in euery good worke, which is the obedience and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God in mans good. This vertue was in <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 12</note> who <hi>in simplicitie and godly purenesse had his conuersation in the world:</hi> thus he preached the Gospel: and so ought we to doe euery good worke. Now that this sinceritie may shew it selfe, we must take heede of a speciall vice which is contrarie vnto it, namely, the <hi>guile of the spirit,</hi> mentioned Psal. 32. 2.<note place="margin">Spirituall guile in wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.</note> which maketh a man intend and propound false ends and by-regards in doing good workes; as his owne praise and delight, or to please men
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:14013:118"/>
thereby. And that we may auoid this spirituall guile, we are to know, that it may and doth vsually preuaile with men in foure cases: I. when<note place="margin">It preuailes in 4 cases.</note> those doe practise vertue in whome God onely restraines the contrarie<note place="margin">1</note> vice: thus ciuill honest men that haue no religion, may practise iustice, temperance, mercie, and other morall vertues, because they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to iniustice, intemperance, and the contrarie vices: but these acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in them are no good works before God, because they proceede not from sanctified hearts, sincerely intending to obey &amp; glorifie God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. II. When men doe good works for feare of diuine iustice, and the<note place="margin">2</note> penalties of mens laws: and such for the most part is the repentance of the sicke: I graunt indeede that some doe truly repent in this estate, but commonly such repentance is vnsound, and proceedeth not from a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle heart, but from feare; whereby, being vnder Gods hand, they seek to auoid his iudgement. Such also are the outward duties of religion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by our common Protestants, who come to Church, and receiue the Sacraments chiefly for custome sake, and to auoide the daunger of mens lawes. III. When men doe good works for the honour &amp; praise<note place="margin">3</note> of men. This is a dangerous thing: vpon this ground a man may preach the word, vse prayer, and professe the Gospel; yea, and be zealous for Gods glorie as <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> was: and hence it comes, that many fall away to loosenes of life from a strict profession of religion, because they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not the truth in simplicitie of heart, with purpose onely to obey &amp; please God, but rather to get the praise of men. IV. When men doe<note place="margin">4</note> good works from some corruption of heart preuailing in them; as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man is both proud and couetous, yet more proud then couetous: co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes bids him, not to giue to the poore; but yet pride desiring the praise of men preuailing in him, causeth him to giue to the poore: And so when couetousnes preuailes in a proud man, it will cause him to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from riot &amp; proud apparell, which yet his pride would perswade him vnto. In all these cases spirituall guile corrupts the worke that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise is good in it selfe: and therefore we must haue a watchfull eye vnto singlenes of heart in our well-doing, and to the rest of the vertues before named, that so we may be able to say with good conscience, that our works are such as God approoueth.</p>

                  <hi>Iames</hi> saith.

Indeede the most doe thus plead for themselues, that they vse to pray often: but the truth is, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon practise of our people in prayer, is nothing els but lippe-labour and a mocking of God: for what be their praiers, but the saying ouer the ten Commandements and the Creede, which are no praiers: yea, their repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Lords praier without vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding or deuotion, is no prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with God, when they doe it onely of custome, and rest in the worke done. But here is required an other manner of praier then this. And to incite vs vnto it, let vs consider the worthie examples of Gods seruants herein: <hi>Moses</hi> praied for the sauing of the Israelites <hi>fourtie daies and</hi>

                  <hi>fourtie nights without meat or drinke: Dauid</hi> praied <hi>seauen times a day!</hi> and our <hi>Sauiour Christ spent whole nights in prayer.</hi> Now these exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were written for our learning, to teach vs to addict our selues to this holy dutie wherein our hearts speake vnto God. The want hereof is the cause of the common Atheisme that is in the world, of iniustice, and crueltie in mens callings, of swearing, pride, &amp; backbiting in mens liues: for if men would often set themselues in the presence of God, by vnfained inuocation, the remembrance thereof would still be before their eyes, and cause them to abstaine from all these iniquities: for who beeing stained with such transgressions durst present himselfe before the maiestie of God, who is a consuming fire against all sinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, hauing <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>fierie eyes</hi> to see their sinnes, and <hi>feete of brasse</hi> to bruise them in pieces that will not repent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in this prohibition against hypocrisie in praier we may see, that to conceiue a praier, and to make profession of religion, may for the outward worke, as well be performed from pride of heart as from the grace of God: carnall men may doe it in pride, which Gods children doe by grace, as we shewed in the former point of Almes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: that therfore which Christ said of hearing the word, <hi>take heed how you heare,</hi> must be conceiued to be spoken to vs of praier and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of religion, <hi>take heed how you praie, and how you professe religion.</hi> And indeed before we pray, we ought to enter into our hearts, and there to search out our corruptions diligently, that we may be able to discerne in our selues between <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>Gods grace;</hi> and so perceiue vpon what ground we pray, that it be not from a damnable pride, but from the sauing grace of Gods holy spirit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in this prohibition Christ condemnes this false ende of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:14013:122"/>
praier, when men doe it to <hi>haue praise of men;</hi> whereby we may see, that it is a thing incident to the professors of the Gospel, to doe the duties of religion, for the approbation of men: which notably bewraies the hypocrisie of our hearts, which naturally haue more respect to men, then to the Lord, euen then when we haue to deale with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Thus did the Scribes and Pharisies, and it is to be feared, the same fault is common among vs; for men are farre more forward and carefull to performe the publike duties of religion, in the assemblies of the Church, then priuate duties, either in their families, or by themselues: Many will praie in the Church, that neuer regard priuate praier at home. Againe, in performing publike duties, men haue more care of the outward action, then of truth and sinceritie in the heart; and many stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die more for fit words to delight mens eares, then for good affections, which God approoueth; for what is the cause that many ancient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, when they come to die, know not how to commend their soules to God? Surely, this especially, that in the whole course of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, they more respected men then God; and therefore in the time of death, when they must needs deale with God indeed, they know not what to doe, nor how to behaue themselues.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Christ here reprooues their behauiour in praier, which was<note place="margin">Vnreuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in praier.</note> 
                  <hi>standing,</hi> without all humbling of themselues, either in soule or bodie. This is a thing incident to many in our congregations, who vse to shew no manner of reuerence or humilitie in the time of praier; but either stand, or fit, as though they had no need to humble themselues; or else intended onely that men should see them. But we must know, that howsoeuer the word of God prescribes no peculiar gesture in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet it is not a thing indifferent, either to vse, or not to vse, some seemely gesture of humiliation in this worship of God; but some must needes be vsed, to expresse and further the humilitie of the heart, which is chiefly required: Isay, 6. 2. the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Christ hauing forbidden hypocrisie in praier, in the former verse,<note place="margin">Sinceritie in praier.</note> doth here commaund the contrarie vertue; namely, <hi>sinceritie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

That in this place our Sauiour Christ doth not forbid publike praier in the congregation, or in publike places; for publike praier is Gods ordinance, <hi>where two or three</hi> (saith <note place="margin">Math. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, by publike<note place="margin">2</note> praier a man professeth himselfe to be a member of Gods Church, and one that seuereth himselfe from all prophane societies and companies of men in the world. Thirdly, publike praier serues to stirre vp zeale in<note place="margin">3</note> them that be cold and backward; for herein they are made acquainted with Gods blessings, they are left to see their owne wants, &amp; they haue the good example of Gods children. 2. <hi>Ground. That priuate praier</hi> (though it be Gods owne ordinance) <hi>is not here directly commanded:</hi> for looke what was forbidden in the former verse, the contrarie thereto is here commaunded; but Christ did not simply there forbid publike praier, he aimed at an higher thing therein; namely, hypocrisie, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here he commandeth not priuate praier directly, but intendeth the right manner thereof, for sinceritie, whether publike or priuate.</p>
               <p>Hauing laid downe these two grounds, I come now to the true meaning of the words. <hi>When thou praiest,</hi> that is, either thy selfe alone, or with others, <hi>enter into thy chamber, and when thou hast shut thy dore,</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:14013:123"/>
                  <hi>praie, &amp;c.</hi> that is, be as though thou diddest pray in thy closet, intending onely to approoue thy selfe, and thine heart vnto the Lord, hauing no respect to any creature in the world; for this Christ meanes by <hi>praying in a chamber, or closet;</hi> namely, that a man in praier should not respect himselfe, or any creature, but simply intend and approoue himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God onely.</p>
               <p>In the words thus explaned, we are to obserue two things; a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and a reason thereof: the commandement in these words, <hi>When thou praiest enter into thy chamber, and when thou hast shut the doore, pray vnto thy father which is in secret.</hi> This commandement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning the right disposition of the heart to God ward in our praiers, doth prescribe the true and perfect manner of praier; whereto that we may the better attaine, I will here shew how the same is performed.</p>

               <p>The <hi>duties after praier,</hi> are chiefly two; 1. Wee must call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance<note place="margin">2. duties af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter praier.</note> the praier wee made to God; if one man talke with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,

he will be so attentiue, that as neere as may be, he will remember the words that passed betweene them; and much more ought we so to doe when we talke with God: now we must thus meditate on our praiers, for this ende, that we may the better doe the thing wee aske; as we craue in praier the pardon of our sinnes, so wee must after praier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to leaue the practise of them. What a horrible shame is it for men to begge at Gods hands the pardon of sinne, and when they rise from praier, to fall againe to the practise of it? This is with the <note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>dogge to returne to his vomite,</hi> and with the desperate thiefe to stealing, after he hath intreated fauour of the Iudge. 2. After praier, wee must bee<note place="margin">2</note> carefull to be as plentifull in thanksgiuing for blessings receiued, as wee were in petition to craue them. This indeede may bee done in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our praier, though here I mention it last, but omitted it may not be. Ordinary men haue this humanitie, that where they find friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, they will be more plentifull in rendring thankes, then in making new requests; and if we deale thus with men, shall wee not much more doe it with God, with whom true thankfulnesse for one blessing, is a speciall meanes to procure many moe? Now this thankfulnesse must not be onely in word, but in deed testified by due obedience, in life and conuersation: and these are the duties whereby a man shall auoide all carnall ostentation in praier, and approoue his heart vnto God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>

Secondly, that our common people come farre short of their dutie in this part of Gods worship: for their praiers consist chiefly in the bare repetition of words, which is onely a lip-labour, they pray without knowledge and feeling, &amp; so must needes faile in many other duties. Now this bewraies the manifold wants that be in the praiers of the best Christians, for besides their ignorance of many duties in praier, their doubting and distrust, their dulnesse and deadnesse of heart, and their by-thoughts, doe all shew that their hearts
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14013:124"/>
are not wholly taken vp with Gods glorie, as they ought to be. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Against spels and charmes</note> hereby we may see the grosse ignorance of our common people, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout spels and charmes; because they consist of good wordes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny strange things are done thereby, therefore they thinke them to bee good praiers: but herein they are deceiued, through ignorance in the right forme of praier; for they that make them and vse them, are either gracelesse persons that haue societie with the deuil, or grosly deluded through palpable ignorance: and they cannot set themselues before God, to approoue their hearts vnto him in this action: nay, the worship that is done herein, is to the deuill, and the cure that is wrought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, is his worke; for these charmes are his watch-word, to stirre him vp to such exploits.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, in this clause, <hi>Pray vnto thy Father which is in secret,</hi> that is, an inuisible God, is couched a reason to induce men to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of this commandement, to this effect; <hi>He to whom thou praiest, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>man of thy heart vnto him.</hi> Hence I gather, first, that it is an horrible thing, to make an image to represent the true God, or to worship God in it; for God is inuisible. The second commandement condemneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, as <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe doth so expound it, Deut. 4. 15, 16. <hi>Ye saw no Image in the day that the Lord spake vnto you in Horeb, therefore cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt not your selues by making you a grauen image, or representation of any signe.</hi> Secondly, that there should be no outward pompe in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, either for gesture, or for garments; for praier is made to an inuisible Father. This ouerthrowes the whole worship of the Popish Church, which stands in outward shews of carnall pompe; if there be any pomp, it must be inward, in the graces of the heart, among which, humilitie is the first ornament. Thirdly, that all places are alike, in respect of Gods<note place="margin">No differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of place in regard of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</note> presence, and of his hearing; for hee is a God in secret, wheresoeuer a man hath occasion to praie, there God is: which confuteth them that make the Church a more holy place for praier, then other-where, and therefore reserue all their praiers till they come thither; for now diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of place, in respect of Gods presence, is taken away: God is as well in the fielde, and in the priuate house, as in the Church: and yet Churches are ordained and vsed in a godly policie, because a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may more conueniently there meete, to their mutuall edification, in the publike exercise of the word and praier; otherwise priuate hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were as good places for Gods worship, as Churches, if they were so decent, and conuenient for edification: for <hi>in all places men may lift vp pure hands vnto God,</hi> as the Apostle <note n="a" place="margin">1.

                  <hi>And thy father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</hi> These words containe a two-fold reason, wherby Christ perswadeth his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and in them all others, to the carefull practise of the former dutie, of sinceritie in praier. The first reason is drawne from Gods <hi>All-seeing propertie:</hi> the second, from his <hi>bountie.</hi> Gods all-seeing propertie is set out in these words; <hi>&amp; the father which seeth in secret:</hi> that is, though the father himselfe be inuisible, yet when thou praiest in secret, that is, as though thou wert in secret, intending onely to approoue thine heart vnto God in praier, then thy father seeth thee, he knowes thine heart, and heares thy praier. This is verefied by the example of <hi>Ionas,</hi> who was heard praying in the Whales bellie; of <hi>Daniel,</hi> praying in the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons denne; and of <hi>Moses,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 14. 15.</note> who is said to <hi>crie</hi> vnto the Lord, when as he praied onely in heart.</p>
               <p>The vse of this point is manifold. 1. It serueth to admonish vs that<note place="margin">Vse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 1.</note> when wee pray, wee must in singlenesse of heart, bring our selues into Gods presence, and heartily and truely put vp our requests vnto God, so as we may approoue vnto him, both our hearts and our prayers; for there is nothing in our prayers that can be hid from God: and therefore we must not content our selues with the thing done, but labour so to pray, that God may be well pleased with the manner thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hereby we are taught to make conscience, not only of our<note place="margin">2</note> doings and speeches, but euen of our very thoughts, and that in secret places; for though we may conceale the same from men, yet we cannot couer them from the eies of God: he is inuisible, and yet <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 4. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>all things are naked before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this prooueth that no prayer can lawfully be made to the<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Praier to Saints vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</note> virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> or to any other Saint departed; for he alone is to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon in praier, who sees in secret: but God onely sees in secret, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> nor any other of the Saints can see in secret; and therefore praier is to be made to none but to God alone. The Papists<note place="margin">Rhem. on Luk. 15. sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> answer, that Saints departed see in secret, though not of themselues, yet by God, and in God; but that is false: the Angels before their fall saw not their own future fal, nor the fall of man. The blessed Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, know not now the time and day of the last iudgement; yea, &amp; the Saints departed lie vnder the Altar, crying, <note n="d" place="margin">Leu. 6. 9. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>how long Lord?</hi> beeing ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the time of their full redemption: and therfore the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted see not in secret.</p>
               <p>The second reason drawne from Gods promised bountie, is in these words, <hi>shall reward thee openly;</hi> that is, shall repay thee for thy praier in the day of iudgement, before the Saints and holy Angels, as we expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:14013:125"/>
the same words in the fourth verse. This is a notable reason to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men to pray in a true and holy manner; wherein we may see the endlesse mercie of God, vouchsafed to them that pray aright: if any subiect put vp a supplication to his earthly Prince, he takes it for a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauour, if the Prince vouchsafe to admit him to his presence: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here the King of Kings, will not onely vouchsafe vs accesse vnto the throne of his grace, when wee put vp our supplications vnto him, but if we pray aright, he doth hold himselfe indebted vnto vs for the same, and promiseth one day to reward vs openly. This far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e exceedes the loue of all creatures in heauen and earth, no Prince is so kinde and gratious to his best subiects, as the Lord is to all that call vpon him in spirit and truth.</p>
               <p>From this place the Papists would gather, that prayer is a worke<note place="margin">Rhem. on this cha. sect. 2. Bellar. de bonis oper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in parti. l. 1. c. 3.</note> that merits at Gods hand eternall life, for thus they reason; <hi>Where there is repaying by way of reward, there is something done which meriteth: but vnto prayer there is a repaying, therefore it doth merit at Gods hand. Answ.</hi> Reward is due to man two waies, either by desert, or of free gift and promise; now in this place God will reward man for his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, not for their desert, but of his owne free will and grace, because he hath promised so to doe. That this is so, may thus appeare; If a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger should aske an almes of any man, it were absurd to say, that the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by asking did deserue the almes: and so stands the case for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our prayers; thereby we beg things at Gods hands, and therefore can no more merit thereby, then the begger can deserue his almes by asking: nay rather, we may gather hence, that Gods rewarding them that pray, proceedes from his owne free grace alone; for prayer proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is a worke of man vnto God, wherein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man giues nothing vnto God, as the Iewes did in the sacrifices, or as is done in some other spiritual sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the new Testament; but onely asketh and receiueth some thing from God, and therefore cannot hereby merit any thing at Gods hands. And by this may all other places be expounded, where reward is promised to mans worke.</p>
               <p>Lastly, note the phrase here vsed; <hi>he shall reward thee openly:</hi> that is, at the last day: whence I gather, that till the day of iudgement, no seruant of God shall fully reape the fruite and benefit of his praiers. This must bee well considered, of all that haue care to call vpon God vnfainedly; for many times after long and earnest praier, we feele little or no comfort, whereby we may be brought to dislike our estate, as though God had no respect vnto vs: but we must know, that God doth often long deferre to reward his seruants that praie

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:14013:129"/>
but not according to Gods will, either failing in the time, as did the foolish virgins, who cried, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to vs, when the doores were shut:</hi> Matth. 25. 11, 12. or in the things they aske, and so the <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 20. 22</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Use.</hi> 1. This prouident eie of God ouer all our wants, teacheth<note place="margin">Christian behauiour in distresse.</note> vs what to doe when we are assaulted by any enemie, either of bodie or soule; we must first of all make God our refuge and tower of defence, by getting assurance of our adoption; for if we be Gods children, he is our father, knowing, and weighing our wants, and hee is most carefull to make supply thereto, before we pray. Gen. 25. 22. When the two twinnes stroue together in <hi>Rebek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So when <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> was beset with many enemies, <hi>he cried vnto the Lord for helpe, and was deliuered,</hi> 2. Chron. 18. 31. and Chap. 20. 12. And it was the Prophet <hi>Dauids</hi> practise to haue recourse to God in all his troubles, for which cause he calles the Lord <hi>his rocks, his resting and hiding place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, hereby wee are taught to haue a moderate care for the<note place="margin">A ground of contentatio.</note> things of this life, for wee haue a father in heauen, who careth for vs, knowing all our wants, and readie to make supply thereof, before wee pray. In these daies, most men set their hearts vpon the world, and trust to outward meanes more then to God himselfe, which comes from this; because they want a true perswasion of their adoption in Christ: for if they knew that God were their father, then surely this perswasion would take place in their hearts; <hi>God knowes my wants, and is carefull for the supply thereof, and therefore I will trust in him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Fourthly, this serues to arme vs against all carnall and slauish feare,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:14013:129"/>
whereby mens hearts are oppressed, either in regard of death, or of the day of iudgement; for though the deuill rage against vs, yet when death commeth, God is our father, who knoweth our wants, and the way to comfort vs, and is both willing and able so to doe. In a word, this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation serueth to stirre vs vp to all dutifull obedience in the whole course of our liues; for who can but bee thankfull vnto such a father, as knowes all his wants, and as he is able, so also he is willing and readie to make supply thereto: this therefore should enlarge our hearts to blesse God that is such a father vnto vs in Christ.</p>

like did <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> when he taught his disciples to pray. II. <hi>Reason.</hi> In man there be sundrie wants in prayer, as ignorance in the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,<note place="margin">2</note> distractions in the minde, obliuion in the memorie both of Gods commandement and promises; in the heart is much deadnes, dulnes, and distrust; in the tongue many times, is want of such conuenient vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance as should be in him that would speake vnto God; and in most men there is that bashfulnes, that they cannot vtter and dispose the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of their heart before others in that order which were meete. Now to make supplie of all these wants, a set forme of praier is to be vsed, whereunto all the powers of bodie and soule may be well fitted. III.<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>Reason.</hi> The ancient Church of God, long before the time of Poperie, vsed a set forme of praier: indeede for the first three hundred yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ, by reason of continuall persecution, they could not doe so, but after those times there was a set forme of praier vsed in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in so much as the souldiers in the field had their set praiers. And in many Councels it was decreed, that no Church should vse any forme of praier, but such as was allowed and appointed, and that for these causes: first, that there might be an vniformitie in the solemne worship of God: and secondly, that the ignorance and negligence of many Pastors might be preuented, who otherwise would haue omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this dutie in their congregations: and therefore there was then set downe a generall forme of Confession of faith, of praier, and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and of administration of the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Now considering set praier is Gods ordinance, and the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of man require it, and the same hath beene so long vsed in former ages, I doubt not to affirme the same to be both profitable and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; whereby we may see how blinde and rash they are, who tearme set<note place="margin">Barrow and Greenwods re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lesh was to the Iewes. These be loathsome and vnreuerend tearmes; but that we may know their follie and error the better, let vs here scanne their principall Reasons against set praier; and they be two. I. To read a sermon penned by an other is no preaching, and therefore to repeate a set praier is no praier. <hi>Ans.</hi> The reason is naught: for in reading a penned sermon a man cannot expresse the gift of prophesie; but in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a set praier he may shew the gift of praier; as namely, a touched heart for his sinnes, an hungring desire after grace, and a thankfull heart for Gods mercies; and herein doth praier consist, and not in the words. <hi>II. Reason.</hi> We must pray freely as the spirit mooues vs; and therefore to vse set formes of praier, is to stint and quench the good motions of the spirit. <hi>Ans.</hi> This reason were somewhat, if euery one receiued
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:14013:130"/>
such a portion and measure of the spirit as did inable him hereunto: but seeing in this life we haue but <hi>the first fruits</hi> thereof, and not the <hi>tenths</hi> (as one saith) we are to vse all good helps to make supplie vnto our wants: for in the practise of holy duties we are like vnto a man that is newly recouered of some grieuous sicknes, who can walke in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, yet not by himselfe alone, but either with his staffe, or leaning vpon an other mans shoulder: euen so we beeing weake and feeble in praier, had neede of the helpe of set formes of praier, to hold vp our feeble hands vnto God: and therefore it is requisite for men to vse set formes of praier, at least for the matter and order thereof in their owne hearts; yea and many times it is needefull for some, to vse set praiers for words: for many that haue true grace in their hearts, want vtterance to expresse it: and if they might not vse set formes of praier, they should be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of many great comforts, especially when they pray with others. So that if the heart be rightly prepared thereto, set praier doth not quench but helpe the weake gifts of the spirit both in the heart and tongue.</p>
               <p>By this then we see, that neither our Church, nor any other, where a set forme of diuine seruice is established, is therefore to be blamed; because the same is both necessarie and profitable. Secondly, here we see, that it is meete and necessarie we should haue some set forme of prayer in our hearts according to our peculiar estates, whereby we may expresse vnto God our particular wants, and craue supplie thereof particularly: some thinke we must onely pray vpon extraordinarie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and motion of the spirit: but so many be our wants, that vnlesse we prepare our selues before hand, we cannot pray aright: and therfore to auoid many distractions and lets in our mind, heart, and vtterance, it shall be sound needeful to prescribe vnto our selues a set forme of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: we are content to keepe a set order for our diet and apparell, and why should we not doe it in praier which concernes the comfort and refreshing of our soules.</p>
               <p>A second thing to be gathered from this commandement is this;<note place="margin">The Lords praier a most excellent forme of praier.</note> That the Lords praier is the most excellent forme of praier that is, or can be made by any creature: for it was indited and propounded by the sonne of God, who is the wisdome of the father.

Secondly, hence we see that the practise of those preachers is commendable, who vse to conclude their prayers with the Lords prayer: for hereby, as by a most perfect and excellent praier, the wants and imperfections of our prayers are supplied. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas some would gather from the perfection and excellencie of this prayer, that it alone is sufficient to be vsed, they are deceiued; for Christs intent was rather to commend this prayer vnto vs for matter and manner, then for the words thereof. Againe though it be a most perfect prayer, yet it is only generall; but euery true beleeuer must haue particular prayers, whereby in speciall forme and manner his particular estate and condition may be made knowne vnto the Lord; yet so, as they be alwaies suitable vnto this forme here prescribed. And thus much of the Commandement: Now followeth the prayer it selfe.</p>

                  <hi>I. The Meaning. Our Father</hi>] This title <hi>Father,</hi> properly belongs to God, who is a father simply, by creation giuing beeing to all things, and preseruing them by his prouidence. Men indeede are called fathers, but that is onely secondarily, because in some properties of fatherhood they resemble God. Now this title is giuen to God, sometime simply considered without personall relation; as Deut. 32. 6. <hi>Doe ye s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is a perfect patterne of true praier, wanting no direction for the right performance of this part of Gods worship; now this directs vs onely vnto God in praier. II. God onely is the author and giuer of all good things, Iam. 1. 16. and therefore we must aske them of him alone. III. The Lord onely who is infinite and omni potentican heare all mens praiers at all times,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:14013:132"/>
and in all places: and therefore he alone is to be praied vnto, and not Saints departed, as the Papists teach.</p>

And thus also must we worship him, euen one God in three persons, and three persons in one God. And yet seeing the Father is first in order, the Sonne the second, and the holy Ghost the third, therfore when we pray to God, we must obserue this order, directing our praiers to God the Father, in the mediation of the Sonne, by the assistance of the holy Ghost, as Christ here teacheth vs to say, <hi>Our father.</hi>

Euery one will say, this is the Ministers dutie: which is most true; but yet it is not his onely: for as in the naturall bodie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery member imployes it selfe for the good of the whole bodie, so must it be in the mysticall bodie of Christ: for the meanest Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath some gift of the spirit; and <hi>the manifestation of the spirit</hi> (wheresoeuer it is) <hi>is giuen to profit withall.</hi> The common saying is, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery<note place="margin">1.

               <p>III. Hence we learne, how we must come affected towards our<note place="margin">Brotherly loue need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in praier.</note> brethren when we pray to God, namely, louingly and peaceably, as to children of the same father: when we come to the Lords Table we make conscience of loue and amitie with all men; and so should we doe in praier, for therein we bring a spirituall sacrifice vnto God, and therefore we must be <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 5. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>reconciled to our brethren</hi> when we offer it: for when mens hearts be full of malice, or <hi>their hands full of blood,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Isa. 1. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>God will not heare them, though they make many prayers.</hi> If therefore we call vpon God as on our father, we must be sine to loue his children as our brethren; for <note n="c" place="margin">1. Ioh. 4. 21</note> 
                  <hi>this commandement we haue of God, that he which loueth God, should loue his brother also; and he is not of God, that loueth not his brother,</hi> 1. Ioh. 3. 10.</p>
               <p>IIII. Here we see that all true beleeuers whether high or lowe,<note place="margin">Fatherhood in God, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual towards all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers.</note> poore or rich, are in an equall condition in regard of God; for God is no respecter of persons: and here Christ teacheth euery one to say, <hi>Our father.</hi> In earthly kingdomes there be differences of estates and degrees; some be noble, some base; some rule, others serue and obey; but <hi>with God in Christ there is neither bond nor free, &amp;c. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loss.</hi> 3. 11. The beleeuing shepheard may call God his father, as well as the beleeuing King, and haue as good a place in Christs kingdome. Which serues notably both to encourage the poore to embrace the Gospel in sinceritie, seeing their meane outward estate can nothing preiudice or hinder their high acceptance with the Lord, if they be faithfull: as also to admonish the rich and noble in this world, not to bee puffed vp with these outwarde thinges to contemne the poore;
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:14013:134"/>
for these things giue them no title to the kingdome of God: nay, <note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>not many noble, nor mightie after the flesh are called: but God hath chosen the poore of this world, that they should be rich in faith.</hi> Iam. 2. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which art in heauen</hi>] These words shewe towardes what place we must dispose our selues in praier: our father to whome we pray <hi>is in heauen,</hi> and therefore thither must we direct our hearts, our eyes, our hands, and all that is in vs. Indeede the Iewes vnder the law looked towards the Temple, and in the Temple towards the mercie-seat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord had there promised the manifestation of his presence, and therefore <note n="i" place="margin">Dan. 6. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> turned his face towardes Ierusalem when he praied in Chaldea: but now in the new Testament difference of place in respect of Gods presence, is taken away, and we are not tyed in praier to looke, East or West, North or South, but men may now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where and euery way lift vp pure hearts and hands vnto God: towardes heauen thou must dispose thy heart, because thy father to whome thou praiest is there: and looke which way thou wilt, or goe whither thou wilt, heauen is not nearer nor further off. Which shewes euidently two notable and grosse Popish fooleries in the matter of<note place="margin">Two popish fooleries.</note> Gods worship; the first is, their <hi>going on pilgrimage</hi> from place to place to serue God the better: for God whome thou must worship is in heauen, in respect whereof all places are alike, goe whither thou wilt thou art not nearer, and stirre no foote, thou art not further off. Their second foolerie, which is also abominable before God, <hi>is to worship God in an Image, at Crosses, and in Crucisixes, &amp;c.</hi> these they vse to put them in minde of God, and of Christ; but this they learne by the precepts and traditions of men, and therefore it is but meere vaine and foolish worship in the sight of God: Christ teacheth vs to set our hearts towardes heauen, and not to po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:14013:134"/>
an action, done to so high a maiestie. Thirdly, in the humble and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend vttering of our requests, hauing before hand well considered the things we are to vtter before God. But goes the case thus with men in their ordinarie praiers? nothing lesse; for beside the multitude that pray without vnderstanding, euen the better sort in the time of praier, haue their minds running vpon other matters, some about their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, others about their sports, or such like: now is not this pharisaicall praier, wherein the lippes draw neare to God, but the heart is farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued? Againe, many shew no reuerence in gesture or in speach, some disdaine to bow to God in prayer, and others doe rush vpon God in many words without premeditation: But all these sinne grieuously, for howsoeuer vnreuerent praying troubles few mens consciences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not easily discerned, beeing against the first table, yet it is to be esteemed as a disgrace vnto the Almightie: and beeing carelesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practised, when it is once knowne, it is plaine mockerie of Gods maiestie, worser then mocking of father or mother: and therefore we must with all carefulnes auoide it, and set our hearts with all reuerence towards God in prayer.</p>
               <p>III. Hence we must learne to aske of God in prayer heauenly<note place="margin">What we must aske of God in prai er.</note> things especially: these earthly blessings may be asked, so farre forth as they are helpes to further vs towardes our euerlasting inheritance in heauen, to which we are called, 1. Pet. 1. 3, 4. But to be euer groue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the earth, is against the nature of him that hath a father in heauen.</p>
               <p>IIII. Our principall care must be how to come to heauen, for<note place="margin">Our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards heauen.</note> there our father is: ordinarily a child desires to be with his father, and is best pleased on his mothers lappe, or in his fathers armes: herein therefore we must testifie our selues to be the sonnes and daughters of God, by our vnfained desire to be in heauen where our father is. It is vnnaturall for a child not to be delighted with his fathers house, and so it argues them to be void of grace, that haue no affection towards heauen and heauenly things: let vs therefore delight to pray, whereby we may creepe into our fathers bosome, and though our bodies be on earth, yet in affection and desire let our soules mount vp to heauen: here we are but pilgrimes, if God be our father, our hearts must be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our home which is heauen where our father is.</p>
               <p>Now the words of this preface thus opened, containe a twofold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table<note place="margin">A double pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to our praiers.</note> ground and proppe to all our praiers: to wit, that God is both <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to heare and helpe when we pray: for his beeing <hi>in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> imports that he is almightie, and therefore can heare and helpe vs:
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:14013:135"/>
                  <hi>our God is in heauen, and be doth whatsoeuer he will.</hi> And beeing a <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 215. 3.</note> yea our father in Christ, he must needes be willing and readie to graunt our requests: for no father is so tenderly affected towardes his naturall sonne, as the Lord our God is towardes all his children in Christ: Psal. 103. 13. <hi>As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on all that call vpon him:</hi> Luk. 11. 13. <hi>If you that be euill can giue good things to your children, much more shall your heauenly father giue the holy Ghost to them that aske him:</hi> and hence it is that Christ saith, <hi>Whatsoeuer you aske the Father in my name he will giue it you,</hi> Ioh. 16. 23. Of these two must euery one be perswaded that praies aright: euery one will graunt that God is able to heare and helpe; but of his willingnesse thereunto none can be assured but he that is the child of God, who knoweth God to be his father. Yet here must none deceiue himselfe, to thinke that whatsoeuer he askes on his owne head, God will graunt it, for if we aske amisse we shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue; and therefore we must carefully marke and obserue the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Gods word both for the things we aske, and for our manner of asking.</p>
               <q>Halowed be thy name.</q>
               <p>Thus much of the preface: here begin the petitions, which are sixe in number; whereof the three first concerne God, the three latter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our selues. Againe, of those which concerne God, the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes Gods glorie it selfe, the other two the meanes whereby Gods glorie is manifested and inlarged among men: for <hi>Gods name is the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> glorified among men, when his kingdome doth come, and his will is done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this petition for the glorifying of Gods name, is rightly set in the first place: for Gods glorie is the absolute end of all things: Prov. 16. 4. <hi>The Lord made all things for his owne sake, yea euen the wicked for the day of euill:</hi> and therefore it must be preferred before all things: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore life it selfe, yea before saluation which is life eternall: Ioh. 12. 27, 28. our Sauiour Christ preferres the glorie of his fathers name before his owne life. And <hi>Paul</hi> preferres it afore his owne saluation: for he professeth that for Gods glorie in the saluation of the Iewes, <hi>he could wish himselfe separate from Christ,</hi> Rom. 9. 3.</p>
               <p>In this petition, as in the rest, we are to obserue this order: first shew the meaning of the words; then propound the vses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I. The meaning. Name</hi> The word ascribed to God is here taken generally; first, for <hi>God himselfe;</hi> as Psal. 20. 1. <hi>The name of the God of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods name.</note> 
                  <hi>defend thee:</hi> that is, the God of Iacob defend thee: Rom. 10. 13. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shal cal vpon the name of the Lord, shal be saued;</hi> i. vpon the Lord.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:14013:135"/>
Secondly, it here betokens any thing whereby <hi>God may be knowne,</hi> as men are by their names: and thus it comprehends, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. his <hi>diuine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes;</hi> as Iustice, mercie, power, wisdome, &amp;c. II. his <hi>word,</hi> the holy scriptures which reveale to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true knowledge of God. III. Gods <hi>Iudgements,</hi> publike or priuate; for thereby he makes knowne his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, his power, and iustice. IV. his <hi>workes</hi> and <hi>creatures;</hi> for all these beare a stampe of Gods name, and in them may the inuisible things of God be seene, Rom. 1. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Halowed,</hi> or <hi>sanctified</hi> To <hi>halow Gods name,</hi> is to glorifie Gods name, as Ioh. 12. 28. and this we doe, when we giue vnto him the highest honour that may be: the highest I say, because there are two kinds of<note place="margin">Two kinds of honour. 1. Religious.</note> honour; First, the honour of religion, when we giue our hearts to God, louing him, fearing him, trusting, and delighting in him aboue all; which we testifie by all outward adoration prescribed in Gods word: this is the highest honour of all. Secondly, there is the honour of societie,<note place="margin">2. Ciuill.</note> which passeth betweene man and man, in common wealths; and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the acknowledgement of preheminence and superioritie in another, either by word or gesture, ciuilly: thus Subiects honour Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Magistrates; and inferiours, their superiours. This is due to the creature; the former to the Creator onely, and that is the honour wee here pray for.</p>
               <p>That we may yet the better vnderstand the meaning of this petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">How we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Gods name. 1. in himselfe.</note> we must know that Gods name is halowed or sanctified of vs 2. waies; either in God himselfe, or in his works: In himselfe by 3. actions; 1. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we conceiue of God in our mindes, and acknowledge him as he hath reuealed himselfe in his word; to wit, creator &amp; gouernour of al things, most holy, most wise, iust, mercifull. &amp;c. 2. When <hi>we</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>sanctifie the Lord in our hearts:</hi> that is, when we loue him aboue all, &amp; feare him aboue al, &amp; put our trust in him in him in all estates. 3. When we praise and laud the name of God, for his goodnes; yea, though we should neuer taste of his special fauour, yet for his generall mercie, iustice, and most wise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, we ought to extoll the Lord with our mouthes.</p>
               <p>Gods name is halowed or sanctified in his creatures, by three speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all<note place="margin">2. in his creatures.</note> actions: 1. When we acknowledge the wisdome of God, &amp; his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull hand in euery creature. 2. When we haue a reuerend estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the creatures, and vse them in Christian sobrietie, in regard of the stampe of Gods power and wisedome, which appeareth in them. 3. When wee sanctifie our moderate vse of them, by the word and praier, as God requireth, 1. Tim. 4. 5. See the practise hereof in the word of God, which is his owne solemne ordinance, whereby he makes
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:14013:136"/>
himselfe knowne vnto his Church: Therein we sanctifie and halow Gods name: I. when we acknowledge the wisdome, mercie, &amp; power<note place="margin">Howe we sanctifie God in his word.</note> of God in it: II. when we haue a reuerend estimation of the word in regard of the glorious Image of God which appeareth in it. III. when we vse it in a sanctified and holy manner, comming vnto it reuerently with prepared hearts, hungring after the graces of God which are wrought thereby, and giuing our selues in heart and life to be framed and ruled thereby. And thus we sanctifie God in afflictions (for they are his worke) when we labour to see the hand of God therein, in iustice, mercie, and great wisdome chastening vs, when we haue a reuerend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the hand of God appearing in them; and labour to be humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereby for the increase of our repentance, and the exercise of our faith and patience.</p>
               <p>Thus then in this petition we desire in minde, in heart, and life, to glorifie God both in himselfe and in his works: and the meaning of it may be thus expressed: <hi>O Lord, open our eyes that we may know thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and may discerne thy power, wisdome, iustice, and mercy; and inlarge our hearts that we may sanctifie thee in our hearts, by making thee our feare, loue, ioy, and confidence: and open our lippes that we may blesse thee for thine infinite goodnesse: yea, O Lord, open our eyes that we may see thee in thy work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and strike our hearts with reuerence of thy name appearing in them: and graunt that when we vse any one of them, we may honour thee in our sober and sanctified vse thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vses. I. Wants to be bewayled.</p>
               <p>I. Here we are to call to minde our wants, and to humble our soules<note place="margin">Sinnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning Gods name.</note> for those sinnes, whereby we haue hindred Gods glorie or prophaned his name. And these especially are foure: I. <hi>Pride of heart;</hi> a vile affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereby we seeke our owne praise and glorie, and not Gods. This is naturall, and so the more hardly discerned; but while it is nouri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hed Gods glorie is neglected, and therefore when we desire <hi>to glorifie Gods name,</hi> we must acknowledge and bewaile this inward corruption. II. <hi>Want of zeale, coldnesse</hi> of heart towards God. This is an inward cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which debaseth the Lord in our hearts, and takes away that high esteeme of God which ought to be in vs. This causeth vs to omit to glorifie God, and to defend the causes of God, and the honour of his name, when wicked men disgrace and reproch the same: he that hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny insight into his owne estate may perceiue this in himselfe: now it mightily hinders the glorie of God, and therefore we must vnfainedly bewaile it in our own hearts. III. <hi>Hardnesse of heart,</hi> whereby we are hindred from the true knowledge of God in his word, and from discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:14013:136"/>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>er we neglect the word, and passe by the workes of God without consideration; or if we vse them, yet it is without glorie to God, or profit to our soules. Mark. 6. 5. <hi>Christs owne disciples considered not the matter of the loaues, because their hearts were hardened;</hi> they discerned not, or at least remembred not the power of God in that miracle, though themselues were instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about it, and they might perceiue the foode to increase in their hands. IV. <hi>Prophanenesse and impietie in life:</hi> for God is <hi>glorified,</hi> when we bring forth the <hi>fruits of grace,</hi> Ioh. 15. 8. and our <hi>good workes</hi> cause others to glorifie God, Math. 5. 16. And therefore our prophane life is a reproach vnto the Lord, and causeth others to dishonour and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheme his name, Rom. 2. 24. Now this prophannesse appeareth, either in mens speach, by blaspheming the name of God, abusing his tides, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, his word, his creatures, or any worke of his prouidence; or in their conuersation, when they dispose the whole course of their liues to wrong ends, seeking themselues and not Gods glorie.</p>
               <p>These are the speciall sinnes against Gods glorie, which we are to see and to bewaile in our owne hearts: if we see them not in our selues our case is the worse, and we must suspect our selues the mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: if we por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them in vs, we must be humbled for them, yea ashamed and confounded in our owne hearts, thinking euill of our selues by reason hereof: and then shall we be able to say with some truth of heart, <hi>O Lord, halowed be thy name.</hi> And indeede till we be inwardly humbled for these corruptions in some measure, the heart can neuer speake these words as a sonne and daughter of God ought to doe.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Use. Graces to be desired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this petition teacheth vs, earnestly to desire of God those<note place="margin">Graces ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling vs to glorify God.</note> spirituall graces whereby we may glorifie his name in our selues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The graces enabling vs hereto, are these especially. I. The true <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> as he hath reuealed himselfe in his word, and in the workes of his power and prouidence: for he that knowes not God cannot possibly glorifie his name. II. To <hi>sanctifie God in our hearts;</hi> by louing, fearing, and tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ting in him aboue all. This makes greatly for his glorie, when wee depende vpon him in soule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for all good things. III. The <hi>calves of our lips,</hi> which is a sacrifice of praise to God for all his mercies; Psal. 50. 23. <hi>He that offereth praise shall glorifie me.</hi> IV. To <hi>see Gods hand</hi> in all his workes, how mightie, wise, iust, and gratious the Lord is. V. To <hi>reuerence the workes of God</hi> for his iustice, mercie, power, &amp;c. appearing in them. VI. To <hi>vse all</hi>

                  <hi>his creatures reuerently,</hi> sanctifying the same vnto our selues by the word and praier.</p>
               <p>These graces we must hunger after, and labour to haue a liuely fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of in our owne hearts, and so shall we sanctifie Gods name, and honour him in all his workes. And hereby we shall know our selues to be the sonnes and daughters of God: we may indeede belong to God in his secret counsell; but without these sanctified affections and holy actions, we are not effectually called, and so indeede not actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Gods children.</p>

                     </gap>ies wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may glorifie god.</note> the same in our conuersation. For this ende we must haue regard to three things:</p>
               <p>I. That our liues be vnblameable, not tainted with any sinne, that as<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> said of earthly seruants, <hi>They must count their masters worthie all</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim 6. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>honour, that the name of God be not euill spoken of;</hi> so the same may be verified in euery one of vs towards the Lord our master in heauen. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way therefore with all Idolatrie, blasphemous oathes, and cursed spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, with Sabbath breaking, and all other sinnes against the second table: for a prophane life brings great reproach vpon the name of God which men professe.</p>
               <p>II. We must propound the right ende of our life euery day in our<note place="margin">2</note> calling and conuersation, to wit, Gods honour and glorie, and not our owne praise, wealth, pleasure, or dignitie.</p>
               <p>III. When God offers occasion by any worke of his prouidence,<note place="margin">3</note> we must endeauour therein to glorifie and magnifie God: example; say God sendes a gricuous dearth and famine of bread among vs, or the plague of pestilence, as he hath done sundrie times; then must we striue herein to glorifie and praise Gods name: first, by labouring to see the hand of God smitiag vs for our sinnes: secondly, by reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the worke of God, esteeming it as his hand vpon vs: thirdly, by humbling our selues vnto God, and renuing our repentance for our sinnes, that haue brought Gods iudgements vpon vs. Thus should we glorifie God in his Iudgements; but alas, such is our blindnesse and securitie, that though Gods hand be vpon vs, yet few lay it to heart; where is he that saith, <note n="a" place="margin">Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

so as Gods name is dishonoured in his iudgements. So when Gods blessings are vpon vs, we should glorifie his name, by labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to see his hand of mercie; and esteeming of them reuerently, with praise and thanksgiuing to God that is the giuer: but herein also men dishonour God, by poaring vpon the meanes, praising their owne witte and industrie, and so <hi>sacrifice to their nets,</hi> as the <note n="c" place="margin">Hab. 1. 15, 16.</note> Prophet saith.</p>
               <p>Now because this dutie is of great waight and importance, I<note place="margin">Motiues to glorifie god.</note> will adde some speciall reasons to mooue vs hereunto: I. from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie<note place="margin">1</note> hereof in Gods Church and children: for Gods name is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonoured ouer all the world. In the great dominions of the Turke, God is acknowledged, but yet out of the Trinitie: And the Iewes confessing God, denie Christ: The Papists in word confesse and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Trinitie; but yet by their Idolatrie they greatly robbe God of his glorie, they robbe Christ of his offices, and giue diuine worshippe vnto creatures. And in the bosome of the Church are many Atheists, blasphemers, oppressors, drunkards, adulterers, and voluptuous persons, whose bellie is their God; all which, though they will professe God in word, yet by their workes they denie him; so that vnlesse Gods children seeke to maintaine and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance Gods glorie, it is like to be trampled and troden vnder foote. II. There is great daunger to Gods children in omitting and negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting<note place="margin">2</note> this dutie; for by calling they are brought neare vnto God: now God will be glorified in all that come neare him: if we doe not honour him according to our profession, his hand will be vpon vs for his glorie in our confusion: hence it was, that God slew <note n="d" place="margin">Lev. 10. 1, 2.</note>

                  <hi>because they glorified him not at the waters of strife.</hi> This made the wrath of God to burne like fire against the house of <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitic of his sonnes, which their father saw in them, and yet staied them not, and so honoured them aboue the Lord.</hi> We had neede therefore to looke vnto our selues, that we glorifie God in himselfe and in his workes, els his hand will be vpon vs in soule or bodie, goods, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or some other way for the glorie of his iustice: for God will not loose his glorie. III. If wee say, <hi>Halowed be thy name</hi> with our<note place="margin">3</note> mouth, and seeke not his honour in our life, we bewray in our selues damnable hypocrisie, and make profession of that sinne which the Lord vtterly detesteth: we esteeme very basely of dissemblers among men; but much more edious is this sinne in the matters of God:
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:14013:138"/>
and therefore let the practise of our liues, shew the sinceritie of our hearts, when we pray for the glorifying of Gods name.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this petition teacheth vs, that wee our selues must bee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed<note place="margin">4. Vse. We must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be sanctified.</note> and sanctified, for else we cannot halow Gods name: <hi>They that beare the vessels of the Lord,</hi> in his sanctuarie, <hi>must be clean,</hi> Isay 52. 11. How much more ought they to be holy, that beare the glorious name of God? When <hi>Ananias</hi> doubted of going to <hi>Paul,</hi> the Lord tels him, <note n="g" place="margin">Act. 9. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>he is a chosen vessel vnto me to beare my name:</hi> alluding to that state of sanctification, whereto the Lord had lately called him, whereby hee made him a fit instrument for the glorie of his name, in the ministerie of the Gospel. And the same state must we labour after, if we would be answerable to that we seeme to desire in this petition. We must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour to be new creatures, changed in minde and heart, for an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy person cannot truely desire the glorie of God; but when wee once feele the grace of sanctification, then will the desire of Gods glorie breed in our hearts, and we shal know how worthy the Lord is to haue all glorie giuen vnto his name.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, if we compare this petition with the reason wherewith Christ<note place="margin">5. Vse. More plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, then in petition.</note> concludes this praier, wee shall see that the praise and honour of God, is the beginning and end of Christs praier, and so as it were the first &amp; last thing with Christ: whence we learne, that wee ought to bee more frequent and plentifull in thanksgiuing vnto God, then in petition and request. Thus we deale with those that be bountifull vnto vs on earth, we giue them many thankes for one good turne; and therefore should we much more abound in thanksgiuing to our heauenly father, from whom we receiue euery good gift that we enioy. It beseemes not the childe of God to be alwaies and onely begging, as though he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but withall, he must be plentifull in thanks and praise, for that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues he hath a taste of Gods mercie towards him: this made <hi>Dauid</hi> say, <note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 147. 1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Praise is a comely and pleasant thing; it well becommeth vpright men to be thankefull.</hi> Our life of glorie shall be spent in praising God, and therefore we should invre our selues thereto, in this time of grace: and indeed, according to our thanksgiuing is our grace; little praise, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grace; but he that abounds in thanksgiuing, abounds in Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings. Againe, heartie thanksgiuing for that we haue, is an effectuall praier for more increase.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the place wherein this petition is set in this praier, teacheth<note place="margin">Gods glorie must bee sought abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.</note> vs to seeke the glorie of God simply and absolutely before all other things.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:14013:138"/>
that must we alwaies prefer in all our actions, though no good should follow vnto vs thereupon: for this ende, God giues vs time to liue in this world, that wee might glorifie God in our places and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; and hee that imployeth himselfe otherwaies profaneth Gods name, and transgresseth this heauenly order here set downe by Christ, who is the wisdome of his father.</p>

                  <hi>The Coherence.</hi> Christ hauing taught vs to pray for the sanctifying of Gods name, in the former petition, doth in this, and the rest which follow, as it were expound the same, by directing vs to the meanes whereby Gods name is halowed of vs: for then doe we glorifie Gods name, when he sets vp his kingdome in vs, and we suffer him to rule in our hearts, when we doe his will, depend vpon his prouidence for the things of this life, trust in his mercie for the pardon of our sinnes, and on his power and strength against temptation. Now of them all, this second hath the neerest dependance vpon the former, as beeing an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special meanes thereof; for men ought to glorifie Gods name on earth, but of themselues they cannot doe it, till God rule in their hearts by his word and spirit, and so set vp his kingdome in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The meaning.</hi> Gods <hi>kingdome</hi> is two-fold; <hi>Generall,</hi> and <hi>Speciall.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. 1. Generall.</note> Gods <hi>generall kingdome,</hi> is his absolute power and soueraigntie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ruleth all things in heauen, in earth, and in hell, euen the deuils themselues: Psal. 103. 19. <hi>The Lord hath prepared his throne in heauen, his kingdome ruleth ouer all:</hi> and this wee acknowledge in the ende of this praier, <hi>For thine is the kingdome.</hi> Now this wee pray not for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is alwaies euery where, no creature can hinder it, no not all the deuils in hell; for euery creature is subiect hereunto, and can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which God either willeth or permitteth: <note n="k" place="margin">Dan. 4. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>according to his will hee worketh in the armie of heauen, and in the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, nor say vnto him, what doest thou?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gods speciall kingdome,</hi> is that, whereby hee ruleth his elect and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen<note place="margin">2. Speciall.</note> people, working his will not onely by them, as he doth in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kingdome, by the deuils themselues; but in them also, by his holy spirit: and it is called <hi>speciall,</hi> because it is not exercised ouer all the world, but onely ouer the elect, whom hee hath ordained to eternall life.</p>
               <p>This speciall kingdome of God is two-folde; either of <hi>Grace,</hi> or of<note place="margin">Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace.</note> 
                  <hi>Glorie:</hi> The <hi>kingdome of grace,</hi> is a spiritual estate, wherein God makes men willingly subiect to his written word, by his spirit. I call the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:14013:139"/>
of grace, <hi>a spirituall estate,</hi> both because it is principally exercised in the conscience, and also because this regiment in the conscience, is by the spirit of God. Secondly, I shew wherein it consists; namely, in a voluntarie subiection of the whole man in soule, and bodie, and spirit, to the will of God, reuealed in the word: Psalm. 110. 3. <hi>Thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall come willingly in the day of assembling thine armie, in holy beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> And this subiection stands in three things; in <hi>Righteousnesse, Peace, and Ioy in the holy Ghost,</hi> Rom. 14. 17, 18. In <hi>Righteousnes,</hi> that is, First, in Christs righteousnesse imputed; and secondly, in the righteousnesse of a good conscience, the ground whereof, is sanctification by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which Christ giues to them, whom he doth iustifie. In <hi>Peace,</hi> that is, peace of conscience towards God, and peace with Gods Church; yea, with all creatures, so farre forth as is needfull for them. Now vnder peace, we must comprehend loue, and all duties of loue; for as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse concernes the person in soule and bodie, so peace respects all duties and actions of the life: Righteousnesse is the root, from whence springeth this peace, with euery action thereof; for when the heart is sanctified, the life is reformed. Lastly, in <hi>ioy in the holy Ghost:</hi> this is a fruite of both the former, respecting especially the state of affliction; for when a man is iustified and sanctified, and hath peace towards God, then ariseth in his heart a spirituall delight in God, in all estates: yea, though great afflictions light vpon him for Gods cause, yet he beareth them with inward ioy and delight, knowing that the spirit of glorie, &amp; of God, resteth vpon him, and that he shall be glorified with Christ, if he suffer with Christ: which things, while he compareth together, hee little esteemeth the afflictions of this life, in respect of the glorie that shall be reuealed; <note n="l" place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 17</note> 
                  <hi>for the light affliction that is but for a moment, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth vnto vs a farre more excellent and eternall waight of glorie.</hi> These are the branches of this spirituall subiection, which whosoeuer hath, is a good subiect in the kingdome of grace; as the Apostle saith in the next verse, <note n="m" place="margin">Ro. 14. 18</note> 
                  <hi>he that in these things serueth Christ, is acceptable vnto God, and approoued of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>kingdome of glorie,</hi> is the blessed estate of Gods elect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in heauen,<note place="margin">God, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glorie.</note> whereby God in Christ becomes all things vnto them immediately, 1. Cor. 15. 28. This estate of glorie is a subiection also, but yet such a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as is indeed a glorious regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; for there we raigne with Christ, in whom, and through whom, God himselfe becomes honour, peace, health, foode, raiment, and all things needfull to the perfection of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie. Now these two beeing Gods kingdome, differ thus; The state of grace is the beginning and entrance to the state of glorie; and the state
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:14013:139"/>
of glorie is the perfection of the state of grace. This state of glorie is the citie; and the state of grace, as it were, the suburbs of it. In this life, wee liue in the kingdome of grace; but the kingdome of glorie, is reserued for the life to come: and this speciall kingdome of God in both these estates, doe we here pray for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thy kingdome</hi>] This imports that there is another kingdome, euen the kingdome of Satan, which is a kingdome of darkenes, full of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and confusion, through sinne, which greatly hindereth &amp; annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Gods kingdome of grace especially.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Come</hi>] That is, to vs men in the world; and then it <hi>commeth,</hi> when<note place="margin">Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome comes by degrees.</note> God doth erect &amp; establish the same in their hearts: now vnto perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it comes by 5. degrees; 1. When God giues vnto men the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward<note place="margin">1</note> meanes of saluation, wherein he doth reueale his grace &amp; fauour in Christ; as the Gospel preached, which is therefore called <hi>the word of the kingdome,</hi> Matth. 13. 19. And so Christ (hauing relation to his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, which he confirmed by miracles, among the Iewes) saith, <hi>The kingdome of God is come vnto you,</hi> Luk. 11. 20. and beeing demaunded by the Pharisies, <hi>when the kingdome of God should come?</hi> he tels them, <hi>it was among them,</hi> Luk. 17. 21. meaning, that it was brought vnto them, by the ministerie of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> of himselfe, and of his Disciples; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed, it were without profit to many of them. 2. When the<note place="margin">2</note> word preached inlightens the minde, so as a man knowes and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the mysterie of the Gospel, which is the law of this kingdome. 3. When a man is thereby regenerate, and so brought into this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;<note place="margin">3</note> for by regeneration we haue effectuall entrance into the state of grace, wherein Christ rules in vs by his word and spirit, and wee yeeld subiection vnto him. 4. At the ende of this life, when the bodie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">4</note> to the earth, but the soule to God that gaue it, beeing translated to the ioyes of heauen, in the glorie of this kingdome. 5. At the last iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">5</note> when body and soule beeing vnited againe, are both made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the glorie of this kingdome: and this is the full and perfect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of it.</p>
               <p>So then our request to God in this petition, is to this effect; <hi>O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let thy kingdome come to vs that be pilgrimes and strangers here on earth, prepare vs for it, and enter vs into it, that be yet without; renue vs by thy spirit, that we may be subiect to thy will, confirme vs also in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, that our soules after this life, and both soule and bodie at the day of iudgement may be fully glorified: yea, Lord hasten this glorie to vs, and to all thine elect.</hi>

                  <hi>for he that committeth sinne, is the seruant of sinne:</hi> and where sinne raigneth, there the deuill hath dominion. And hence it comes that wee rebell so much against the kingdome of God, and refuse to stoop to the scepter of his word. Indeede this bondage is weakened in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but none is wholly freed from it in this life, as <hi>Pauls</hi> complaint declares; Rom. 7. 14. <hi>The law is spirituall, but I am carnall, sold vnder sin.</hi> The naturall man is dead in sinne, and feeles it not; wee therefore must labour to feele in our selues this spirituall bondage vnder sinne, and when we feele it, we must bewaile it, and so shew some life of grace to be in vs. This <hi>Paul</hi> did, Rom. 7. 24. <hi>O. wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me from the body of this death!</hi> Looke as the prisoner feeles his bolts and fetters, so sensibly should we feele the chaine of sinne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our soules are kept in bondage; and till we feele it, and bewaile it, the kingdome of Christ doth not come vnto vs: wee must therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day, crie vnto Christ our Lord, that he would shew himselfe to be our Redeemer, by breaking the fetters of sinne, wherewith our soules are kept in bondage, and giuing vs that free spirit, which may fully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his blessed kingdome in our hearts; <hi>for where the spirit is, there is libertie,</hi> 2. Cor. 3. 17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee must bewaile the sinnes of all the world, in the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression<note place="margin">Bewaile the sinnes of the world.</note> of Gods law, whereby God is dishonoured, and his kingdome hindered, and the kingdome of darkenesse furthered: 2. Pet. 2. 7, 8. <hi>Iust Lot vexed his righteous soule with the vncleane conuersation of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of his time.</hi> 1.

banners of victorie; how much more then ought the godly to grieue, when they see impietie practised with an high hand, which is as it were a flagge of defiance in the kingdome of Christ, and a speciall ensigne of Satans triumphing in the increase of his kingdome of darkenes? When the deuil sees one that hath liued in sinne, but cast a looke toward the kingdome of Christ, hee rageth greatly, and labours by all meanes to turne him backe: and when we see those that haue made profession of religion, returne againe to the lusts of their former ignorance, O it should grieue our soules, and cause vs to pray, <hi>thy kingdome come.</hi> Doe we perceiue the Turke, or Pope, or any instrument of Satan, either by subtiltie or tyrannie, to hinder the Gospel preached, which is the scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Christs kingdome, and the aime of God, whereby hee puls men from the kingdome of darkenesse? O then we should mourne! Or doe we see the want of Gods ordinance in preaching, sacraments, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline, which serue for the furtherance of Christs kingdome; or the Lords people committed to ignorant or idle Ministers, to scandalous teachers, either for life or doctrine? In all these we haue cause of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and they should stirre vp our hearts to crie vnto the Lord, <hi>Thy kingdome come.</hi>

               <p>As we must mourne for the wants and hinderances of Christs king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; so we must hereby learne to haue our hearts inflamed with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall desires after all helpes and furtherances vnto Gods kingdome, both in our selues and others: as First, for the preaching of the Gospel,<note place="margin">1</note> and all other diuine ordinances, whereby Gods kingdome is erected and maintained: our hearts desire to God must be, that these may bee set vp and continued, where they are wanting, and that God may blesse them, where they are vouchsafed. Secondly, that God would enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<note place="margin">2</note> the eies of our minds, that we may see the wonders of his Law, as<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> did, that so the Lords ordinance may be blessed vnto vs. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">3</note> that we may be wholly subiect vnto Christ, and that of conscience, not onely in our outward behauiour, but in minde, and heart, in will, &amp; in all our affections: wee must make sure this holy desire bee in vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, and therfore must denie our selues, and subiect our selues whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto God, as a willing people to serue him, and none but him; and then we may be sure his kingdome is come vnto vs. Fourthly, we must<note place="margin">4</note> desire to be dissolued, and to be with Christ in the kingdome of glorie, for this end, that we may make an ende of sinning, and become more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient subiects vnto Christ; yea, wholly ruled by him, though for the good of others, we must be content to liue. Fiftly, that Christ would<note place="margin">5</note>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:14013:141"/>
come in iudgement, when all things shall be subdued vnto God, and all his obedient subiects shall be fully glorified. This wee may desire in heart, though we must leaue the time to Gods good pleasure, still wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for it by faith in his promise. Sixtly, that God would inlarge his<note place="margin">6</note> sanctuarie here on earth, gather his elect more and more, and still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and maintaine his Church in euery place in the world: when these desires affect our soules, then doe wee truely say, <hi>Thy kingdome come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Use. Duties to be practised.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatsoeuer we aske in praier, that must we endeauour after in life<note place="margin">Duties fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering gods kingdome.</note> and conuersation, else we mocke God, saying well, and doing nothing; First therefore, as we say, <hi>Thy kingdome come,</hi> so must we seeke to meet<note place="margin">1</note> it, &amp; striue to enter into it; for this end God giues vs time to liue in this world, that here we might enter the gate of grace, and wait for the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of glorie: and therefore we must diligently frequent the suburbs of this heauenly Ierusalem, euen the preaching of the word, and therein labour both for true <hi>humiliation</hi> and <hi>conuersion,</hi> or else wee cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this kingdome, Math. 18. 3. Iohn 3. 5. First, we must haue the pride of our hearts pulled downe, and become as little children, beeing humbled in our selues through the knowledge of our sinnes, and the feeling of that miserie which is due vnto vs for them: yea, wee must confesse them vnto God, and crie vnto him for mercie, and by this meanes lay aside this burden, which hinders our entrance into the gate of grace. Secondly, we must bee conuerted and changed by the renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our mindes, our hearts must cleaue vnto God, and we must carry therein a resolute purpose not to sinne: when these things be in vs, we enter into Gods kingdome; but till we endeauour after them in some truth, we say in vaine, <hi>Thy kingdome come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, wee must bee carefull to bring forth the fruites of Gods<note place="margin">2</note> kingdome; for therefore doth he send it among men, and for want hereof, doth he take it from them, Matth. 21. 43. Now these fruits are <hi>Righteousnesse, peace, and ioy in the holy Ghost,</hi> Rom. 14. 17. whereof we haue <note n="a" place="margin">In the meaning of this petition.</note> spoken before: all which, we must labour to finde in our hearts, and to expresse in our liues, else this kingdome shall be taken from vs, &amp; we shall neuer see the glorie of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hence we must learne to bee contented in all estates of this<note place="margin">3</note> life whatsoeuer, the hope of the glory of this kingdome which we pray<note place="margin">A ground of contentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> for, must swallow vp all the sorrowes that earthly calamities can bring vpon vs: This it was that made the Patriarks to walke contented in the state of Pilgrimes and Strangers here on earth, Hebr. 11. 13, 14.

               <p>Fourthly, wee must all labour in our places and callings, to bring<note place="margin">4</note> one another into this kingdome, one neighbour another, &amp; one friend another; Ezek. 18. 30. <hi>Returne,</hi> (saith the Lord to the house of Israel) <hi>and cause one another to returne.</hi> This the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> noteth as a practise of the subiects of this kingdome, that <hi>they shall say one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, come, let vs goe vp to the mountaine of the Lord,</hi> Isay 2. 3. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters<note place="margin">Duty of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</note> of families especially, must looke to the practise of this dutie, and labour to bring Gods kingdome into their families: for this ende they must see to these things; First, that there bee no manifest or open sinne permitted in their families; ridde thy house of such a person, if thou canst not reforme him, Psalm. 101. 7. Secondly, instruct thy familie in the way of the Lord, that they may know to liue righteously and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly both before God and man. Thirdly, set vp and maintaine the priuate worship of God in thy familie, ioyne thou with them in holy duties, especially in daily calling vpon the name of God. In regard of these and such like duties it is, that the <note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 19. 9.</note> Scripture ascribes saluation to a familie, where the master or the gouernour of the house is conuerted to the faith. And for the practise hereof, the holy Patriarkes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to all posteritie: God saith of <hi>Abraham,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, hence wee must learne, euery day to prepare our selues to<note place="margin">5</note> die, for by death our soules enter into the glorie of this kingdome,<note place="margin">Prepare to die.</note> which we pray may come vnto vs; and therefore we must be ready to receiue it euery day, that whensoeuer our King commeth vnto vs, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by death, or in the last iudgement, wee may passe from grace to glorie. And indeede wee cannot with comfort make this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vnlesse wee bee in some measure prepared for death, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day. Now beeing prepared, wee must <hi>waite,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Iob. 14. 14 Luk 2. 25.</note> did, <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day till our changing come.</hi> Looke how the godly in the olde Testament looked for our Sauiour Christs first comming in the flesh; so must we waite for his comming to vs, either by death, or iudgement,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:14013:142"/>
neither must any thing dismay vs in this waiting, no not death it selfe; for the sooner we die, the sooner wee may enter into glorie. And here wee may take a viewe of the monstrous hypocrisie of the world, for who will not say these words, <hi>Thy kingdome come?</hi> but yet the most men neglect to prepare themselues for entrance into this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; nay many contemne the word and praier, which are the meanes whereby we haue admittance into the state of grace, and are prepared for the kingdome of glorie.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, wee may here learne of our Sauiour Christ the practise of<note place="margin">6</note> humilitie, and in all things to giue all glorie to God; for though this kingdome pertaine equally to him (as hee is God) with the father; yet because he hath it from the father, as he is the son, therfore he will haue it wholly attributed vnto him; for he teacheth vs to say, <hi>Our father, thy kingdome come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, here obserue the necessitie of this petition, in respect of<note place="margin">7</note> our outward estate; for the comming of this kingdome to any estate,<note place="margin">Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome brings prosperitie.</note> is a speciall cause of prosperitie and happinesse vnto it: for where this kingdome is, Gods hand of blessing and protection is in a speciall manner: here the Lord raigneth, and his glorious and blessed Angels, which are mightie in strength and power, keepe watch and guard in that kingdome, and about that people who haue the Lord for their King and God. Hence it is, that this our Kingdome hath so long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed peace and protection from many dangerous assaults, because we embrace and professe the Gospel, which is the scepter of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and if wee could doe it in sinceritie, and walke worthie of the Lord our King, our prosperitie should bee as the stoods, and our peace as the Sunne and Moone in heauen. And therefore they that loue the peace of this kingdome, must embrace and obey the Gospel, and pray for the happie and flourishing estate thereof, for therein standes our peace.</p>
               <q>Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heauen.</q>
               <p>The Coherence. This petition dependeth on both the former thus; as a meanes whereby wee doe that which wee desire in the first petition; for Gods name is glorified, when his will is done: and as a manifestation of that which wee desire in the second petition, for there wee pray, that Gods kingdome may come vnto vs, and hee rule in our hearts by his word and spirit: now here we craue that we may doe his will, and so testisie our selues to be his loyall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>
               <p>The meaning. This petition is propounded in a comparison,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:14013:142"/>
which naturally standeth thus; <hi>As thy will is done in heauen, so let thy will bee done in earth:</hi> And it hath two parts; The first respects the grace of obedience which wee pray for, <hi>Thy will be done in earth:</hi> The second shewes the right manner of performing it, <hi>as it is in heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first, <hi>Thy will, &amp;c.</hi> Gods will is onely one, considered in it selfe, as God is one; yet for our vnderstanding, it may be thus distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: It is either <hi>absolute,</hi> or <hi>reuealed.</hi> Gods <hi>absolute will,</hi> is the will<note place="margin">Gods abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute will.</note> of his good pleasure, whereby according to his eternall counsell, hee determines of all things, what shall be done, or what shall not be done, and in what manner. This absolute will extendeth ouer all creatures, and ouer all their actions: Ephes. 1. 11. <hi>Wee are predestinate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the purpose of him that worketh all things after the counsell of his owne will.</hi> Roman. 9. 19. <hi>Who hath resisted his will?</hi> Matth. 10. 26. <hi>Without this will of God, a sparrow cannot fall to the ground.</hi> And this absolute will of God is hidden from vs, till God reueale it by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent. Gods <hi>reuealed will,</hi> is the sacred doctrine of God in his word,<note place="margin">Gods reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will.</note> whereby he signifieth vnto man, so farre as concernes his happinesse and saluation, what he ought to doe, or what he ought not to doe. This is not Gods absolute will, but rather an effect thereof concerning man, reuealing vnto him, not what he simply and absolutely willeth to bee done, for that must needes be done; but what is pleasing or displeasing vnto him, done by man, and what he will haue man to doe, or not to doe, if he desire to come to life, and would not be condemned. And this reuealed will comprehendeth both the Law and the Gospel, with all their commandements, prohibitions, threatenings, exhortations, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, &amp; such like, whereto the Apostle hath relation, when he saith, <hi>Proue what is the good will of God, and acceptable,</hi> Rom. 12. 2.</p>
               <p>Now this distinction of Gods wil being according to the Scripture, hath his vse in this place; for when we say, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> wee meane not the absolute, but the <hi>reuealed will of God. Reasons.</hi> I. The absolute will of God is alwaies done, &amp; cannot be resisted; <hi>My counsel shal stand</hi> (saith <note n="a" place="margin">Isa. 46. 10.</note> the Lord) <hi>and I will doe whatsoeuer I will:</hi> and againe, <note n="b" place="margin">Rom 9. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Who hath resisted his will?</hi> that is, his absolute will; for his reuealed will is generally transgressed by men, and men doe that which seemeth good in their owne eies, notwithstanding God reueale his will to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. II. A man may sometime dissent from the absolute will of God without sinning, so be it he still submit himselfe to the will of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting therein, when it is reuealed. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 18. 23, 27.</note> praied for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Sodome (yet submissiuely) which God willed and decreed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy:

And as in will, so in affection a man may dissent from Gods absolute will without sinne: Christ as the sonne of God, knew his Fathers will, concerning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Ierusalem, and yet <note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>t part<note place="margin">5</note> of Gods will, is to <hi>subiect our selues</hi> vnto the hand of God in all cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and afflictions whatsoeuer: when the brethren at <hi>Cesarea</hi> saw <hi>Pauls</hi> resolution to goe to Ierusalem, notwithstanding the bonds that there remained for him, they said (as it were expounding this petition) <hi>the wil of the Lord be done,</hi> Act. 21. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be done</hi>] According to the Scripture there bee two degrees of<note place="margin">Obedience twofold. Fuangelicall</note> doing Gods will; the first is prescribed in the Gospel, to wit, a sincere
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:14013:143"/>
endeauour and strife according to all the power of grace that God hath giuen vs, to doe the will of God; and this especially is here meant. The second is commanded in the Law, and it is a fulfilling of Gods<note place="margin">Legall.</note> will, doing that which God commandeth in that manner of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he commandeth: but this is not attained vnto in this life: and therefore our desire of God in this petition is, that he would giue vs grace, sincerely to endeauour to doe his whole will here on earth, and to hasten that time and state vnto vs, wherein we shall doe it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as the Law requires.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Vse. Wants to be bewailed both in our selues and others.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. This petition teacheth vs to bewaile our naturall disposition<note place="margin">Hindrances to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> whereby we are prone to rebell against the will of God, beeing wholly bent to disobedience in doing that which is euill.</item>
                  <item>II. We must bewaile our naturall hypocrisie, euen that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in vs after grace receiued: for though we may say these words, yet we can not possibly haue our hearts affected with such a perfect desire after obedience to Gods will, as we ought to haue.</item>
                  <item>III. Though we haue neuer so much grace, yet here we must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bewaile our want of obedience in all good duties: for though we giue our selues to doe good things, yet the best of vs all faile in the manner of doing them, as in hearing the word, in receiuing the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and praier; so as we must be humbled for our wants, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that we are vnprofitable seruants, when we haue done all that is commanded vs, Luk. 17. 10.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Secondly, we must bewaile the sinnes of others, whereby they diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the will of God, and so rebell against him; hereby God is disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and therfore in zeale of Gods glorie, and loue to our brethren, we must be grieued when others sinne. Thus was Dauid affected, Psal. 119. 136. and <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. Cor. 12. 21. <hi>I feare least when I come vnto you, my God abase me among you, and I shall bewaile many of them that haue sinned alreadie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Use. Graces to be desired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As we must bewaile the wants that hinder the doing of Gods will<note place="margin">Desires fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering our obedience.</note> in our selues and others; so we must stirre vp our hearts vnto heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desires after those graces whereby Gods will may be done. As first,<note place="margin">1</note> that we may haue grace to denie our selues, our owne wills and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; for naturally we are herein vnlike God, and like the deuill: and this must euery one learne that would be Christs disciple, Luke 9. v. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:14013:144"/>Secondly, that God would incline and dispose our hearts towards his holy word, that we may not onely know, but obey Gods reuealed<note place="margin">2</note> will. This was <hi>Dauids</hi> vsuall request, Psalm. 119. 27. <hi>Make me to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the way of thy testimonies:</hi> and 36. <hi>Incline my heart vnto thy testimonies.</hi> For how should we doe the will of God, vnlesse we know it? and how shall we know it, vnlesse our hearts affect the meanes of grace and of obedience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that God would hasten that time and state vnto vs, wherein<note place="margin">3</note> we shall perfectly doe the will of God, that is our state of glory.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that vnder euery crosse which God shall lay vpon vs, wee<note place="margin">4</note> may possesse our soules with patience, &amp; so subiect our selues to Gods absolute will. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> prayes in behalfe of the Colossians, that <hi>God would strengthen them by the power of his might, vnto all patience &amp; long suffering with ioyfulnesse,</hi> Colos. 1. 12.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that God would turne the hearts of men from sinne, &amp; bring<note place="margin">5</note> them euery where to the obedience of his will.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Use. Duties to be practised.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Because wee must seeke to practise that which we aske in praier,<note place="margin">Duties fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering our obedience.</note> therefore hereby we are also taught to endeauour our selues after these good duties; First, to <hi>prooue what is the good will of God, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> Rom. 12. 2. We must by often triall of our actions by the word of God, become expert in Gods will; vse in all things makes perfect, and therefore in all our affaires wee must consult with God, whether the things wee goe about be agreeable to his will. Most men will haue an eie to the lawes of the land in their ciuill affaires, as in buying and selling; and why should we not bee as wife for our soules, in the matters of God? Doe we not dissemble with God, when wee say with our tongues, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> and yet in life and conuersation, haue no regard to square our works thereby?</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee must be strict in the matter of sinne, making consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<note place="margin">2</note> of euery euill way; yea, euen of the first motions vnto sinne, that neuer come to consent: for this petition for obedience, respects not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our words and deedes, but our secret thoughts; for euen they must be brought to obedience to God, 2. Cor. 10. 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we must seeke to cut off all things that hinder vs from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">3</note> Gods will, wee must mortifie and crucifie the lusts of the flesh, and all sinnefull motions of our corrupt hearts; for these make vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells against God in transgressing his will. This is a hard thing to doe, and vnto a naturall man of himselfe altogether impossible, and therefore we must vse spirituall meanes, for the deedes of the flesh
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:14013:144"/>
must bee mortified by the spirit, Roman. 8. 13. Now the ground of this worke is the death of our Sauiour Christ, applyed by faith to our corrupt heart; <hi>for the old man is crucified with him,</hi> (as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith) <hi>that the bodie of sinne might bee destroyed, that henceforth we should not serue sinne,</hi> Roman. 6. 6. This therefore must wee doe, if we thinke our selues to haue part in Christ; wee must perswade our hearts, that when our Sauiour Christ was vpon the crosse in our roome and stead, bearing the punishment of our sinnes, then were wee, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the old man, crucified with him; the vertue and efficacie whereof, wee shall vndoubtedly finde in our selues, for the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of sinne, when we doe truely beleeue; for our fellowshippe with Christ, beginnes in his death; and if we be dead to sinne, how can the motions thereof yet liue and raigne in vs? When a malefactour is put to death, he ceaseth from his badde courses; and so, if our corruption be crucified with our Sauiour Christ, it must not raigne in our hearts, to bring forth the fruits of sinne. Let vs therefore meditate on the death of our Sauiour Christ, and apply it to our selues by faith, and consider the vilenesse of our sinnes, in the bitternesse of his passion; and then no doubt we shall be mooued to striue against euill motions: <hi>for if we be Christs, we haue crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts,</hi> Gal. 5. 24.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we must not liue inordinately, but in that sort which God<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <note place="margin">An orderly life.</note> inioyneth Christians in his word: euery one must haue a double cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; the generall calling of a Christian, common to all that liue in the Church, concerning the seruice of God, in righteousnesse and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and a particular lawfull calling, in some set state of life, tending to the good of the Church, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, or familie, wherin a man must glorifie God in the good of men: this is to liue in order, &amp; he that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth both, or one of these, liues inordinately; for God would haue euery man to abide in that vocation wherein hee hath called him: euery one therefore according to his gift and grace receiued of God, must liue in a lawfull calling, and hee that doth not so, resisteth Gods will. Whereby wee see, that wandring beggers are not to bee suffered in Church or common wealth; for they liue without any calling, and so transgresse Gods will: yea their course of life is here also condemned, that spend their life in sports and gaming; for such a life is rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, who wil be glorified in workes done by vertue of our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it is the will of God, that through manifold afflictions wee<note place="margin">5</note> should enter into his kingdome; and therefore when any crosse befalls
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:14013:145"/>
vs walking in our lawfull callings, wee must endeauour to subiect our<note place="margin">Patience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the crosse.</note> selues patiently, to the will of God therein: in prosperitie we are cheerefull and thankfull, but when affliction comes, our nature would repine: O remember, we say in all estates, <hi>Thy will be done:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the most bitter crosses that can befall vs, wee must labour to say with <hi>Iob, The Lord giueth, and the Lord taketh away, blessed bee the name of the Lord,</hi> Iob. 1. 21. So did the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> beeing bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed his kingdome by his owne sonne, 2. Sam. 15. 26. <hi>But if hee thus say, Behold, I haue no delight in thee, beholde, here I am, let him doe to mee, as seemeth good in his eies:</hi> and Chapter 16. 10, 11. when <hi>Shemei</hi> cursed him, he staied <hi>Abisna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> from reuenge, vpon considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods will to haue it so; saying, <hi>Suffer him to curse, for the Lord hath bidden him.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>In earth as it is in heauen.</q>
               <p>Hauing spoken of the grace of obedience desired in this petition, we now come to the manner how it must bee performed; to wit, <hi>In earth as it is in heauen:</hi> that is, of vs men liuing on earth, as the blessed Angels and glorified Saints doe it in heauen: for <note n="a" place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>the Angels that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in strength, doe Gods commandements, in obeying the voice of his word.</hi> And because this exposition is generally receiued, I will not stand to prooue it; this onely we must remember, that here wee pray not to performe obedience equall in measure and degree, to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Saints &amp; Angels in heauen, but such as is like vnto it; for<note place="margin">Resembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of mans obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Angels.</note> this note of comparison here imports a likenesse and resemblance, and not equalitie.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>willingnesse,</hi> for the holy angels obey the commandement of God free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and readily, without murmuring or constraint: for this cause they are said <hi>to come and stand before God,</hi> Iob. 1. 6. <hi>and to behold his face,</hi> Matth. 18. 10. to expresse their voluntarie seruice vnto God: and so should Gods children obey God, as <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of <note n="b" place="margin">Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>God loues a cheerefull giuer,</hi> so in all obedience, he likes a cheerefull doing; and therefore hee saith, <note n="d" place="margin">2. Co. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>if there be first a willing minde, it is accepted according to that a man hath.</hi> In this regard, <hi>Peter</hi> besought the Elders, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>to feed the flocke of God, depending on them, and to care for it; not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a readie minde:</hi> and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 17</note> 
                  <hi>If I doe it willingly, I haue a reward.</hi> This vertue the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> expressed notably, Psalm. 40. 6, 7, 8, when God as it were bored newe eares in his soule, then he
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:14013:145"/>
said, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> I come, I desired to doe thy will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, in <hi>Prioritie,</hi> for the Angels preferre to doe the will of<note place="margin">2</note> God, before all other things; and therefore they are said to stand in his presence continually, as it were waiting vpon his pleasure: and the like affection for obedience vnto God, must be in all his children. This <note n="g" place="margin">Ge. 22. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> notably testifies, when at Gods command he would haue <hi>kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Isaac;</hi> testifying thereby, that he preferred obedience vnto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the deerest thing in the world: this also wee may see in <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psalm. 119. 14. <hi>I haue had as great delight in the way of thy testimonies, as in all riches:</hi> and verse 127. <hi>I loue thy commandements aboue golde, yea aboue much fine gold:</hi> and in our Sauiour Christ, who said, when he was wearie and hungrie, <hi>My meate is to doe the will of him that sent me, and to finish h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> worke,</hi> Iohn, 4. 34.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>in speede,</hi> and <hi>quickenesse;</hi> for the Angels doe Gods will<note place="margin">3</note> without all delaie or slackenesse, which the Scripture signifies by their wings and flying, which it ascribeth vnto them: and the like alacritie should Gods children shew in their obedience vnto God, Psal. 119. 60. <hi>I made hast and delaied not to keepe thy commandements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, in <hi>faithfulnesse;</hi> the Angels doe not Gods will by halues<note place="margin">4</note> or peace-meale, but throughly and perfectly, wherein soeuer God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth them; and so should wee bee faithfull in doing Gods will, endeauouring to yeeld sincere obedience, not to some, but to all Gods commandements which concerne vs, Psalme 119. 6. <hi>I shall not bee confounded when I haue respect vnto all thy commandements.</hi> 2. Kings 23. 25. King <hi>Iosias</hi> turned to the Lord, <hi>with all his soule, with all his heart, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses:</hi> an example to be followed of all Gods children, that so they may be like to the blessed Angels.</p>
               <p>The 1. Use. Wants to be bewailed.</p>
               <p>First, this patterne of Angelicall obedience here propounded for<note place="margin">1</note> our imitation, must teach vs to acknowledge and bewaile the naturall hardnesse, deadnesse, and vntowardnesse of our hearts, in yeelding obedience vnto the will of God: if wee feele not this dull and vntoward heart, we may suspect our selues of the want of grace, for euery gratious heart feeles it, more or lesse, and bewailes it vnto God: and so must we doe, if we say in truth, <hi>Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, wee must here also bewaile the want of sinceritie and<note place="margin">2</note> faithfulnesse in doing Gods will: our maymed and halte obedience,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:14013:146"/>
shewes how farre we come short of this Angelical example: many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselues with the outward seruice of the bodie, and neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard<note place="margin">Isa. 29. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>3.</note> the inward worship of the heart; and others haue respect to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward duties of pietie, that concerne God, but for vprightnes and mercy towards men, they little regard: this the Angels doe not.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Use. Graces to be desired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereby also we must learne to pray for the spirit of freedome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may be deliuered from the bondage of corruption, and so may the more freely, and cheerefully, and heartily endeauour to doe Gods will: Psal. 51. 12. <hi>Restore to me the ioy of thy saluation, and stablish me by thy free spirit:</hi> the holy Ghost is therefore called <hi>the free spirit,</hi> because it giues liberty from the bondage of sinne, and makes the heart free, and forward, and cheerefull in Gods seruice: <hi>for where the spirit of the Lord is, there is libertie.</hi> 2. Cor. 3. 17.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Vse. Duties to be practised.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Because we must practise the good things we pray for, therefore<note place="margin">Imitation of the Angels.</note> here we are taught to frame our liues to an holy Imitation of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Angels. Though we cannot attaine to the measure of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet we must endeauour after their manner of obedience, in <hi>readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> &amp;c. and so by following them beginne our heauen in this world. This will not stand with their humour who account zeale in religion, affected precisenesse: but such as call God father in sinceritie, must set before them the obedience of the holy Angels, as a patterne for their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation. Now in them we may obscrue these things for vs to follow.</p>
               <p>First, they desired before Christs incarnation, to looke into the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie<note place="margin">1</note> of our redemption wrought by Christ, 1. Pet. 1. 12. although it concerne them not as it doth vs: for they neuer fell, and they are esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by another grace then of redemption: now herein we must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Angels, or (if it were possible) goe beyond them, for <hi>Christ took not the Angels, but the seede of Abraham:</hi> his redemption concernes vs, and therefore we much more must be diligent searchers out of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie in the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Angels are maintainers of true religion, and of the<note place="margin">2</note> worship of God: for the law was giuen by Angels, Gal. 3. 19. The most of Daniels visions were shewed by an Angel; and so was the reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto Iohn, Reuel. 1. 1. the Angels brought the Apostles out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to preach the Gospel <note n="a" place="margin">Act 5. 19. and 12 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. and 16. 26.</note> sundrie times. They are enemies to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; for, Apoc. 19. 10. when <hi>Iohn</hi> would haue worshipped the Angel, he forbad him, saying, <hi>See thou doe it not, worship God:</hi> herein also we must be followers of Angels, by furthering the Gospel and true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:14013:146"/>
of God to the vttermost of our power; by hindering all Idolatrie, and shewing our selues enemies to all the enemies of God and of his truth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Angels were alwaies seruiceable vnto Christ; they<note place="margin">3</note> brought the tidings of his birth to the shepheards, Luk. 2. 9, 10. <hi>they ministred vnto him in his temptation,</hi> Mat. 4. 11. <hi>in his Agonie,</hi> Luk. 22. 43. <hi>in his resurrection,</hi> Math. 28. 2. <hi>and ascension,</hi> Act. 1. 10. &amp; so should we performe vnto Christ all the seruice we can.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they spend their time in praising and lawding the name of<note place="margin">4</note> God: and so should we labour to haue our hearts inlarged for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and our mouthes filled with his praises.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, they be seruiceable for our good, if we be Gods children,<note place="margin">5</note> though they be farre better then we are; Heb. 1. 14. <hi>They are mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string spirits sent forth to minister for their sakes which shall be heires of saluation.</hi> Psal. 91. 12. <hi>They are as nurces to beare Gods children in their hands:</hi> Psal. 34. 7. <hi>The Angel of the Lord pitcheth round about them that feare him:</hi> And all this they doe vnto vs of loue, as though it were not inioyned them: So we after their example must imploy our selues in soule and bodie, calling, credit, and all we haue for the good of men.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, the Angels are ioyfull when sinners are humbled and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">6</note> from sinne vnto God: Luk. 15. 10. and they are grieued when men by sinne dishonour God. And the like affections should be in vs, we should mourne for all sinne in our selues and others, whereby God is dishonoured; and haue our hearts to leape for ioy, when sinners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and turne vnto God. In the world to come we shall be like the Angels of heauen in glorie, Math. 22. 30. let vs therefore here testifie this hope by beginning our heauen vpon earth, in becomming like to the Angels, though not in glorie yet in obedience.</p>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:14013:147"/>
our obedience; for there we asked grace to doe Gods will; and here we pray for those blessings and mercies wherein we may expresse our obedience; for we doe Gods will, when we <hi>depend vpon his prouidence</hi> for the blessings of this life; when we <hi>relie vpon his mercie,</hi> for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our sinnes, and <hi>trust in his power for strength</hi> against temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deliuerance from euill. Now then to come particularly to this fourth petition; hauing in the former craued grace to doe Gods will in our particular callings, here we pray for such sufficiencie of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall blessings, whereby we may glorifie God therein.</p>
               <p>In the handling of this petition, sixe points are to be considered: 1. what we aske; <hi>Bread:</hi> 2. what bread we aske, <hi>daily bread:</hi> 3. whose bread, <hi>ours:</hi> 4. for what time, <hi>this day:</hi> 5. to whome, <hi>to vs:</hi> 6. whence we would haue it: by gift from God, <hi>giue vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first: The thing we aske is <hi>Bread.</hi> But what is meant by <hi>Bread,</hi> is not agreed vpon: some expound it spiritually of Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<note place="margin">

                     </gap>rasmus.</note> and blood, the foode of the soule in the word and Sacraments. But the vnfitnesse of this exposition we shall see by the weakenesse of their reasons alleadged for it. First, they say, it is not meete that in so heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a praier, we should aske so base a thing as materiall bread of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father. <hi>Ans.</hi> If God command vs to aske him bread, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende vpon him for it, wee must not iudge basely of it: nowe in this <note place="margin">v. 25. 26. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>1.</note> chapter God commands vs to depend vpon him for foode to eate: yea, 1. Pet. 5. 7. we must cast all our care on him: and <hi>Iacobs</hi> practise in praying <hi>for bread to eate,</hi> Gen. 28. 20. and <hi>Agurs</hi> praying for a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie in outward things, Prov. 30. 8. declare plainely the lawfulnesse thereof. Secondly (they say) we must first seeke Gods kingdome and his righteousnesse, and then all these things shall be cast vpon vs, v. 33. <hi>Ans.</hi> Distrustfull and distracting care is there onely forbidden, but a moderate care is there allowed, and therefore praier for them is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly lawfull.</p>
               <p>The second opinion touching Bread is of the Papists, to wit, <hi>that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rhem on this place.</note> 
                  <hi>here we aske not onely all necessarie sustenance for the bodie, but much more all spirituall foode, namely, the blessed Sacrament, which is Christ the bread of life.</hi> But neither is this so fit: for first, we praied for spirituall things directly in the second petition. Secondly, sacramentall bread cannot here be meant, because it was not ordained when Christ taught his Disciples this praier. Thirdly, their exposition is against their owne practise: for if by bread, were meant Christ in the Sacrament, then the people should be fed therewith euery day, which they barre them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>The third opinion is, that by <hi>bread</hi> is meant corporall food and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:14013:147"/>
necessarie to temporall life onely: and this I take to be the truth for these reasons, which also make against the former expositions. First,<note place="margin">What is meant by Bread.</note> 
                  <hi>S. Luke,</hi> the best interpreter of our Sauiour Christ, expounds the words, <hi>of bread that serues for the day:</hi> that is, for euery day, Luk. 11. 3. and therefore it must needes be bodily: for spirituall food once truly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, serues not for a day, but for euer, Ioh. 4. 14. Secondly, this is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect platforme of praier, and therefore must containe petition for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall blessings, els it were not perfect: now we cannot comprehend our requests for temporall blessings vnder any other petition but this onely, and therefore Christ here propoundeth them.</p>
               <p>Now properly, bread imports that sustenance made of graine which is fit and conuenient for mans bodily nourishment, such as Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek brought out to Abraham and his companie, with wine for their refreshing, Gen. 14. 18. and such is meant in Scripture where bread is opposed to wine or water. But more generally it is taken for all kinde of foode whatsoeuer, whereby life is preserued: in which sense <hi>goates milke is called bread,</hi> Prov. 27. 27. and the <hi>fruit of trees,</hi> Ier. 11. 19. and all things that passe too and fro in trafficke, Prov. 31. 14. Now in this place it must be taken in a generall sense, not onely for bread, but for all other necessarie foode, and for raiment also, with health, peace, libertie; and all other things that are meete and needfull for the good outward estate of man, of family, or common wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The vses.</hi> 1. In that Christ bids vs pray for bread and not for dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;<note place="margin">1</note> hereby he would teach vs to beware of couetousnes, the common<note place="margin">Beware of couetousnes</note> sinne of our nature whereby we are discontent with our estate, &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure with the Israelites, if we haue no more but Manna: but we must striue against this corruption, and say with <hi>Dauid, Lord, incline my heart vnto thy testimonies, and not vnto couetousnes,</hi> Psal. 119. 36.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we must hereby also learne to practise sobrietie and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration<note place="margin">2</note> in diet, apparell, and all other things appertaining to this life,<note place="margin">Learne so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie.</note> vsing them so as we may be the fitter for our callings, and the seruice of God, and so bettered thereby and not made worse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this must teach vs contentation with that place and state of<note place="margin">3</note> li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Israelites</hi> in the wildernes were not content with Manna, but would needes haue flesh to eate, and God gaue them their desire, but <hi>while the flesh was in their mouthes, his wrath fell vpon them:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs lust after no more then God giues vpon our sober vse of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes, least in seeking more, we draw Gods curse vpon vs. But, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, few are content with their estate, the yeoman wil be like the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in attire and diet; and the gentleman like the noble man; and hence comes vsurie, oppression, iniustice, and much vngodlines; hence it comes that Gods iudgement in dearth is increased vpon the poore, because men make no conscience of the meanes, so they may benefite and inrich themselues, and get aloft: but beware of Gods curse with thine aduancement; vnlesse God change thine estate, rest contented with that which is present, and be thankefull for it: <hi>for better is a little with the feare of God, then great treasure and trouble therewith,</hi> Prov. 15. 16. now what trouble like the wrath of God, and therefore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that which God sendeth in the vse of lawfull meanes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, must we aske of God euery bit of bread we eate? then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way<note place="margin">4</note> with all chance and fortune, and let vs learne to acknowledge<note place="margin">Chance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> Gods prouidence in all things.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, must Gods children aske of God their daily foode and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue<note place="margin">5</note> it as a gift of mercie from the hand of their father? then away<note place="margin">Merit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sated.</note> with merit by mans works, for if bread be of mercie, life euerlasting cannot be of merit on mans part.</p>
               <p>Lastly, this petition ministreth vnto vs a notable ground of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation<note place="margin">6</note> against distrustfull care, for that which Christ bids vs aske, God vndoubtedly will giue, because it is according to his will: and therefore the child of God may assure himselfe of things sufficient for this life, in the sober vse of lawfull meanes; and looke if temporall blessings faile, for a good supplie in spirituall graces.</p>
               <p>Here a question may be asked, seeing we aske of God but breade<note place="margin">Of vsing Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to our delight.</note> onely, that is, things necessarie for this life, whether may we vse the creatures of God for our delight? <hi>Answ.</hi> We may vse the outward blessings of God for our honest delight, Eccles. 5. 17. <hi>Behold what I haue seene good, that it is comely, to eat and to drinke and to take pleasure in all his labour wherein man trauelleth vnder the sunne:</hi> yet three ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueats must be remembred, lest we abuse our libertie in this delight: I. we must see God to giue vs not onely things necessarie, but for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: II. in our delight and pleasure we must so moderate our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that they be not taken vp with these earthly things, nor hereby
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:14013:148"/>
withdrawen or hindred from thinges heauenly and spirituall: III. Our principall ioy must be in spirituall foode, euen in Christ crucified, and in our true communion with him in his body and blood: all our delight must stoope to this, and out of Christ we must count nothing ioyous.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Point.</hi> What bread: <hi>daily bread.</hi> The word in the orginall signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>bread put to our substances</hi> day by day; that is, such bread as serues to preserue health and life from day to day: this <hi>Agur</hi> calls <hi>bread or foode conuenient for him,</hi> Prov. 30. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The vse.</hi> In this second point we learne two things. First, that it<note place="margin">We may pray for te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.</note> is lawfull to aske temporall blessings at the hands of God, for he is our mercifull father and bids vs so to doe; which serueth to confirme the former exposition of this article. Secondly, that we ought to haue a<note place="margin">A moderate care for te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things lawfull.</note> moderate care to preserue our bodily life and health, in the diligent vse of all lawfull meanes; for what we pray for we must endeuour to doe. The sixth commandement saith, Thou shalt not kill; wherein the Lord inioyneth vs by all good meanes to preserue our owne and our neighbours life. And this we must doe for two causes especially: first, that we may doe all the good we can to that Church, Commonwealth, and family whereof we are members: secondly, that we may haue a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient time to prepare our selues for heauen: for death will come, and the day of iudgement; and after death <hi>there is no wisdome, nor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>worke, nor inuention:</hi> therefore now must we prepare our selues for God, that we may be readie to receiue him at his comming; and he that is prepared for the Lord hath liued well and long enough, but without this our life is spent in vaine.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Point.</hi> Whose bread doe we pray for, <hi>our owne,</hi> not other<note place="margin">How tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall blessing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becom ours.</note> mens. But how doth bread or any other temporall blessing become ours? <hi>Ans.</hi> First, when we haue true right thereto before God: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when we haue lawfull possession thereof before men. Our right before God is needefull, for we lost all in Adam, and haue recouerie of our right in the creatures onely in Christ Iesus, when by saith we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his members: 1. Cor. 3. 22. <hi>All things are yours, &amp; you are Christs.</hi> And yet for all this, the child of God may not vse all things as his owne though he haue right thereto in Christ, vnlesse by Gods prouidence he haue also lawfull right thereto or possession thereof before men, as by lawfull gift, purchase, labour, or such like. Indeede right in Christ is the chiefe title, but yet right before men is also necessarie: for Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie doth not abolish good orders in ciuill estates, but establish them rather: Christ is no enemie to Cesar; and therefore the Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynes
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:14013:149"/>
                  <hi>euery man to eate his owne bread,</hi> 2. Thess. 3. 12. that is, such whereto he hath right in Christ by faith, and also inioyeth by Gods prouidence in some honest meanes alowed of men; for by good orders established among men, we are put into possession of those things whereto we haue right in Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The vse.</hi> I. Here we learne to receiue our bread from God, or any<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ov all in Christ.</note> other temporall blessing we enioy as a fruit of Christs passion; and indeede Christ crucified is the foundation of euery good gift and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God. As for infidells and wicked men who possesse and vse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temporall blessings, it must be graunted that they haue right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to before men; but yet hauing no part in Christ crucified, they want the true foundation, and so are no better then vsurpers before God, for which one day they must be called to reckoning. If this point were learned, men would shew more conscience in getting, and more reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and thankfulnesse in vsing Gods temporall blessings, then vsually they doe: there would be lesse riot and excesse in diet &amp; attire, and lesse abuse of all Gods creatures: for the meditation of this price of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, would restraine vs from dishonouring God in any of his blessings.</p>
               <p>II. This petition for our owne bread, teacheth vs that euery one<note place="margin">A lawful cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric.</note> should haue a lawfull calling, and therein so imploy himselfe that he may eate his owne bread, 2. Thess. 3. 12. No man ought to liue out of a lawfull calling, nor yet idlely therein; the master must banish idlenesse out of his family; and the magistrate out of the commonwealth: va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant persons ought not to be tolerated, for such eate not their owne bread.</p>
               <p>III. Here is condemned all fraud, iniustice, and crueltie, in the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Ill getting condemned.</note> of temporall blessings, for we pray for our owne bread; but that which is so gotten, is not our owne, but others: neither will the game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters gaine, nor that which is got by lotterie, stand with this petition: for this is not to labour the thing that good is, as the Apostle requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, Eph. 4. 28. neither are they sanctified meanes of getting. <hi>Quest.</hi> If this bread be our owne, what neede we to aske it? <hi>Ans.</hi> We aske it for good causes though it be our owne: for in bread there be two things; the substance of bread, and the blessing of God therein, which in Scripture is called <note n="a" place="margin">Isa. 3 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the staffe of bread,</hi> which is that vertue and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er therein, whereby it nourisheth: for herein it fareth with bread, as it doth with an old man, take away his staffe and he cannot stand but fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; so take away Gods blessing from bread, and it becomes vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and nourisheth not. Now because we may haue the substance of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:14013:149"/>
bread, and yet want the blessing vpon it; we may haue our garners full, and yet be poore: <hi>we</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Hag. 1. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>may eate, and not be satisfied;</hi> fill our bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and yet be hungrie, therefore we pray to God for bread; that so we may haue not onely the substance, but the blessing of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall: for which cause Princes must as well make this petition as the poorest beggers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV. Point.</hi> For what time doe we aske bread: not for a moneth or a yeare, but <hi>for this day,</hi> or as <hi>Luke</hi> hath it, <hi>according to the day,</hi> Luk. 11. 3. that is, meete and conuenient for this present day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The vse.</hi> In this circumstance of time, we are taught; first, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile our distrustfulnes in Gods prouidence for temporall blessings, as foode, raiment, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to acknowledge Gods particular prouidence vpon vs from day to day, whereon we must depend and cast our selues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually for all things needefull, though wee see no reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Thus did Abraham, when he was about to sacrifice his sonne; for when Isaac asked, <hi>where is the sacrifice? Abraham answered; my sonne, God will prouide,</hi> Gen. 22. 8. and so hee did, vers. 13. whereupon Abraham in memorie of this singular worke of Gods prouidence, called the name of the place, <hi>Iehovah ijreh, God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide,</hi> v. 14.

If we could learne and practise this dutie, we should haue more comfort in the creatures then yet we haue; yea it would restraine vs from fraud, oppression, crueltie, and from pride and vanitie in getting and vsing all Gods blessings: for if we were perswaded that all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall blessings came from his hand, how durst we sinne against him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in getting or vsing of them?</p>

               <p>Where, first we may note what is the faith of worldlings: they<note place="margin">Worldlings want <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Isa. 28. 16. <hi>He that beleeueth will not make hast,</hi> but will stay Gods lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, waiting for his blessings whereof he stands in neede: But is this the practise of the world? no verily; for let a crosse come, and men will not sticke to vse vnlawfull meanes for their deliuerance: and so they deale, when hope of gaine is offered, making little conscience of fraud, lying, oppression, &amp;c. and so making hast to be rich, they ouerrunne the prouident hand of God, that would lead them by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie lawfull meanes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hence we learne how to enioy and vse all temporall<note place="margin">Right vse of temporall blessings.</note> blessings, foode, raiment, &amp; such like; namely, as helps and meanes to draw vs towards Gods mercie in Christ. Thus did Iacob, Gen. 28. 20. 21.. <hi>If God will be with me, and giue me bread to eate and clothes to put on,—then shall the Lord be my God:</hi> Ioh. 6. 27.

               <p>To come to the petition, wherein we will handle, first the necessitie of it; then the meaning; and lastly the vses.</p>
               <p>For the first: This petition may seeme to be needlesse; for they that make it are Gods children, who haue all their sinnes forgiuen them,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:14013:151"/>
both past, present, and to come. <hi>Ans.</hi> This indeed must be the daiely<note place="margin">Why Gods children must daily pray for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</note> petition of all Gods children in this world, and the necessitie of it is great; for howsoeuer in the purpose of God all sinnes are pardoned to true beleeuers; yea, all sinnes past repented of, are so forgiuen, that they shall neuer be againe imputed: yet sinnes present, and to come, are not actually pardoned, till they be repented of. This experience teacheth, for who can feele the assurance of mercie for any sinne committed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he haue repented of it? and though true repentance once had set vs for euer in Gods fauour, yet it must bee daiely renued for our daiely falls, or els we cannot know it to be true. Hence it is, that <hi>Paul</hi> intreats the Saints of God in Corinth (though they had truely repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at their conuersion) <hi>to bee reconciled vnto God,</hi> 2. Corinth. 5. 20. meaning, by renuing their repentance. And <hi>Dauid</hi> was the true childe of God, yet beeing left vnto himselfe, hee fell into two grieuous sinnes, wherein he lay almost a whole yeare without repentance; during all which time, he had not pardon of them actually; for <hi>Nathan</hi> rebuked him to bring him to repentance, and vpon his confession, pronounced them pardoned: yea, and <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe afterward, for the fuller assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of mercie to his soule, most earnestly intreated pardon hereof at the hands of Gods, Psal. 51. So that this petition is most necessarie, as well for actuall pardon of sinnes present, as for the more ful assurance of sinnes past.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The meaning.</hi> This petition is propounded in the forme of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, which naturally standeth thus; <hi>As wee forgiue our debters, so forgiue thou to vs our debts:</hi> and it hath two parts, a request for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and a reason thereof. Our request for pardon is this; <hi>Forgiue vs our debts.</hi> In the word <hi>debt</hi> is a figuratiue kinde of speech, taken from bargaining, wherein <hi>God</hi> is resembled to the <hi>Creditour, Man</hi> is the <hi>debter:</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> is the <hi>bond or obligation;</hi> and <hi>sinne</hi> is that <hi>debt</hi> of<note place="margin">Sinne a debt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> ours, for which we stand bound to God by the law: this appeares by this, that in the Euangelists the word <hi>sinne</hi> and <hi>debt</hi> are vsed promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously; as Luk. 11. 4. compared with this of Matthew, and Luke 13. 4. Now sin makes vs debters vnto God, not for that we owe it vnto him, for we are bound by the law to yeeld the contrarie obedience; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause vpon default of obedience vnto God whereto wee are bound by the law, we are bound for our sins vnto punishment, which is as it were a second debt. Euen as a man that is bound in an obligation to another, through default of performing the condition thereof, is bound to paie both the principall and the forfeiture: the punishment of sinne which is eternall death, being that forfeiture whereto we stand bound before
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:14013:152"/>
God, for want of obedience which is as it were the principall.</p>
               <p>The consideration of this resemblance for which sinne is called a debt, serues to direct vs in some points of religion: as first it confutes<note place="margin">Remission of sinnes is not our whole iustification.</note> their opinion, who hold that our whole iustification consists in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, and that the same is wrought by the shedding of Christs blood alone: for we owe to God a double debt, first obedience, and for default thereof we stand bound to punishment: these two debts are different and distinct one from an other, and they must both be paid, and Gods iustice satisfied either by our selues or by a furetie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can be accepted as righteous vnto life. Now we our selues can discharge neither; therefore Christ our suretie must doe both: and so he hath: for our second debt of sinne whereby we stand bound to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, Christ discharged by his death and passion, wherein <hi>he made his soule a sacrifice for sinne:</hi> and our debt of obedience in perfect loue to God and man, he also paid to God in fulfilling the law for vs: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is true, <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>that the righteousnes of the law is fulfilled in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</hi> But (say they) the Scripture euery where ascribes our whole redemption and iustification to Christs blood-shedding, and to his death and passion. <hi>Ans.</hi> Christs blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedding must be considered two waies: first, as a part of his passion whereby we are discharged from punishment: secondly, as a part of his obedience, wherein he testified singular loue both to God his father, and vnto mankind: for in suffering he obeied, and in obeying he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: now because his bloodshedding is a part of both, therefore is our whole redemption ascribed thereunto, not excluding, but including his actuall obedience therein, it beeing a part thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, debt in this place betokening sinne as it binds vnto pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, sheweth plainly that sinne and punishment goe alwaies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:<note place="margin">Rhem. on 1. Ioh. 1. sect. 5.</note> and therefore the Popish doctrine is false and erroneous which parteth them asunder, by making some sinnes veniall, not deseruing the punishment of death, which is the wages of sinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forgiue vs</hi>] This forgiuenesse here asked is a free and full discharge<note place="margin">Forgiuenes of sinne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> from sinne and the punishment thereof, without any satisfaction on our part: and this God doth, when he is content for Christs sake, not to impute sinne vnto vs, but to account it as not committed, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment thereof as not due vnto vs; beeing fully and freely conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the all-sufficient satisfaction made by Christ in his death and passion. This forgiuenesse Hezekias expressed when he saide to God, <note n="d" place="margin">Isa. 38. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou hast cast all our sinnes behinde thy backe:</hi> and Michah, saying, <note n="e" place="margin">Mich. 7. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>He will subdue our iniquities, and cast all our sinnes into the bottome of</hi>

                  <hi>the sea.</hi> So that our request to God is this, that <hi>whereas our sinnes binde vs vnto punishment, the Lord would be pleased for his Sonnes sake, freely to remit all our sinnes, and neuer to impute them vnto vs, and to be fully contented with the suffering of Christ, that the punishment of our sinnes be neuer laide vpon vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But of what sinnes doe we here aske pardon? <hi>Ans.</hi> Both of sinnes past and present: for howsoeuer the child of God hath his sinnes past fully pardoned at once on Gods part, vpon his true repentance; yet he is not able so to receiue pardon as God giues it, but must receiue it by little and little, and as it were droppe by droppe: this we may see in Dauid, who had the pardon of his sinne pronounced by <note n="f" place="margin">2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet; and yet after that he penned the 51. Psalme, wherein he begges mercie and forgiuenes most earnestly for that sinne which God had alreadie pardoned, aiming no doubt at a more full and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble assurance of Gods pardon in his owne heart: for this cause also in his olde age he praies for the pardon of the sinnes of his youth, Psal. 25. 7. Againe, here we pray for the pardon of sinnes present, both that they may be actually forgiuen; and also that our hearts and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be setled in the assurance thereof.</p>
               <p>

This is that sinne which Christ foretold should raigne in the latter daies, Math. 24. 39. and I appeale to the conscience in the veiw of all estates and conditions, whether it be not so: for though iniquitie doe abound, yet no man saith, <hi>what haue I done?</hi> Ier. 8. 6. yea, this is the sinne of many professors, for the nature of man is prone to incroach vpon Gods favour. But we must know that this securitie cannot stand with this petition, for here we are taught to call to mind our sinnes, euery day praying for the pardon of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here we see whereon we must relie and setle our hearts<note place="margin">Our rest in distrust.</note> in all estates, in affliction, temptation, and death it selfe; namely on the meere mercie of God in Christ, by faith in his blood for the pardon of our sinnes: Looke to the prayers of all the Saints of God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and we shall finde that they made this their rocke, and ankor of stay in all distresse.

Now this daily humiliation stands in three things: 1. in examination of our selues for our debt vnto God by sinne: 2. in confessing our debt vnto our creditour, yeilding our selues into his hands: 3. in humbling our selues vnto him, crauing pardon and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion earnestly for Christs sake, as for life and death: herein the children of God are presidents vnto vs: Psal. 32. 5, 6. <hi>Dauid</hi> in great distresse found no release while he held his tongue, but when he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and <hi>confessed against himselfe,</hi> then he found mercie and ease: whereupon he professeth that he will be a patterne to euery godly man for their behauiour in the time of distresse.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, here we haue a notable remedie against desparie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<note place="margin">Remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire.</note> the deuill assaults many a child of God, when through infirmitie they fall into some grieuous sinne, or commit the same sinne often, which greatly wounds the conscience: for here Christ bids vs aske for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of our daily sinnes whatsoeuer they be, or how often so euer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. And no doubt, he that bids vs forgiue our brethren that sinne against vs, though it were <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 17 4.</note> 
                  <hi>seauen times in a day, if they seeke it at our hands,</hi> will much more forgiue vs. This must not embolden any to sinne presumptuously, for the Lord hath saide, <hi>He will not be mercifull vnto that man,</hi> Deut. 29. 19. but if any fall through infirmitie, hereon he hath to stay himselfe from despaire.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, hereby we see that no man possibly can fulfill the law, for the<note place="margin">No man can fulfill the law.</note> Apostles themselues were commanded to aske pardon of sinne euery
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:14013:153"/>
day; whereby it is plaine they could neuer fulfill the law, and therefore much lesse can any other.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that which we pray for we must in all godly manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour<note place="margin">Endeauour to get par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</note> after. And therefore as we pray for pardon of sinne euery day, so must we daily vse the meanes wherein God giues assurance of remission to his children; as heare the word, receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and pray vnto God publikely and priuately; endeauouring to resist all temptations, and to glorifie God by newe obedience: for it is grosse hypocrisie to aske the pardon of sinne, and still to liue in the practise of it.</p>
               <p>Lastly, here we see we must pray not only for the pardon of our own<note place="margin">We must be carefull of the saluation of others.</note> sinnes, but of our brethrens also: <hi>Forgiue vs;</hi> whereby Christ would teach vs, to be carefull of the saluation of our brethren and neighbours; the good estate of their soules should be deare and pretious vnto vs: and if this were so, happie would it be with the Church of God; but, alas, men are so farre from care of the saluation of their neighbours, that men of the same family are carelesse of one an others soules; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters regard not their seruants, nor parents their children: indeede they will prouide for their bodies and outward state, but for their soules they haue no care: wherein they bewray themselues to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and mercilesse, hauing more care of their hogges and bruit beasts then of their children and seruants: for when their hogges haue all needefull prouision, their children and seruants soules shall want in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As we also forgiue our debters.</hi>] These words are here propounded as a condition of the former petition; and they include a reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as Luk. 11. 4. <hi>Forgiue vs our sinnes,</hi> FOR <hi>euen we forgiue euery man that is indebted vnto vs.</hi> And this Christ addeth for waightie causes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to crosse the fraud and hypocrisie of our corrupt hearts, who would haue forgiuenesse of God, and yet would not forgiue our brethren, nor yet leaue off the practise of sinne our selues. But this condition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that we must exercise mercy towards our brethren, and so breake off the course of our sinnes, if we looke for mercie at Gods hands. Now the words here vsed are comparatiue, betokening a likelihood and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude betweene Gods forgiuing and ours: which must be rightly vnderstood, because our forgiuenesse is mingled with much corruption through want of mercie: and therefore we must not vnderstand it of the measure of forgiuenesse, nor yet of the manner simply, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the very act of forgiuing, for thereto sometimes must simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes be restrained; as Mat. 9. 29. <hi>According to your faith be it vnto you.</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:14013:154"/>
And the force of the reason stands in the circumstance, thus; If we who haue but a drop of mercie, doe forgiue others; then doe thou who art the fountaine of mercies forgiue vs: but we forgiue others; therfore do thou forgiue vs.</p>
               <p>Touching our forgiuing others, three questions must bee scanned:<note place="margin">How man forgiues.</note> I. How can any man pardon a trespasse, seeing God onely forgiueth sinnes? <hi>Answ.</hi> In euery trespasse which one doth to his neighbour, be two things: the losse and dammage whereby man is hindered in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, goods, or name; and an offence against God, by a practise of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice against his law. Now as a trespasse is a damage vnto man, so may a man forgiue it; but as it is a sinne against God in the transgression of the morall law, so God onely pardons it: as when a man hath his goods stollen, that dammage done to him, a man may remit; but the breach of the eight commaundement therein, God onely can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Quest.</hi> How farre is a man bound to forgiue others that tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasse<note place="margin">How far wee are bound to forgiue.</note> against him? <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a threefold forgiuenes; of <hi>reuenge,</hi> of <hi>punishment,</hi> and of <hi>iudgement: Forgiuenesse of reuenge,</hi> is when a man is not desirous of reuenge from an inward grudge, but forbeares to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der like for like to those that wrong him: this is principally here meant, for we must <note place="margin">Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>alwaies forgiue our brethren,</hi> in respect of reuenge; <hi>for ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is mine, saith the Lord, and I will repaie,</hi> Rom. 12. 19. <hi>Forgiuenes of punishment,</hi> is the remitting of that punishment which another mans wrong-doing iustly deserues: this is not alwaies to be granted, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the case of offence, which may tend to the publike hurt; for then were the state of magistracy vnlawful, whose office it is to punish offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The <hi>forgiuenes of iudgement,</hi> is the remitting of that censure which an euill deed doth iustly deserue; neither is this here meant, for beeing lawfully called therevnto, wee may freely censure that which is euill done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. Quest.</hi> Whether must we forgiue those that wrong vs, if they<note place="margin">How we must forgiue the obstinate.</note> will not confesse their fault, nor aske vs forgiuenesse? <hi>Ans.</hi> Wee must forgiue them freely, in respect of reuenge. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But it is said, <hi>If hee repent, forgiue him,</hi> Luk. 17. 3. therefore, vnlesse hee repent, wee neede not to forgiue him? <hi>Answ.</hi> That place is meant of Ecclesiasticall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, that those must proceede no further after the partie offending doth repent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Debters</hi>] Hereby is not meant such as we count debters in the ciuill<note place="margin">How we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters against our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note> state; that is, such as owe vs money graine, &amp;c. but any one that doth vs iniurie, or wrong: for no mans estate is so lowe, but in some degree
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:14013:154"/>
God hath giuen one or moe of these 4. things; honour, life, goods, or good name; and he that hinders his neighbour in any of these, is a deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before God, and so standeth, till hee make recompence to the partie, and repent towards God: yea further, wee must know that besides the endammaging of our neighbour in these things, the very omission of preseruing and furthering our neighbours life, honour, goods, &amp; good name, makes vs also debters before God.</p>
               <p>These words thus vnderstood, must be conceiued as a reason drawn, not from the cause, or like example, but from the signe and pledge of Gods forgiuenesse; for God hath made a promise to forgiue vs, if wee forgiue our brethren their trespasses, Mark. 11. 25. From whence mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull men may gather assurance of pardon with God, from that inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to compassion and readinesse, which they find in their own hearts, to forgiue others that wrong them; for Christ teacheth them to reason thus: If we be those to whom thou hast promised pardon when they aske it, then Lord pardon vs: but we are such, for wee feele our hearts inclined to mercie; therefore Lord pardon vs. So that this reason serues to mooue vs to pray to God for pardon with confidence and assurance: yea further, they include a profession to God of new obedience in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life; for vnder one dutie of mercie towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, is comprehended the whole practise of repentance, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of our vow made in baptisme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uses. I.</hi> Marke here, that asking pardon of God, and testimonie of<note place="margin">Remission &amp; repentance go together.</note> repentance goe together; he that receiues the one, must expresse the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for where God giues pardon, there also he giues grace to repent, and mercie is not granted, but on condition of repentance. Act. 2. 37, 38. when the Iewes that were pricked in conscience at <hi>Peters</hi> sermon, asked <hi>what to doe to finde mercie; Peter</hi> said, <hi>Amend your liues, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore when he perceiued want of repentance in <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> he tels him, <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Thou art yet in the gall of bitternesse, and in the bond of iniquitie,</hi> though he had formerly baptized him. Whereby we see, First, with what affection we must come to God, when we pray for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our sinnes; namely, with humble and contrite hearts, hauing a true purpose not to sinne wittingly and willingly, but to obey God in all his commandements: and the want of this, is the cause of that small comfort in praier, which many finde in themselues; for the promise of pardon is not giuen, where the condition of repentance is not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Secondly, this shewes the grosse and fearefull errour of the blind world, who sing this song while they liue in sinne, to their owne hearts; <hi>God is mercifull: Christ is a Sauiour:</hi> but thus trusting to Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:14013:155"/>
they deceiue themselues, for they trust to nothing; for mercie is not due, where repentance is wanting: nay, the Lord hath said, <note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 29. 19. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee will not be mercifull to that man that shall blesse himselfe in his heart, saying, I shal haue peace though I walke after the stubbornnesse of mine own heart, &amp;c.</hi> Let vs therefore see to this, that we practise repentance, when wee pray for pardon; and looke to the purpose of our heart against sinne, when we waite for mercy to our soules. We may not seuer those things which God hath ioyned, but looke how heartily wee desire mercie, so earnestly must we hunger after grace to repent: if we truely seeke both, we shall haue both; but if we let slip repentance in our selues, wee shall come short of mercie with the Lord.</p>
               <p>II. The ioyning of this condition, implying repentance, to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and the dependance of it on the former, teacheth vs, euery day to renue our repentance, and to humble our selues for our sinnes, seeking for a new supply of grace, that so our purpose not to sinne, may bee more and more confirmed in our hearts, which is the infallible signe of a new creature.</p>
               <p>III. Here we see wherein the practise of true repentance standeth;<note place="margin">The practise of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> namely, in exercising mercie, loue, peace, reconciliation, and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; for though forgiuenesse bee onely named, yet vnder it all other fruits of repentance are vnderstood. Indeede to heare the word, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacrament, to preach and pray, be excellent workes; but yet the heart of man may more easily dissemble in them, then in the duties of the second table: the most infallible marke of true grace, is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the loue of God in workes of loue and mercie to our brethren; Iam. 1. 27. <hi>Pure religion and vndefiled before God, is to visit the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, &amp;c.</hi> Iam. 3. 17. <hi>The wisedome that is from aboue, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easie to be intreated, full of mercie and good fruits.</hi> And hence it is, that <hi>loue is called the fulfilling of the law,</hi> Rom. 13. 10.</p>
               <p>IV. Christ knitting our forgiuing our brother, with Gods forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing<note place="margin">A true signe of pardon of sinne.</note> vs, doth here affoard vnto vs a notable signe of pardon of sinne; namely, a readie and willing minde to forgiue our brother offending vs: our inclination to mercie in suppressing the desire of reuenge when we are wronged, giues assurance to our conscience that wee shall finde mercie at Gods hands: whereby it is plaine, that the child of God may know his owne estate towards God, in regard of his mercie in Christ, euen by descending into his owne heart, and there finding the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mercie, in forgiuing those that haue wronged him: and this wee must labour for, if we would know Gods mercie in Christ to belong vnto vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:14013:155"/>V. Hereby we are admonished, to beware in our selues, of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<note place="margin">Desire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge must be auoided.</note> sinne of this age, ingraffed in our nature; to wit, desire of reuenge, spite, and grudging vpon euery occasion: for when we pray vnto God with such malitious hearts, wee doe in effect desire the Lord to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise his wrath, and to reuenge his iustice on vs. And vndoubtedly, many a man doth searefully curse himselfe in his owne prayers, while hee is cruelly minded towards his brethren; and God oftentimes saith <hi>Amen</hi> to such curses most deseruedly, seeing men are so cruell to their owne soules to curse themselues: and therefore we had need to looke to our hearts, when we pray to God, that we forgiue men, if we would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen of God.</p>
               <p>VI. Here note a general grosse abuse in this age: most men wil seeke<note place="margin">When wee ought to seeke recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with our brethren</note> to be reconciled to their brethren, with whom they are at variance, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come to the Lords table: but at all other times thy take their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, thinking they may well enough performe all other duties of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though they retaine malice and enmitie towards their brethren. But here we may obserue, that we ought to be reconciled with our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whensoeuer we goe to God in prayer; for else, if we come in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and enuie towards our brethren, wee curse our selues, and sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our owne soules. In prayer we bring the sacrifice of our hearts, &amp; the calues of our lips vnto God; but before we offer it, wee must <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile our selues vnto our brethren,</hi> as we <note n="o" place="margin">Chap. 5. 23, 24. An euidence of our hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie.</note> heard before.</p>
               <p>VII. Here also we may see the grosse hypocrisie of our nature, for so oft as we make this petition, wee make profession of reformation of life in new obedience, (for this one branch of brotherly reconciliation here professed, doth presuppose our conuersion from all sinne, sith that true repentance for one sinne, cannot stand with a purpose to liue in any other.) And yet behold, though men say this prayer often, yet stil they continue in their old sinnes, as in blasphemie, drunkennes, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, oppression, lying, fraud, &amp;c. as though it were nothing to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with God: but God is not mocked, either amend thy wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, or leaue off to make this holy profession.</p>
               <p>VIII. In that Christ tieth our duty of forgiuing our brethren, to so<note place="margin">Mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cruelti.</note> waightie a condition, as is our forgiuenesse with God; hereby he would acquaint vs with the horrible crueltie of our nature, and pronenesse to reuenge: we must therefore take notice of it, and labour to see and to bewaile this corruption of our hearts; and on the other side, to hunger after loue, mercie, gentlenesse, meekenesse, and to endeauour to practise the same continually.</p>
               <p>Lastly, ioyne both parts of this petition together, &amp; they shew vs a
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:14013:156"/>
way how to keepe true peace of conscience for euer; namely, First, wee must call vpon God for the pardon of our sinnes euery daie. Secondly,<note place="margin">How to get and keepe peace of conscience.</note> we must follow after peace with men, in the practise of forgiuenesse &amp; reconciliation when offences growe; for when we are at one with God and man, we haue a blessed peace: and hence will follow peace in our owne hearts, which is that peace which the world cannot giue; which while we retaine, wee need not to feare any euill, no not death it selfe; for if God be with vs, who can be against vs?</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in this fond conceit, that God surely loues them, and they are deepe in his fauour, because they are freed from temptations; when as indeede they ought rather to suspect themselues to be vnder the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan: for <hi>when the strong man armed keepes the holde, the things that he possesseth are in peace,</hi> Luk. 11. 21.

               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:14013:156"/>Secondly, this petition is ioyned with the former, to teach vs, that as we must be carefull to begge mercie and pardon for our sinnes already<note place="margin">Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes against sinne.</note> past, so we must be watchfull to preuent sinnes to come: he that saith, <hi>Forgiue vs our trespasses,</hi> must pray also, <hi>not to be lead into temptation:</hi> and therefore as we would not haue our consciences pricked with the sting of our old sinnes, so we must be carefull wee fall not into them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, neither be ouercome with new temptations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The meaning.</hi> The words themselues containe one onely petition, (though some haue thought otherwise) consisting of two parts; the first is the petition it selfe, <hi>And lead vs not into temptation:</hi> the second, is the exposition thereof, <hi>But deliuer vs from euill:</hi> for in effect it is thus much, <hi>That we be not lead into temptation, deliuer vs from euill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first, that we may rightly vnderstand it, wee must search out<note place="margin">Temptations two fold.</note> two things: First, what a temptation is: Secondly, what it is to bee lead into temptation. There be two sorts of temptations, Good, and Euill. I call that <hi>a good and holy temptation,</hi> when as God tempts a man, and<note place="margin">1. Good.</note> it is an action of God whereby hee prooueth and trieth man, to make manifest vnto man himselfe and vnto others, what is in his heart, for God knoweth well enough before hee trie him. Thus he tempted <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> by the offering of his sonne, Gen. 22. 1, 2. and the Israelites, <hi>by sending false Prophets among them,</hi> Deut. 13. 3. And in this sense <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are called <hi>temptations,</hi> Iam. 1. 2. because God trieth man by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as gold is tried in the fire: and all these are good, both in respect of the author, which is God; and of the ende, which is the good of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: Iob. 23. 10. <hi>Hee knoweth my way and trieth me, and I shall come forth as the gold.</hi> An <hi>euill temptation,</hi> is a wicked motion, allurement, or<note place="margin">2.

must know that in euery temptation there be two actions; one of God, whereby in his iust iudgement hee leaues a man to himselfe, or to the malice of Satan: another, of man himselfe, whereby being left of God, hee enters into the middest of the temptation, as it were plunging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into it. For the better conceiuing hereof, we must know that a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation<note place="margin">4 Degrees in Temptation.</note> hath foure degrees, by which it proceedeth, til it bring a man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to destruction, vnlesse it be cut off; to wit, <hi>Suggestion, Delight, Consent,</hi> and <hi>Perfection,</hi> Iam. 1. 14, 15. <hi>Suggestion,</hi> is when the mind conceiueth a wicked thought, put in by Satan, or arising from naturall corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Delight,</hi> is when the euill thought conceiued, and for a time retained in the minde, descendeth to the heart, and there pleaseth the will, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth the affections: <hi>Consent,</hi> is when the will yeelds to the euil mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the heart resolues to practise it: <hi>Perfection,</hi> is when a sinne is often committed, and by custome becomes as it were ripe, whereupon followes destruction. Now in the first and second of these degrees, a man is said to be tempted onely; for suggestion and delectation do not defile the heart, but when the will consents, then the temptation takes hold vpon him, and possesseth him: and by often practise he is plunged into it, intangled and insnared, and held captiue vnder it. Now then (to apply this to the point in hand) a man is lead into temptation, when he is left of God to an euill motion suggested into his minde, so as hee giues consent vnto it, and goes on to the practise of it. See this in <hi>Iudas,</hi> Ioh. 13. 2. Satan cast this euill motion into his heart, <hi>Iudas betray thy master:</hi> this he thought vpon, and was delighted with the gaine that he hoped to reape thereby: and here God left him to himselfe for his hypocrisie and other sinnes, and then Satan entred into his heart, gote consent of will, and so carried him to the practise of this treason. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to also the Apostle seemes to allude, 1. Tim. 6. 9. <hi>They that will bee rich fall into temptations and snares,</hi> beeing left of God to their corruption in couetousnesse.</p>
               <p>But some will say, that Gods owne children haue beene thus carried<note place="margin">Whether Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be lead into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> into temptation, as <hi>Dauid</hi> in the case of his adulterie and murther, 2. Sam. 11. and <hi>Peter</hi> in denying his master, Math. 26. 70. 74. <hi>Answ.</hi> It may seeme they were carried into temptation, for their euill motions were not onely receiued with delight, but consented vnto &amp; practised: yea, <hi>Dauid</hi> lay in his sinne almost a whole yeare. But wee must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they were the children of God by adoption and regeneration, and therefore howsoeuer God left them to be tempted, yet he forsooke them not wholly or finally, but still loued them, so as they were not carried into temptation with full consent of heart: but Gods sauing
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:14013:157"/>
grace remained in them, which when God stirred vp, they were reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by repentance. Indeede they went as farre as they could, and in regard of themselues, farre enough to haue cut off their saluation; but that was laid vp with God in Christ, for his <hi>foundation remaineth sure,</hi> and <hi>whom he loues, he loues to the ende, his gifts and calling are without repentance.</hi> So then, to be lead into temptation, is to bee carried into it with full consent, beeing left of God vnto the malice of Satan, and the powerfull working of a mans owne corruptions: and Christs meaning is, as if he had taught vs to say thus; <hi>O Lord, we are euery way subiect to temptations, and by our sinnes we deserue to be left therein, to the malice of Satan, and to the power of our owne corruptions, yet we beseech thee not to forsake vs in any temptation, but giue an happie issue thereto, still vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding vs by thy grace.</hi>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> How can God lead a man into temptation, and yet not bee<note place="margin">How God leads into temptation.</note> the author of sinne? <hi>Ans.</hi> Well enough, for as temptation is a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sinne, so God may lead a man into it by permission, leauing the partie to himselfe, and Satans malice, for some former transgression. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, God neuer puts any euill motion into the minde, but yet hee suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Satan to doe it; and though the deuill be a most wicked instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yet such is Gods power and wisdome, that hee can vse him without sin, in a good manner, and to a good ende.</p>
               <p>

This petition serues to confute a grosse errour of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de iustif. l. 3. c. 14</note> who teach that a man truely iustified before God, may finally fall from grace, and bee condemned: as also the opinion of some Protestants, who though they will not say that the childe of God may finally fall away and perish, yet they holde that hee may wholly fall<note place="margin">The child of God cannot wholly fall from grace.</note> away for a time, and that euery grieuous sinne which he commits, cuts him off totally, till hee doe repent; for looke what the childe of God asketh in prayer, according to Gods will, that shall bee granted him: but in this petition hee asketh preseruation from totall and finall apostacie, and that according to Gods will, by the reaching of Christ himselfe, <hi>Lead vs not into temptation:</hi> and therfore it shall be granted. Indeed it stands with the will of God, and the good of his children, that sometime they should bee buffeted by Satan in temptation: and therefore we pray not here to be freed from all assaults, but that we be not wholly left vnto our selues, nor forsaken of God, but so preserued by his grace, that we be not swallowed vp in temptation: and this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition beeing according to Gods will, shall be granted to him that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But <hi>Dauid</hi> by his two sinnes became guiltie of Gods wrath, and so lost his right of this prerogatiue in beeing the childe of God. <hi>Answ.</hi> If we consider the desert of those sinnes, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly should haue beene his estate; but yet in regard of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and free grace of adoption, wherein God changeth not, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in regard of the inward seedes of Gods grace in his heart, he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned still the childe of God, though the signes of Gods fauour were changed into the signes of his anger and displeasure. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But by such sinnes a man looseth the graces which formerly he had. <hi>Answer.</hi> The graces of God in man are of two sorts; some are necessarie to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as faith, hope, and charitie, without which a man cannot bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: others be very excellent and profitable, but not of like necessitie with the former; as the sense &amp; feeling of Gods loue and fauour, peace of conscience, ioy in the holy Ghost, alacritie in praier, courage and boldnesse with God: and these latter may bee lost, but the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie graces cannot, howsoeuer they may bee greatly weakened; for so it was with <hi>Dauid,</hi> by his fall hee lost for a time the feeling of Gods fauour, the ioy of the spirit, &amp;c. but faith, hope, and loue, were not extinguished, but sore weakened and couered, as fire in the ashes.</p>

               <p>Here also wee are taught to mourne for the corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby we are prone to yeeld vp our selues to euery temptation of sinne and Satan, and be slacke and negligent in resisting: we doe not watch and pray against temptations diligently, nor shunne the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of sinne, as we ought to doe: nay, we offer our selues into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and minister occasion vnto Satan, and to our owne corruption to assault vs often. This we shall finde to be true in our selues, if we search out throughly our owne estate; and therefore it should grieue our hearts when we feele the law of our members rebelling against the law of our minds, and leading vs captiue into sinne.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Use. Graces to be desired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here also wee must learne to desire of God all such graces as may<note place="margin">Graces hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping against temptation.</note> helpe vs against temptation, and they are many: I. Spirituall heede and watchfulnesse to preuent temptations, and to auoyde the occasions thereof. II. Grace to pray in the time of temptation, that God would lessen and moderate the violence &amp; force thereof. III. That in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:14013:158"/>
God would be so farre from withdrawing his grace from vs, that he would then adde grace to grace, euen new grace vnto the former. IV. That in the continuance of temptation, when it abideth long vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, God would strengthen vs to hold out. V. That he would giue vs patience to beare the irkesomnesse and burthen of it. VI. That in the ende of it, God would giue a comfortable issue, for his glorie, and our owne good.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Vse.</hi> Here also we are let to see, how great our weakenesse is, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen when wee bee Gods children, and haue true grace; for wee must daiely pray, <hi>that God would not lead vs into temptation:</hi> whereby wee import, that of our selues wee are so farre from withstanding a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that if God should leaue vs, wee would giue vp our selues as slaues vnto the deuill. Here then behold thine estate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whosoeuer thou art, considered in thy selfe; if God leaue thee, thou canst not stand in any temptation, but must needes fall into the bondage of Satan: yea, so exceeding great is our weakenesse in our selues, that in temptation there doth scarce appeare any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the childe of God, and a wicked one; for both are subiect to the temptations of Satan: nay, the child of God is vsually more assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then the wicked: when the euill motion ariseth, or is suggested in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the minde, the wicked receiue it, and delight therein: so did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> and so doe wee all: the wicked giue consent of will, so doe the godly, if God leaue them: the wicked fall to practise sinne, and so doe the godly, if God keepe backe his grace from them: the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked lie in sinne, and so doe the godly, till the Lord by grace doe raise<note place="margin">Difference between the godly and wicked in temptation.</note> them vp. Where then is the difference? Surely the persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues doe differ in temptation, for the wicked is carried with violence into sinne, and without resistance in temptation; but the godly hath some resistance in himselfe, when hee giues consent to sinne, the euill that hee doth, hee would not doe: Romans 7. 19. But the maine dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, is Gods grace and mercie, vouchsafed to the child of God, but denied to the wicked; for if wee escape temptation, it is of grace and mercie; if wee stand in temptation, and yeeld not to euill suggestion, if we denie consent of will, or be kept from the practise of sinne, it is all of grace: and if wee bee fallen into sinne, and rise againe by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that also is Gods speciall grace, without which vndoubtedly wee should runne on with the wicked vnto destruction. Here therefore wee must learne to renounce all confidence in our selues, and to walke in all humilitie before God, relying wholly vpon his grace and mercie in Iesus Christ: wee must make his arme our strength, and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:14013:159"/>
his grace our shield, to defend vs from temptation. This was <hi>Dauids</hi> practise, who in all trouble and distresse had recourse to God, calling him, <hi>his hope, fortresse, and deliuerer,</hi> Psal. 91. 2, 3. his <hi>secret or hiding place, who preserueth him from trouble, and compasseth him about with ioyfull deliuerance,</hi> Psal. 32. 7. and when his enemies increased, yet the Lord was <hi>his buckler, his glorie, and the lifter vp of his head,</hi> Psal. 3. 2, 3. And thus should wee rest vpon God, considering that if we receiue a good thought, we can hardly retaine it; and when euill motions come, we cannot of our selues resist them.</p>

And this course Satan holds to this present day in the bosome of the Church of God; hee labours by might and maine to holde the professors of religion in some one sinne or other: and therefore wee must alwaies praie as here wee are taught, that this naturall concupiscence may bee daiely mortified and made weake, so as it budde not forth in any branch of sinne raigning in vs.</p>

               <p>First, we must haue a double, calling; the generall calling of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,<note place="margin">How to keep a good conscience.</note> wherein we must serue God; and a particular calling, according
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:14013:162"/>
to our place and gifts, wherein we must exercise our selues for the good of men. These two must not be seuered so as either be wanting: but he that would keepe a good conscience, must practise his generall calling in doing the duties of his particular calling: it is an easie thing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Christianitie in the Church, and many a man doth so, that keepes no good conscience in his priuate calling at home: but this is the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a good conscience, when a man shewes himselfe a Christian in his calling at home, and conuersation among his brethren.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we must alwaies be exercised in doing some good dutie, either of our generall or particular calling, or in some commendable furtherance thereunto: for idlenesse is the deuills pillow, whereon men<note place="margin">Idle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ioh. 18. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in euery estate of life we must labour to see a speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, &amp; therein to rest contented be it better or be it worse. It is an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>asie thing to see and acknowledge Gods mercie in health, peace, and plentie, and to rest contented therewith: but if we would haue peace toward God in our owne hearts, we must labour to quiet our selues with his disposing hand in the day of trouble, sicknes, or any other distresse of life or death.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whatsoeuer we would doe when we die, that we must now begin, and continue doing it euery day while we liue; to wit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of our daily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>These words conteine the reason of the former sixe petitions: touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we must obserue two things in generall: first, that they are not a reason to mooue God whose wil is vncha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geable; but to perswade the child of God that prayeth thus, that God will graunt his requests. Secondly, that this reason is not peculiar to the last petition, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally belonging to them all: as, <hi>halowed be thy name, because thine is the kingdome, power, and glorie, and so for the rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Kingdome</hi>] This here imports three things in God: first,<note place="margin">What Gods kingdome imports.</note> that he is al-sufficient of himselfe to doe all things whatsoeuer, needing no helpe nor instrument beside his soueraigne will: Gen. 17. 1. <hi>I am God al-sufficient.</hi> Secondly, that he hath a soueraigne right and title to all things in heauen and earth, as a King hath to those things which belong to his territories and iurisdiction. Thirdly, that he hath so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne rule and authoritie ouer all things in heauen and earth, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning them as he pleaseth and bringing them into an absolute sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</p>
               <p>Further, the kingdome of God is twofold: <hi>The kingdome of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> whereby he rules and gouernes all things in heauen and earth, euen the deuill and all his angels and instruments: and <hi>the kingdome of grace,</hi> whereby he gouernes his Church by his word and spirit: and both these are here to be vnderstood. <hi>Thine</hi>] The kingdome is here called Gods, for two causes. First, to shew that God hath his kingdome of himselfe and from himselfe alone: thus the kingdome of grace and of prouidence are both his. Secondly, to distinguish God from earthly kings, for though they haue a kingdome, power, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as <hi>Daniel</hi> tells Nebuchadnezzer; yet they haue all these from God, not of themselues; but God hath them of himselfe alone, and not from any other.</p>
               <p>Now because our nature is blind in the things of God, I will here<note place="margin">Proofes of Gods soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> propound some reasons to prooue that God hath such a soueraigne kingdome, as also to shew the excellencie of it. First, this appeares by that excellent order which God hath set in all his workes by their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for how fitly doe times and seasons, as spring time and summer, autumne and winter, succeede one an other? how sweetely doe the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:14013:163"/>
heauenly creatures, the sunne, moone, and starres, serue for the creatures here below, as hearbs and plants? how doe these serue for beasts and foules? and all of them for the vse of man? as this prooues against the Atheist that there is a God, so it shewes the soueraigntie and most wise regiment of his kingdome. When a man sees a great armie in good array, and euery one keeping his place and standing constantly, he will presently commend the wisdome and authoritie of the leader: why then should we not acknowledge the power and souerangntie of the almightie, in that constant station of the creatures in that sweete order which they obserue from the creation?</p>
               <p>Secondly, the terror &amp; accusation of a guiltie conscience doth argue<note place="margin">2</note> euidently the absolute soueraigntie of Gods kingdom: for when a man hath committed some grieuous sinne, either against the law of nature or the written word of God, though it be so secretly that no man know of it, yet wil his conscience accuse and fright him; which it would not doe, vnles he were to answer for that fact to God the soueraigne Lord of al.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, men of death, that is, such as by some notorious crime de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue<note place="margin">3</note> death, though through the ignorance or negligence of magistrats they be let to escape, yet ordinarily they are ouertaken with some feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iudgement, and one way or other meete with their desert: which is a speciall worke of Gods soueraigne prouidence.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Gospel preached is as contrarie to mans corrupt nature,<note place="margin">4</note> as fire is to water; and yet hath it in all ages wonne men vnto it, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it, and to loue it so, as they haue been content for the Gospels sake, to forsake house and lands, wife, &amp; children, yea and life itselfe. This no word of man could euer doe, &amp; therfore it argues plainly that some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural power worketh with it, which draws the heart of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto it.</p>
               <p>Here some may say, that the Deuill hath a kingdome contrarie to Gods kingdome wherein he raigneth; and therfore Gods kingdome is not absolute. <hi>Ans.</hi> If we regard the malice of Satan, or the practise of the wicked, it may seeme Gods kingdome should not be absolute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they continually rebell against his reuealed will: but consider the power of God, which ouerruleth Satan and all his instruments, dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing most wisely of all their works, to his owne glorie, the good of his Church, and their own ruine, and then we shall plainly see that God ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ouer all: for howsoeuer the deuill and his angels, and all other his instruments oppose themselues vnto the word of God, which is the law of his kingdom of grace, yet God willingly permits all such works, and restraines them all at his pleasure; so as that which comes to passe against Gods reuealed will, is not contrarie to his absolute will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:14013:164"/>
                  <hi>Thine is the power</hi>] By <hi>power</hi> is meant an abilitie in God whereby he can doe whatsoeuer he will, and more then he will doe: for the better<note place="margin">Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> conceiuing of it, note these two things. First, that God is not onely powerfull, but euen power it selfe in regard of his nature as he is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and wisdome, &amp;c. Men and Angels are called powerfull, as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing power from God; but God onely is power it selfe, because his nature is infinite in power, as in all other properties. Secondly, that power and will in God are one and the same: for our better concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of them, they may be distinguished, but in themselues they differ not, for Gods willing of a thing is the effecting and doing of it. It is not so in vs, for we will many things which we cannot doe: but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer God willeth that he doth, and that which he cannot doe, he cannot will. The Scripture saith, <hi>God cannot lie, nor denie himselfe, nor die, &amp;c.</hi> now as he cannot doe these things, so neither can he wil them: for they are no workes of power, but of weakenesse and frailtie, and therefore is God omnipotent because he can neither doe nor will the same. <hi>Thine is, &amp;c.</hi> Here also we say Gods power is his owne, that is, of himselfe alone, not receiued from any other, as is also said of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and glorie, to distinguish the true God from all creatures who haue not power, and kingdome, and glorie of themselues, but from God, whereas all these in God are of himselfe alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the glorie</hi>] By Glorie is meant excellencie and maiestie: and<note place="margin">Gods glory.</note> this propertie rightly ariseth from the two former; for seeing he hath an absolute soueraigntie ouer all things, and power answerable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose and gouerne them at his pleasure; therefore of right all glorie, and maiestie, and excellencie belongs vnto him: yea, the glorie of all creatures is from him: so that sinnefull man must say with Daniel, <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs belongs shame and confusion,</hi> Dan. 9. 7. <hi>but vnto God be honour, and glorie, and power, and dominion for euermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The vse.</hi> I. This reason thus conceiued and vnderstood, containes a<note place="margin">A ground of trust in God.</note> notable ground of trust and confidence in God, and of praier to God in all distresse of life and death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we haue a father whose is <hi>kingdome, power, and glorie:</hi> now his <hi>power</hi> assures vs that he is able to helpe vs: and is he <hi>our King,</hi> and we his subiects? then he is willing to helpe vs. Is <hi>glorie</hi> his? why, what can make more for his glorie then to shew mercie to his people, in hearing their praiers, and helping them in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse? Psal. 50. 15. <hi>I will heare thee and thou shalt glorifie my name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. These words are a notable forme of giuing thanks and praise to God: for when the heauenly creatures are said to giue thanks to God, they doe it to this effect, Rev. 4. 9. 11. <hi>Thou art worthie, O Lord, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:14013:164"/>
                  <hi>honour, and glorie, and power.</hi> Againe, Phil. 4. 6. <hi>Be distrustfull in nothing, but in all things let your requests be made knowne to God with giuing of thankes;</hi> where we see praier and thanksgiuing must goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Now this beeing a perfect forme of praier, must needes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend thanksgiuing with petitions; as therefore in the sixe petitions Christ taught vs to aske all needefull things of God; so in this reason he teacheth vs how to giue thanks: for these three, <hi>kingdome, power, and glorie,</hi> doe generally comprehend all matter of praise and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto God: yea, it is a summe of all the Psalmes of praise: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Dauid blessed God, it was to this effect, 1. Chron. 29. 11, 12. <hi>Thine O Lord is greatnesse, and power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and glorie, and victorie, &amp; praise: for all that is in heauen and earth is thine: thine is the kingdome, O Lord, and thou excellest as head ouer all: both riches and honour come from thee, and thou raignest ouer all: and in thine hand is power, and strength, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This point well obserued, directeth vs in two Christian duties: first,<note place="margin">We must be frequent in praising god.</note> that we must be earnest and frequent in giuing prayse and thanks to God; for the first thing we aske, is grace to glorifie Gods name, and<note place="margin">Howe to praise God.</note> the last thing we here doe, is to ascribe glorie to God indeede. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, here we see in what maner we must giue thanks to God, namely, in euery blessing we must ascribe <hi>kingdome,</hi> and <hi>power, and glorie</hi> vnto God: as in the vse of meate and drinke, first, therein labour to see, and accordingly to ascribe the kingdome to God; that is, acknowledge Gods soueraigntie in that creature; that the right and interest thereto belongs to God, and that thou hast it from him and not of thy selfe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, see and acknowledge the power and prouidence of God in that creature: his prouidence in that thou hast it; and his power in that it serues for thy good, and comfort in thy nourishment and refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing. Thirdly, when thou art comforted therewith, giue honour and glorie to God, so thou shalt be truly thankefull. And thus must we be thankefull to God for his word, and all other blessings that we enioy. Yea, this direction must we obserue for our behauiour in affliction: we must labour to see and acknowledge Gods soueraigntie and power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs as we are his creatures, and that he hath right to dispose of vs at his pleasure, and therefore we must humble our selues vnder his hand, desiring grace so to behaue our selues therein that we may glorifie his name. And thus shall we honour God euen in affliction.</p>
               <p>III. Here we see a way whereby we may obtaine the things we<note place="margin">How to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests in praies.</note> aske of God: namely, we must confesse our owne vnworthinesse, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king shame and confusion to our selues, and giue all praise and honour
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:14013:165"/>
and glorie to God. Thus did Iacob, Gen. 32. 10. <hi>I am not worthie of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou hast shewed vnto thy seruant:</hi> so, Dan. 9. 7. <hi>To thee, O Lord, belongeth righteousnes, but vnto vs open shame.</hi> And thus comming in humilitie of heart, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our selues and all that we can doe, and endeauouring to giue all glorie to God, we shall finde mercie with the Lord for the obteining of all our requests.</p>
               <p>IV. Is kingdome, power, and glorie Gods? then is he to be feared aboue all creatures: for howsoeuer Satan and earthly Monarchs haue dominion and power, yet it is not of themselues, but from God: they can doe nothing but by power and permission from God; but God of himselfe can punish and destroy.</p>
               <p>Lastly, hereby we must be mooued to loue God and to yeild obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto him in all good duties: for to such will he shew his soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie and power for all good things, that so they may giue the glorie of all to God that giues them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amen.</hi>] We haue heard the preface, and the petitions of this prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:<note place="margin">Amen, what it signifies here.</note> now we come to the third part of it, which is the Conclusion, in this word, <hi>Amen:</hi> which is as much as <hi>verely, truly.</hi> It is commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be a word of wishing in this place, importing as much as, So be it, I wish it be so, or such like. But we must know that it hath here a further vse, to wit, not onely to expresse our desire of the things we aske, but also to testifie our faith in assurance of receiuing them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our desire: for so it is vsually taken in the new testament, where it is vsed to affirme or asseuere a thing with vehemencie and certentie. Againe, our Sauiour Christ giuing both direction and incouragement to praier, saith thus, <hi>Whatsoeuer you desire when ye pray, beleeue that ye shall haue it, and it shall be done vnto you,</hi> Mark. 11. 24. where he shewes two principall things required in prayer; the first, an earnest desire of the grace and blessing we aske: the second, is faith whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that God will graunt vs the things we aske. Now our desires were sufficiently expressed in the sixe petitions: and therefore, this beeing a perfect platforme of praier, here vndoubtedly is propounded the testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our faith, to this effect: <hi>As we haue craued these things at thy hands, O Lord, so doe we beleeue that in thy good time thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for Christs sake, graunt the same vnto vs.</hi> So that it is not here to be taken, as it is commonly, onely for a bare assent of the people answering the Minister in the congregation; but for a part of the praier belonging both to Minister and people that pray in faith, whether publikely or priuately: and that so much more excellent then the former, by how
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:14013:165"/>
much our faith excelleth our desire: yea, it is the seale of our hearts which we must set to euery petition, for to ratifie and confirme the same vnto our selues; as when we say, <hi>Halowed be thy name,</hi> our hearts must say, <hi>Amen:</hi> that is, as I desire grace to glorifie thy name, so I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue Lord, thou wilt enable me thereunto: and so for the rest.</p>

That our sinnes may not turne it into a curse, but that we hauing the pardon of our sinnes, may make good vse thereof, for our humiliation and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. 6. That we may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not in that our weaknesse be assaulted of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan aboue our strength, but that God would deliuer vs from all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>U. In the howre of death</hi> we may most comfortably commend our<note place="margin">In the houre of death.</note> selues to God following these petitions: praying, first, that we may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in sicknesse and death, as wel as in life &amp; health. 2. That God would now shew the comfortable worke and regiment of his word and spirit in our hearts, euen aboue all that we haue felt in the time of our health. 3. That we may as readily and cheerefully obey God dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as liuing. 4. That God would giue his blessing vpon all meanes we shall vse for our comfort or recouerie, making vs contented with his prouidence euen in death it selfe. 5. That we may be truly humbled for our sinnes, and hauing comfortable assurance of mercie and pardon, may with ioy render vp our soules into the hands of God in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death. 6. That seeing Satan is most busie and malitious in our greatest weaknesse, it would please the Lord to magnifie his mercie in strengthening our soules against all the assaults of sinne and Satan. Thus we see how in all estates of life and death, we may haue sweete and comfortable recourse to God following these petitions: we must therefore labour to know and vnderstand this heauenly praier, that so we may vse it on all occasions to the glorie of our God, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our soules: we cannot giue more euident testimonie of the grace of Adoption, then by the sincere exercise of the gift of praier, when we can come with boldnesse into the presence of our heauenly

father; and therefore we must giue our selues to the serious and often imitation of this heauenly patterne, and not content our selues to say o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the words, but from a feeling heart powre out our soules before God, according to the meaning of this praier in all estates.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Vse.</hi> These petitions may serue for a notable direction according to which we may frame our whole liues: for what we aske of God in<note place="margin">A patterne of a godly life.</note> praier, that must we endeauour to practise in our liues: and therefore according to our requests in these petitions must we spend our time in a godly endeauour after these sixe things: 1. our cheife care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour must be euery day to bring some glorie to God. 2. We must euery day yeild vp our selues in soules and bodies vnto God, submitting our s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

We must endeauour to doe his will in all things, euery day; making conscience of all sin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we rebell against him. 4. We must applie our selues faithfully to our callings, yet so as we still depend vpon Gods prouidence for a blessing in euery thing we take in hand. 5. We must humble our selues euery day before God in regard of our daily offences, still confessing our sinnes and crauing pardon for them at the hands of God. 6. We must daily flie to God for helpe and succour in our spirituall combate with sinne and Satan, striuing manfully against our owne corrupt nature, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the world and the deuill.</p>

As, 1. an earnest and heartie desire in all things to further the glorie of God. 2. A care and readinesse to resigne our selues in subiection to God, to be ruled by his word and spirit, in thought, word, and deede. 3. A sincere endeauour to doe his will in all things with cheerefulnesse, making conscience of euery thing we know to be euill: this is an infallible note of the child of God. 4. Vpright walking in a mans lawfull calling, and yet still by faith to relie vpon Gods prouidence, beeing well pleased with Gods sending whatsoeuer it is. 5. Euery day to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble a mans selfe before God for his offences, seeking his fauour in Christ vnfainedly, &amp; so daily renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his faith &amp; repentance. 6. A continuall combate betweene the flesh and the spirit, corruption haling &amp; drawing one way, &amp; grace resisting the same &amp; drawing another way: where this striuing &amp; resistance is in mind and heart, there is the spirit, for els all would goe full-sway with corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Hereby then make search in thy selfe for these graces of God, &amp; if thou find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thee, comfort thy selfe in assurance of thine adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; &amp; though thou canst not find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, yet if there be an vnfained de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:14013:167"/>
after them, when thou puttest vp these requests vnto God, comfort thy selfe, for thou art the child of God: for without the spirit of praier, which is the spirit of adoption, we cannot <hi>cal God father,</hi> nor say <hi>halow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be thy name,</hi> from a true heart, vnfainedly desiring Gods glorie.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Use.</hi> Out of these petitions we may obserue the plaine marks of a<note place="margin">Markes of a carnall man.</note> carnall man: as, 1. to neglect the glorie of God, and to seeke his owne praise &amp; glorie. 2. To follow the sway of his owne corruptions, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to be his guide, &amp; to neglect to yeeld subiection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the word of God. 3. To make no conscience of sinne, if it fit his humour, so his own will be satisfied, he cares not for the doing of Gods will. 4. Not to rest on Gods prouidence for the things of this life, but wholly to relie vpon the meanes; if they faile, his heart is downe, &amp; his hope is gone. 5. To goe on in sinne, without remorse, or humbling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto God: this impenitence is a plaine marke of a carnall man. 6. To runne headlong into temptation, without feare or feeling, so as he finds no occasion to pray for deliuerance from sinne: he that hath any of these sixe things raigning in him, is a carnall man; therfore trie thy selfe, if thou finde them in thee, turne vnto God by true repentance.</p>
               <p>And look what we haue said of praier, according to the patterne of the former petitions, may also be said of thanksgiuing, after the example of these words, <hi>For thine is the kingdome, the power, and the glory.</hi> We haue shewed the vse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, &amp; so accordingly in al Gods blessings and works of his prouidence, for which we must giue thanks; we must first labour to see therein the soueraignty &amp; power of God, &amp; then we must ascribe the same to God, with all glorie, &amp; praise, &amp; thanksgiuing.

                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> How doth these depend one vpon an other, <hi>our forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of men, and Gods forgiuing vs? Ans.</hi> We must not conceiue that our forgiuing men their trespasses, is a cause why God forgiues vs: for we are by nature dead in sinne, and can not doe any good thing of our selues, till we be enabled thereunto of God: but our forgiuing is a signe that God hath forgiuen vs, beeing indeede a fruit of our reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God: for it is a signe of true repentance, which is a fruit of faith, whereby we apprehend the mercie of God for the pardon of our sinnes in Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. Point.</hi> How should our forgiuenes, goe before Gods forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing<note place="margin">How our forgiuenes goeth before Gods.</note> vs: for so the words seeme to import, <hi>If you forgiue—your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father will forgiue you, &amp;c. Ans.</hi> The pardon of sinne which God giues must be considered two waies: first, as it is giuen in heauen; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as it is reuealed and assured to the conscience of man: now the pardon of sinne in heauen alwaies goes before our forgiuing others: but our assurance of pardon with God, followes after our forgiuing of men: for a mans sinnes may be forgiuen with God, and yet he may long remaine without the assurance thereof in his owne conscience: this we may see in <hi>Dauid,</hi> for when Nathan said, <note n="c" place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord hath put away thy sinne,</hi> no doubt it was forgiuen in heauen; but yet his <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 51.</note>

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>wes plainly that he did not vpon Nathans speech receiue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable assurance of pardon in his owne conscience. This then is Christs meaning, that if we forgiue men their trespasses, God will assure vs in our consciences that he hath forgiuen vs; otherwise, if we will not forgiue, God will denie vs that assurance.</p>
               <p>The vse of this point is first and cheifly this: we must learne to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue<note place="margin">Priuate wrongs must be forgiuen. Motiues.</note> and forget all priuate wrongs and iniuries done vnto vs whether great or final, without desire of reuenge. The reasons to mooue vs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to are these. First, it is Gods commandement here expressely inioyned,<note place="margin">1</note> which must needs bind the conscience to obedience. Secondly, if we<note place="margin">2</note> will not forgiue men, God will not forgiue vs: this Christ inforceth by doubling the sentence: now without Gods forgiuenes theres no salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore we must be ready to forgiue, as we tender our owne saluation. Thirdly, the frailtie of our nature is such, that we our selues<note place="margin">3</note> are subiect to offer wrong to others: this is intimated in this phrase, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:14013:168"/>
                  <hi>ye forgiue men their trespasses;</hi> so that euery man is prone to tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasse against others; and therefore as we would be forgiuen when we trespasse, so must we also forgiue men their trespasses.</p>
               <p>Now for the better performing of our dutie herein, these rules must<note place="margin">Rules of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</note> be obserued. <hi>I.</hi> We shall perceiue in sundrie men many wants &amp; frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which mens laws punish not; as in old men frowardnes; in others hastines; and in some ambition and desire of praise: now these and such like we must in loue passe by, without taking notice thereof. Prov. 19. 11. <hi>It is the glorie of a man to passe by an offence. II. Rule.</hi> If men giue vs some light occasions of offence, as vpbraid vs with our ignorance, vnskilfulnes, basenes, pouertie, or such like, we must lightly passe them ouer, preferring the bond of peace before outward reputation. <hi>III. Rule.</hi> Though a man doe vnto vs that which is indeede flat iniurie, yet if it doe not manifestly hinder Gods glorie, or too much preiudice our good estate; by hurting our good name, our goods, or life, we must cause our priuate griefe and hurt to yeild to publique peace. <hi>IV. Rule.</hi> If men doe vs such great wrongs as manifestly hinder Gods glorie, and our good estate in life, goods, or name; then we must vse the helpe of the magistrate, and the lawfull defence of laws prouided for that ende. Alwaies remembring that in seeking to right our selues, we lay aside all malice, hatred, and desire of reuenge, and with a single heart propound Gods glorie in the reformation of the partie that doth vs wrong.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in this reason perswading to forgiuenes, we may see that<note place="margin">Remission &amp; reformation go together.</note> pardon of sinne before God, and reformation of life goe together: for here by this one branch of a reformed life <hi>in brotherly forgiuenesse,</hi> is vnderstood all of the same kind: but where is no reformation of life, there is no pardon of sinne before God. Wouldest thou therefore be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured in thy conscience of Gods speciall fauour towards thee in Christ? then reforme thy life by euery law of God: for this will giue thee assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from God: but if thy life be vnreformed, thy hope of pardon is a meere conceit of thine owne braine: and therefore if thou want refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation now beginne, and if thou haue begunne, then hold on, and doe it more and more, for thy more full assurance.</p>

               <p>Our Sauiour Christ, hauing rectified the abuses in Almes-giuing,<note place="margin">Of Fasting.</note> and in praier, doth here come to a third Christian dutie, namely, fasting: wherein as in the former, first he seeks to reforme abuses, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the true manner thereof. But before we come to these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:14013:169"/>
I will in generall handle the doctrine of fasting, for the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of this text, and exercise of this dutie. And first we must know, that Christ here speakes not of a ciuill fast, appointed by magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates in their dominions for ciuill respects; but of a religious fast, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the worship of God: which appeares by this, that he ioyneth the doctrine of fasting to the doctrine of praier, which is a speciall part of Gods holy worship.</p>
               <p>Now touching a religious fast, I will here handle sixe points. First,<note place="margin">Of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fast sixe points.</note> 
                  <hi>what kinde of worke a fast is.</hi> The Scripture speakes of two kinde of workes: some commanded of God; others left indifferent. <hi>Workes</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>commanded,</hi> be <hi>good works,</hi> and <hi>parts of Gods seruice,</hi> because he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth<note place="margin">What kind of worke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting is.</note> them, as praier, thanksgiuing, Almes-deedes, &amp;c. <hi>Workes indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi> be in themselues neither good nor euill, because they be neither commanded of God, nor forbidden; as to eate, drinke, buie, sell, &amp;c. And to this kind of works must we referte fasting: for it is not simply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, and so no part of his worship in it selfe, more then ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is. And yet consider fasting in it circumstances; to wit, as a meanes to further and to testifie our humiliation in repentance, and our zeale in praier, and so it is a good worke: for in that vse, and to that ende God commandeth it, and it is a part of his worship. If it be saide, there is no commandement for it in the new Testament: I answer, if we consider it<note place="margin">How fasting is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> in the forenamed vse and ende, there is: for the same commandement that inioyneth praier, and humiliation, inioyneth fasting; because it is a meanes to further them both: for euery commandement includeth all necessarie furtherances to the maine dutie. Againe, we haue in the new Testament examples of ordinarie fasting, which are without all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in our Sauiour Christ and his Apostles, with the occasions thereof set downe whereupon they fasted. Now this is a rule in Diuinitie, that<note place="margin">How exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are a rule.</note> 
                  <hi>the ordinarie examples of the godly approoued in Scripture beeing against no generall precept, haue the force of a general rule, and are to be followed.</hi>

How a religious fast is to be performed.</hi> In a religious fast<note place="margin">In perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious fast 3. things.</note> three things are required. <hi>First,</hi> Abstinence from meate and drinke for one day, at least til the euening: for abstinence from morning till noone is no fast. When Hester required the Iewes to fast for her, shee forbids<note place="margin">1</note> them<note n="a" place="margin">Hest. 4. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>to eate, or drinke, during the fast.</hi> And when <hi>Dauid</hi> fasted and praied for his child begotten in adulterie, he would<note n="b" place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 16. 17. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>eate nothing till he had ended his humiliation perceiuing that the child was dead.</hi> This is a thing graunted by all Protestants. And the very names of fasting v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the old and new Testament, import a totall abstinence for that time: which must be obserued, to discouer the absurditie of Popish
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:14013:169"/>
fasts, wherein they allow men to drinke oft if they will, and eate also, so<note place="margin">Tollet. Instr. Sacerd. l. 6. c. 2.</note> it be not flesh: but in fasting, abstinence must be vsed from all meat and drinke so farre as health and strength will suffer. Secondly, Abstinence from all delights of nature, whereby the outward man may be cheered and refreshed, <hi>as musicke, sweete smells, soft apparell, recreations,</hi> and such like. This Daniel obserued for three weekes of daies; <hi>I ate</hi> (saith <note n="c" place="margin">Dan. 10. 3.</note> he) <hi>no pleasant bread, neither came flesh or wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint my selfe at all:</hi> and the like may we see in many examples of the old Testament. They cast <note n="d" place="margin">Iob 2. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>dust and ashes vpon their heads,</hi> in stead of anointing themselues with oyle: and for soft apparell, they put on <note n="e" place="margin">Nehe. 9. 1.</note>

                  <hi>howling</hi> in stead of singing. Thirdly, a man must hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and afflict his bodie in fasting; and therefore must be sparing in his diet and delights before the day of fasting: for a man may so pamper and full himselfe, that he shal not neede to eate or drinke for one whole day; but such persons fast not: the time of our fast must be <hi>a</hi>

                  <hi>Paul</hi> did: for though <hi>Ahabs</hi> fasting was but outward, yet thus he humbled himselfe before the Lord, 1. king. 21. 27. 29. Gods children therefore must see in their religious fasts, that their bodies be humbled with their soules. Here indeede care must be had, that in humbling our bodies we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy not nature, or so weaken our strength that we difable our selues to serue God in our callings afterward; such <hi>afflicting of the bodie</hi> the Apostle disaloweth, Coloss. 2. 23.</p>

This stands with good reason: for a mans abasing and pinching of his bodie, shewes him his vnworthinesse of the comforts of Gods creatures by reason of his sinnes; it leades him to see his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert of Gods wrath by reason of his transgressions, and so his heart is more deepely stricken with conscience of his owne sinnes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he doth more freely confesse them vnto God, and more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully turne from them afterward. II. A religious fast serues for an<note place="margin">2</note>

It serues to subdue<note place="margin">3</note> the flesh, and the corruption of nature: this end is necessarie, for the soule worketh by the bodie, the inclination of the affections is greatly swaied by the bodily constitution, and the soule is stained with many sinnes, by reason of the distemper of the bodie. But yet this ende is not so generall as the two former: for there bee two sorts of men in Gods Church; some of so weake a constitution of body, that their ordinarie sobrietie and temperance in diet, doth sufficiently subdue the rebellion of their flesh; now these neede not to fast for this end: others there be, whom ordinarie temperance and sobrietie will not serue to tame the rebellion of their flesh, and these are they that must vse religious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, for the subduing of the flesh to the spirit, besides their ordinarie moderation in diet. IV. Fasting serues to prepare vs vnto praier, and<note place="margin">4</note> to further vs therein; for first it causeth watchfulnesse, &amp; cuts off drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, and so makes a man the more liuely and fresh in prayer: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon our Sauiour often ioynes these together, <note n="n" place="margin">

Sam. 7. 6. <hi>The Israelites hauing fallen to Idolairie, put away their strange gods, and turne vnto the Lord with weeping and fasting:</hi> and when they kept the feast of <hi>Expiation,</hi> which was a type of their forgiuenes by the Messias, <hi>then they humbled themselues in fasting before the Lord,</hi> Leuit. 16. 29. <hi>Secondly,</hi> when<note place="margin">2</note> some among vs fall into any grieuous sinne, though wee our selues bee cleare from it, yet then wee must fast, because for the sinnes of others, Gods iudgements may iustly fall vpon vs. Hence it was that <hi>Paul</hi> blames the Corinthians, <note n="o" place="margin">1.

Indeede in the old <note n="s" place="margin">Leu. 16. 29.</note> testament, they had a set time of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, to wit, <hi>the tenth day of the seanenth moneth:</hi> but in the newe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, there is no set time which bindes the conscience; onely men must fast as iust occasion is offered.

Sam. 31. 13. they fasted seauen daies together for <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan;</hi> abstaining from their dinners, and taking some refreshing in the euening: and so <hi>Daniel fasted for three weekes of daies,</hi> that is, each day from morning till night, Dan. 10. 3. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it is from all kinde of sustenance for many daies together; so <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and her maides fasted three daies,</hi> Hest. 4. 16. Now the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer may be vsed of vs as occasion serueth; but this last is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; for it is not with vs in this regard, as it was with the Iewes; they liued in hot countries, and so had colde stomacks, by reason whereof they might fast three daies without any great inconuenience: but wee that liue in colder clymates, haue hotter stomacks, and so haue neede of more and oftener refreshing then they had; neither can we fast so long without endangering life or health: now fasting must bee to humble and afflict the body, but not to destroy it.</p>
               <p>Thus much of fasting in generall: now I come to Christs doctrine of fasting here propounded.

Here obserue the practise of these Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies in Christs time: they did not only fast often, <note n="a" place="margin">Luk 18. 12.</note> as twice a weeke, but they were carefull in obseruing all outward rytes and signes pertaining to a religious fast: yet as in the two former duties of Almes-deeds, &amp; Praier, so in this, the principal thing is wanting; that is, truth &amp; sincerity of heart; for their sowre looks came not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sorrowful hearts: they were whole and righteous in their own conceit, and so needed not the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.

And if Christ blame the Pharisies for their bad manner of fasting, then much more wil he blame them that fast not at all, though neuer so iust occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be giuen vnto them; for in this case it is not a thing indifferent, but necessarie, for the want whereof, God doth many times renue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his iudgements, as wee may see, I say 22. 12, 13, 14.

                  <hi>Paul,</hi> who fasted often: now their examples must bee a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses vnto vs, for we come farre short of them in many graces of God, and in obedience, and therefore had more neede to humble our selues. <hi>Secondly,</hi> wee haue among vs continuall occasions of fasting, both in<note place="margin">2</note>

Gods iudgements imminent and hanging<note place="margin">2</note> ouer our heads; for our professed enemies watch for our subuersion, and we are in danger to haue the kingdome of heauen taken from vs, in the power of the Gospel, the comfort of praier, and of the Sacraments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:14013:173"/>
wee doe not bring forth the fruites thereof. III.

               <p>Fourthly, Christ here disallowes not onely the affectation of prayse in these Pharisies, but the disfiguring of their faces by a kind of pyning of themselues; whereby he would teach vs, that a true fast stands not in the afflicting and weakening of the bodie. Now albeit few offend this way at this day, for most are giuen too much to pamper the flesh; yet here may fitly be shewed, what care men ought to haue of their bodies.<note place="margin">Of care for the bodie.</note> And first of all, a two-fold care must be auoyded; as well <hi>an immodera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> care to pamper the bodie with meate and drinke,</hi> for that makes the heart heauie, and the head drousie, and hereby lust is kindled, and sinne che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished; which the Apostle forbids, Rom. 13. 14. as also <hi>too little care,</hi> whereby the bodie is pined and pulled downe to ouermuch weaknes, which is one thing here reprooued. The <hi>care required,</hi> is that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate regard vnto the bodie, whereby it is so sustained by meate and drinke, that it may alwaies become the temple of the holy Ghost, and a sit instrument for the soule vnto workes of righteousnesse, and the worship of God. Now he that would thus order his bodie, must doe two things: First, he must obserue perpetuall temperance in foode and rayment, taking that which may well suffice nature, but not fulfill the lusts thereof. Secondly, if this will not serue to subdue the flesh, but that it will still rebell against the law of the spirit of life, (as in some it will not) then fasting must be vsed, in which the body is to be afflicted, and the soule humbled, for the subduing of the rebellious flesh: but yet herin we must beware, that we destroy not our health, our strength,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:14013:173"/>
or our constltution; for thus we neglect our life, which is a sin of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: wherein (though few) yet some doe offend, who in the meane time liue in the practise of soule and grosse sinnes otherwaies.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, here note how farre the Pharisies goe in outward humiliation:<note place="margin">Outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises more embraced then waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie duties.</note> they are content to afflict their bodies, euen to the disfiguring of their complexion; but yet they will not repent and leaue their sins, no though <hi>Ioh.

But yet these words are not to be taken properly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they bind vs to annoint our heads when we fast, as may appeare by these reasons: 1. If the words should be taken properly, then should Christ condemne al the fasts of holy men in the old testament, who vsed neither ointments nor washings, but abstained from all such bodily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights for that time. 2. Christ should command contraries, namely, the vse of such things in fasting, as were more proper to feasting, wherin me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vse to be ioyfull &amp; cheerefull. 3. He should inioyne that to some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which were not in their power, or at least could not be vsed of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without excessiue charges; as in this or other cold cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, where sweet oiles are rare &amp; costly. The true meaning therfore, must be gathered out of the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances of the place: now Christs intent is here, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer points of Alms-deeds, &amp; praier, <hi>to prescribe vnto men the approuing of their hearts vnto God in fasting, by auoyding ostentation therein, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the praise of men:</hi> &amp; therfore he names such behauiour, as doth no way intimate a fast vnto others; meaning thereby, that we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale our priuate fasts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men; as if he should say, <hi>when thou fastest pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately so carrie thy selfe, that it may not appeare to men thou fastest, and in all thy fasts seeke onely to approue thy heart vnto God.</hi>

               <p>The words thus explaned containe 2. parts; a <hi>commandement,</hi> and a <hi>reason</hi> therof. The <hi>commandement</hi> is two-fold: First, that we should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale our fasts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, intimated by <hi>wash thy face, &amp; annoint thy head:</hi> secondly, that we should seeke to approoue our selues, not to men, but to God in our relgious fasts, in these words, <hi>That thou seeme not to men to fast, but to thy father which is in secret.</hi> In this first branch of this<note place="margin">Priuate wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship must be concealed.</note> commandement we may learne, that the priuate worship of God must be performed priuately vnto God, &amp; concealed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men; for that which is here said of priuate fasting, which is a meanes to further our praiers, is true of praier it selfe, &amp; of euery part of Gods priuate worship, for there is the same reason of all: as may thus appeare; First, in al actions of Gods worship, there must be obserued an holy comelines &amp; decencie, which is then done, when they be performed with fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>That thou seeme not to men to fast.</hi> This is the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d branch of Christs<note place="margin">The hear must be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued to God in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, &amp; how.</note> commandement, wherein wee learne a second dutie in a religious fast; namely, <hi>that therein we seeke to approoue our selues &amp; our action only to God:</hi> for which end, we must obserue 3. things. 1. With our fasting wee must ioyne a conuersion of our heart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sin vnto God: Ioel 2. 12. <hi>Turne you vnto me with all your heart, &amp; with fasting:</hi> there God hath ioyned them together, &amp; they may not be seuered. Now that our hearts may<note place="margin">How the heart may turne to god in fasting.</note> turne to God in fasting, we must haue speciall regard to our behauiour both <hi>before, in,</hi> and <hi>after our fast,</hi> whether publike or priuate. <hi>Before the fast,</hi> we must prepare our selues thereto in an holy manner, by a serious consideration of the causes and occasions of our fast: a worthy example hereof we haue in <note n="a" place="margin">2. Chron. 20. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> who considering a fearefull iudgement to be at hand, in the approching of his enemies, was sore afraid, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon set his heart to seeke the Lord, &amp; proclaimed a fast. <hi>In fasting</hi> wee must labour to haue more tender affections, &amp; deeper humiliation then ordinarie: 1. Sam. 7. 6. The Israelites humbling themselues in fasting for their idolatrie, in <hi>Mispah, drew water, and powred it out before the Lord:</hi> which words import their deep humiliation, whether it were by abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant weeping, (as some expound the place) or by powring out water indeed, to signifie, that they powred out their soules before the Lord. <hi>After the fast,</hi> we must labour for reformation and amendment of life,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:14013:175"/>
that our behauiour both towards God and man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be euery way bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then before.

That we approoue our selues &amp; our action to God in fasting, we must be sure we propound vnto our selues therein the right ends of a religious fast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we haue before propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded; for if we faile therein, and propound other ends vnto our selues, we corrupt the whol action vnto our selues. 3. With our fasting we must ioyne the duties of the second table, in the works of iustice, mercie, &amp; loue to our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for without these, our loue to God is not sincere: nay, God reiects that bodily humiliation, which is seuered from the exercise of mercie &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, as we may see at large, Isay 58. 3, 4, &amp;c. I shewed before that we had iust cause to humble our selues; which when we doe, wee must bee carefull thus to approoue our hearts vnto God.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement: now followeth the reason therof, drawne from the promise of Gods reward to them that fast in an holy manner: <hi>And thy father which seeth in secret will reward thee openly:</hi> that is, <hi>seeing thee intend onely to approoue thine heart and action vnto God in fasting, will giue thee an open reward at the last day.</hi>

                  <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nath serued God with fastings and with praier. Answ.</hi> In the old testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fasting was a part of Gods worship; for it was commanded to be performed <hi>the tenth day of the seauenth moneth:</hi> and then also was the making and performing of vowes, a part of religious worship, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God. Now in all likelihood <hi>Annah</hi> had bound her selfe by vowe to God, to that course of praier and fasting, and therfore was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued of God therein. But now in the newe testament wee haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for set fasts or vowes, &amp; therfore the case is not the same, and so her example cannot prooue the thing for which they alleadge it: indeed we haue the vow of moral obedience made in baptisme, but that
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:14013:175"/>
euery one is bound to performe that takes God for his God, though he should not vow it. Again, a man may be said to serue God in praier and fasting as Annah did, because praier is a true part of Gods worship, and though fasting in it selfe be not the worship of God, yet beeing ioyned with praier, it is a notable furtherance thereunto: and beeing so perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iust occasion, it is a part of his worship, because he requires it.</p>

                  <hi>Fasting satisfieth Gods iustice, and merits remission of sinnes and life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting;</hi> because this promise of open reward is here made vnto it. <hi>Ans.</hi> We must know, that the promises of God for remission of sinnes and life euerlasting, beeing grounded vpon Christ, are onely made to them that be regenerate and beleeue in Christ; and so they are not made to him for his works sake, but for his faith whereby he is in Christ, and so indeede are made vnto him for Christs sake onely, in whome we grant, that God of his free grace makes himselfe a debter by his promise to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery beleeuer that doth any good worke: yet the debt is not due to vs for any thing we doe, but due to Christ who hath merited it, and in Christ due to vs. But it will be said, that works are oft mentioned with Gods promises, and especially faith, which is a worke. <hi>Ans.</hi> True: but yet the reward promised is not giuen for works sake, nor yet for faith; but for Christs sake, whose merit imputed to vs is receiued by faith, which faith we testifie by workes: and so according to our faith and works, we receiue a reward of God, but not for them: as Christ said to the Centurion, <note n="f" place="margin">Math. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 13. How fasting shall haue a reward.</note> 
                  <hi>As thou hast beleeued, so be it vnto thee.</hi> Thus then must we conceiue of this promise made to fasting; though in it self it be a bodily exercise: yet being done in obedience to God vpon iust occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by him that beleeueth in Christ, &amp; beeing ioyned with praier and conuersion to God, it is a worke of faith, and shall haue a reward.</p>
               <p>Now this gracious promise made to fasting in this holy maner, must stirre vs vp to a loue of this exercise, and to the practise of it, so oft as iust occasion is giuen. And vndoubtedly one speciall cause of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall renuing of Gods iudgements among vs is, because we humble not our selues by praier and fasting vnder Gods mightie hand. It were therefore to be wished, in regard of the manifold iust occasions, that publike fasts were more often commanded by publike authoritie, and priuate fasts more conscionably vsed in euery family.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the fourth part of Christs Sermon, containing a reformation of abuses in Almes, Praier, and Fasting: out of all which we must learne this one thing which Christ principally intends; to wit, <hi>in all holy duties to auoid hypocrisie, endeauouring to doe them with that simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie</hi>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:14013:176"/>
                  <hi>and sinceritie of heart, whereby we truely desire to haue God and not man the seer and approouer of them.</hi> And so shall our workes be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good in themselues, but in vs, and acceptable vnto God: otherwise, if we doe them in ostentation, or for other sinister respects, the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie of our hearts defiles our good workes, and so makes them vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and vnprofitable to our selues.</p>

to iudge what is necessarie: other rules wee haue not in the word, but what they iudge needefull, according to the word, that must be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med necessarie, and accordingly prouided. Yet further this may here be added, that things must not be deemed necessarie, onely in regard of the present vse, but also with respect to the time to come, wherein they may be needfull. <hi>Example.</hi> A trades-man hauing nothing besides his trade to liue vpon, may prouide for things necessarie while his strength continueth, to maintaine himselfe in old age, when through decay of strength or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now these grounds thus premised, I set downe this rule touching<note place="margin">A rule for prouision of worldly things.</note> mans prouision for worldly wealth. <hi>Things necessarie for mans person &amp; his calling, a man may seeke for and lay vp; but for aboundance, &amp; for superfluities, no man ought to labour or be careful:</hi> hereto Christ hath put this barre, <hi>Lay not vp treasures for your selues:</hi> &amp; <hi>Salomon</hi> praies as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against superfluitie, as against pouertie, Pro. 30. 8, 9. <hi>Giue me not riches nor pouertie</hi> (saith he) <hi>but feed me with food conuenient for me:</hi> and he renders this reason against aboundance, <hi>lest I be ful and denie thee, &amp; say, who is the Lord?</hi> Now hence I reason thus; looke what we may aske of God, that onely must we seeke for, &amp; no more: but we may only aske for things necessarie; for to pray for aboundance we haue no warrant, &amp; therfore we must only seek for necessaries, &amp; not for aboundance. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Apostles rule agreeth well, <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>If we haue food and raiment, let vs herewith be content, for they that would bee rich or abound</hi> (as the word signifieth) <hi>fall into temptation and snares. Quest.</hi> If we may not pray for aboundance, what must we doe, if God giue aboundance? <hi>Ans.</hi> If God blesse vs with aboundance, vpon our moderate labour and care in our lawfull callings, we must receiue it thankfully, &amp; as good stewards lay it vp to be bestowed on good vses, either in our families, or in the church &amp; common wealth, as God in his prouidence shal offer vs iust occasion.</p>
               <p>Now this beeing euident, that we must onely seeke for things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, and no more; then we must all learne to beware of carking care, &amp; be contented with things necessary, when God giues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And to moue

vs hereunto, consider the reasons following: First, it is Gods comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we should be contented with things necessarie, 1. Tim. 6. 8.<note place="margin">Motiues to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentation.</note> and therefore we must make conscience of obedience in the practise of<note place="margin">1</note> contentation. Secondly, they that are greedie after aboundance, haue<note place="margin">2</note> many temptations to bad dealing, and so can hardly keepe a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: <hi>they fall into snares</hi> (as the <note n="f" place="margin">1.

And for abuse, they are subiect to the iniuries of vngodly persons, theeues may steale them, and couetous persons may hoard them vp that they shall serue for no vse. Now if all earthly creatures be subiect to vanitie both by corruption and abuse, then we must not make them our chiefe treasures, but seeke for them and vse them in a moderate and sober manner. <hi>Quest.</hi> But whence came this vanitie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the creatures? <hi>Ans.</hi> God hath subiected them vnto it for the sinne of man.

               <p>The consideration hereof must let vs see the grieuousnesse of our<note place="margin">vse. 1.</note> sinnes, and the greatnes of Gods anger due thereunto, in that he hath imprinted the stampe of his wrath vpon euery creature for the sinne of man, by subiecting it to this two-fold vanitie. And therefore when we see a moth vpon apparell, or rust and canker<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vpon mettall or other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures corrupting them, we ought rather to be humbled for our sinnes, then to suffer our hearts to be drawne to immoderate desire &amp; delight
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:14013:178"/>
after earthly things. Secondly, are the creatures that neuer sinned, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to vanitie for mans sinne? then how vaine a thing is man, that by his transgression bringeth vanitie vpon the creatures? let vs therefore in them behold our owne vanitie, and when we pitie them, learne to lament our owne iniquities.</p>

                  <hi>But lay vp treasures for your selues, &amp;c.</hi> Christ hauing shewed what we must not doe in respect of treasures here on earth, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mans inclination to be such, that he will needs haue something for his treasure, doth here come to the <hi>second branch</hi> of his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; shewing what treasure we must lay vp for our selues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth vs thereto by a speciall reason. The treasures we must lay vp are, <hi>treasures in heauen. Quest.</hi> How should we lay vp treasures in heauen, for we cannot of our selues come there; no man can saue himselfe, the beginning, progresse, and accomplishment of our saluation is of God in Christ wholly? <hi>Ans.</hi> It is vsuall with God in Scripture, to ascribe the worke of the principall efficient cause, to the instrument thereof. Thus in the last ver. of Obadiah, <hi>Preachers, are expressely called Sauiours:</hi> and,<note place="margin">Obad. 21.</note> 1. Tim. 4. 16. <hi>In doing this thou shalt both saue thy selfe, and them that heare thee:</hi> and, 1. Cor. 4. 15. <hi>I haue begotten you through the Gospel:</hi> and yet both saluation and regeneration are the works of God alone, onely Preachers are the instruments thereof. So in this place, to make vs rich with heauenly treasures, is the worke of God alone: for we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>treasure vp vnto our selues wrath against the day of wrath,</hi> by our<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 5.</note> transgressions: and yet because we are instruments by his grace, in the vse of meanes to get this treasure, therefore he giueth this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto vs, as though the worke were wholly ours, though himselfe be the principall author.</p>
               <p>But yet that we may better conceiue of, and practise this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, two points are to be considered. <hi>First,</hi> what this treasure is: <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> how a man must lay it vp for himselfe: both these we must marke with reuerence, because they are points of great waight and moment, in the practise whereof standeth our saluation.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hereby they make the merits of Saints departed, to be the merits of others which liue long after them, by the Popes application; which is a thing impossible and absurd: for no man can merit for himselfe: but say he could, yet should his merits be for himselfe alone and for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for euery man in regard of saluation is a priuate man, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his workes he doth that way can onely redound vnto himselfe: onely Christ Iesus our Mediatour, God and man, who was by God himselfe made a publike person for this ende, can merit for others.</p>

                  <hi>The exposition.</hi> By <hi>treasure</hi> (as we saide before) must be vnderstood things pretious &amp; excellent in our estimation laid vp for time to come, wherein we repose our trust, and take a speciall ioy and delight. By <hi>heart</hi> we must conceiue, not onely <hi>the affections</hi> which are seated in the heart, as loue, ioy, care, desire, and delight; but the more inward powers of the soule in <hi>thought</hi> and <hi>imagination;</hi> yea and <hi>the effects</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in action, as labour, studie, and endeauour: As if he should say; your treasure and your heart are ioyned together, looke where that thing is wherein you trust and take chiefe delight, &amp; theron will your thoughts runne; your loue, feare, desire, and care will draw vnto it; and your chiefest paines, studie, and endeauour will be after it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The vse.</hi> Doe heart and treasure goe together? Then here first we learne to search out and trie the state of our owne hearts: for though it be a bottomlesse gulfe, <note n="h" place="margin">Ier. 17. 9. How to trie the state of our owne: heart.</note> 
                  <hi>and deceitfull aboue all things, so as none can thoroughly know it,</hi> yet if we applie this sentence aright vnto our selues, we shall be able to giue true iudgement of the state of our owne heart. <hi>An earthly treasure, and an earthly heart; but heauenly treasure, and an heauenly heart;</hi> these cannot be seuered: therefore looke whereon thou spendest thy thoughts, &amp; settest thy loue, thy care &amp; delight, and bestowest thy wit, industrie, and labour, and thereby iudge of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition of thy heart. If the thing be earthly and worldly, then thy heart is earthly and carnal: thou maist plead that thou hearest the word, receiuest the Sacraments, and praiest often; yet all this will not prooue thee to haue Christ Iesus for thy treasure: for thine heart beeing set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world, there vndoubtedly thy treasure is, and that prooues thy heart to be earthly and carnall. And on the contrarie, if thy principall thoughts, thy chiefe loue, ioy, and delight be on Christ crucified, and thy speciall care and industrie be after his merits and righteousnes, then is Christ thy treasure, and thine heart is heauenly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hereby we may know whether we haue any portion in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:<note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our title to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</note> for looke where our heart is, there our portion is: if our heart in thoughts, desire, and industrie, be set on earthly things, then is our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon earth: But if we mind heauenly things, if we delight in them, and labour after them, then is our portion in heauen.

                     </gap>ious and couetous minde:</hi> and so they make Christ here to speake of liberalitie and couetousnes. Now it is true that the words will beare this sense, for <hi>Salomon</hi> puts the <hi>good eye,</hi> for the liberall and mercifull person: Prov. 22. 9. <hi>He that hath the good eye, he shall be blessed: for he giueth of his bread vnto the poore:</hi> and <hi>the euill eye,</hi> for the couetous person: Prov. 28. 22. <hi>A man of a wicked eye hasteth vnto riches.</hi> But though the words will beare this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, yet it is not (as I take it) the proper meaning of Christ in this place: for here, the <hi>light of the bodie,</hi> the <hi>single eye,</hi> and the <hi>light that is in vs,</hi> be all put for one and the same thing. Now <hi>the light that is in vs,</hi> is the vnderstanding and iudgement of the minde. Againe, the <hi>eye</hi> is here called the light of the whole bodie: but the liberall minde cannot be the light of the whole bodie for all actions, but for workes of mercy and bountie onely.</p>
               <p>To come therefore to that which I take to be Christs true meaning:<note place="margin">The true meaning.</note> The words containe in them diuers similitudes: In the first wordes,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:14013:182"/>
                  <hi>The light of the bodie is the eye,</hi> is a parable taken from a candle in an house; for as a burning candle set vp in an house lighteth the house and all that be in it; so <hi>the light of this eye</hi> (which is the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) lighteth the whole bodie and giueth direction to the whole man, in all his actions. In the next words, <hi>If thine eye be single, &amp;c.</hi> to the end of the 23. verse, is a second similitude, which standeth thus: If a man haue a good and cleare bodily eye, he can guide himselfe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus stand the comparisons in these words: Now the meaning of them is this. The first words are plaine, <hi>The light of the bodie is the eye,</hi> that is, the eye giues light for the direction of the bodie; as a light in an house directs the housholders in their affaires. <hi>If thine eye be single, &amp;c.</hi> By <hi>eye</hi> here is meant the minde, resembled by the bodily eye: and <hi>the single eye</hi> is the vnderstanding mind, able to iudge of good and euill, of things to be done, and not to be done. <hi>Thy whole bodie shall be light:</hi> by <hi>bodie</hi> is meant, the <hi>life, and by light</hi> is meant, <hi>well ordered and directed:</hi> for the mind is to the life for the directing of it, that which the eye is to the bodie for the ordering thereof. <hi>But if thine eye be wicked, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>wicked eye</hi> is the <hi>corrupt mind,</hi> hauing the vnderstanding darkned, &amp; iudgement so depraued that it cannot right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discerne of good and euill, what is to be done, and what is to be left vndone. <hi>Then all thy bodie shall be darke;</hi> that is, thy whole life in all thine actions shall be full of sinne and disorder. <hi>Wherefore if the light that is in thee be darknesse;</hi> that is, if the natural light of reason and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment left in man after the fall, be quite extinguished. <hi>How great is that darknesse;</hi> that is, wonderfull shall his corruption and disorder be; yea so full of confusion, that there shall be no difference betweene his life and the life of a brute beast. And this I take to be Christs proper meaning.</p>
               <p>Now the words thus explaned, depend vpon the former as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer<note place="margin">The cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> to a secret obiection, which the heart of man might frame vnto it selfe, against those two commandements, to this effect. If there be such necessitie of laying vp treasures in heauen, and of auoyding to lay vp
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:14013:183"/>
treasures in earth, then why doe not the most wise and learned men of our time doe so; they seeke more for earthly treasures then for heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Hereto Christ answers thus, as if he had saide; maruell not at this, for they want the single eye, the vnderstanding mind to discerne of things that differ, they cannot iudge aright of the true treasure, and so not knowing the heauenly, they seeke the earthly treasure only. Now that we may preceiue the words of Christ thus to answer the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer obiection, we must know that Christ doeth here presuppose thus much; that euery mans eye is either single, corrupt, or blind: and <hi>the single eye</hi> which is a good vnderstanding, befalls not all men, no not all wise and learned men, but them onely to whome God in mercie giues it. But the <hi>corrupt eye</hi> befalls euery man naturally. And some by sinne put out the light of nature, and so become senselesse in spirituall things. And hence it is, that all men naturally wanting the single eye, and hauing the corrupt eye, yea many hauing the blind eye, doe not discerne of the true treasure: and so leaue the heauenly and giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues wholy to the earthly.</p>
               <p>Thus we see both the meaning and the coherence, leading vs to the maine cause of couetousnes, which the blind eye of the mind not able to discerne of true spirituall treasure. Now in the words these three points are to be handled: I. The single eye with the fruites there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: II. The wicked eye with his fruites. III. The dark and blind eye with the fruites thereof.</p>

And for our better instruction<note place="margin">The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde by Adams fall.</note> herein, we must know, that the mind of man by Adams fall receiues a two fold blemish: first, it hath lost the gift of discerning and iudging in<note place="margin">1</note> spiritual things, mistaking euill for good, earthly for heauenly, things to be refused, for things to be chosen.

We therefore must remember to get the single eie, else we are no schollers in the schoole of Christ. Indeed some plead, that Preachers can say no more in effect but this, <hi>Loue God aboue all, and thy neighbour as thy selfe:</hi> but these men know not what they say, blessing themselues in their ignorance: they must know that grace must be put to nature, and sanctifie it; and spirituall knowledge ioyned with naturall, or else we remaine with the wicked eie.

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:14013:187"/>
this light) yet it may be so buried and couered, that no light shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, nor any vse be made of it, and then is it said to be <hi>darkenes;</hi> which is the state of those that are giuen vp to a reprobate sense, as when a man denies there is a God, or that the Scriptures be the word of God, or such like; in these men naturall light is become darkenesse. And the cause of this change in them, is their corrupt will and rebellious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which ouer-ruling naturall knowledge and conscience, cause men to giue themselues to actuall sinnes, whereby at length they come to commit sinne greedily and without remorse; yea, euen against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and the light of nature, and so burie them both in such sort, that they haue no more vse of them, then if they were quite put out.</p>
               <p>Now where the light of nature is thus put out, the fruite of it is most<note place="margin">The fruit of the blinde etc.</note> palpable darknesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>How great is that darkenesse?</hi> that is, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in that mans life, but brutish confusion in hellish actions, of pride, couetousnesse, enuie, blasphemie, and vnnaturall vncleannesse; as Rom. 1. 27, 29, &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>The Use.</hi> Considering the light of nature may be thus put out, wee<note place="margin">A motiue to consider our naturall vilenesse.</note> must hereby be admonished, First, to enter into a serious consideration of our owne vilenesse; for naturally wee haue in vs (euen the best of vs all) such rebellious lust, and damnable desires, as vnlesse they be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or renewed by grace, will darken, and as good as put out the light of nature. This should make vs vile in our owne eies, that nourish such corruptions, and esteeme so of sinne, which wil put out that light which yet <hi>Adams</hi> fall left in vs.</p>

Many men thinke much to be crossed of their naturall desires and delights, but it is happie for the soule, when God in his prouidence doth breake men of their wills; for the will vnsubdued carries the whole man headlong into all disorder. This must be considered of them which haue knowledge and learning, for vnlesse the will and affections be ruled by the word, all knowledge is made fruitlesse: <hi>out of the heart</hi> (saith <note n="a" place="margin">Pro. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, if the light of nature may bee turned into darkenesse, then<note place="margin">The illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at the Gospel may be put out.</note> may the illumination of the Gospel be put out &amp; turned into darkenes; for the knowledge of the Gospel is not naturall, and therefore not so deeply imprinted in the vnderstanding, vpon the bare knowledge of it. Experience sheweth this to be true, in all those temporizers which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in the spirit, &amp; end in the flesh: &amp; the author to the Hebrews shews<note place="margin">Fine degrees of apostacie.</note> 5. degrees of apostacie, by which the illumination of the Gospel is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into darkenesse, Heb. 3. 12. saying, <hi>Take heede lest there be in any of you an euill heart of vnbeleefe, &amp;c.</hi> where the first degree, is consenting<note place="margin">1</note> vnto sinne, beeing deceiued with the temptation of it. The second, is<note place="margin">2</note> hardnesse of heart, vpon many practises of sin. Thirdly, the heart beeing<note place="margin">3</note> hardened, becomes vnbeleeuing, and calls the truth of the Gospel into question. Fourthly, by vnbeleefe it becomes euill, hauing a base con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit<note place="margin">4</note> of the Gospel. Fiftly, this euill heart brings a man to apostacie, and<note place="margin">5</note> falling from God, which is the extinguishing of the light of the Gospel. We therefore to preuent this feareful estate, must embrace the Gospel, and practise the counsel there set down; euen by looking carefully eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to his owne heart and life, and by mutuall admonition and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation one of another, vers. 13. that so the first step of this apostacie, which is <hi>the deceitfulnesse of sinne,</hi> take not place in vs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, seeing the light of nature may bee put out, whether may<note place="margin">Sauing grace cannot be lost.</note> not true faith, and other sauing graces be quite lost? <hi>Answ.</hi> There is no grace of God, but considered in it selfe, it may be lost; for it is a creature, and so is changeable, for nothing is vnchangeable in it selfe, but the Creatour: but in regard of the promise God, touching the preseruation of sauing grace vnto the ende<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in such as be in Christ: hence it comes that faith, hope, and charitie, cannot be lost; for <hi>the gifts and calling of God, are without repentance in Christ.</hi> God indeede gaue to <hi>Adam</hi> true and perfect grace, whereby he might haue stoode if he would; but because he decreed to permit the fall, to make a way for his mercie in Christ, therefore he left man in the hand of his owne counsell, and so he fell from his created integritie: but now in Christ God workes both the will and the deede, so as he which doth truly beleeue, <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 125. 1</note> 
                  <hi>is as mount Zion, which cannot be remooued, but standeth fast for euer:</hi> for he is built vpon <hi>the</hi>

grace vnto the first, &amp; by vertue hereof it becomes vncha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geable, though in it selfe considered, it might be lost. Againe, I answer thus; that as the light of nature is not quite put out, but onely buried, in such sort as it is without vse, and seemes exstinguished; so the grace of faith, by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of sinne may be hidde and couered, so as it shall not appeare for a time: but yet it cannot be quite put out, where it is once truly wrought. And thus much of the blinde eie, with the fruit thereof.</p>
               <p>Now to end this place, wee must remember that the scope of Christ in these two verses, is to shew that the euill and blind eie of man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby he is disabled to discerne rightly of things that differ, is the cause why in seeking after treasure, he leaueth the heauenly, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth earthly treasure onely. And hereby we must be admonished to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for this gift of discerning, by the illumination of the spirit in the word, as we shewed before, that so <hi>the eie beeing single, the whole body may be light:</hi> that is, so ordered, that with peace and comfort wee may walke on in the way of life: whereas otherwise, we walke in darkenesse, and feare no danger till we fall into it irrecouerably.</p>

                     </gap> both, and lay vp both treasures for himselfe in earth, and in heauen also.</hi> To this Christ answers, <hi>No: that is impossible;</hi> and he prooues it thus: <hi>No man can serue two masters: But to seeke heauenly and earthly treasures, is to serue two masters; to wit, God and Mammon: and therefore no man can seeke them both.</hi> The first part of this reason is fully set down, and proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the text, by the effect of such seruice in contrarie affections and behauiour; <hi>for either he shall hate the one, and loue the other, &amp;c.</hi> The as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption and conclusion are necessarily implied in the last words, <hi>Yee cannot serue God and Mammon:</hi> wherein Christ applies the former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Exposition. No man can serue two masters.</hi> This may well bee doubted of; for experience shewes, that by their mutuall consent, one Factor may serue diuers Marchants. Hereto some answer thus, that it is implied, the masters must be of diuers and contrarie qualities; as when one saith, <hi>come and doe this;</hi> the other saith, <hi>doe it not:</hi> and then no man
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:14013:188"/>
can serue them both: and thus the words containe an holy truth. But yet because no clause is expressed, implying contrarietie in the masters; therfore I take it, the words must be taken as a <hi>common prouerb</hi> among the Iewes, which Christ Iales downe for the ground of his reason. Now in a prouerb it is not requisite it should be alwaies true, but for the most part, and ordinarily; as Luk. 4. 24. <hi>No Prophet is accepted in his owne countrie:</hi> that is, ordinarily. <hi>For either he shall hate the one</hi> that is, the one master commanding him; either disliking that he should be his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, or displeased with his commandements: <hi>And loue the other;</hi> that is, the other master in whom he taketh delight, and is well pleased with his commandements. <hi>Or else he shall leane to the one, and despise the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> These words are an explication of the former, shewing how it may appeare, that a seruant hates one master, and loues another; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>his leaning to the one,</hi> declares his loue vnto him: that is, his applying of himselfe to respect his masters pleasure, and to doe his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And <hi>hic despising the other,</hi> declares his hatred, when he hath no regard to his commandements. <hi>Yee cannot serue God and Mammon.</hi> By <hi>mammon</hi> he meaneth riches, lucre, and gaine: now he saith not, Ye cannot serue God and haue riches, for <hi>Abraham, Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> were very rich, and yet serued God sincerely: but <hi>ye cannot serue God, and serue riches;</hi> that is, giue your selues to seeke riches, and set your hearts vpon them, and serue God also.</p>
               <p>In the words thus explaned wee may obserue sundrie instructions:<note place="margin">Instruct.</note> First, here Christ sheweth <hi>what it is to serue God:</hi> a point much spoken<note place="margin">1</note> of, but little knowne, and lesse practised. <hi>To serue God</hi> therefore, is <hi>to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What it is to serue God.</note> 
                  <hi>loue God, and to cleane vnto him.</hi> Euery one will say, he loueth God, &amp; euer hath done; but beware herein of spirituall guile, for true loue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists not in word and tongue, but in deed, and in truth: and God must be loued, not onely as he is a bountifull father, but as he is a Lord and master, and doth command vs seruice. The written word shewes his will and pleasure, concerning vs, what he requireth at our hands; and if we serue him indeed, we must loue him in his power of commanding, though he should bestowe no reward vpon vs. This <hi>Dauid</hi> sheweth notably, Psal. 119. 25. <hi>I am thy seruant, graunt me therefore vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that I may know thy testimonies.</hi> Againe, if we serue God, we must <hi>cleane vnto him,</hi> and thereby testifie our loue: now what is meant by <hi>cleaning vnto,</hi> is notably expressed in the parable of the prodigal sonne, Luk. 15. 15. where it is said of him, that hauing spent his portion, <hi>hee claue to a citizen of that countrie;</hi> that is, he resigned and gaue himselfe to his seruice: So <hi>to cleane vnto God,</hi> is to resigne a mans selfe vnto
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:14013:189"/>
Gods seruice, in obedience to all his commandements, and embracing all his promises: not suffering himselfe to be drawne from any part of Gods word, by vnbeleefe or disobedience, though all the world should set against vs. This Dauid also professeth of himselfe, saying, <note n="a" place="margin">Ps. 119. 31</note> 
                  <hi>I haue cleaued to thy testimonies O Lord, and</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Ps. 119. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>I shall not be confounded when I haue respect vnto all thy commandements.</hi> On the contrarie, when a man withdrawes himselfe from God, by disobedience to his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by vnbeleefe, then he doth hate and despise him. Indeed the vilest wretch that liues, is ashamed with open mouth to professe hatred &amp; despite of God, but yet the bad practise in life, bewraies the bad affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the heart: Prou. 14. 2.—<hi>He that is lewd or peruerse in his waies, despiseth God;</hi> &amp; they that liue in the <hi>breach of his commandements hate him,</hi> Exod. 20. 5. let them professe in word what they will.</p>
               <p>Now the consideration hereof serueth, First, to discouer vnto vs the<note place="margin">Vse. 1. The ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the world</note> grosse blindnesse and superstitious ignorance of the world; who thinke, that if a man rehearse the Lords praier, the Creede, and the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, he serues God well, let his life be what it will: but here Christ teacheth vs a further thing; if we will be Gods seruants, we must cleaue vnto him both in the affections of our heart, and in actions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in our life. Thus did <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God said vnto him, <hi>thou shalt not kill,</hi> he kept himselfe from murther; but when he said, <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 22. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham kill thy sonne,</hi> he addressed himselfe to doe it, though he were the sonne of the promise, and the onely sonne of his old age. Secondly, this<note place="margin">2</note> sheweth how <hi>Atheisme</hi> abounds in all places at this day; <hi>for to hate and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Atheisme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds.</note> 
                  <hi>despise God is flat Atheisme:</hi> now they that withdraw their hearts from God, and set themselues to seeke the things of this world, neglecting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Gods holy commandements, are here accounted of Christ, <hi>despisers, and haters of God;</hi> and the number of such is great in euery place. I know such men doe scorne to be called <hi>Atheists,</hi> but how they be esteemed in the world, it skilleth not, till they reforme this wicked practise, they are no better in the sight of Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mammon</hi> are here opposed as two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;<note place="margin">2</note> hence we learne that <hi>Mammon,</hi> that is, <hi>riches,</hi> is a <hi>great lord and</hi>

                  <hi>master in the world:</hi> this Christ here takes for graunted, and therefore doth forewarne his Disciples of it. But how (will some say) can riches be a God? <hi>Answ.</hi> Not in themselues, for so they are the good creatures of God; but to the corrupt heart of man, which makes an ido<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">1</note> they doe for the true treasures of Gods heauenly graces. Secondly, let<note place="margin">2</note> a man haue worldly wealth at will, and he is full of ioy and delight, his riches giue him great contentment; but if hee loose his goods, then vexation and sorrowe doth more oppresse him, then all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of God in the Bible can comfort him. Thirdly, by transgressing<note place="margin">3</note> Gods commaundements a man looseth heauen; but who is so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for his transgressions, whereby hee incurres this losse, as hee is for a small dammage in some part of his riches?

And that these <hi>Mammonists</hi> abound euery where, appeares by the common practises of oppression, extortion, and crueltie, in hard dealing towards the poore, by greedie Land-lords and Vsurers; as also by the practises of the rich in the time of dearth, for by their hoarding vp of store, ingrossing of commodities, and enhauncing of the price, to the augmenting of their priuate wealth, they mightily increase Gods wrath vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poore. Indeed God hath his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which haue him onely for their God, but the number of them is small, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of those that set their hearts vpon the world, and make Mammon their God.</p>

This may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by their whole behauiour about wealth, whether we consider their getting, their keeping, or imploying of it, in all which they sinne against God.

So that there is a lawfull care euen for the things of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> life. Now the practise of it stands in two things. First, in the diligent walking in a mans lawfull calling, dealing vprightly &amp; iustly therein with euery one, minding onely to get things honest and necessarie in the sight of all men. Secondly, in leauing the successe and issue of all our labour and endeauour to God, for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him: we must vse the meanes soberly and honestly, &amp; leaue the blessing to God. This godly care <hi>Moses</hi> shewed notably in leading the children of Israel out of Egypt: for what God commanded him to doe, that he did; he goes which way God sends him, although he met with many crosses; and vseth the meanes that God calls him vnto, leauing the issue to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as appeares notably at the red sea, when they were at a wonderful strait, hauing the sea before them, the Egyptians behind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and woods and mountaines on each side; yet beeing commanded to strike the waters with the rod of God, he shewes notable trust in Gods prouidence: <hi>Feare not</hi> (saith <note n="g" place="margin">Exod 14. 13.</note> he,) <hi>stand still, and behold the saluation of our God.</hi> And when <hi>Abraham</hi> at Gods commandement went to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his sonne, Isaac askes him, <hi>my father, where is the sacrifice?</hi>

Secondly, there is no<note place="margin">2</note> trade or calling without his conuaiances of craft and deceipt, though it doe not appeare so much in some callings, as in others; and hard it is to finde them that make conscience hereof, when gaine and profit may come thereby; which comes from this distrustfull care in mens hearts, whereby they doubt of Gods blessing answerable to their desire, in the vse of lawfull meanes onely. But sith Christ forewarnes vs of this sinne, we must beware it take not place in our hearts: and for the auoyding of it, we must follow the counsell of the holy Ghost in Scripture, Psal. 37. 5. <hi>Commit thy way vnto the Lord, and trust in him, and he shall bring it to passe:</hi> which is oft commended vnto vs, Psal. 55. 22. <hi>Cast thy burden vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord, &amp; he shall nourish thee:</hi> &amp; Pro. 16. 3. <hi>Rowle thy worke vpon the Lord:</hi> 1.

But Christ doth thus distinguish them so: iust cause; for though in cold countries, apparell serues to preserue life, as well as meate and drinke doe; yet the first and most generall vse of apparell, is another matter; to wit, to hide the shame of nakednesse, which the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> brought vpon it: Gen. 3. 7. 21. for before their fall, <hi>the man and the woman were both naked, &amp; were not ashamed,</hi> Gen. 2. 21.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>Here Christ propoundeth his <hi>third reason,</hi> against distrustfull and<note place="margin">3. Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustfull care.</note> carking care for worldly things, from the <hi>vnprofitablens and vanitie</hi> of it in man. The words of this reason are propounded by <hi>way of question:</hi> which kind of phrase imports the <hi>affirming</hi> or <hi>denying</hi> of the thing spoken of with more vehemence. And here it hath the force of <hi>a more vehement negation:</hi> as if Christ had said, Vndoubtedly not any of you by taking care can adde one cubit to his stature. A <hi>cubit</hi> is a measure taken from a part of mans bodie, beeing the length of the arme from the elbow, to the end of the longest finger. Now God in framing mans bodie, brings it from this length in the mothers wombe, by continuall increase adding cubit vnto cubit, till at last it containe many cubits in stature according as he hath ordained and appointed. And looke how many cubits long God hath ordained euery man to come vnto, of that stature and talnesse he is; and no man by all his wit, skill, and carefull industrie can adde one cubit vnto his stature: for that is the proper worke of the creatour, he that giues the bodie, appoints the stature, and by his prouidence brings it thereto, by daily increase. Now hence Christ reasons thus, from the like: <hi>As no man by taking care in all the meanes he can vse, can augment his stature one cubit,</hi> he cannot doe the the <hi>least thing</hi> this way, as <note n="p" place="margin">Luk. 12. 26</note> 
                  <hi>S. Luke</hi> noteth; <hi>no more can any man by his distrustfull care better his outward estate for things needefull to this life any whit at all:</hi> and therefore sith it is vaine and fruitlesse to vexe our hearts herewith, we must beware of this distrustfull care.</p>
               <p>From this reason we may obserue and gather sundrie instructions.<note place="margin">Mans labour vaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods blessing.</note> First, that mans labour, care, and industrie, is altogether vaine and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, without the blessing of Gods prouidence. Psal. 127. 1, 2. <hi>Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vaine that build it: except the Lord keepe the citie, the keeper watcheth in vaine. It is in vaine for you</hi>

                  <hi>to rise earely, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Cor. 3. 7. <hi>Neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth,</hi> (meaning, of themselues) <hi>but God giueth the increase.</hi> This point the Lord doth notably expresse by Haggai, saying, <note n="q" place="margin">Hag. 8. 6-9.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye haue sowen much, and bring in little:—and he that earneth wages putteth it in a bottomlesse bagge. Ye looked for much, and lo, it came to little, and when it came home I did blow vpon it.</hi> The consideration whereof must teach vs to commend all the sober care and labour of our lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to God by praier for his blessing: for it is <hi>his blessing that maketh rich,</hi> Prov. 10. 22. If <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> two most worthie men, could doe nothing of themselues, what shall we thinke to doe? and when we find Gods blessing vpon our labour, then we must giue thanks.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hence we learne that no man can better his outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state<note place="margin">Mans out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward estate is appointed of God.</note> in the world, for wealth and dignitie by all his care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, aboue that which God hath appointed him to come vnto: for as God hath determined of mans bodily stature, which no man by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care can adde vnto or alter, so hath he appointed in his decree what shall be mans estate, for wealth or pouertie, dignitie or disgrace, which it lies not in the power of man, or any creature to alter: indeede the diligent vse of lawfull meanes is an argument of Gods blessing in outward things, and therefore must be followed and exercised in sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie and godlinesse of those that waite for such blessings, because ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily God conuaies his blessings by such meanes: but yet the state of man depends not on the means, but on Gods decree and pleasure: Psal. 75. 6, 7. <hi>To come to preforrement is neither from the East nor from the West: but God is iudge: he maketh high, and he maketh low:</hi> and, Prov. 22. 2. <hi>The poore and the rich meete together, and God is the maker of them both.</hi> In regard whereof we must learne, to depend vpon God in the sober vse of lawfull meanes, and to rest contented with his blessing thereupon be it more or lesse: for whatsoeuer it is, it is that portion which God hath allotted vnto vs.</p>

Indeede art may help to preserue life till it come to the period in nature, but further to prolong it, is beyond the art and power of man: for <hi>man is not lord ouer the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to retaine the spirit,</hi> Eccles. 8. 8. <hi>God hath herein appointed his bounds</hi>

               <p>In these three verses Christ returneth to his former commandement<note place="margin">Distrustfull car. forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note> against distrustfull care conteyned in the 25. verse: and here vrgeth one part thereof concerning <hi>care for rayment,</hi> and the other for meate and drinke, in the 31. verse. Now what meaneth Christ by this maner of handling this heauenly doctrine, not onely to propound it, and to vrge it by strong and forcible reasons, but againe to repeat it, and vrge it by peece-meale? Surely, hereby he declares himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be the true doctor of his Church: for hauing a waightie point of doctrine in hand, which the nature of man in vnwilling to receiue and practise, he doeth beside the propounding and confirming of it, thus vrge it by peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale, that hereby it may the better take place in our heart, and be the more effectuall to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing forth obedience in our liues. And this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity must euery one shew that is to teach the word of God to others: not onely ministers, though it be their dutie specially, but also masters and parents, as Deut. 6. 7. <hi>thou shalt whet them vpon thy children</hi> (as the word signifies) that so it may more deeply enter into the heart.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the maner of prosecuting this argument. Now wee come to the words. <hi>And why care you for rayment?</hi> This interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath the force of a prohibition; and so it is the same with this branch of the 25. verse, <hi>care not for your bodie what you shall put on.</hi> Now all care for apparell is not here forbidden; for there is a lawfull godly care, whereby men seeke and labour vprightly and in a sober maner for such apparell as is meete for their callings, and needefull to the health and comfort of their bodies. But the care here forbidden, is an<note place="margin">Inordinate care for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell.</note> inordinate and immoderate care for apparell, ioyned either with distrust and feare of want, or els with a discontentednesse with that apparell which is meete and necessarie. And this is the common sinne of this age, as the sundrie bad practises of men and women about apparell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from this inordinate care, doe euidently declare: as first, the<note place="margin">1</note> affecting of superfluitie and aboundance in apparell, and the following of strange and forraine fashions so soone as they are taken vp. Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> the wearing of too costly apparell, aboue their abilitie and degree: as when seruants are as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ine as their masters, trades-men like gentlemen; and gentles, like nobles. Thirdly, the spending of much time in the<note place="margin">3</note> curious trimming and attiring of the bodie which might be spent in better duties. This proceeds from some dislike in Gods workmanship, as though he had not done his part throughly to their bodies, or they by their curiositie could make themselues better.</p>
               <p>Now that Christ might remooue out of mens hearts this inordinate
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:14013:198"/>
care, he doeth here enforce his commandement by a fourth reason, taken from his <hi>prouidence ouer the lilies of the field,</hi> and the reason is waightie, though the subiect of it be meane and simple. It may be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thus:</p>
               <p>If God c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>othe the lilies of the field, then doubtlesse he will clothe you: But God clotheth the lilies of the field: Therefore much more will he clothe you.</p>
               <p>This reason is fully set downe in these three verses, though the parts of it be inuerted, by reason of their amplifications: for first, Christ propounds to our consideration the <hi>subiect matter</hi> whence his reason is drawen, <hi>learne how the lilies of the field doe grow.</hi> Where this must be marked, that Christ speakes of <hi>field-lilies,</hi> which haue not the help of man, as garden flowers haue; Then he layes downe a proofe of his assumption, <hi>that God clothes them,</hi> by remoouing from them the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie meanes of clothing; They labour not, neither spinne, v. 28. am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying this work of God vpon them by a comparison, wherin he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the glorie of them before the glorie of <hi>Salomon</hi> in his princely araie, verse 29. And then by way of inference propounds the reason, omitting the assumption, verse 30. where the first part, and conclusion are both propounded and amplified as we shall see when we come to the handling of them: for I will follow the order obserued by Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Learne how the lilies of the field doe grow.</hi> Here Christ makes the<note place="margin">Vnsensible creatures are our teachers</note> lilies and hearbes of the field a schoolmaster vnto man, yea to his owne disciples (for he spake to them.)

And hence it is, that when by true faith a man laies holde on the maine promise of God in Christ, he doth withall apprehend the promises of God for temporall blessings: the heart that saith by faith, <hi>God will pardon my sinne, and saue my soule,</hi> will say also by the same faith, <hi>God will giue me food and raiment, and all things sufficient for this life.</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 4. 18.</note> by the same faith whereby he was iustified, <hi>beleeued Gods promise, that hee should haue a sonne in his olde age:</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi>

Now hence<note place="margin">Liue by faith</note> we learne, that as we looke to be saued by our faith after death, so wee must liue by faith in this world; if wee relie vpon his mercie for our soules, we must depend vpon his prouidence for our bodies: how this is done, we shall see afterward; for how should we cast our selues vpon Gods mercie for the kingdome of heauen, if wee cannot depend vpon his prouidence for food and raiment.</p>

               <p>Here Christ againe repeateth his commandement against distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full care giuen in the 25. verse. The reasons of his repetition be these: First, to set an edge vpon the commandement, that so it may more sharply and deepely enter into their hearts, as we said before. Secondly, to further his disciples in this practise of faith, for by this often repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he giues them occasion to meditate and thinke vpon the dutie the oftner, whereby their faith must needes be much confirmed: for this we must know for our direction to get and strengthen true faith in our hearts, that a man is not a meere patient in the receiuing and strengthening of this grace; it comes not from God to vs, as visions did to the Prophets in a dreame in the night, or as the print of the seale is set into the waxe, but God workes it in the vse of ordinarie meanes. And therefore if we would haue faith wrought or increased in vs, we must doe that which by nature we may doe; to wit, heare the word preached, and read, we must meditate therein, and labour so to vrge the promises of God vpon our owne hearts; yea, we must doe what we can, to stirre vp in our hearts a desire to beleeue, and to striue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst doubting and distrust, and therefore must giue our selues to praier with sighs and groanes to God, for the working of his spirit in our hearts.</p>
               <p>Now touching this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement against distrustfull care, we hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it in the 25. v. shewing how farre our care must goe for things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and where it must stay. It must extend it selfe to the diligent vse of

lawfull ordinarie meanes to procure things needefull, and there stay; giuing place to faith to waite vpon Gods prouidence for the blessing<note place="margin">How distru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stfull care may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</note> of our endeauours. The distrustfull care which perplexeth the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the successe of our lawfull labours, is that which Christ forbids, and it is that euil sicknesse which infects most mens soules, as they may easily discerne by obseruing these things: <hi>What it is, that oft breakes their sleepe in the night: what comes first into their thoughts when they awake; and what their mindes runne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here onely obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e how Christ describes this vnlawfull care by the effects of it in distrustfull persons, bringing them in, saying, <hi>What shall we eate? what shall we drinke? or wherewith shall we be cloathed?</hi> And thus indeede they vse to complaine, especially when they haue great charges and slender meanes, or els doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sustaine any great losses, then, <hi>how shall we liue? what shall we doe?</hi> and such like speeches of distrust: which Christ here iustly reprooues, because they blame God for his dealing towards them; as though he had no care of them, or would not prouide things needefull for them. We therefore must here learne to shut our mouthes against distrustfull thoughts, and beware we mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure not nor complaine of his dealing towards vs. When <note n="l" place="margin">Levit. 10. 2, 3.</note>

               <p>This verse containes Christs fifth and sixth reasons, to disswade his hearers from distrustfull care. The fifth is drawne from the practise of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:14013:202"/>
the Gentiles, and it standeth thus:</p>
               <p>That which the Gentiles doe which know not God, you must not doe,<note place="margin">5. Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustfull care.</note> (they doing amisse:)</p>
               <p>But the Gentiles seeke thus distrustfully for things needefull: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you must not doe so.</p>
               <p>The words in the originall whereby Christ declareth this behauiour of the Gentiles, be more full and emphaticall then our translation doth expresse: for they import that the Gentiles <hi>set themselues to seeke,</hi> or<note place="margin">

                  <hi>seeke with all their might.</hi> Which must be obserued, because it is not a sinne simply to seeke things necessarie, but wholly to giue our selues thereto, that is, the sinne; because it proceedes from distrust in God. <hi>Quest.</hi> Why did the Gentiles thus wholly giue themselues to seeke things necessarie? <hi>Ans.</hi> Because they know not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>This point well obserued; first, ouerthrowes the opinion of <hi>vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall</hi>

               <p>Secondly, this shewes that they who set their hearts vpon the world,<note place="margin">2</note>

This is the state of many among vs, who beare the name of Christians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but indeed and practise are as Turkes, and Pagans: and this reason alone well waighed is sufficient to mooue any christian heart in a moderate care to seeke earthly things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, marke the ground of this reason; Christs disciples had the<note place="margin">3</note> true God for their God, which the Gentiles had not, and therefore<note place="margin">Christians must in all things be vnlike the heathen.</note> they must differ from the Gentiles in their behauiour.

               <q>For your heauenly father knoweth that you haue neede of all these things.</q>
               <p>These wordes containe Christs sixth reason to his Disciples against<note place="margin">6. Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst distru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stfull care.</note> distrustfull care, drawen from Gods speciall prouidence ouer them: and it also includes an answer to a secret obiection against Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: for some man might say; If we may not be carefull for things needfull, who shall prouide them? Christ here answers; <hi>you must not be distrustfully carefull, for you haue a father in heauen, who knowes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you haue need, and careth for you. Now looke whereof God takes care in your behalfe, you need not trouble your selues further then the sober vse of lawfull meanes: But God your heauenly father takes notice of your estate, and will prouide that which is best for you: and therefore you need not to vexe your minds there-about.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A most worthie reason, and alone sufficient to driue vs from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustfull care: for this acquainteth vs with Gods particular and speciall prouidence ouer vs, taking notice of our estate whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">A notable ground of contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> it is, and disposing it to the best.

By <hi>kingdome of God</hi> is here meant, <hi>a state and condition of man in this life, whereby in Christ he enioyes the fauour of God, and hath right to euerlasting life.</hi> This very estate of man is in Scripture called the <hi>kingdome of God,</hi> and the <hi>kingdome of heauen,</hi> because whosoeuer is in this estate, hath sure right and interest to Gods glorie in heauen, and God here rules in him, as a king ruleth in his kingdome. The <hi>kingdome of God</hi> is onely one, and<note place="margin">Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in two degrees.</note> yet it hath two degrees; the first in grace, and the second in glorie. The <hi>kingdome of grace,</hi> is that spirituall regiment which God exerciseth in man, or in his Church, by his word and spirit in this life; and it is the first step or entrance into Gods heauenly kingdome. The <hi>kingdome of glorie,</hi> is the full fruition of immediate fellowship with the blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, by meanes of Iesus Christ in the highest heauens, after this life. Now both these degrees are here vnderstood by the kingdom of God. The second thing to be thus sought for, is <hi>his righteousnesse,</hi> that is, the righteousnesse of God, and not as some translate it, the righteousnesse thereof, that is, of Gods kingdome; for the wordes will not beare that translation. And the seeking of Gods righteousnesse is here added for
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:14013:203"/>
speciall cause; to let vs see by way of explication, when we haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for our selues the kingdome of God: for Gods kingdome standes in <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> and then doth God rule in man, when hee makes him<note place="margin">Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is Christs obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> partaker of his righteousnesse. Now by <hi>righteousnesse of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> wee must here vnderstand, the obedience which Christ our mediatour perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for vs, in fulfilling the law, and in his sufferings. This is the very ground-worke and foundation of Gods kingdome among men: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh oft, Rom. 1. 17. <hi>For by it,</hi> that is, the Gospel, <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of God is reuealed from faith to faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and Rom. 3. 21, 22. <hi>Now is the righteousnesse of God made manifest, &amp;c.</hi> and 2. Cor. 5. 21. <hi>God made him to be sinne for vs, which knew no sinne, that wee might be made</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why it is so called.</note> 
                  <hi>the righteousnesse of God in him.</hi> And it is so called for diuers respects; <hi>First,</hi> because it is freely giuen vs of God to be our righteousnesse in his<note place="margin">1</note> sight: and man cannot attaine vnto it of himselfe, by any worke of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or of grace, without the gift of God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> because God will<note place="margin">2</note> accept this obedience of Christ at the day of iudgement, for his elect, as satisfying his iustice, and the rigour of the law, which no righteousnes of man can doe. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> because it is the righteousnesse of that person<note place="margin">3</note> who is God; for Christ is both God and man, and though he obeyed the law, and suffered death, as he was man, yet that obedience was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by that person who was also God. <hi>Adams</hi> righteousnesse by creation, was in himselfe, but he lost it by his fall: but our righteousnes is in Christ out of vs, and therefore he is said,<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 30</note> 
                  <hi>to be made righteousnesse vnto vs of God.</hi> But how should we get this righteousnesse, seeing it is in Christ? <hi>Answ.</hi> It is made ours by imputation, for when wee truely repent of our sinnes, and beleeue in Christ, God accepts the obedience of Christ for vs, as if wee had perfectly satisfied his iustice, and done his will in our own persons. Now with this imputed righteousnesse, wee must vnderstand and ioyne the fruite hereof in vs, which is <hi>sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or <hi>renued holinesse,</hi> whereby we are enabled to walke before God in new obedience, bringing forth the fruits of righteousnesse: for these two are neuer seuered; whom God iustifies by the righteousnesse of Christ, them he sanctifies by his spirit.

But if wee would set our selues to seeke this kingdome, wee needed not to feare the want of any needfull blessing; for so God promised to his people, to giue them aboundance of all things, if they would obey his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, which are the lawes and statutes of his kingdome: Deut. 21. 1, 2. &amp;c.</p>

Wherein we shew our selues foolish and simple, like to little children, who are better pleased with the gift of a nut or an apple, then with the promise of rich reuenues, or great inheritance. II. This teacheth vs with what minde we must seeke the temporall blessings of this life; namely, with the same honest minde, wherewith wee seeke the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, for they are appurtenances therevnto, and depend vpon it: and therefore with an vpright heart, we must onely vse lawfull meanes moderately for the getting of them. And when we haue them, this may direct vs in the right ende whereto we must vse our temporall blessings; namely, to the furtherance of our selues and others towards the kingdome of God; so wee <hi>honour God with our riches,</hi> as <hi>Salomon</hi> biddes vs, Prou. 3. 9.

And out of question this is the state of euery naturall man, though he be neuer so great a monarke in the world, while hee is out of Gods kingdom, wanting righteousnes and regeneration by Iesus Christ.

IV. An vnfained turning vnto God from all sinne by newe obedience, hauing a constant purpose of heart not to sin, and a godly endeauour in life to please God in all things. These are the markes of the newe creature, who hath true title to Gods kingdome; which we must labour to find in our selues, for our comfort in the vse of Gods creatures: and if we finde them in vs, our title is good, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his creatures, but to his kingdome, notwithstanding our owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse by our former iniquities.</p>
               <p>IV. In this, that temporall blessings are dependants on Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">4</note> we must learne contentation and patience in all temporal losses<note place="margin">A ground of contentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in losses.</note> whatsoeuer, though we loose friends, goods, lands, libertie, reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or life it selfe, yet we must not be ouerwhelmed with sorrow or griefe; for if we be Gods children, and retaine his fauour, the kingdom of heauen remaines sure vnto vs: while a mans stocke remaines, though some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances bee taken from him, he counts himselfe well enough; and so must we in all worldly losses, while our title is good to Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Herewith our Sauiour Christ comforts his Disciples, Luk. 12. 32. <hi>Feare not little flocke, for it is your fathers pleasure to giue you the kingdome.</hi> Now if God giue vs that with his fauour in Christ, wee may be sure he would giue vs all temporall blessings, if hee saw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them to bee good for vs; <hi>for if he haue giuen vs Christ, how shall he not with him giue vs all things also?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this promise of Christ, to <hi>giue his kingdome to them that seeke it,</hi> and beside, <hi>to cast all temporall blessings vnto them,</hi> if they seeke
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:14013:207"/>
his kingdome principally, doth notably commend vnto vs the bountiful goodnes of God; for here we see he giues to his children more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they<note place="margin">God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> aske or seeke. And this bountie of God <hi>Paul</hi> expresseth as a ground of our praising God, Eph. 3. 20. <hi>To him therefore that is able to doe excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abundantly aboue all that we can aske or thinke, according to the power that worketh in vs, be praise in the Church, by Iesus Christ:</hi> where we must obserue, that hee speakes of Gods abilitie to be bountifull, as brought into actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his children, so as he is not only able, but willing hereunto: and hereof we haue daily experience in the blessings of God which we doe enioy, for when we pray for spirituall graces, God giues them vnto vs, and many temporal blessings also. This <hi>Dauid</hi> confesseth, Psal. 21. 3. <hi>Thou diddest preuent me with liberall blessings:</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> found it to be true, who asking only <hi>a wise &amp; vnderstading heart,</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>riches &amp; honour besides his wisedom,</hi> 1. Ki. 3. 13. And so did <hi>Iacob,</hi>

                  <hi>he went out but with a staffe yet returned with two bands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the consideration of this bountie of God must teach vs these<note place="margin">1. Duties fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods boun ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> duties; First, to <hi>beware of all sinne,</hi> whereby we doe offend and displease our God, who is so gratious and bountifull vnto vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if our outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state did depend vpon others, we would then be careful so to carrie our selues towards them, as that we would not willingly giue them any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or cause of dislike; how much more ought we then to seeke the continuance of Gods fauour towards vs by all good behauiour, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him depends our whole estate both temporall and eternall? Secondly, <hi>to trust God with our liues, health, bodies, and all wee haue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> for foode, raiment, and protection, in the sober vse of lawfull meanes, for he is a bountifull God. Thirdly, to seeke for helpe and succour<note place="margin">3</note> from God in all distresse and want, for hee is bountifull; <hi>hee giueth to all men liberally, and reproacheth no man,</hi> Iam. 1. 5. and therefore wee must be readie and forward to call vpon him, and to make our moane vnto him. Fourthly, to loue so bountifull a God, yea to enforce our<note place="margin">4</note> hearts to all duties of loue towards him: <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>Euery man is a friend to him that giueth gifts,</hi> Pro. 19. 6. but none is to bee compared to God for the riches of bountie; &amp; therefore our loue to him should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound. Fiftly, to be thankefull vnto God for all the good things we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy;<note place="margin">5</note> for whatsoeuer we haue, comes from his bountie: and therefore we must say with <hi>Dauid, What shall I giue vnto the Lord, for all his blessings are vpon me,</hi> Psal. 116. 12, 13. In a word, we must labour continually in<note place="margin">6</note> heart &amp; life, to walke worthy of the Lord, &amp; to please him in al things, beeing <hi>fruitfull in all good works</hi> (as the Apostle saith) Colos. 1. 10.</p>

                  <q>Care not for the morrow, for the morrow shall care for it selfe: the day hath enough with his owne griefe.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>Here Christ the third time repeats his commaundement against di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustful care, propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded first in the 25. verse; In which often repetition, hee intends to make vs more carefull and diligent, both to learne and practise the same. And hereto hee also addeth a seauenth reason to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force and further our obedience, drawne from the daily griefe &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which accompanies euery daie of our life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Exposition. Care not for the morrow:</hi> that is, for the time to come. This may seeme a strange commandement, tending to patronage sloth &amp; negligence; but wee must know, that there is a double care for<note place="margin">A double prouidence in man. 1. Godly.</note> the time to come. I. A godly lawfull care. II. A distrustfull and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate care. The godly care is that, whereby a man prouides for in the time present, such things as are needfull in the time to come, &amp; cannot then be prouided: this lawfull care wee may obserue in our <hi>Sauiour Christ,</hi> for he had a bag to keepe prouision for himselfe &amp; his disciples, which <hi>Iudas</hi> bare, Ioh. 13. 29. and when <hi>Agabus</hi> foretolde of a general famine, <hi>the Disciples prouided aforehand,</hi> to send succour to the brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which dwelt in Iudea, Act. 11. 28, 29. And thus may a trades-man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for maintenance while his strength and sight is good, against the time of his age, wherein hee may be vnable to follow his calling. And thus doe men in fit season prouide for foode and raiment. And we may prouide to day, that is, in the time present, for any needfull thing, when to morrow will not affoard it.</p>
               <p>The inordinate and distrustfull care for the morrow, is that whereby<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Inordinate prouidence</note> men vexe their mindes, and turmoile themselues, to prouide aforehand for such things as may well enough be had in the time to come: this <hi>parts and rents asunder the minde,</hi> as the word signifies: and this our Sauiour Christ forbids. It is indeede the common care of the world, and we may obscrue the practise of it three waies especially: I. When men prouide so much worldly goods for themselues, as would serue for many families, or for many generations: there be many such ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-goods, which scrape together as though they should neuer die, and they scarce know any ende of their wealth. This practise our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ here forbids; If any in a land might seeke for superfluitie, it is the King, whom bountie at all times well beseemeth; and yet God <hi>forbade the King ouer his owne people, to multiplie ouermuch his horses and furniture, his siluer and his golde,</hi> Deuteron. 17. 16, 17. II. When men seeke to preuent all losses &amp; casualties, and so plot for themselues, that howsoeuer it goe with others, yet they shall feele no
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:14013:208"/>
want; though others sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ue and goe naked, they shalbe full, and well clothed. III. when men prouide or to day and to morrow together a forehand, when as the morrowes prouision may sufficiently, safely, and soone enough be made on it owne day: This Christ doeth chiefly aime at, as crossing the practise of faith whereby we should daylie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon his prouidence.</p>
               <q>For the morrow shall care for it selfe; the day hath enough with his owne greefe.</q>
               <p>These words conteine Christs seuenth reason against distrustfull<note place="margin">7. Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst distru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stfull care.</note> care: the effect whereof is this, euery day of mans life hath care enough and greefe sufficient, through the busines that falls out thereon and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs vnto it, and therefore we are not to adde thervnto another dayes care and greefe, for so we should bring vpon our selues more care and greefe then needes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The morrow,</hi> that is, the time to come, <hi>shall care for itselfe.</hi> Here Christ answers a question which might be made from the former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; for hauing forbidden care for the morrow, some might say; How shall we doe on the morrowe, and the time to come? Christ answers, This daies care must be to day, and to morrowes care to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, each day must haue his owne care: such care as is fit and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the time present must now be taken, and such things as are now needfull must now be sought for: but such care as is fit to be taken in the time to come, must be put off to his proper time; and things then needfull, must then be sought for, when their fit time salleth out: euery time and euery day must haue his proper care alone.</p>
               <p>In this reason we haue a most notable rule for the wel ordering of<note place="margin">A rule for our life.</note> our liues: to wit; <hi>that euery man must know the duties of his lawfull calling, and how the discharge thereof will yield him things necessarie and conuenient from time to time, and so accordingly must walke therein; that is, doeing onely such duties diligently as the present time requireth at his hands, for the procuring of things then meete and needfull; and so proceeding by dependance on Gods prouidence, in such care and labour, as is fitting for the present occasion, time, and season: but for time to come leane on Gods prouidence, respiting the care thereof till God require it at thy hands:</hi> The practise hereof <hi>Samuel</hi> inioyneth <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. Sam. 10. 7. <hi>When these signes</hi> (of establishing thee in the kingdome) <hi>shall come vnto thee, doe as occasion shall serue;</hi> that is, doe the present duties of a king that lie before thee, without troubling and vexing thy selfe through feare or care of things to come, till God offer them to thy hand. And this should be euery mans practise in his calling; and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:14013:209"/>
so should their present diligence testifie their obedience, and cleare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> presumption, &amp; their respiting of future care till time require it, argue their faith in Gods prouidence: and thus they should neither foolishly feede vpon vncertaine hopes, nor needlesly vexe themselues with vntimely cares.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The day hath enough with his owne griefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that is, euery day by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of mans sinnes, hath trouble and griefe enough, through that care and labour for prouision which God thereon requireth at our hands: and therefore wee should let euery day content it selfe with his owne care, and not adde thereto another daies griefe.</p>
               <p>In this branch of the reason, Christ sets out the continued miserie<note place="margin">The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued miserie of mans life.</note> of mans naturall life; <hi>Iacob</hi> said to <hi>Pharaoh, The daies of my pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage haue beene few and euill,</hi> Gen. 47. 9. And <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>Man that is borne of a woman is of short continuance, and full of trouble,</hi> Iob. 14. 1. But our Sauiour Christ here goes beyond them both, saying, <hi>Euery day of mans life hath griefe enough of his owne.</hi> This beeing well conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, may teach vs these things: I. To walke in our callings soberly,<note place="margin">Duties. 1.</note> without intangling our selues in worldly cares; for the daiely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the duties of our callings, will bring sorrowe and griefe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough vpon vs, wee neede not to adde thereto by our carking care; for the more wee care, the more miserable is our life. II. To labour to<note place="margin">2</note> withdrawe our hearts and to estrange our affections from delight in the things of this naturall life, or in this life it selfe, for it is full of griefe; and therefore wee must so walke in our callings, that wee may waite for a better life in heauen, where wee shall haue freedome from all sorrow and griefe. The good prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> was <hi>wearie of his life</hi> by reason of the miseries of it, through the calamities of the time; and therefore intreates the Lord <hi>to take away his soule,</hi> 1. King. 19. 4. And <hi>Paul</hi> cries out, one while vpon the miseries that he felt through the bodie of death, that was in him, Rom. 7. 24. and at another time, desires to be dissolued, and to be with Christ, Philip. 1. 23. not simply, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was freedome from all sinne, and the miseries thereof. III. Euery day to commend our selues in soules and bodies, and all<note place="margin">3</note> that we haue, morning and euening, to the blessing and protection of God; for each day and night hath griefe enough, by reason of our sinne, which of our selues we cannot vndergoe without the helpe of God. When our Sauiour Christ was to die vpon the crosse, hee <hi>commended his soule into his fathers hands,</hi> Luk. 23. 46. And none of vs haue assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our continuance in life, but though we be well in the morning, wee may be dead in the euening; or aliue at night, and dead in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:14013:209"/>
and therefore we must not forget the practise of this dutie: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> did it in the time of trouble, though hee were in health, Psal. 31. 5. and though we were free from perill of death, yet our daiely vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should mooue vs hereunto; for who can learne any good thing without labour and paine? who can doe a good worke without let or opposition? If wee would <hi>repent,</hi> we are either clogged with corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or ouerwhelmed with temptations: and if wee seeke to <hi>walke in new obedience,</hi> we haue the world, the flesh, and the deuil, all endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to turne vs backe to our olde course in sinne. So that if we would either auoide euill, or doe good, or support with some comfort our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vexations, we must commend our selues, and all ours, into the hands of God euery day. And thus much of this reason, and of Christs dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from distrustfull care.</p>

               <p>Touching the commandement, <hi>Iudge not] The meaning.</hi> This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement forbids not all kinde of Iudgement, but must bee restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to vnlawfull Iudgement; for there be foure kinds of lawfull Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">4. kinds of lawfull iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> two whereof be publike, and two priuate. Of publike, the first is <hi>ciuil Iudgement,</hi> belonging to the ciuill Magistrate, who is to enquire<note place="margin">1</note> into the manners of men, and according to the good positiue lawes of the country to giue iudgement, either in punishing offenders, or rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:14013:210"/>
them that doe well. The second kinde is <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> belonging principally to the minister, who in the publike dispensation of the word<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>iudgeth</hi> mens manners, by reproouing and condemning their sinnes, whether they be thoughts, words, or actions. In this sense the <hi>vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer</hi> is said <hi>to be iudged,</hi> when his thoughts &amp; actions are controlled by the word, 1. Cor. 14. 24. and thus <hi>Noah iudged and condemned the olde world,</hi> Heb. 11. 7. Of priuate lawful iudgement, the first is <hi>priuate admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> whereby one man doth in Christian and louing maner, reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d another for his sinnes, and thereby iudgeth him: this is also comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the word of God, and therefore it is not here forbidden.

               <p>The thing then here forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is <hi>rash iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> which one man doth vniustly giue of another; and the reason why wee so vnderstand this place, may be drawne from the 3. verse, where instance is giuen of the iudgement here forbidden, in a quicke espiall and sharpe censure of small faults in others, not seeing farre grosser and greater in our selues: also Saint <hi>Luke</hi> setting downe this same prohibition, <hi>Iudge not,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 37.</note> it in the next words, by <hi>condemne not:</hi> which must be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of rash censure, as is plaine by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 2. 1. <hi>In that thou iudgest another, thou condemnest thy selfe,</hi> because thou doest rashly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now that wee may better know the thing forbidden, first I will shew what <hi>rash iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is, and in the second place make knowne the common <hi>practises</hi> thereof. For the first:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rash iudgement, is when of an euill minde wee iudge amisse of others,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rash iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrbed.</note> 
                  <hi>for some euill ende.</hi> In this description, first obserue the roote and ground of all rash iudgement; to wit, <hi>an euill minde,</hi> whereby wee loue our selues too well, and want the loue of our neighbour: This wee te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, by beeing sharpe sighted, to prie into the liues and behauiour of others, and are blinde as beetles to see into our selues: as also by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our selues exactly to censure other mens sayings and doings, and with delight to heare their faults ripped vp; but for our own courses, we would not haue them called into question nor controlled. Secondly, here note the manner of rash iudgement, which is <hi>to iudge amisse of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</hi>

and this they doe which iudge of other mens persons and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings without a calling, or vrgent necessitie: secondly, which giue out sentence of mens doings, but not according to the law of charity, which bindes a man to iudge and say the best of others alwaies, so farre forth as may stand with good conscience, and the word of God. Thirdly, here note the <hi>ende</hi> of rash iudgement; for as it is ill grounded and guided, so it aimes not at the reformation of the partie, nor the detestation of sin in our selues and others, but is directed to some wrong ende: as first, to testifie our hatred of the partie, and desire of reuenge: secondly, to delight our selues with the faults of others: thirdly, to defame our neighbours, and to bring them to an ill name, that our names may beare away the praise without comparison: and lastly, that wee may seeme more holy then others, by beeing much in censuring sinne in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>The practise of rash iudgement consists in two things: first, the euill<note place="margin">The practis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of rash iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> minde of man prepares matter of wrong iudgement: and secondly, giues sentence accordingly of the sayings and doings of men, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of their persons. For the first, the euill minde prepares matter of rash iudgement thus; it sets it selfe to prie and inquire narrowly into the liues and behauiour of men, and to see if it can find any matter in word or action worthy reproofe: Indeede there is a vertue wherby one man doth obserue another in his waies, but that is directed to a good ende; namely, to rectifie and reforme him in his wants, and to further him when he doth well: but for one man to obserue another for this ende, to finde out matter of defamation and reproach, is a fault directly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by our Sauiour Christ in this place. Secondly, when matter is found, the euill minde accordingly giues censure: this censure is giuen, first, of the persons of men; then of their speeches and actions. Rash<note place="margin">Rash censure of mens persons.</note> censure of <hi>mens persons,</hi> is when a man thinkes otherwise of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of another, then in conscience, and by Gods word he ought to doe. Example of this wee haue in Satan, for when the Lord commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Iob</hi> for his fidelitie, Satan tels the Lord, that <hi>Iob</hi> indeede serued<note place="margin">Iob 1. 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> the Lord, but it was onely for his owne profit, for (saith hee) <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe thou thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> hand from him, and thou shalt see, whether hee will not curse thee to thy face:</hi> This then wee see is a deuillish practise, and ought to bee farre from euery one of vs. Wee must remember what an auntient Diuine hath taught heretofore, that there are three things exempted from the iudgement and censure of men; the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> the <hi>Counsell of God,</hi> and <hi>the condemnation of any mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:14013:211"/>Rash censure of mens speeches and actions is giuen many waies: I. When things are well done, to carpe and cauill at them without any<note place="margin">Ras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> censure of mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour.</note> iust cause. Thus the profession of Religion at this day, is accounted of many to be but counterfeit holines, and the due obedience to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law is nicknamed and tearmed precisenesse, and the professours thereof called Puritans and Precisians, for this cause onely, that they make conscience of walking in obedience to Gods law. II. When actions or speeches indifferent, are taken in the worser part. Thus was <hi>Dauids kindnesse</hi> ill accepted of <hi>Hanun</hi> king of Ammon, when Dauid<note place="margin">1. Sam. 10. 3, 4</note> sent his seruants to comfort him after the death of his father: for his Nobles told him and perswaded him, that Dauid sent not vnto him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he honoured his father (though Dauid vndoubtedly sent with an honest and vpright heart) but as it were craftily to search out the citie, and to spie it out, and to ouerthrow it. Now hereupon Dauids seruants were badly intreated, and shamefully sent away; whence grew the warre that ensued betweene them. III. When vpon light occasion and vncerten reports, we suspect and surmise euill of our neighbour: suspicions indeede are sometime good, beeing conceiued on a good ground, and retained for a good ende; as to beware of the partie and of his euill: but when they are conceiued vpon light causes, and for some sinister respect (as the common practise is, vpon no good ground to conceiue most badly) this is rash iudgement. IV. When we see any want in our neighbours speach or behauiour, to make it worse then it was meant, or then indeede it is. V. When we spread abroad and publish the wants of men, to defame them, which might better be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and in conscience and charitie ought so to be. VI. When we speake nothing but the truth of another, but yet withall doe insinuate thereby some euill of the partie into the hearts of the hearers. This pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise is as pestilent and daungerous, as any of the former. Thus <hi>Doeg</hi> told <hi>Saul</hi> of the fact of Ahimelec vnto Dauid, how <hi>he gaue him victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, and the sword of Goliah,</hi> which was true: but withall he did therein insinuate, that Dauid and Ahimelec intended conspiracie against Saul. And this telling of the truth in that sort, cost the liues of <hi>fourescore and fiue persons, that weare the liuen Ephod,</hi> as we may read, 1. Sam. 21. 7. compared with the 22. chap. v. 9. and 18. VII. When in hearing the word preached, and sinnes reprooued in the congregation, some hearers misapply the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for example, the minister reprooues the sinne of swearing, of drunkennesse, or any such sinne: then some one gultie hereof, doth not onely surmise, but also breake forth intò this speach, <hi>Now the preacher meanes me: he speakes this of me: he censures</hi>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:14013:211"/>
                  <hi>my facts and speaches;</hi> herevpon followes spite and malice against the person of the minister, and also rash censuring and condemning of his ministerie. They also sinne in this kinde, that apply the reproofes of sinne to the person of others: as when they say, <hi>now such a one is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: there is a good lesson for such a one if he would learne it:</hi> yea others goe further and say, <hi>now the preacher meanes such a man; now he speakes against such a man:</hi> but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this also is rash iudgement in hearing of the word: they misconceiue of the purpose of the minister, for his maner is not when he standeth in the roome of God, to rippe vp the secrets and liues of some particular hearers; but to deliuer the will of God concerning such and such sinnes vnto all: it is the power of the word, not the mind of the preacher, that causeth: it to touch thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: and therefore euery one ought to apply the word vnto his own heart, and not to lay it vpon others, or els take it to be spoken of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for his disgrace: for it is to misapply the word, and to iudge amisse of the preacher: and this is a common sinne, which is the cause why many men reape so little profit by the word preached as they doe. The VIII. practise of rash iudgement is, when in townes and cities some persons are wrongfully reputed and taken for witches: this is as common a sinne throughout the world as any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: one man will say, <hi>such a one is a witch, because he in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is so perswaded; and yet the ground of this perswasion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his bare conceit. Another man saith, <hi>such a one is a witch, because a wise man or a wise woman hath so reported of him or her:</hi> and yet this testimonie is but the testimonie of the deuill, <hi>who is a lyar, and the father thereof:</hi> if he tell truth, it is with purpose to deceiue. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, another is iudged to be a witch, <hi>because comming to a mans house to borrow something, and beeing denied thereof, he tooks it vnkindly, and thereupon gaue these or such like threatning words; it had beene as good you had lent it me,</hi> or, <hi>I will meete with you:</hi> and hereupon some one in the family fell sicke, or some cattell died, and other things did miscarie. It is no question, but witches be too rife among vs, and ought to be sought out and seuerely punished; and there be lawfull waies of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing a witch: but vpon these bare presumptions to iudge any one to be a witch, is an vnchristian practise of rash iudgement: for why may not the hand of God befall thee in visiting some one in thy family, or in the death of thy cattell, as well as the annoyance of the witch, after some hard speeches of another. A witch therefore must first be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuinced, and then iudged to be a witch, and not before. This thing especially Iurers ought to looke vnto; els if they haue but the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:14013:212"/>
discretion of common people, to iudge one for a witch vpon these presumptions, they may easily defile their hands with innocent blood. Thus much for the sinne of rash Iudgement, and the practises thereof, which are condemned and forbidden in this place.</p>
               <p>Now because it is so common a sinne in all places, and with most men counted no sinne: for the common talke in all meetings is of other men, and selfeloue makes the heart glad to heare other mens faults rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp, yea this sinne will take hold when other sinnes leaue a man, which caused Christ to forewarne his Disciples hereof in this place: therefore it is our dutie to labour and striue the more earnestly to be<note place="margin">Reason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst rash iudgement.</note> purged from this euill minde, and preserued from these euill practises of rash iudgement: for which ende let vs lay to our consciences the reasons following. I. The practise of rash Iudgement cannot stand<note place="margin">1</note> with Christian charitie: for charitie binds a man to walke in loue, and <hi>loue suspecteth not euill,</hi> but thinks the best alwaies, and if it be possible, thinks well of all. II. When thou seest a man speake or practise any<note place="margin">2</note> euill, for which thou beginnest to thinke hardly of him, then consider well of thine owne selfe, how thou hast both that and all other sinnes in thee, if we regard the roote of sinne, and therefore doe not rashly condemne him for his fact, because thou thy selfe hast done the like heretofore; or els in time to come maist doe the like or worse, then he hath done whome thou now condemnest. III. Consider that God<note place="margin">3</note> the father hath committed all iudgement vnto his Sonne: who now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuteth publike iudgement by the Magistrate in the common-wealth, and by the Minister in the Church; and priuate iudgement of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and iust dispraise, by them whome he calleth thereunto: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou iudgest another, not beeing called thereto, thou thrusteth Christ out of his office, and robbest him of his honour, which is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous sinne, and cannot be vnpunished. IV. Consider also that thou<note place="margin">4</note> art vnable, whatsoeuer thou art, to iudge aright of other mens actions, beeing ignorant of many circumstances thereof: for thou knowest not with what minde, or to what ende the action was done: thou knowest not the cause why he did it, nor the state of his person, nor manner of his temptation thereto: and therefore why iudgest thou rashly of him. V. He that giues rash iudgement of another, is worse then a theefe<note place="margin">5</note> that steales away a mans goods: for he robbes him of his <hi>good name,</hi> which (as Salomon saith) <hi>is to be chosen aboue great riches,</hi> Prov. 22. 1. Againe, riches may be restored, so can not a mans good name beeing once blemished in the hearts of many. Againe, a man may defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from a theefe, but no man can shunne an other mans euill minde,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:14013:212"/>
or his badde tongue: nay the backebiter is worse then a murtherer, for he killeth three at once; first, his <hi>owne soule</hi> in thus sinning: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his <hi>neighbour</hi> whose name he hurteth: and thirdly, the hearer who receiueth this rash and iniust report: and for this cause the <hi>slaunderer</hi> is numbered among those that shall not inherit the kingdome of God, Psal. 15. 3. 1. Cor. 6. 10. and the Apostle char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Christians to account of such raylers as of persons excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. 1. Cor. 5. 11.</p>
               <p>Here some will say; if we may not giue our opinion of others freely<note place="margin">Duties to be obserued when we speake of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> as we haue done; what must we doe when we haue occasion to speake of them? <hi>Answ.</hi> Thy cariage towards others must be according to these rules: I. If thou know any good thing by the partie of whome<note place="margin">1</note> thou speakest, when thou hast occasion, thinke and speake of that: if thou knew euill by him also, conceale it from others; and if thou maist, admonish the partie thereof: or els tell it to those who haue authoritie to correct his faults; and thus shalt thou win thy brother. Some will say, I doe indeed sometime censure my brother for his faults, yet onely in detestation of his sinne; I loue the partie neuer the worse; and I onely doe it to some priuate friend that will not tell it againe. <hi>Answ.</hi> But this excuse, and all such like are friuolous: no colour of good intent can excuse rash iudgement: if thou louest him, why doest thou make knowne his fault to another, <hi>for loue couereth a multitude of sinnes?</hi> And if thy conscience answer, it will tell thee that either ill will to the partie causeth thee so to doe, or selfe-loue, whereby through his defamation thou thy selfe seekest to be aduanced aboue him in the thoughts of others. In thy censuring therefore looke to thine heart, whether malice mooue thee not thereto: and take heed to the end also; for if it rise from a bad ground, or tend to a wrong ende, the whole action is nought. II. <hi>Dutie.</hi> We ought to thinke as wel of euery man,<note place="margin">2</note> as possibly we can, yea of our enemie &amp; of his actions: for <hi>loue thinketh not evill;</hi> and in the practise of loue towards our enemies we become followers of God, Math. 5. 44, 45. III. <hi>Dutie.</hi> If thou marke thy<note place="margin">3</note> neighbours life and behauiour, doe it for this ende to withdraw him from sinne, and to further him in well-doing. Lastly, in all thy societies<note place="margin">4</note> and dealings with others, labour either to doe them good, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue good from them: and by this meanes thou shalt eschew the sinne of rash iudgement.</p>
               <p>Here two questions may be mooued concerning rash iudgement, and that necessarily, because surmises will arise vpon very small occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>

                  <hi>I. Quest.</hi> When may a man doubt or suspect euill of another? <hi>Ans.</hi> In all suspicion recourse must be had to the ground thereof,<note place="margin">Of suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euill of others.</note> whether it rise of iust and sufficient cause or not. A sufficient cause of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion is that, which in the iudgement of wise men, beeing well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with all the circumstances thereof, is iudged sufficient: and on the other side, that is insufficient which wise men well waying with the circumstances thereof, doe iudge insufficient: if then the cause of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion be thought insufficient in the iudgement of the wise and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we must suspend our suspicion: as thus; suppose some euill is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted abroad of such a man; as that he is a theefe, an adulterer, or such like: yet this fame riseth onely of some one mans report, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it may proceede from an ill minde on a priuate grudge, we are not to yeild thereupon to suspect ill of the partie: this report may well cause vs to search further into the case, and mooue vs to looke vnto our selues that we be not hurt by him. But if the cause be thought sufficient in the iudgement of those that are wise and discreete, then we may without offence or breach of conscience, yeild to suspect and iudge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Question.</hi> How may we giue vpright iudgement of all men with whome we liue and haue to deale? <hi>Answ.</hi> This is as necessarie to be<note place="margin">Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>ightly</note> knowen as the former, for as we are prone to thinke ill, so we are also forward in iudging rashly: therefore there are three things required in the iudging of others. First, we must haue recourse to the cause of<note place="margin">1. Rule.</note> our iudgement: for if the cause be insufficient, then our iudgement is rash and vnlawfull. Before the Lord brought vpon the world the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of languages, he is saide to <hi>goe downe among them, to see their fact,</hi> Gen. 11. 6. &amp; before he destroied Sodom and Gomorra with fire &amp; brimstone, he is saide to <hi>come downe from heauen to see whether they had done according to the cry that was come vp to the Lord.</hi> Gen. 18. 21. whereby the Lord would teach vs, that before he enter into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with any man, or any people, he first takes good consideration of the fact, which causeth his punishment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we must haue authoritie and warrant by calling to giue<note place="margin">2. Rule.</note> iudgement, or els some thing which is answerable thereto, though the iudgement be priuate: as to giue admonition or iust dispraise; yet without a calling we must not doe it: he that giueth iudgement must be able truly to say, <hi>the Lord hath called me thus to doe.</hi> The Magistrate, the Minister, the master, and euery superiour hath authoritie to iudge those that are vnder him: and for priuate men in priuate iudgement, though they want this authority by calling, yet if they haue that which
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:14013:213"/>
is answerable hereto, that is, the affection of Christian loue; so as they can say with <hi>Paul, the loue of God constraineth me,</hi> then they may iudge.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we must alwaies haue a <hi>good ende</hi> of our iudgement, as well<note place="margin">3. Rule.</note> as a good beginning: that is, the reformation and amendment, not the defaming of our brother. And these three concurring in all hard spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they cease to be rash and vniust censures. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> calls the <hi>Pharisies and Sadduces, a generation of vipers,</hi> Matth. 3. 7. our <hi>Sauiour Christ</hi> calls them<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 23. 27</note>

                  <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and people of Sodom:</hi> and the Apostle Paul calls the <hi>Galatians, fooles,</hi> Gal. 3. 1. and the <hi>Cretians, lyars, euill beasts, slow bellies,</hi> Tit. 1. 12, 13. All which are hard speeches, but yet no slanders; because they had all of them a calling so to doe: and likewise did this on good ground, and for a good ende.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the commandement. Now follow two reasons to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce<note place="margin">2. Reasons against rash iudgement.</note> vs to make conscience of rash iudgement. The former is laide downe in these words: <hi>That ye be not iudged.</hi> And it may be framed thus:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>If ye iudge, ye shall be iudged of men againe with rash iudgement:</l>
                  <l>But ye cannot abide to be iudged of rashly: and therefore iudge not.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>The <hi>second part</hi> is vnderstood, but yet necessarily collected. The <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> is the commandement it selfe, <hi>Iudge not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reason doth affoard vnto vs two instructions. I. It giueth vs a<note place="margin">A tast of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s naturall pride.</note> tast and view of our owne naturall pride and selfeloue: for when we heare God dishonoured by sweating, or our neighbours name defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by slandering, we are not onely not grieued, but oftentimes are the cause thereof, and take great delight therein, especially in hearing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens faults ripped vp to their disgrace: but yet we can in no sort brooke or suffer our owne good name to be called into question: if our selues be ill spoken of, we are presently filled with malice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, and cannot be at rest till we be requited or reuenged: nay, though we be in a good manner admonished of our fault, euen in loue, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a friendly sort, yet we can very hardly brooke it; though the partie admonishing make knowne vnto vs, that he doth it only for our good, without all purpose of disgrace vnto our persons.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Instruct.</hi> Here also our Sauiour Christ affoardeth vnto vs a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table<note place="margin">How to know and iudge right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our owne sinnes.</note> way whereby we may come to the knowledge of our own sinnes, and of the hainousnes thereof. When we behold sinne in our selues we hardly iudge it to be sinne: we must therefore looke vpon our owne
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:14013:214"/>
sinnes in the person of others, and learne to iudge of it in our selues as we iudge of it in others. When we consider of rash iudgement in others against our selues, we count it a vile and grieuous sinne, yea odious and intolerable: and in like sort ought we to thinke of rash iudgement in our selues towards others: and so for euery other sinne in our selues, we ought to iudge of it, as we doe when we see it in the person of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers against vs: otherwise if we looke onely to our selues, we shall sooth vp our selues in sinne, making great sinnes, little sinnes; and small sinnes, none at all.</p>

               <p>Now in this proofe, first, we may obserue one true and maine cause<note place="margin">A maine cause of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> of that personal defamation which is common in the world, and it is to be found in the person himselfe that is defamed; he hath rashly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly censured others, for which God in his prouidence, doth most iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cause others to defame him againe: so as men themselues doe most of all wound their owne good names, and by their bad cariage toward others, iustly cause their owne disgrace. In regard whereof we must learne; first, to set a carefull watch before our mouthes, to keepe the doore of our lips, gouerning our tongues by the word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when we censure others rashly, we doe procure iudgement vnto our selues. Secondly, to be patient vnder the rash censures and slaunders of others. For we must thinke, that we our selues haue heretofore done the like to others: and therefore it is iustice with God to reward vs in the same kinde, wherewith we haue wronged others. This is <hi>Salomons</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, in this proofe wee may also obserue the right way how to get and keepe a good name: to wit, by iudging others with Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an<note place="margin">How to get a good name.</note> iudgement, carying a charitable opinion of euery one, speaking the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:14013:214"/>
the best of them in all companies, so farforth as we can with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and neuer iudging hardly of any, till we be indeed lawfully called thereunto, hauing a good ground for our action, and doing it for a good end: <hi>If thou wouldst liue long,</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>and see good</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 34. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>dayes, refraine thy tongue from euill, and thy lips that they speake no guile;</hi> that is, speake not euill of any man though thou know ill by him, till thou be lawfully called thereto.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from the consideration of this prouidence of God, whereby he ordereth and disposeth, that defamers of others shal be rewarded in their kind, and that by others; we may gather, that God knowes euery vnaduised thought of the heart, and euery rash censure which we speake or thinke of others; els how could this be true, that rash Iudgers shalbe so rewarded in their kind, seeing men may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale their thoughts, and many times their words from the eyes of men. To this purpose Salomon admonisheth, not <hi>to curse the king, no not in thy</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 10. 20</note> 
                  <hi>thought, nor the rich in thy bedchamber, for the foule of heauen shal carie the voice, and that which hath winges shall declare the matter.</hi> And this must teach vs to make conscience of all our speaches and thoughts that concerne others, yea then when we our selues are iudged. When Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid was rayled vpon by wicked Shemei, he staied himself with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of this, that God <hi>knew it,</hi> and had <hi>appointed Shemei to curse Dauid.</hi> 2. Sam. 16. 10.</p>
               <p>Lastly, here it may be doubted howe God can be cleared from the guilt of rash iudgement, seeing in his prouidence he causeth it by his decree. <hi>Answ.</hi> Though he decree it, yet is he free from the fault there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for first, he decrees it not to be the cause thereof himselfe, but to permit it among men, leauing them to be the authors thereof: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he decrees to dispose of it well, and to order it as a iust punishment of the rash iudgement of others, and so in no sort is the cause of the euill in rash iudgement; howsoeuer he dispose hereof for the iust pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of offenders in this kinde.</p>
               <p>The second confirmation of the first reason is contained in this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which tendeth to the same ende with the former sentence: <hi>And with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you againe:</hi> That is, the Lord hath ordained that men shall be rewarded in their kind, like for like. Hence we may obserue this rule of Gods iustice in the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Gods iustice in punishing sinners i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Again, it signifies <hi>supposed sinnes;</hi> such as are not indeed sinnes before God, but onely in his opinion that giues rash iudgement. <hi>And perceiuest not</hi> this <hi>perceiuing</hi> is properly an action of the minde, standing in <hi>consideration</hi> and <hi>thinking,</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows after <hi>seeing.</hi> Thus the word is vsed, Luk. 12. 27. <hi>Consider the lilies of the field;</hi> that is, looke vpon them, and then consider well thereof in your minde. And, Iam. 1. 23. <hi>He that heares the word, and doth it not, is like vnto a man that</hi> BEHOLDS <hi>his naturall face in a glasse:</hi> that is, to one that sees and considers of his shape.

By <hi>beame,</hi> is here meant <hi>great and notorious raigning sinnes</hi> in mans heart; such as wound the conscience, which are like vnto a beame in the eye: which doth not onely blemish, but quite dash out the fight. Some may here aske, in what sense this is spoken, seeing the eye is not capable of a beame? <hi>Ans.</hi> It is spoken by way of supposition, as if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> had bin said; if it
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:14013:216"/>
were possible that a beame could be in the eye, the rash censurers fault is as a <hi>beame in the eye:</hi> this kind of spech is vsuall in Scripture; <hi>If I could speake with tongues of Angels,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 13. 1. that is, suppose Angels had tongues, and that I could speake as eloquently as they. The words of the 4. v. are for substance all one with the former in the 3. The difference between them is onely this; in the 3. v. Christ speaks onely of <hi>rash iudgment co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued in the mind;</hi> but in the 4. he speaks of <hi>rash iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vttered in speech, How saist thou to thy brother, &amp;c.</hi> So that in both verses the words are a parable bearing this sense: with what face, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, or conscience, canst thou finde fault with thy brother either in thought or speach, thou thy selfe beeing tainted with greater faults and offences? And hence the second reason may be thus conceiued:</p>
               <p>He that hath greater faults, must not censure him that hath lesser:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he that giues rash iudgement, hath greater faults then he whom he censureth: And therfore no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to vse rash iudgment.</hi> The proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or first part is omitted: the Assumption expressely set downe in the 3. &amp; 4. v. whereupon the conclusion follows against rash iudgement.</p>
               <p>Vpon this forme of speech, <hi>How seest thou? why saiest thou?</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Our word &amp; thoughts must haue good grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> with what face and honestie, and vpon what ground? we may learne this instruction; that our speaches, yea our very thoughts must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and vttered vpon good ground, and in a good manner. <hi>Establish thy thoughts by counsell,</hi> (saith Salomon) <hi>and by counsel make warre:</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching<note place="margin">Prov. 20. 18.</note> vs to haue direction from the word of God, for the ground and maner of our very thoughts, and for all our affaires.

<pb n="421" facs="tcp:14013:216"/>
him as a breaker of the Sabbath day, and as a companion of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and sinners, though he conuersed with them for their good: so they blamed his Disciples for eating with vnwashen hands, and for plucking vp the eares of corne on the Sabbath day to satisfie their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and for their seldome fasting. This fault was in the Corinthians, who censured <hi>Paul</hi> and his ministerie, for want of eloquence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of words, which was in other Teachers among them, as may appeare by his rebuking of them, 1. Cor. 4. And the Christian brethren among the Romans condemned one another in the obseruation of daies and times, and in the vse of the creatures of God, Rom. 14. which was nothing els but rash iudgement. And this no doubt is a fault which raignes in our congregations, euen among the better sort at this day; for deepely is our nature stained with this corruption, and so prone it is to this sinne, that euen they which haue receiued true grace, can hardly abstaine from the practises of rash iudgement.</p>
               <p>The consideration hereof must teach vs these duties. First, to take knowledge of this corruption of our nature, and of the want of brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue in vs; for why should we so soone spie a fault in another, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we want loue and charitie to his person? Wee may consider the vilenesse of this practise by resemblance in some bruite creatures, for we account most basely of those rauening fowles which delight in nothing but in filthie carrions; and such for all the world are these rash censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, all their delight is in other mens faults, which makes them so sharp sighted to spie them out.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when we are about to censure any man, we must (in regard of this corruption) suspect our selues, and our speeches, &amp; call our selues backe to a view and consideration of that which wee are to speake; for oft-times we see that which we ought not to see, and thereupon speake that which we ought in conscience to conceale. Physitions giue this note of a frensie, <hi>to begin to take vp strawes:</hi> Now when the mind looks not into it selfe, but pries into other mens actions, then no doubt it is not right, but is corrupt and infected with a spirituall frensie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the danger of this disease must cause vs to looke vnto our selues.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here we may obserue a reason of the strange behauiour of men in regard of sinne; for this we may easily perceiue, that men with open mouth will condemne those things in others, which they like and approoue in themselues: now the cause hereof is, for that the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe followe the minde, such as the minde is, such are the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and mans minde naturally lookes outwarde, not inwarde, it sees very little faults in others, but will neither see nor condemne
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:14013:217"/>
the same faults, nor greater in it selfe: nay, rather it causeth man to loue those sinnes in himselfe which he detests in others. And therefore in the amendment of our liues, we must beginne in our owne hearts, and turne the eye of our minde inward, to see our owne sinnes, and labour first to haue our hearts touched with sorow for them, and to hate them first in our selues, and then to proceede to hate them in others. It is a preposterous course, arising from the corruption of nature, to beginne with the hatred and dislike of sinne out of our selues.</p>

A <hi>mote</hi> or a <hi>straw</hi> may sometime put out the eye, though indeed the <hi>beame</hi> be more forcible to dash it quite out: and so doe small sinnes wound the conscience, and damne the soule, though greater sinnes doe more deepely wound the conscience and plunge the same into hell: small and great sinnes, both destroy the soule, though in a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t degree: the very mote is deadly sinne, though in nature the beame be more mortal. This distinction they borowed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> former ages, but abusing the primitiue Church from whence they had it: for the ancient Fathers called some sinnes <hi>veniall,</hi> not because they<note place="margin">How the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers called some sinnes veniall.</note> deserued not death, but because they were pardonable in regard of the censure of the Church, and did not incurre the censure of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and those they called mortall or criminall sinnes which had the censure of excommunication passed against them: so that the Papists a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse both Fathers and Scripture in this distinction.</p>

When <hi>Dauid</hi> sent his seruants to <hi>Hanun</hi> king of Ammon to comfort him after his fathers death; the Princes of Ammon told their lord, that Dauids seruants <hi>were but spies that came to search out his citie:</hi> thus they iudged rashly of Dauids fact,<note place="margin">1.

                  <pb n="423" facs="tcp:14013:217"/>
and their intent was to corrupt the honest mind of Dauid: perswading the king that Dauid and his seruants had an other intent and end of their comming then they made knowen to the King. So that the rash censurer seekes to blemish the good mind and conscience of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And hence we may well be warned to take notice of our naturall corruption, how that without Gods speciall grace we doe plainly hate our brother; els we would neuer so suspiciously prie into his waies as to depraue his good meaning. We must therefore content our selues with the speaches and actions of our brother, and take heede how we deale about the eye; that is, with his intent and meaning; that we must leaue to God, who onely knowes the heart: and for his actions &amp; spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (if it may be) we must alwaies expound them in the better part: if we cannot defend a mans doing, yet we must excuse his meaning: if we cannot excuse his intent, yet we must thinke the best of his conscience: if we cannot excuse his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, yet we must iudge it to be but a sinne of ignorance: if we cannot so doe, yet we must thinke that it was done in some grieuous temptation, and that if we our selues had beene in like case, we should haue done farre worse: we know not when God may giue grace to men, or when he leaues them to themselues, and therefore in regard of the minde and conscience, we must comprimit our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at all times.</p>

                  <hi>And perceiuest not</hi>] that is, though it may be thou seest it, yet thou dost not well consider of it. Hence our Sauiour noteth out a second<note place="margin">Mans carnal securitie.</note> maine fault in mans nature to be thought vpon; namely, <hi>carnall securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> whereby though in some small measure men see their offences, yet naturally they neuer thinke on them heartily &amp; seriously as they ought to doe: <hi>S.

               </epigraph>
               <p>This verse conteines a <hi>remedie</hi> against rash iudgement: it depends<note place="margin">The remedy of rash iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> vpon the former verses as an Answer to a secret obiection that might thence arise, for whereas Christ had said, <hi>Iudge not:</hi> and <hi>why seest thou a mote in thy brothers eye, &amp;c.</hi> some man might say, belike then it is not lawfull to correct my brother by speach, and by reproofe to seeke amendment of his fault. To this Christ here answers; that he forbids not brotherly correction and admonition, but the euil, corrupt, and vnchristian maner of giuing admonition and correction; when as men take a preposterous course in censuring, and doe not beginne with
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:14013:218"/>
themselues in the first place, but with their brethren: as if our Sauiour Christ had said, Hypocrite, thou hast greater faults then he whom thou iudgest: and therefore if thou wilt take a right course in thy correction, beginne with thy selfe, reforme the great sinnes that be in thy selfe, and then shalt thou be fitter and better able, to correct and reforme thy brother. So that these words containe two parts: 1. the remedie of rash iudgement, <hi>Hypocrite, first plucke out the beame out of thine owne eye:</hi> 2. the fruit hereof, which is <hi>true wisdome,</hi> to be able to discerne aright of our neighbours fault, and also how it is to be cured, in these words, <hi>and then shalt thou see clearely to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye.</hi> Of these in order.</p>
               <p>The remedie against rash iudgement, is for a man first to beginne with himselfe, reforming first his own offences: which because it is here propounded by our Sauiour Christ of set purpose, as a speciall remedie against this sinne, I will stand a little to shew how a man may cast out the beame out of his owne eye. Hereunto foure things are required: I.<note place="margin">How to cast out a beame out of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s owne eye.</note> A man must turne the eye of his mind inward, and cast his cogitations towards his owne life and conscience, that so he may see and know the principall sinnes of his owne heart and life. To this purpose serueth the morall law, which is as a glasse to let vs see our maine and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall sinnes, which be the <hi>beames</hi> in our eyes here meant. And for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction herein I will note out some speciall maine sinnes, which be in all men naturally; and which euery one must well consider of, that will cast this beame out of his owne eye. The first common sinne of all<note place="margin">1</note> men, is a <hi>guiltinesse</hi> in Adams first offence; that is, his sinne made ours<note place="margin">Maine sinnes common to all.</note> by relation or imputation: for his eating the forbidden fruit was no particular or priuate sinne, but the sinne of mans nature: and euery one sinned in Adam that was to descend of him by ordinarie generation: for though we were not borne when Adam sinned, yet by his sinne we stand guiltie of eternall death before God.</p>
               <p>The second common sinne, is a natural disposition and pronenesse to<note place="margin">2</note> euery thing that is euill, and against Gods law when occasion is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the sinne against the holy Ghost not excepted: for the same corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pronenesse to euill which was in them that haue committed this sinne, is in all men naturally; the difference stands onely in this, that all doe not fall into it. And this pronenesse to euil is the second head of originall sinne.</p>
               <p>The third common sinne, is inward Idolatrie: this is a most hainous<note place="margin">3</note> sinne, and may be thus perceiued: Euery man by nature takes his heart<note place="margin">Idolatrie of the heart.</note> from the true God, and bestowes it on some other thing: now looke
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:14013:219"/>
whereon a man bestowes his heart, that thing he makes his God: and by nature we loue our selues, our sinnes, and the world, more then God, and yeeld obedience to the deuill rather then to the true God. The like may be said of our feare, ioy, &amp; delight, and of our trust and confidence, all which affections we set vpon the deuill, the world, and iniquitie; yea vpon the creature, forsaking the creator who is blessed for euer: and he that sees not this in himselfe, hath idolatrie as yet raigning in his heart.</p>
               <p>The fourth sinne is <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> which naturally raigneth in all men,<note place="margin">4</note> till grace expell it: This hypocrisie stands in this; when men are about<note place="margin">Hypocrisie.</note> any good thing, they are more carefull to please God in the outward action, then with the seruice of the heart. Againe, they seeke more to please men then God. And lastly, they rather endeauour to performe the outward duties of the first Table, then of the second. This is a huge beame in euery mans eie naturally, which each one ought to see in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as well as the former.</p>
               <p>The fift sinne is <hi>pride,</hi> not outward in apparell, but <hi>spirituall inward</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>pride of the heart,</hi> which stands in this; that a man thinkes himselfe out<note place="margin">Pride.</note> of Christ to haue in him some naturall goodnesse, whereby he stands in Gods fauour, and hath in himselfe perfect loue, and perfect faith: this sinne all men will condemne, and yet it cleaues fast to euery man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Reuel. 3. 17. <hi>said shee was rich, and lacked nothing;</hi> whereas indeede <hi>shee was poore, and blinde, and naked.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pride poisons Gods grace in the heart, it is a maine sinne, and the common cause of rash iudgement.</p>
               <p>The sixt sinne is that <hi>particular sinne</hi> or <hi>sinnes,</hi> wherewith euery one<note place="margin">6</note> is most assaulted; for howsoeuer the corruption of nature doth infect al men alike, yet euery one that is of yeares shall find himselfe more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with some sinnes then with others, by reason that corruption is in part either remooued or restrained in him. Wherefore euery one must enter into his owne heart, and there search and see what be those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular sinnes, which most of all preuaile against him, troubling his heart, and causing him to dishonour God. These be his beames which keepe Gods grace out of his heart, which wee must labour to finde out in our selues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Duty.</hi> After we haue some sight of these our maine sins, we must in<note place="margin">How to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the gricuousnes of our sinnes</note> the next place labour to <hi>see them in our selues as beames,</hi> &amp; to feele the waight thereof: for commonly wee either see them not at all in our selues, or if we doe a little perceiue them, yet wee see them not in their quantitie as beames, but rather like motes or strawes. Now wee shall
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:14013:219"/>
come to see these sinnes in our selues as <hi>beames</hi> in their iust quantitie: first, if <hi>we compare them with other mens sinnes,</hi> as with <hi>Adams</hi> first sin,<note place="margin">1. Rule.</note> for doubtlesse we haue many particular sinnes in our hearts that bee as great or greater then <hi>Adams</hi> sinne was, considered in the fact; and yet by that sinne <hi>Adam</hi> brought not onely on himselfe, but on all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie mortalitie and destruction, the first, and the second death. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,<note place="margin">2. Rule.</note> we shall come to see the grieuousnesse of our sinnes, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in the <hi>punishment</hi> thereof; that is, <hi>subiection to all woe and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie,</hi> yea and to <hi>death</hi> it selfe in this life, and also to <hi>death eternall</hi> after this life, with the deuill and his angels: this is the reward of euery sinne in it selfe. Thirdly, consider these thy sinnes, as <hi>they were laid vpon the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Rule.</note> 
                  <hi>holy person of our Sauiour Christ,</hi> for which he endured not onely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bodily torments on the crosse, but inwardly in soule apprehended the whole wrath of God due vnto vs for the same, which caused him to <hi>sweate water and blood,</hi> and to crie, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken me.</hi> This beeing wel waighed, will let vs see that our sinnes are no motes, but huge and great beames, such as are able to crush vs in peeces vnder the heauy wrath of God. Lastly, haue recourse to the <hi>last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. Rule.</note> which forbids the very first thoughts and motions in the heart, that be against our neighbour, and against God, though wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer giue consent of will thereto; nay, though wee abhorre the fact it selfe: as when we see our neighbours oxe or his asse, to wish in our hearts, O that this were mine, though wee detest the stealing thereof: now if this first motion be a sinne deseruing damnation, how hainous be the sinnes of our nature, and the transgressions of our life, wherin we haue giuen full consent to rebell against God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. Duty.</hi> The third thing required to this casting out the beame<note place="margin">How to iudge our selues.</note> out of our owne eie, is that which is here intended by our Sauiour Christ; namely, <hi>to surcease to iudge others, and to beginne to iudge our selues for our own sins; for if we would iudge our selues we should not bee iudged,</hi> 1. Cor. 11. 31. Now we doe then iudge our selues, when in our owne hearts wee giue sentence against our selues, and condemne our selues in regard of our owne sinnes: Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> iudged himselfe, Psa. 51. 1. <hi>Haue mercie vpon me, O Lord, according to the multitude of thy mercies:</hi> as if he should say, Lord, one mercy will not serue the turne, so farre haue I plunged my selfe into hell by my grieuous sinnes; but in the multitude of thy mercies doe them all away. And in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vers. 2. <hi>Wash me throughly from mine iniquitie,</hi> hee confesseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be so deeply stained with the filth of sinne, that a little washing will not serue. So when the Lord had spoken vnto <hi>Iob,</hi> and made him
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:14013:220"/>
see and know himselfe, he cries out, <hi>Behold, I am vile,</hi> Iob. 39, 37. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Now I abhorre my selfe, and repent in dust and ashes,</hi> for those things that I haue said and done, Chap. 42. 6. In such sort also did the <hi>Prodigall sonne</hi> iudge himselfe, crying out, that hee <hi>had sinned against heauen, and against his father, and was not worthy to bee called his sonne,</hi> Luk. 15. 21. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> likewise confesseth against himselfe, that he was <hi>the head of all sinners,</hi> 1. Tim. 1. 15. And thus must we condemne our selues, and say with <hi>Daniel</hi> in his praier for the people, chap. 9. 7. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen shame and confusion of face belongs vnto vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV. Dutie.</hi> After we haue thus iudged our selues, wee must labour<note place="margin">Reform our waies.</note> to breake off, and to amend our former euill waies, endeauouring by all meanes, that sinne may be abolished and weakened in vs more &amp; more: and this is indeede the <hi>remoouing of the beame out of our owne eies,</hi> that so we may be fitter to censure and reforme others. Of this last duty the Apostle speaketh, Rom. 14. 13. <hi>Let vs not iudge one another any more; but vse your iudgement rather in this, that no man put a stumbling block before his brother:</hi> that is, that he liue without offence. These foure du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties<note place="margin">Motiues to all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> ought euery one to practise: and to mooue vs hereunto, first let vs consider, that it is Gods commandement in this place, that wee should<note place="margin">1</note> first reforme our owne selues. Secondly, that our state and case is feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">2</note> and miserable, without this reformation; if a man haue but a thorne in his finger, he cannot be well till it be plucked out; what case then is he in, that hath a huge beame in his eie, the most tender part of the whole bodie: that is, hath his heart and conscience pricked with the sting of sinne? and therfore it neerely concernes euery one to remooue it. Thirdly, we shall neuer be able to iudge aright of our selues, of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">3</note> or of the life to come, till we practise this dutie: and therefore in the feare of God let vs seriously set our selues vnto it.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the remedie it selfe; now follow two circumstances therein further to be considered: I. The <hi>partie</hi> to whom the remedie is giuen; that is, <hi>an Hypocrite:</hi> II. <hi>When</hi> this remedie is to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; <hi>First, plucke out, &amp;c.</hi> For the partie: by <hi>Hypocrite</hi> wee must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand<note place="margin">An hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</note> him, that in heart and speech is prone to conceiue, and giue rash iudgement of other mens sayings and actions: and good cause there is why he is so called, for this man hath the sinne of hypocrisie raigning in him, he desires to seeme more holy then others, and therefore giues himselfe to censure others, that by debasing of others, he may aduance himselfe: see this in the hypocriticall Pharisie, <hi>I thanke God that I am not as other men, extortioners, vniust, adulterers: or euen as this Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, I fast twice in the weeke, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 18. 10, 11. But they must know,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:14013:220"/>
that this censuring of others, is a fruit of hypocrisie, arising out of an hollow heart.</p>
               <p>The second circumstance, is the time <hi>when this dutie is to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A rule for brotherly correction.</note> namely, in the <hi>first</hi> place, <hi>First cast out, &amp;c.</hi> Here then wee haue a notable direction for the manner and order of giuing brotherly corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; <hi>It must beginne with a mans owne selfe, and ende in a mans neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:</hi> and by proportion, looke by how much euery one is neerer vnto vs, so much the sooner must he be corrected and iudged. If thou bee a priuate man that art to giue censure, first begin with thy selfe; then iudge thy kindred; thirdly, thine acquaintance; and last of all, strangers. So a master of a familie must first iudge himselfe, then his owne fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and after he may iudge his friends and neigbours, and last of all strangers: and the like must euery superiour practise in his place. Now by this order to be obserued in brotherly censure, wee may easily see that the world is farre wide in the practise of this dutie, for euery one thinkes well of himselfe, and also of his friends and acquaintance, and therefore spares them and will not censure them; but for strangers, them will he not sticke to reproach and to condemne: but this is a preposterous course, swaruing farre from this direction of our Sauiour Christ.</p>

Hence I gather this generall doctrine, that <hi>Right wisedome and vnderstanding followes the reformation of our owne hearts and liues. The beginning of wisedome is the feare of the Lord,</hi> Psal. 111. 10. that is, true wisdome and good vnderstanding comes from a reuerent awe of God, in regard of his word and commandement: so Psal. 119. 100. <hi>I was made wiser th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Manasses,</hi> that when hee repented and humbled himselfe, <hi>he knew that the Lord was God:</hi> and after <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> was humbled, <hi>his vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was restored to him,</hi> Daniel 4. 31. for, <hi>God teacheth the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his waies,</hi> Psalm. 25. 9. The proud man is hee that builds vp his sinnes with posts and beames, and such a one the Lord will not teach; but him that pluckes downe these posts by amendment of his life, will the Lord instruct in the way that he should walke. Christ saith

to his Disciples, <hi>Ye are my friends if ye keepe my commandements:</hi> and <hi>to his friends will he make knowne all things needfull that he hath heard of his father,</hi> Ioh. 15. 14, 15. by all which it is plaine, that right iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment followes true reformation of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vses. I.</hi> Hereby we see how to come to vnderstand the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<note place="margin">How to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Gods word</note> read or heard; namely, by the amendement of our owne liues: First, reforme thine owne heart and life, and then shalt thou haue true iudgement giuen vnto thee, to be able in reading or hearing, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Gods word, at least so much thereof, as shall be needfull for thee: and doubtlesse, the cause why most men profit so little in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though they heare and read them much, is for that they looke not to the reformation of their owne liues and consciences, according to the word: Prou. 1. 23. <hi>Turne you at my correction</hi> (saith Wisdome) <hi>and I will powre out my minde vnto you, and make you vnderstand my words.</hi> The student therefore that must fit himselfe to get true vnderstanding in Gods word, for the edification of Gods Church, must remember this direction, and labour first to plucke out the beame out of his owne eie, and then shall hee see cleerely to reade with iudgement the word of God, and to discerne the true way of euerlasting life, for the good of Gods people: but if thou come in thy sinnes, thou readest without profit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Use.</hi> Againe, wouldest thou know thy selfe to be the childe of<note place="margin">How to know our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</note> God? remember then to purge thy heart and life from all sinne, for thence floweth true vnderstanding, and thereupon God will certifie thy conscience of thine election and reconciliation: but if thou suffer thy selfe to lie in sinne, thou maiest long waite for this certificate, and yet neuer haue it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. Use.</hi> Many men there be that will bee of no religion, because<note place="margin">How to know true religion.</note> there are so many and diuers opinions about matters of religion in the world; and therefore till some generall Councell haue determined of the truth of religion, they will liue as they doe: but these men must know, that they take a wrong course: If they would come to know the truth of religion, they must first reforme their liues; but while they liue in sinne, they can neuer see what is good, what is badde; what is truth, what is falshood in religion. Ioh. 7. 17. <hi>If any man will doe my fathers will</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>hee shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speake of my selfe:</hi> where he plainely giues vs to vnderstand, that true iudgement of religion comes from obedience vnto God.

it be, please God, and doe good to others; first purge thine owne heart and life from sinne, and then shalt thou see clearely wherein thou failest, and how thou art to amend thy fault, and afterward to doe good to others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A II. generall Point.</hi> Further, in this remedie our Sauiour Christ<note place="margin">Brotherly correction commanded</note> opposeth <hi>Brotherly correction,</hi> vnto <hi>rash iudgement;</hi> and withall, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes <hi>brotherly correction</hi> as a dutie to be practised among Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Touching this point, foure things are to bee considered: I. who is to correct. II. Who is to be corrected. III. What is to bee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. and IV. In what manner. For the first: the partie that must<note place="margin">1. Who must correct.</note> correct is <hi>a brother,</hi> that is, any member of Gods Church; so it is said, <hi>Then shalt</hi> thou <hi>see cleerely to put out the mote out of thy brothers eie:</hi> &amp; Leuit. 19. 17. <hi>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart, but shalt plainely rebuke thy neighbour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not suffer him to sinne:</hi> and Math. 18. 15. <hi>If thy brother sinne against thee:</hi> that is, doe thee any wrong; or else sinne against God, and thou be priuie to it: (for that sinne may bee said to be against a man, whereto he is priue, though the wrong bee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him because there is an offence giuen vnto him:) <hi>Then tell him his fault betweene him and thee alone:</hi> that is, correct and admonish him priuately. Againe, euery man is bound in conscience to saue his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers soule, which oft-times may bee done by <hi>brotherly correction;</hi> and for want thereof, many times the soule may perish: and therefore it is euery mans dutie to correct his brother; yet with this clause and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that iust occasion be offered, and time and place obserued; for there<note place="margin">Exceptions in the case of correction</note> be certaine particular exceptions, in which a man is freed from this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and all because there is no iust occasion of correction offered: as first, if he bee not certaine of the fault committed, for all lawfull corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,<note place="margin">1</note> is of faults certainely and truely knowne. Secondly, if the partie<note place="margin">2</note> offending doe repent for the ende of correction is to bring the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to amendment. Thirdly, if there bee no hope of his amendment,<note place="margin">3</note> Prou. 9. 8. <hi>Repro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e not a skorner:</hi> that is, such a one as mookes thee for thy labour. Fourthly, If it may in better manner, and to better purpose<note place="margin">4</note> be performed by others, which for place and abilitie may and wil more fitly performe it. But yet out of these cases, if iust occasion bee offered, euery one is to performe brotherly correction vnto his brother.</p>
               <p>Here I note one particular instruction; that not onely the Minister of<note place="margin">How euery Christian is a Pastor. Heb. 10. 24.</note> Gods word is our Pastor, but euen euery brother after a son is a pastor, in regard that hee must watch ouer the liues of his brethren for their good and amendment. It is the sinne of our time, that euery one thinks he hath no charge laid on him in regard of his brothers life and estate:
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:14013:222"/>
This was Cains sinne towards his brother Abel, he denied himselfe to be <hi>his brothers keeper:</hi> if any man sinne, the common speach is, what is it to me? let them looke to it whom it concernes. But this ought not to be, one man ought to obserue another, &amp; vse also brotherly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for the reformation of faults certainly known. This is a duty of loue and mercie, tending to the good of our brother, and to the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his soule: in conscience we are bound to releeue the bodies of our poore brethren that be in perill and want, much more then are we bound to looke vnto their soules, that they perish not for wante of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition. We must turne back our enemies oxe or asse that wandreth, much more our brother from going to perdition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> Who is to be corrected? out of whose eye is the mote to<note place="margin">Who must be corrected</note> be taken? to wit, <hi>a Brother; out of thy brothers eye:</hi> By a <hi>brother</hi> here Christ meaneth not euery neighbour, for that is euery man; but euery one that is a <hi>member of that Church, whereof we are members,</hi> and professeth the same religion which we doe, beeing admitted into the Church by the same sacrament of baptisme, whereby we were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This is plaine in the exhortation of Christ, Math. 18. 17. <hi>If thy brother sinne against thee tell him his fault, between him and thee: and so proceed</hi> (if he heare thee not) til he come to the censure of the Church: which were in vaine if the partie were no member of the Church. <hi>If any one that is called a brother</hi> (saith S. Paul) bee a fornicator, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, &amp;c. <hi>with such a one eate not,</hi> 1. Cor. 5. 11. and he addeth, <hi>what haue I to doe to iudge them that are without? doe yee not iudge them that are within?</hi> Now here the former order must be obserued; that first a man must correct himselfe, secondly his family and kindred, next a brother of the same congregation with him. And if good order be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, he may admonish a brother that is a member of another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church; but beyond this we may not goe, though we must carrie our selues so to them that are without, that by our good conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation we may winne them to God. And further this is to be knowne,<note place="margin">Outward dignity frees none from correction.</note> that in the Church of God, authoritie and dignitie frees no person fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brotherly correction; whereupon Paul biddes the <hi>people</hi> of Colossa, to say vnto <hi>Archippus</hi> their Pastor, <hi>Take heede to thy ministerie, which thou hast receiued of the Lord, that thou fulfil it,</hi> Coloss. 4. 17. And hence we may learne this dutie; when we offend in word or deede, wee must submit our selues willingly to brotherly correction; wee must not say, as one of the Israelites that stroue with his brother, said vnto Moses for reproouing him, <hi>who made thee a iudge and a ruler ouer vs?</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Exod. 2. 14.</note> faultie, we must submit our selues to the correction of our brother,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:14013:222"/>
though we be aboue them in place. <hi>It is better to heare the reproofe of a wise man</hi> (saith Salomon) <hi>then the song of a foole,</hi> Eccles. 7. 7. It may be the song of a foole will more delight vs, but sure it is, the wise mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe is farre more profitable. This <hi>Dauid</hi> testified, by desiring that <hi>the righteous might smite him,</hi> Ps. 141. 5. accounting it as a <hi>pretious balm vpon his head, which he would neuer want:</hi> yea, nature it selfe doth teach vs this, that it is better to be reprooued euen of an enemie, then to bee praised of a friend: according to that of <hi>Salomon, Open rebuke is better then secret loue,</hi> Prou. 27. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. Point.</hi> For what is a brother to bee admonished or corrected?<note place="margin">The matter of reproofe.</note> not onely for <hi>great</hi> offences, but for <hi>lesser</hi> sins: we must pull out not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beams, but strawes and motes out of his eie; for here lesser sins are as strawes and motes to greater sinnes, which be as beames and posts. The reason why we must correct our brother for s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al offences, is because e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery great sin hath his beginning of some little &amp; small sin; &amp; therefore it is a dutie of brotherly correction, to cut off sin in the head, before it growe out to the full. Thus the Lord dealt with <hi>Caine,</hi> Gen. 4. 6. he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued him for his wrath &amp; malice against his brother, testified by his sad countenance, before he slew his brother; but <hi>Caine</hi> not yeelding to the Lords reproofe, came at last to the grieuous sinne of murther.</p>
               <p>In this third point we may take a view of that heauenly order which Christ hath left in his Church, for the reformation, not only of greater crimes, but of lesser sins; for there be many sins committed which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be corrected by the sword of the Magistrate, neither yet by the publike censure of the Church; as lying, foolish lesting, &amp; other offences in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour &amp; attire; yet these will not Christ permit to be in his Church, &amp; therefore hath prouided brotherly correction to cut them off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV. Point.</hi> How is brotherly correction to be performed? Although<note place="margin">The manner how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue.</note> the maner of brotherly correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not here expresly set down, yet it is implied, where it is said, <hi>Then shalt thou see cleerely, &amp;c.</hi> I will stand a little to shew how this dutie is to be performed. In brotherly correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these things are required; 1. Christian wisdome to see cleerely into the fault, &amp; also how it is to be ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. The author to the Hebrews makes<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 24.</note> it the duty of euery Christian to <hi>obserue his brother:</hi> not for this end, to vpbraid him with his faults; but that he may rightly discerne thereof, &amp; also know how to correct him. And here comes a common fault to bee reprooued, many are forward and hastie to correct their bretheren, but yet it shall be vpon bare rumors &amp; vncertain grounds, they wil not stay till they know the fault throughly and certainly, wherupon it comes to passe many times, that the reprouer bears the blame; for the party repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:14013:223"/>
saith, there is no such matter, the thing is otherwise, &amp; so the other becomes a rash censurer. 2. In christian correction, there must be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation<note place="margin">2</note> of fit circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances; as time &amp; place; els the good admonition may be lesse effectuall. We shall see the practise of this in the word of God, <hi>Abigail</hi> obserued a fit time to reprooue her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for his churlish an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer<note place="margin">1. Sam. 25. 36. 37.</note> to <hi>Dauids</hi> seruants, and therefore told him not of it till his feast of sheep-shearing was ended, &amp; the wine gone out of his head. 3. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<note place="margin">3</note> of our brothers offence must be considered, whether it proceede of humane frailtie, or otherwise; if his fault proceed from humane frailtie, then <hi>Pauls</hi> lesson may be practised, Gal. 6. 1. <hi>Ye that are spiritual restore such a one with the spirit of meekenes.</hi> The phrase there is borrowed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Surgeons, who being to deale with a broken ioynt, wil handle the same very tenderly; and so must they be dealt with in reproofe, that sinne of humane fiailtie. Example of this mildenes in reproofe we haue in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> who reprooued <hi>Dauid</hi> in a parable, and so brought him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne<note place="margin">2. Sam. 21. 1, 2. &amp;c.</note> himselfe: &amp; the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> reproouing the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Cor. 4. 6. And giuing direction to <hi>Timothy</hi> how to carrie himselfe in the Church of God, though he allow him to vse rebuke &amp; reproofe, 2.

                     </gap>. Tim. 5. 1.</note> admonition: if the partie be an Elder, though reproofe be not vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet it is not so fit as exhortation: and the like mildenesse must be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed toward all those that sinne of humane frailty. But if the offence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from wilfulnes and obstinacie, then the iudgements of God must be denounced against them to driue them to repentance. 4. Euery one<note place="margin">4</note> that is to correct another, must consider himselfe, and his owne estate, knowing that of himselfe he may fall into the like offence. So <hi>Paul</hi> bids them that are to seeke the restoring of such as are fallen, <hi>to consider the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,</hi> Galat. 6. 1. 5. Brotherly correction must bee deliuered with<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>Doctrine</hi> and instruction: 2. Tim. 4. 1, 2. <hi>I charge thee before God, to reprooue, exhort, and rebuke, with all long suffering and doctrine.</hi> He that will admonish, must first himselfe be resolued, that the thing done is a sinne, then he must propound it to the partie, as a sinne out of Gods word; and deliuer the reproofe, not in his owne name, but in the name of God; so as hereby the partie may know himselfe to haue offended, and also say, that he is reprooued of God himselfe rather then of man. This ought all superiours to practise, in correcting and admonishing their inferiours; they must not goe thereto in rage, but in long suffering; nor rudely, but with <hi>doctrine,</hi> that the partie offending may see his
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:14013:223"/>
fault. And thus much for this dutie of brotherly correction.</p>

This verse dependeth not vpon the former, but herein our Sauiour Christ laies down a new point of instruction, directing his Disciples, and in them all ministers, vnto that Christian discretion which ought to be obserued in the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word of God. And his direction is here propounded in a prohibition of <hi>giuing holy things to dogs, or casting pearles before swine:</hi> which is enforced by a double reason, least they tread vpon you, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now for the better vnderstanding hereof, first I will speake of the words, because they are hard and difficult; and then come to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
               <p>In the words foure things are to be sought out. 1. What is meant by <hi>holy things.</hi> 2. What is meant by <hi>pearles.</hi> 3. What is meant by <hi>dogs:</hi> and 4. what is meant by <hi>swine.</hi> For the first, by that <hi>which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> we must vnderstand, first and properly, <hi>the word of God,</hi> written in the bookes of the old and new testament, in his right and holy vse; that is, read, dispensed, and preached: and consequently, by <hi>holy things,</hi> are meant the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and Christian admonition. <hi>Gods word</hi> is called<note place="margin">Gods word is an holy thing.</note> an <hi>holy thing</hi> for sundry causes, but principally for these two; first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is holy in it selfe: and secondly, in effect &amp; operation. It is holy in it selfe, because it is set apart by God, to be in the Church in stead of his owne liuely voyce vnto his people, for the reucaling and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all things to be beleeued and done in his Church. In the old te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, God himselfe spake by a liuely voice vnto the Patriarkes, and after the giuing of the Law, hee gaue answer to the high Priest at the Mercie-seat &amp; yet we are not inferiour to them, though we want that liuely voice; for we haue the written word in stead thereof, which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable euery way thereunto: for looke what the written word saith, is as much as if the Lord from heauen should speake by a liuely voice: and so consequently, it is to vs in stead of the Arke of God, a pledge of his presence. And thus it is holy in it selfe. Secondly, Gods word is <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> in regard of operation; for it is the instrument of the spirit, set apart by God himselfe, to be the meanes whereby he sanctifies and reformes the hearts and liues of his children.

Surely we must consider the word of God, which is that <hi>holy thing</hi> set apart by God, to be in stead of his owne liuely voyce; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we neede not seeke for him that is inuisible, but wee must haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vnto the word, &amp; labour to haue it present with vs in our hearts, in our liues, and consciences. <hi>Enoch</hi> walked before God, not onely in regard of his infinite maiestie, which though it bee inuisible, is euery where present; but principally in respect of his word, setting that before him wheresoeuer he was. When we are commanded to <hi>feare God,</hi> wee must know that that is done, not onely when wee stand in awe of his glorious maiestie, but principally when wee feare to offend God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding vs in his word. The Apostle saith, that <hi>the holy Ghost dwels in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>our hearts:</hi> which must not be thought to be meant of that infinite sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the holy spirit; but of the dwelling of the word, which is made effectuall by the holy spirit: for saith euer hath relation to the word, &amp; beeing beleeued, it dwels in the heart, &amp; makes the spirit, which workes by the same word present also. In which regard <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Now I liue</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>not, but Christ liues in me;</hi> which he expoundeth after, saying, <hi>I liue now by faith in the son of God:</hi> because the word of Christ was present with him, and the grace of saith that liues by that word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, seeing the word of God is of this holinesse, we must learne<note place="margin">Vse the word holily.</note> to vse the same publikely or priuately, with all reuerence, carefully san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying our selues thereunto. When the people came to receiue the Law in Mount Sina, they were sanctified three daies before; &amp; the same preparation for substance, ought we to make before we heare the word of God: First, <hi>we must wash our hands in innocencie, and then compasse</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, whereas the word is vnto vs the voice of God, &amp; the means<note place="margin">The pure word alone ought to be taught.</note> of sanctification; we may learne that in the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods people ordinarily, the pure word of God alone ought to be heard, without the mixture of the words of men, be they neuer so holy: for it is not said of the words of any man, that they are <hi>that holy thing.</hi> The Lord himselfe alone had the appointment of the making of the <hi>holy oyle,</hi> which was<note place="margin">Exod. 30. 32, 33.</note> to anoint the Kings and Priests vnder the law: neither might any man

adde any thing thereto, though it were neuer so pure and good, nor<note place="margin">Exod. 30. 32, 33.</note> make any oyle like vnto it: so likewise the <hi>trumpets</hi> that serued for the Tabernacle to assemble the people, the Lord himselfe alone had the appointment of them; and none might vse any other, though it were made of most pure gold. Had the Lord this care ouer his Sanctuarie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, to take the appointment of these things to himselfe alone? and shall we thinke that the trumpet of his holy word, which now by his appointment soundeth in the congregation of the Saints, may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a mixture with the words of men, humane, or diuine, be they neuer so holy? The ancient Church was farre from this mixture: and therfore <note n="a" place="margin">Synod. Laodic. ca. 59</note> 
                  <hi>forbade the publike reading of the Apocrypha,</hi> which yet are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent bookes then the writings of men published since the Apostles. But it is saide, that they onely finde fault with this kinde of preaching which cannot attaine vnto it. I answer, it is no point of the greatest lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to vse the sayings of Fathers and Poets in preaching: and they which vse it not, refraine therefrom, not because they cannot doe it, but because they dare not mingle the sayings of men with the word of God, which is that holy thing, seruing in stead of Gods owne glorious voice in all matters that concerne our faith and obedience; and beeing the onely sufficient instrument of our sanctification: and therefore it were to be wished, that in the congregations of the Saints, the pure word of God might sound alone vnto Gods people; that as they are begotten alone of this <hi>immortall seede,</hi> so they might be fedde alone with this <hi>sincere milke.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> things to be considered, are touching <hi>dogs and</hi>
                  <pb n="439" facs="tcp:14013:225"/>
                  <hi>swine;</hi> where these three points are to bee handled: I. What are here properly meant by <hi>dogs</hi> and <hi>swine:</hi> II. Who must <hi>giue iudgement</hi> of men to be <hi>dogs</hi> and <hi>swine:</hi> and III. <hi>Where they are to be found.</hi> For the first: By <hi>dogs</hi> and <hi>swine,</hi> wee must vnderstand the <hi>enemies</hi> of Gods word; yet not all enemies, for so euery sinner should be a <hi>dog</hi> &amp; a <hi>swine:</hi> but onely such as are <hi>malitious obstinate enemies,</hi> manifestly conuicted<note place="margin">Dogs and swine are obstinate enemies.</note> of their enmitie to Gods word &amp; doctrine, of whose amendment there is no hope. And that these are here to be vnderstood, appeares by these reasons: <hi>I.</hi> From the text it selfe, which describeth them by this, that <hi>treading the words of instruction vnder foote, they doe turne againe, and all-to-rend the Teachers thereof:</hi> that is, they do persecute them both by word and deed, in all reproachfull speeches, &amp; cruell actions. <hi>II. Reason.</hi> In the word of God we shall find that Christ and his Apostles preached to dogs (for such are all men by nature:) The Scribes and Pharisies, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Vypers came to <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme vnrepelled, though not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reprooued: Matth. 3. 6, 7. and Christ himselfe telleth <hi>the woman of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, that it was not lawfull to giue the childrens bread to dogs:</hi> that is, to<note place="margin">Math. 15 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Againe, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ preached to the Scribes and Pharisies, euen then when hee wept ouer Ierusalem for their impenitencie; yea, this is a truth, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men are naturally dogs and swine, therefore they must haue the word of God preached vnto them, to purifie and sanctifie them, vnlesse they be obstinate and irrepentant enemies to the word, of whom is no hope of recouerie. <hi>III. Reason.</hi> These obstinate enemies here are called dogs and swine, by allusion to vncleane beasts vnder the law; of which sort were <hi>dogs</hi> &amp; <hi>swine,</hi> which were prohibited the Iews to be eaten, or offered in sacrifice to God: Christ therfore here by allusion to that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, means such persons as are excluded from the holy things of the Lord, and haue no right or interest into the Lords word or sacraments; such as both in heart and life be vncleane as hogs and dogs, &amp; will not be purified. <hi>IV. Reason. Paul</hi> chargeth <hi>Titus,</hi> that <hi>after once or twice</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 3 10. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he should reiect an heretike, knowing that such a one is peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and sinneth, beeing damned of his own selfe:</hi> that is, sinneth wilfully &amp; obstinately, and in so sinning condemneth himselfe in his own heart &amp; conscience: and such are meant by <hi>dogs</hi> and <hi>swine</hi> in this place.</p>
               <p>Now the difference of these two may be this; By <hi>dogs</hi> are meant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate<note place="margin">Difference betweene dogs and swine.</note> enemies that <hi>malitiously</hi> reuile the ministerie of the word, the doctrine of God, and the messengers thereof: such a dog was <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

By <hi>swine,</hi> are meant obstinate enemies that doe contemne the word of God; either because they will not admit reformation of life by it, such as <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The second point touching these persons, is <hi>who must giue iudgem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Who must iudge men to be dogs &amp; swine.</note> 
                  <hi>of any man or any people to be dogs and swine:</hi> we must know that it is not in the power and libertie of any priuate man to giue iudgement of another that he is a <hi>dogge</hi> or a <hi>swine;</hi> but it is a publike dutie belonging to the ministers and gouernours of the Church to giue iudgement in this case. Matth. 18. 17. Before a man must be reputed as a <hi>Publicane,</hi> and as an <hi>heathen,</hi> the <hi>censure of the Church</hi> must passe vpon his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour; and from the iudgement of the Church must priuate men hold other as Publicanes and Heathen. Indeede our Sauiour Christ and his Apostles gaue this iudgement of men particularly and peremptorily; as <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-smith: but wee must vnderstand, what authoritie, and what spirit Christ and his Apostles had; which because we haue not, we cannot giue such iudgement vpon men. Further, here we are to know, that iudgement vpon others is two-fold; <hi>Iudgement of certaintie,</hi> or <hi>iudgement of humane wisedom:</hi> The <hi>iudgement of certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> touching any mans state, belongs onely to God, &amp; to them to whom God reuealeth the same. The <hi>iudgement of humane wisedome,</hi> is when the Church of God, in the feare of God, giue iudgement as truely and as neerely as they can, who is a dogge, and who is a swine: and this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the iudgement of the Church, which also is conditionall; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>till they repent:</hi> because they know not the times that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the conuersion of sinners. And by this wee are taught, to comprimit our iudgement of any man, in regard of his finall estate, though he be an vnrepentant sinner, refusing instruction; for most hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous sinners haue bin conuerted.</p>
               <p>The third point, <hi>where these dogges and swine are to be found:</hi> It is<note place="margin">Where dogs and swine are to bee found.</note> not in the power of any ordinarie minister, or other man, to determine of any one, that he is a <hi>dogge</hi> or a <hi>swine;</hi> for in such do finall impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and wilfull obstinacie concurre; which wee are not able to say cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, are come vpon any man or woman while they liue among vs: &amp; yet this may be said with good conscience, that there is in many a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full declination to the properties of dogs and swine, euen in this age of
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:14013:226"/>
ours; for many will heare the word, receiue the sacraments, &amp; professe that they hope to be saued by Christ; &amp; yet they will raile on his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, &amp; speake against their ministery: yea, the times are now, wherein many in open speech wil not sticke to reuile and condemne those that haue bin the most excellent instruments of Gods mercie in his Church: among many I will name one, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Ioh. Calum,</hi> that worthy instrument of the Gospel, is in the mouthes of many students condemned as an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous person, teaching false &amp; dangerous doctrine. Yea, many there be, that come to the Lords table, &amp; yet will not brooke reformation of life; they wil not be drawn from their drunkennes, ignorance, adulterie, &amp; couetousnesse. A third sort there are, that take occasion from Gods word, to liue in their sinnes, and to maintaine their wicked liues; as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrine of Gods eternall predestination, because the Scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that Gods decree therein is vncha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geable; therfore some say, they will liue as they list: others, because the word saith, we are to be saued by faith alone, therefore they refuse to walke in good workes: &amp; others looke to be saued by Gods mercy alone, and therefore they will not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour either for knowledge, or faith, as they ought to doe: &amp; some, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the doctrine of the <hi>deniall of our selues,</hi> doe say, the word of God is too straite a doctrine, barring men from laughter, &amp; mirth, &amp; other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations; and therefore they will none of Gods word: now though we cannot call these mens <hi>dogs,</hi> because wee know not what they may be hereafter; yet we may truely say, thefe be practises of dogs and swine.</p>
               <p>And thus wee see what is meant by <hi>holy things,</hi> by <hi>pearles,</hi> by <hi>dogs,</hi> and <hi>swine;</hi> from whence the meaning of Christ may be plainely thus set downe: <hi>Giue not that which is holy, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>haue regard how, &amp; to whom ye dispense the word and sacraments, and if any person be openly conuicted of obstinate enmitie to your doctrine, to such publish not my worde, be they dogs in railing, or swine in senslesse contemning and scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the same.</hi>

to conuince their very conscience of the truth which they in heart and life denie: so as he may say with <hi>Paul, If our Gospel be hid, it is hidde to them that perish,</hi> 2. Cor. 4. 3. but if after all this, they giue euident signes of malicious and obstinate enmitie against the word, scorning and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the doctrine of God, and on the ministers thereof, then are they to be cast out by the Church, and to be accounted as dogges, and to be barred from the word of life till they repent. This was Christs owne practise toward the Iewes: at the first he preached vnto them the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of the kingdome by Iohn Baptist, in his owne person, and by his Disciples, but when as he saw some of them maliciously obstinate, then he propounded <hi>his doctrine vnto them in parables vnto them,</hi> that they<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 15.</note> might be hardened in sinne: and after expounded the same priuately to his Disciples. The Disciples likewise after the ascension of Christ, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched still vnto the Iewes, euen when they were persecuted by them: but at length when as they saw that of obstinate malice they oppugned the truth, <hi>putting it from them, and iudging themselues vnworthie eternall life, then they turned to the Gentiles,</hi> Act. 13. 46.</p>
               <p>Now in this that hath beene said, we may note two things: first, the long suffering and great patience of God, that will not haue a sinner li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the Church condemned, till he haue brought him through all the meanes of his conuersion, and till he be past hope. Thus he dealt with the <hi>old world,</hi> expecting their repentance <hi>an hundred and twentie yeares,</hi> whereunto he then called them by the preaching of Noah, Gen. 6. Secondly, hereby we must learne to moderate our iudgements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning wicked men: a man must not be condemned for a dogge or for a swine, till he giue euident signes of obstinate malice, and wilfull contempt of the word, and vntill he doe euen conuict himselfe to be such a one, by a wilfull contempt of the meanes of his saluation. This serues to shew their rashnesse and indiscretion, that condemne our Church for no Church, and our people for no people of God: iudging them for dogges and swine, when as they haue not yet conuicted them of obstinate malice in sinne or error. It will be said, they haue admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed them by writing. <hi>I answer,</hi> that their owne bookes haue more er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in them, then they doe hold whome they admonish, and so their writings can be no sufficient conuiction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here obserue that men become <hi>dogges</hi> and <hi>swine,</hi> by their wilfull repelling that holy doctrine of God, which should purge them and make them cleane. It is the naturall propertie of a dog to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to his vomit, and of a swine, to his wallowing in the mire, as the prouerbe is; and hereof they can by no meanes be bereaued. And all
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:14013:227"/>
men by nature returne to the vomit and filth of their sinnes like dogs &amp; swine: and they which will by no meanes suffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to be drawen from their old sinnes, they haue these properties of dogges &amp; swinerand looke as those beasts were excluded the Lords tabernacle &amp; congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnder the law; so are these men debarred from the word &amp; sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all holy things vnder the Gospel; they are an abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto the Lord: see Psal. 56. 6. and Psal. 50. 16. In this regard we are to be admonished, to suffer our selues to be clensed and reformed by the word of God. <hi>Ye are cleane</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>by the word which I haue spoken vnto you,</hi> Ioh. 15. 3. where he maketh the word of God the instrument of our purification: to which effect he saith in his praier to his father, <hi>Sanctifie them with thy truth, thy word is truth,</hi> Ioh. 17. 17. And <hi>Saint Peter</hi> saith, <hi>our soules are purified in obeying the truth by the spirit.</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 22. Now we are by nature <hi>dogges</hi> and <hi>swine,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the filth of our own sinnes returning thereto with greedines, neither can we of our selues be broken of this property, but when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is offered we doe naturally runne to our old sinnes, as the <hi>swine and dogges doe to their filth and vomit.</hi> In consideration whereof we ought to subiect our selues to the word of God, labouring to see and feele our owne vncleannesse, and to crie with Dauid, <hi>Wash me through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from my sinnes:</hi> and with Peter, <hi>Not my feete onely, but my whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> that so it may be said of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, <hi>We are cleane throughout by Christs word.</hi> If we see any vncleannes in our hearts or liues, we must purge it out by this word, and returne no more to the filth of our former sinnes. It is the propertie of Christs sheepe to heare his voice, and to obey the same: let vs hereby testifie our solues to be his sheepe, that so we may be distinguished from dogges and swine.</p>
               <p>Here it may be demanded, whether we should make confession of our faith before dogges and swine. <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes, if we be called thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we are bound to doe it: <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And herein we may see the abuse of this ordinance, when it is vsed for politicke and ciuill respects; especially in the Church of Rome, where it is made an instrument of the vniust deposing of Christian Princes, and of exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Pius 5. pont. in Bulla co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Thirdly, here our Sauiour Christ noteth out the principall persons<note place="margin">Who must execute this censure.</note> that are to execute this censure of the Church vpon wilfull and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate enemies, that be as dogs and swine; namely, they to whome the disposing and keeping of the holy things of God is committed, that is, the lawfull ministers of the word and Sacraments: for they must keepe those holy things pure which God hath committed vnto them; but that they cannot doe without the exercise of this censure which God hath giuen vnto his Church.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, here also we may see, how farre this censure of the Church<note place="margin">How farre excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth.</note> extendeth against obstinate and wilfull enemies: namely, to the debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them from the vse of the Churches Ministerie in the word, praier, and sacraments. Indeed if the partie be excommunicate for some particular crime, and there be hope of his repentance, because he doth not shew himselfe a dogge or a swine, by wilfull obstinacie in his sinne and contempt of the Church; then, although he be excluded from communion with them in the Sacraments and prayer, yet he may be admitted to the hearing of the word, because that is a means to humble him for his sinne, and to bring him to repentance, which is the end of all Ecclesiasticall censures.

               <p>In this reason see the singular <hi>care</hi> of our Sauiour Christ, to keepe<note place="margin">The holy things of God must be kept from contempt.</note> the scriptures and other holy things of God from prophanation: This care he likewaies shewed with great zeale when <hi>he whipt the buyers and sellers out of the temple,</hi> because they made <hi>his fathers house,</hi> that holy place, <hi>a house of marchandise and a denne of theeues.</hi> Math. 21. 12. 13.

                  <pb n="446" facs="tcp:14013:229"/>In this reason Christ sheweth, that it is not onely lawfull, but neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, that Gods ministers should seeke to auoid and shunne the malice<note place="margin">Ministers may seeke to auoide persecutions</note> and rage of obstinate enemies, by all lawfull meanes which may stand with Gods glorie and the keeping of a good conscience.

Part of Christs ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> the third part of this chapter, concerning <hi>praier:</hi> and it consisteth of two branches: a <hi>commandement</hi> to pray, and effectuall <hi>reasons</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade vs thereto. The commandement is propounded in three seuerall teannes, <hi>Aske, seeke, and knocke:</hi> each whereof hath his promise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed thereto, <hi>Ye shall haue, ye shall find, and it shall be opened vnto you.</hi> Now for our better vnderstanding of Christs meaning herein, two rules must be obserued. I. That Christ here speakes not of euery kind of asking in praier, but of that onely which himselfe commandeth and alloweth: for we may aske and not receiue, <hi>because we aske amisse,</hi> as <note n="a" place="margin">Iam. 4. 3.</note> S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith: but he that asketh, according to Christs direction in this place, shall receiue.</p>
               <p>Now in all acceptable praier to God, foure conditions must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.<note place="margin">4. Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable praier.</note> I. We must aske <hi>while the time of grace and mercie remaineth:</hi> for if the day of grace be once past, we may aske, seeke, and knocke, but all in vaine: this is plaine by the <hi>fiue foolish virgins,</hi> who <hi>asked &amp; sought</hi>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:14013:229"/>
                  <hi>for oyle, but found none, yea they called and knocked, but it was not ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto them,</hi> Matth. 25. 8. 9. 12. Now the time of this life, while God offers mercie vnto vs in his word, is <hi>the acceptable time and the day of grace,</hi> 2. Cor. 6. 2. and therefore herein must we <hi>aske, seeke, and knocke.</hi> II. We must not aske as seemeth good vnto our selues, but <hi>according</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>to Gods will,</hi> and <hi>as his word alloweth.</hi> The sonnes of Zebedie were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied their request, because <hi>they asked they knew not what,</hi> Matth. 20. 22. But <hi>this is our assurance that we haue in him, that if we aske any thing according to his will he heareth vs,</hi> 1. Ioh. 5. 14. III. We must <hi>aske in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>faith,</hi> that is, <hi>beleeue</hi> that God will graunt vs those things which we aske according to his will: Iam. 1. 5, 6. If any man lacke wisdome let him aske of God—<hi>but let him aske in faith, and wauer not: for the wauering minded man shall receiue nothing of God:</hi> therfore saith Christ, <hi>Whatsoeuer ye desire in praier, beleeue that ye shall haue it, and it shall be done vnto you.</hi> Mark. 11. 24. IV. We must referre the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<note place="margin">4</note> of Gods accomplishing our requests to his good pleasure. It was the sinne of the Israelites that they <hi>limited the holy one of Israel,</hi> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing him what they would haue for their prouision, and when they would haue it: Psal. 78. 41. we therefore must waite on God, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, Psal. 40. 1. <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord, and he enclined his eare vnto me, and heard me.</hi> God deferres the graunting of our requests, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would trie the affections of his children. Cantic. 3. 1. The Church <hi>seeketh Christ,</hi> but <hi>cannot finde him,</hi> that is, where and when shee will. And indeede herein doe we shew forth faith when we referre the time and manner of receiuing our request, to the good pleasure of God: for <hi>he that beleeueth will not make hast.</hi> Isa. 28. 16.</p>
               <p>The second rule to be here remembred concerning prayer, is: That<note place="margin">2. Rule. Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to hear and respect the person in Christ.</note> these promises are not made directly to the worke of prayer, but to the person that prayeth; and yet not to him simply, as he doth this good action of praier, but as he is in Christ, for whose merite sake the promise is accomplished: and therefore Christ here speakes to them, whome he takes for graunted to be the true members of his mysticall bodie which is his Church. This rule must be remembred for the right vnderstanding of the promises of God concerning prayer; for hereby it is plaine that our prayer is not the cause of the blessings we receiue from God, but onely a way and instrument in and by which God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayeth his blessings vnto his children: for a true praier is a fruit of our faith in Christ, in whome alone <hi>all the promises of God are yea, and amen,</hi> that is, sure and certen vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Now hauing found Christs meaning, let vs come to such instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:14013:230"/>
as are to be gathered hence. First, obserue that Christ doeth not barely propound this commandement to pray, but repeates the same by a kind of gradation in three distinct words, <hi>Aske, seeke,</hi> and <hi>knocke;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zeale &amp; ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueacie in praier.</note> whereof the latter imports more vehemence then the former. And this he doth to checke the slacknesse and coldenesse of our prayers, and to stir vs vp to feruent zeale and diligence in this duetie both in publike and priuate. And to mooue vs to godly zeale and diligence in this dutie, consider the reasons following. <hi>I. Christs owne example,</hi> which in morall duties is a perfect rule: Now though he had little need to pray in respect of himselfe, for he did neuer sinne, yet how often, and how long, and with what feruencie did he giue himselfe to this dutie? he <hi>spent whole nights in prayer,</hi> Luk. 6. 12. and <hi>in prayer in the garden he swet water and blood.</hi> We haue also <hi>Moses</hi> example, who spent <hi>fourtie dayes and fourtie nights in praier and fasting for the people,</hi> when they had sinned, Deuter. 9. 18. 19. If he were thus feruent in prayer for their sinnes, how earnest would he be for his owne? And <hi>Daniel</hi> humbled himselfe many dayes, and prayed feruently for his people, Dan. 9. 3. 4. &amp;c. Dauid <hi>prayed seuen times a day, and rose vp at midnight to giue thankes to God,</hi> Psal. 119. 164. 62. And <hi>Paul</hi> willeth the Romans that they would <hi>striue</hi> or <hi>wrestle with him by praier to God,</hi> Rom. 15. 30. All these are worthie examples vnto vs; and if we compare our selues with them we shall see we haue much more cause so to doe: for our sinnes abound aboue theirs, and therefore we had need to pray for the preuenting of Gods iudgements which our sinnes call for against vs. Also we come far short of them in grace, and therefore had need to pray for supply thereof against the time of neede; for our dayes of peace will not alwayes last, wee haue enioyed it long, and therefore must looke for dayes of triall, for the state of Gods Church is interchangeable. <hi>II. Reason.</hi> All of vs must come to deale with God, both in the day of death and at the day of iudgement; at both which times all worldly helpes and comforts will forsake vs, and by no meanes can wee shunne that accompt; therefore it will be good for vs while we liue often to set our selues before the Lord, that so we may make our selues familiar and acquainted with him against that day: But if now we estrange our selues from God in regard of this exercise of prayer, then at our ende wee shall finde the Lord to be strange vnto vs, and to professe that <hi>he knowes vs not,</hi> which will be woe vnto vs. <hi>III. Reason.</hi> Euery good thing we haue or stand in need of, comes from the mercie and bountie of God in Christ: and prayer is an ordinarie meanes for the procuring of Gods blessings; we
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:14013:230"/>
therefore must giue our selues to the faithfull practise of this dutie. Indeede if grace and other blessings were our owne, or from our selues, we might well spare this labour, <hi>But what hast thou</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi> to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 7.</note> Christian) <hi>that thou hast not receiued?</hi> be not therefore secure and idle, for Gods blessings come not when we snort vpon our elboes, but in the vse of meanes; and happie are we that may vse those meanes: for <hi>in asking we receiue, in seeking we finde, and in knocking it is opened vnto vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, our Sauiour Christ by trebling this commandement to<note place="margin">Causes why w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>pray,</hi> would giue vs to consider that there is some waightie cause we should be instant in this dutie; and that is, in regard of the great mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and manifold dangers whereunto we are subiect in this life: for as <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>the righteous shall hardly be saued:</hi> and no maruell, for we<note place="margin">

Pet. 4. 18.</note> haue <hi>without vs,</hi> the Deuill and all his Angels plotting our destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the world a daungerous enemie whereby the Deuill workes: <hi>within vs</hi> we haue our owne corrupt hearts, daily drawing vs to the practise of sinne, the bane and poison of our soules. Now what is to be done in this case? surely our onely refuge, is constant and seruent praier to God, as Christ here implies by this threefold command: for <hi>in all things we must let our requests be made knowne to God,</hi> Philip. 4. 6. This hath alwaies beene the practise of all the faithfull, as we may see in Gods booke. But if we had no example, this commandement were sufficient to perswade vs vnto this dutie. Also doest thou want any grace of God, as faith, repentance, knowledge, zeale, patience, strength against temptation, or assurance of Gods fauour? why, <hi>aske and thou shalt haue, seeke and thou shalt finde.</hi> And this must be our course in outward wants, and for temporall blessings, as health, peace, libertie, plentie, &amp;c. Indeede the wicked worldlings seeke to wise men and wise women in their miseries, but this is to forsake God, and to goe to the Deuill: <hi>Gods people must goe to their God,</hi> Isa. 8. 19.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the trebling of this commandement in diuers tearmes must<note place="margin">We must be vrge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t in prayer.</note> teach vs, to be instant and vrgent with God in prayer: this is an holy and acceptable importunitie, when the Christian heart giues God no rest: Ierem. 29. 12, 13. the Lord promiseth to his people, <hi>That they shall erie vnto him, and goe and pray vnto him, and he will heare them: they shall seeke him, and finde him, because they shall seeke him with their whole heart.</hi> Isa. 62. 7. <hi>The Lords remembrancers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to keepe silence, nor to giue the Lord any rest.</hi> Matth. 15. 22. <hi>The woman of Canaan is commended, because shee will take no answer</hi> nor repulse from our Sauiour Christ, till her daughter was
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:14013:231"/>
cured: and Luke 18. 5. <hi>The poore widow by her importunitie preuailed with the vnrighteous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>udge:</hi> which parable Christ propounds to teach vs to be constant and earnest in prayer. We therefore must shake off our naturall coldnesse and negligence in praier, which is the common sinne of the world in regard of this dutie. And we must labour for knowledge both of our owne sinnes and miseries, and of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that so we may pray with vnderstanding, and in zeale and feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie as Christ here requireth. Alas, many pray not at all, and others know not what they aske, though they say the Lords praier, or some other set forme of praier. And most men that haue knowledge, suffer their mindes to wander from God by vaine imaginations: now all comes for lacke of that feeling in praier which Christ here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the commandement in generall. Now out of the wordes more particularly we may obserue two points. First, where Christ bids vs <hi>Aske, seeke, knocke,</hi> he speakes not particularly to some, but generally to all his seruants, so that all must pray; which plainely implies that his best and deerest seruants are during this life in want of<note place="margin">The best are not here perfect.</note> some grace or blessing. And indeede when God giues most excellent gifts and blessings to his children, yet then he leaues them in some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table want or triall for their humiliation and prouocation to prayer. <hi>Paul was taken vp into paradise, and there heard words that cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>be vttered by man in this life:</hi> this was a great grace and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: but yet to humble him, <hi>least he should be exalted out of measure, there was giuen him a pricke in the flesh the messenger of Satan to buffet him:</hi> hereby he was brought to pray most earnestly for deliuerance, but yet he must <hi>rest contented with Gods grace; for God will make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his power through the weakenesse of his seruants,</hi> v. 8. 9. This point must be obserued, to discouer to many secure persons their miserable state, who feele no want of grace in themselues, and therefore thinke all is well. But what meanest thou to professe Christ, if thou haue no neede of him nor of his graces? oh know it, when thou saiest in thine owne heart, <hi>thou art rich and lackest nothing;</hi> then <hi>thou art poore, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>blind, and miserable, and wretched.</hi> And indeede if thou knewest the corruption of thine owne heart, thou wouldest crie out with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, in respect of thy wants; <hi>Oh miserable man that I am, who shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer me from this bodie of death!</hi> Rom. 7. 24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ saying not onely <hi>Aske,</hi> but <hi>seeke</hi> and <hi>knocke;</hi> doth<note place="margin">God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his children.</note> hereby imply what is Gods dealing many times with his own seruants: namely, that he forsakes them for a time, and in part, and in some sort
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:14013:231"/>
hides himselfe, and as it were locks himselfe from them. Now thus he dealeth for two causes: First, hereby to chast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> and correct them for their sinnes: for <hi>iniquitie separates betweene God and his people, and their sinnes hide his face from them,</hi> Isa. 59. 2. Secondly, to make triall of his graces in his children, to see whether they delight in his loue, to shew them their owne weaknes, and to mooue th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>aue vnto him more inseparable. By all which we see it stands <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>and to pray earnestly and continually, for God may forsake vs for our sinnes: and he may iustly take occasion to trie what we haue profited by his Gospel, which we haue long enioyed with aboundance of peace.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the commandement to earnest prayer: Now Christ<note place="margin">Reasons of the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to pray.</note> enforceth it by two reasons. First, by a <hi>promise,</hi> infolded in this verse with the commandement, and confirmed in the next. Secondly, by a comparison, verse 9. For the first, The reason from the <hi>promise</hi> in this verse may thus be framed:</p>
               <p>If they which aske, shall receiue; if they that seeke, shall finde; and they that knocke shall be let in, then doe you aske, seeke, and knocke:</p>
               <p>But they that aske, shall receiue, they that seeke, shall finde, &amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe you aske, seeke, and knocke.</p>
               <p>In this reason our Sauiour Christ teacheth vs, that when we pray to<note place="margin">A speciall faith requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in praier</note> God, we must bring a speciall faith whereby we are assured that the particular things we aske according to Gods will shall be giuen vs. So saith Christ, Mark. 11. 24. <hi>Whatsoeuer ye aske in prayer, beleeue that ye shall haue it, and it shal be done vnto you:</hi> and, Iam. 1. 6. <hi>Let him aske in faith:</hi> for he that doubteth of Gods promise defraudeth himselfe of the thing he asketh. Now if we must bring this speciall faith, then of necessitie must we haue a speciall knowledge of the will and promise of God for the things we aske: for as without faith we cannot pray aright, so without knowledge, no faith: And therefore we must be carefull to accquaint our selues with the will and promise of God, that by Gods commaundement we may know what to aske, and by faith may also aske in assurance; for if we pray without this knowledge and faith, our praiers are but lip-labour and vnprofitable.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hence we learne that the Papists erre grossely, which teach<note place="margin">Rhem. on Iam. 1. sect. 6. Bellarm. de iustif. l. 3. c. 13</note> that this speciall faith is not necessarie in praier; this is a doctrine of Deuills: for we ought to bring in prayer a particular faith to applie to our selues the promise of God concerning that thing which we aske in prayer. But this we can neuer bring, vnlesse we first haue a speciall
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:14013:232"/>
sauing faith whereby we beleeue our reconciliation with God in Christ: for therefore doe we beleeue that God will graunt our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular requests, because by faith wee knowe our selues to be in Christ, in whome he loues vs and therefore will make good his promise vnto vs, as the Apostle saith, <hi>This is the assurance that we haue in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>t if we aske any thing according to his will he heareth vs,</hi> 1. Ioh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hence we learne how to carie our selues in all dangers; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and afflictions; namely, we must settle our hearts by faith vpon the promise of God, who hath saide <hi>he will not forsake vs, but be with vs in trouble and deliuer vs,</hi> Psal. 92. 15. This is necessarie, for without faith in great afflictions our owne naturall passions will confound vs: Hence Habakkuc speaking of grieuous times of affliction saith, <hi>The Iust shall liue by faith.</hi> And this Dauid testified, Psal. 62. 1. <hi>Yet my soule</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hab. 2. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>keepeth silence vnto God: of him commeth my saluation.</hi> Psal. 23. 3. <hi>Though I should walke through the valley of the shadow of death, I will feare none euill: for thou</hi> (Lord) <hi>art with me; thy rodde and thy staffe they comfort me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, this must stirre vs vp to great diligence in praier. We beeing<note place="margin">A moti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e to diligence in praier.</note> Gods creatures, and our God requiring this seruice at our hands, ought to pray vpon his commandement, though he had made no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise vnto vs. But now fith he hath made a gratious promise to heare and grant our requests, this must stirre vs vp to all diligence and alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in prayer: see the practise hereof in Dauid, vpon Gods promise he incourageth himselfe to pray, 2. Sam. 7. 27. 28, 29. <hi>Thou, O Lord of hosts, hast reuealed vnto thy seruant that thou wilt build him an house: Therefore now O Lord God (for thou art God, and thy words are true, &amp; thou hast told this goodnesse vnto thy seruant:) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now let it please thee to blesse the house of thy seruant that it may continue for euer: for thou O Lord God hast spoken it.</hi> So <hi>Daniel</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing by the prophesie of Ieremie, the <hi>promise of God for the returne of the people from the captiultie,</hi> doth set himselfe to most earnest prayer to God, for the accomplishment of that promise, Dan. 9. 2. 3. And so must we doe in all our wants, first search out Gods promise for the supplie thereof, and then goe boldly and diligently to God by prayer in the name of Christ.</p>

                  <hi>The Use.</hi> In this reason we learne, that God is most ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<note place="margin">Gods readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to heare.</note> to heare his children when they pray: Isay, 65. 1. <hi>I was found of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that sought me not, I said behold me, behold me,</hi> to a nation <hi>that called not vpon my name:</hi> and v. 24. <hi>Before they call I will answer, and while they speake I will heare.</hi>

               </epigraph>
               <p>These words containe a second reason of the former commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pray, as also a confinnation of the promise annexed thereunto for assurance to be heard; and it may be framed thus:</p>
               <list type="syllogism">
                  <item>If earthly parents, though they be euill, can giue good gifts to their children, when they want them, and aske them at their hands; then much more will your heauenly father giue good gifts to those that aske him:</item>
                  <item>But earthly parents though they be euill, will giue good gifts to their children:</item>
                  <item>Therefore much more will your heauenly father giue good things to them that aske him.</item>
               </list>
               <p>This reason standeth in a comparison of vnequalls, drawen from the lesse to the greater; from the care which is ordinarily seene in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parents ouer their children, to prooue vndoubtedly the most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care of our heauenly father ouer vs. And this kind of reasoning is vsuall with God in Scripture: Isay 49. 15. <hi>Can a woman forget her child, and not haue compassion on the sonne of her wombe? Though they should forget, yet will not I forget thee.</hi> Psal. 103. 13. <hi>As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that feare him.</hi> Mal. 3. 17.—<hi>and I will spare them as a man spareth his owne sonne that serueth him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the framing of this reason behold a speciall fauour of God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed<note place="margin">A preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> to godly parents: They may take a tast of Gods loue and care ouer themselues by the consideration of that naturall care and tender affection they beare towards their owne childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And indeed they may more easily then other, apprehend and apply to themselues the louing fauour and tender care of God ouer them, by the like affections in themselues towards their owne children. Now this fauour and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God vouchsafeth for speciall cause: first, to incite and stirre vp those parents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which yet haue not tasted of Gods loue, to embrace his word and promises whereby God reueales his loue to men, that so they may tast of Gods loue towards them, whereof they haue so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a patterne in their affection towards their owne children. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to prouoke them to labour to haue their hearts rooted and
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:14013:234"/>
grounded in the loue of God. And thirdly, that they hauing experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods loue in themselues, may bring their children and poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to the fruition of the same loue and mercie.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the comparison: The first part whereof is this, that it is a <hi>naturall propertie in all parents to giue good things vnto their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> This is a principle binding conscience, that parents should be carefull of their children: <hi>He that prouideth not for his owne</hi> (saith <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 8.</note> the Apostle) <hi>especially for them of his familie, is worse then an infidell:</hi> for infidells doe not put out this light of nature, but prouide for their children.</p>
               <p>Here then those parents are to be blamed, who spend their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in gaming and ryote, and so leaue their children and familie<note place="margin">Riotous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued.</note> destitute and in want. These spende vpon their owne lusts those good things which they should bestow vpon their children, and so shew themselues vnnaturall; but the Magistrate, who is the publike father ought to looke vnto them, and to restraine them from such disorder.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here those likewise are to be blamed, which for foode and<note place="margin">Also such as neglect reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> rayment will prouide and giue sufficient to their children: but in the meane while they giue them not godly education, in the <hi>instruction and information of the Lord,</hi> which is a good thing indeede vnto the soule, for which the godly in Scripture are commended: as <hi>Abraham</hi> towards his familie, Gen. 18. 19. and <hi>Lois</hi> and <hi>Eunice</hi> towards Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, 2. Tim. 1. 5. who brought him vp <hi>in faith vnfaigned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, by this we may see, the state of those that kill their owne<note place="margin">Most vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> children, (for so we may read, that some parents haue eaten their owne children) namely, they are such as become vnnaturall, beeing in Gods iust iudgement left vnto themselues to be ruled by the Deuill, who filleth their hearts with this vnnaturall and sauage crueltie. Now Christ speakes here of the light of nature not extinguished, and so it is true euen among the heathen.</p>
               <p>vers. 11. <hi>If ye then which are euill, &amp;c.</hi> Here is the application of the comparison, the ground whereof was laid downe in the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verses. And <hi>by euill,</hi> he meanes not euery sinner, but such as are stained with malice, enuie, and selfe-loue, beeing bent to seeke their owne good onely: for so saith the <hi>Master</hi> to the enuious <hi>labourer,</hi> Matth. 20. 15. <hi>Is thine eye euill, because I am good?</hi> that is, art thou enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous because I am bountifull?</p>
               <p>In these words Christ giues vs to vnderstand, that it is the note of<note place="margin">A note of an euill man to seeke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> an euill man to be giuen wholly to seeke his owne good, though

                  </gap>se of this sinne: for thence come the manifold practises of iniustice, cruelty, and oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that be in the world, hence it is that times of dearth are made more heauie vpon the poore then otherwaies Gods hand hath sent them, because the rich seeke their owne good and commoditie onely at such times, hence come ingrossing, deceiuing, and inclosing to the spoile of the poore. We must therefore beware of this sinnefull practise; and on the otherside giue our selues to practise goodnesse towardes others, setting our selues to the <hi>practise of loue, which seeketh not her owne things, but is bountifull,</hi> that so we may shew forth our loue to God by wel-doing to our brethren; as the Apostle bids vs, Gal. 5. 13. <hi>Doe seruice one to another by loue;</hi> and Phil. 2. 4. <hi>Looke not euery man on his owne things, but euery man also on the things of other men.</hi> This was good King Iosias his practise, for which cause among many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular vertues, all his <hi>goodnesses</hi> are said to be recorded, 2. Chron. 35. 26. And <hi>Saint Paul</hi> likewise <hi>became all things to all men, that he might winne some; and though he were free from all men, yet he made himselfe seruant vnto all men, that he might winne the moe.</hi> 1. Cor. 9. 19.—22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You that are euill can giue good gifts:</hi> that is, <hi>bread, fish,</hi> and such<note place="margin">Euill men may do good things.</note> like, as Luk. 11. 11, 12. Here it is plaine, that an euill <hi>man</hi> may <hi>haue some</hi> kind of vertues in him, whereby he may doe some good works. <hi>Quest.</hi> How can this be, for an euill man wants faith, and so whatsoeuer he doth is sinne? <hi>Answ.</hi> We must know, that the gifts of<note place="margin">Gifts of the spirit two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> the spirit are of two-sorts: some are <hi>common,</hi> whereby the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans nature is onely restrained and limited, for the maintaining of ciuill societies, that man with man may liue in some order and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse: And hence it was that among the heathen, some were iust, some mild, some liberall, &amp;c. All these came from the spirit, yet not renuing the parties, but onely restraining their naturall wickednesse: And of this sort of gifts is the loue and care of parents towards their children, and the loue of children againe towards their parents. And these and such like euill men may haue, for they are not sanctifying vertues, but rather shadowes thereof. The second kinde of the gifts of the spirit are more <hi>speciall gifts and graces,</hi> whereby the corruption of mans nature is mortified and in some part abolished, and the graces of Gods image are renued in man, whereby they become louing, meeke, iust, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, &amp;c. which in the regenerate are true christian vertues, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise hereof is the doing of good works indeede.</p>

Secondly, this giuing is not in essence or person, but in regard of operation and grace; as loue, ioy, peace, &amp;c. in the hearts of Gods children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> What are these good things giuen? <hi>Answ. The holy Ghost. Quest.</hi> Why should the father giue the holy Ghost, and not the holy Ghost as well giue the father, seeing they are equall? <hi>Answ.</hi> The reason is, because of that order which the diuine wisedome manifesteth in the Trinitie; for though all three persons bee equall in all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> properties of the godhead, which is one and the same in them all; yet they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct in order, the father beeing the first person, the sonne not the first, but the second; and the holy Ghost not the first person, nor the second, but the third: and hence it is, that the father giues the sonne, both the father and the sonne giue the holy Ghost; yet not in person, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of gifts and operation, and that by free and equall consent, not from superioritie, or by constraint.</p>

Now though the word <hi>therefore</hi> doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, yet it is not without his vse; for it imports that the doctrine here deliuered is a speciall doctrine, and a maine conclusion inferred vpon diuers particular duties of Iustice before deliuered in the whole Sermon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatsoeuer</hi>] It may seeme that this ought not to be so, for many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and wish euil vnto themselues; as children, that they may haue their wils to take their pleasure, and not be held in subiection vnto their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,

or held to good education: and so idle persons wish euill vnto themselues, for they would not bee set a worke. Wee are therefore to know, that this must not be vnderstood of euil wishes, but of a will and desire wel ordered, either by grace, and according to the written word; or at least, by the light of naturall knowledge, and conscience: so that Christs meaning is this; as if he had said, <hi>Whatsoeuer thing, either by the light of nature, and conscience, or by direction from Gods word, you would wish that men should doe to you, that doe ye vnto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The commaundement thus explaned, containeth two things; I. The thing to be ruled and ordered; namely, <hi>our actions to other men.</hi> II. The rule it selfe that must order all our sayings and doings towards others; to wit, that desire of iustice &amp; equity, which euery man by nature would haue others shew to him in all things.</p>
               <p>In this commaundement our Sauiour Christ would let vs see a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">A propertie of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature.</note> propertie of our corrupt nature; namely, that we are forward and diligent to exact iustice and equitie at other mens hands towards vs, but flacke and backeward to yeeld the same to others againe. In other mens doings towards our selues, wee are masters able to teach them what they ought to doe; but in our owne dealings toward others, wee are scarce schollers that will learne their dutie: we our selues would be reuerenced and commended, but we hardly doe the like to others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here we are taught, to auoyd all practises, whereby wee<note place="margin">We should doe no hurt to ourneigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> might hurt our neighbour, either in body, goods, or good name; as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, slaundering, vsurie, oppression, and such like: this naturall reason might teach vs, for wouldest not thou haue others to defame, hurt, or oppresse thee? then doe not this to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the rule is not, doe as men doe to thee, but <hi>doe to others, as thou wouldest haue them doe to thee:</hi> and it is the corruption of nature, that mooues men to seeke their owne aduantage and preferment, by the losse and debasing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here we learne, that in common iniuries wherein wee are wronged by others, we must not requite like for like; but doe good for euill: we must not looke at that which they doe to vs, but at that which we would they should doe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, henee wee learne, that in matters of commoditie wherea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout<note place="margin">How to deale in bargaining.</note> we deale in the world, we must not only look vnto our selues, but also seeke the good of our neighbours: it is the maner of men to seeke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues only in their affairs, &amp; each man will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:14013:237"/>
to the law of nature, to seeke the common good, and to doe as we would be done vnto.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, this rule of equity cuts the throat of all those pretences, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by<note place="margin">Pretences for badde dealing cut off.</note> bad dealing is smoothed ouer in the world; for ill minded persons vse to colour their doings with these and such like sayings: the gripple seller saith, <hi>The thing is mine, may I not make of mine owne what I can:</hi> the deceiuer saith, <hi>he thrusts his ware on no man:</hi> the vsurer saith, <hi>he bids no man hire his money, but others intreat it of him,</hi> and giue him thanks: but these pretences are nought, these men follow a crooked line, they ought to see in their owne hearts, whether they would haue other men deale so with them: the vsurer may pretend he pleasures the poore, but his helpe is no better then his is, that giues a draught of colde water to him that is in a burning feauer, which seemes pleasant at the first, but after turnes to his great annoyance.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, we would haue all men to shew forth their loue vnto vs, wee<note place="margin">How to get loue.</note> then must be as carefull to shew forth our loue to others, by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of all good duties. This is against our nature, but yet beeing the commaundement of Christ, we must endeauour our selues to obey the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, here we haue direction how to keepe a good conscience, in<note place="margin">How to keep a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> all our dealings with men in the world; for <hi>such things as are expressed in the word, we must follow the direction thereof:</hi> but where wee want a particular commandement, <hi>there we must order our actions by this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule:</hi> enter into thy conscience, and there search <hi>how thou wouldest haue other men deale with thee, and follow that in thy dealings with them:</hi> and so shalt thou keepe a good conscience. For want of this, come so many disorders as are in the world; and therfore happy were our times, if men would doe as they would be done to. Thus much for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, now followes the reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For this is the Law and the Prophets.] The meaning.</hi> By the <hi>Law</hi> we<note place="margin">The reason.</note> must vnderstand the <hi>fiue bookes of Moses,</hi> which were the first Scripture that euer was written<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so Luke the 16. 31. <hi>They haue Moses &amp; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> By the <hi>Prophets,</hi> we must vnderstand, <hi>all the rest of the bookes of the olde testament, besides the fiue bookes of Moses,</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi> beeing put for the <hi>bookes of the Prophets:</hi> as Matth. 2. 23. <hi>It is written the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that he shall be called a Nazarite:</hi> which testimonie is taken out of the booke of Iudges, and it sheweth that the booke of Iudges is to bee numbred among the bookes of the Prophets: and they are called the Prophets, because they were written by some Prophet. And here this commandement touching i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>stice, is called <hi>the law and the Prophets,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:14013:237"/>
it is the summe of the Law and Prophets: yet some may aske how this can bee true, seeing this commaundement onely concernes things to be practised; and the Law and Prophets besides morall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, containe matters of faith to be beleeued? I answer, this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement must be vnderstood to be the summe of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, not for all things, but for that which they prescribe touching this point of iustice and equitie, and the practise hereof. <hi>To doe as wee would be done to,</hi> is the fulfilling of that which is set downe in the Law and in the Prophets, touching equitie in all humane actions. Now the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning beeing thus opened, the reason standeth thus, beeing drawne from diuine testimonie.</p>
               <p>That which is the summe of the Law and of the Prophets touching equitie, must be done.</p>
               <p>But to doe as we would be done to, is the summe of the Law and the Prophets: therefore we must so doe.</p>
               <p>From this reason, we may gather a rule wherby to iudge concerning<note place="margin">How to know the Scripture of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</note> the olde Testament, what is Scripture, and what is not: all Scripture of the olde Testament, is either <hi>the Law,</hi> or <hi>the Prophets;</hi> that is, was either penned by <hi>Moses,</hi> or by <hi>some of the Prophets,</hi> who were extraordinarily mooued and enabled thereunto. And therefore all the bookes from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis to Malachie, are Canonicall Scripture, because they are written by some of the Prophets. To this purpose S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, 2. Pet. 1. 19. <hi>We</hi>

And Chap. 46. 13. that author writeth, that <hi>Samuel</hi> prophesied after his death, and shewed vnto <hi>Saul</hi> his death: but the true storie Canonicall saith, <hi>God had forsaken Saul and would answer him, neither by dreame, nor Vrins, nor by Prophets,</hi> 1. Sam. 28. 6. The booke of Maccabees commendeth one for killing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, which is the most cruell and dangerous murther that can be; and the author also excuseth his insufficiencie in penning of it, which besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not him that is guided by Gods spirit. In the song of the 3. chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren it is said, <hi>the flame ascended</hi> 49. <hi>cubits aboue the furnace;</hi> which seemes incredible, especially that still they should then cast in fuell, or approach so neere, as to put any man into it. Likewise, in the storie of <hi>Susanna,</hi> it is said, vers. 45. that <hi>Daniel</hi> was a young childe when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted iudgement vpon the two false witnesses, which was in the ende of <hi>Astiages</hi> raigne, immediately before the raigne of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> and verse 64. <hi>Daniel</hi> by this meanes is said to growe famous: which cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly accord with the true storie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> neither for his age, nor for his fame and reputation. And the like may be said of the rest; whereby it is plaine, these bookes cannot be canonicall Scripture. And yet they are not to be reiected, but reuerently esteemed of, as the books of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men.</p>
               <p>Here some may say, If <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets comprehend all Scripture that hath diuine testimonie, then the bookes of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament shall not be Scripture, because they were not written by the Prophets? <hi>Answ.</hi> They were either penned by the Apostles, or by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diuine scripture.</note> Apostolike men, and allowed by the Apostles; as Saint <hi>Lukes Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi> and the <hi>Acts,</hi> were written by <hi>Luke</hi> a Physition; and Saint <hi>Marke</hi> that writ that Gospel, was not an Apostle; yet those bookes were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued by Apostolike authoritie, which is all one as if they had beene written by the Apostles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Apostles in speaking and writing were of equall authoritie with the Prophets, hauing the infallible assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the holy Ghost, as well as the Prophets: for Acts 15. 28. they say, <hi>It seemeth good to the holy Ghost, and to vs;</hi> and Ephes. 2. 20. the <hi>Church</hi> is said <hi>to be built on the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles;</hi> where the Apostles are made equall with the Prophets.</p>

before which, there was no word of God written, which was for the space of 2400. yeares.

Some will aske mee, how the people of God did for that space of two thousand and foure hundred yeares, before the Law was written, what guide had they for to knowe the will of God? <hi>Answer.</hi> They had the word of God immediately taught them by word of mouth, from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; as we may see in the Patriarkes, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob:</hi> and they to whom it was deliuered, did also conuaie the same from man to man by tradition. And because it may seeme strange, how religion could for so long time bee preserued pure without writing, wee are to knowe, that before the lawe was written, the Church of God from the beginning, was the most part in one familie onely, as in <hi>Adams, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochs, Noes, Abrahams, &amp;c.</hi> whereby it was a more easie thing to preserue Gods word among them. Againe, those men that first recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the word of God without writing, were of long continuance, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neere to a thousand yeares space, whereby they might better see the word preserued and continued, without writing, by tradition. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, when religion was corrupted, God himselfe restored the puritie thereof, reuealing his will againe, and renewing his couenant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his seruants, as hee did to <hi>Abraham</hi> and the rest of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes.</p>
               <p>Here then behold, how the heads of families preserued Gods word, and true religion, in the beginning of the world; namely, by teaching it to their posteritie: and from them we may learne, what is the dutie, and ought to bee the practise of euery gouernour of a family at this day: they must not thinke themselues discharged, for that the word is written in the Church, and euery man may read and heare the same; but they must see the same bee taught vnto their children, and to the rest of their familie, that so it may bee preserued among them. So God commandeth his people, <hi>to teach their children the seruice of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,</hi> Exod. 12. 26. 27. and <hi>to whet the words of the Law vpon their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> Deut. 6. 7.</p>

                  <hi>III. Point.</hi> In this reason our Sauiour Christ takes for granted, that the writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and of the Prophets are of <hi>infallible certaintie;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Certaintie of Scripture.</note> for it is all one as if he had said, this must needes be euery mans dutie, <hi>to doe as he would be done to,</hi> for <hi>this is the Law and the Prophets:</hi> and so answerable to them, all other bookes of Scripture containe doctrine of infallible truth and certaintie. Here some may aske, how we should be perswaded hereof in our consciences? <hi>Answ.</hi> By these Arguments,<note place="margin">How it may be knowne.</note> which are all drawne from Scripture it selfe, (for as euery Science and Arte hath his grounds and principles, so hath the holy Scripture, which is not the Church, but Scripture it selfe) 1. from the <hi>causes:</hi> 2. from the <hi>effects:</hi> 3. from the <hi>properties:</hi> 4. from <hi>signes:</hi> 5. from the <hi>contraries:</hi> 6. from the <hi>testimonie</hi> that is giuen hereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> 1. <hi>Argument.</hi> Among the <hi>causes,</hi> the first and principall is the<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> from the causes.</note> 
                  <hi>Author</hi> thereof, which is God himselfe, to him doe Scriptures referre themselues, &amp; also shew how God is their Author. In Scripture we read that God spake to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Enoch, Noe, Abraham,</hi> and the rest; and of <hi>Christ,</hi> the new Testament giues most liuely testimony, making him the Author &amp; subiect thereof. Now nothing is falsly ascribed to God, but God in time will bring the same to nought; and therefore if Scripture had not beene Gods word, it would long agone haue vanished. Again, the cause <hi>conuersant</hi> must bee considered; the deuill by wicked men and heretickes hath laboured to take away Gods word from mens hearts and hands: but yet it is still preserued in the Church, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that it is kept by a greater power then is in all men and all angels: that is, by the power of God. Thirdly, the <hi>pen-men,</hi> the instrumentall causes, they were holy men of God, Prophets, and Apostles, who for vertue and pietie farre exceeded other writers: and if they had beene meere polititians, their writings would haue shewed it; for the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of holy Scripture, haue there in faithfully registred their own faults, which no politike person would haue done. Againe, consider the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of holy Scripture, which stands in doctrine, and style; the <hi>doctrine</hi> of Scripture is the Law and the Gospel: now the Law is set forth in most excellent puritie, nothing therein is against right reason, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon equitie. In the lawes of men are many things found against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and equitie; they commaund such things as common reason would condemne, and omitte many things which reason and equitie would commaund. And for the <hi>Gospel,</hi> in it is set downe doctrine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together aboue mans reason; touching Christs incarnation, and mans redemption by his death: and although these things bee aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet wee finde them true, wholesome, and good, in experience of
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:14013:239"/>
conscience; which also prooues that they are the word of God. Men may deuise things aboue nature, but they can neuer be wholesome to the conscience. Further, for the <hi>style</hi> of Scripture, the phrase is plaine &amp; familiar, and yet in any one speech there is more maiestie, then in all the writings of men. Lastly, the <hi>ende</hi> of Scripture prooues the same to bee Gods word; for the Scripture sets vp Gods worshippe and mans saluation, and yet giues nothing to men or Angels, but all to the glorie of God: but for the writings of men, they doe either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, or by insinuation, ascribe some thing to the writers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:14013:241"/>
absolute iudgement in matters of faith and manners; then we must here<note place="margin">What iudge we must choose.</note> learne to make choice of a right Iudge: for vnto one must wee appeale in matters of faith and conscience: and this right Iudge is Gods word, which wee must sticke vnto, and to none other. The commandement is plaine for matters of difficultie that concerne the conscience: Isay 8. 20. <hi>To the law, and to the testimonio:</hi> and our Sauiour Christ referres vs to Scripture for all matters that concerne saluation; Ioh. 5. 39. <hi>Search the Scripture.</hi> If you would know what is true in religion &amp; what is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous; what is equitie in any matter of conscience, wee must haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to Scripture. It will be said, Scripture is an vnfit Iudge, it cannot speake? I answer, It speakes sufficiently to determine of all matters of faith and conscience: wee see in common experience, a man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue his friend in matters of doubt, as well by letter, as by word of mouth; why then may not the word of God sent from heauen vnto his Church, resolue mens consciences in all matters of doubt for faith and manners?

II. That there are two distinct waies to these two cities or kingdomes: one leading to destruction; the other leading vnto life. III. The condition and propertie of these two waies: The way of life is <hi>straite</hi> and <hi>narrow:</hi> The way of destruction is <hi>broad</hi> and <hi>wide,</hi> and that from the beginning to the end.

Now none hath better noted it out vnto vs, then the Prophet Habac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuk, chap. 2. v. 4. in these words, <hi>But the iust shall liue by faith:</hi> in which place he foretells the afflictions of the Iewes by the Chaldeans: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Iewes might say, whereby then shall we stay our selues? he answers, <hi>by faith; The iust man liues,</hi> that is, leadeth his life <hi>by faith.</hi> Some giue this meaning to the Prophet, <hi>The iust by faith shall haue life euerlasting:</hi> but the Apostle expoundeth it otherwise, Gal. 3. 11. So then <hi>to walke in the way of life,</hi> is to lead our liues by faith in Christ: as Heb. 10. 39.</p>
               <p>Here two points must be considered: I. what <hi>faith</hi> that is by which men must liue in this world; namely, <hi>true iustifying faith,</hi> the very same by which they are to be saued in the day of the Lord. <hi>I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> liue by faith</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>in the sonne of God, who hath loued me, and giuen himselfe for me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. where he doth notably expound this text, shewing, that faith in Christ our redeemer, is that faith whereby we must lead our liues in this world: for they which will be saued by their faith, must first liue by their faith: he that beleeues well, liues well: and that faith will neuer saue the soule, that cannot guide and order the life: many men thinke it is sufficient to saluation to beleeue the promise of life: but faith hath a further worke in them that it saueth; for it also causeth them to liue thereby. Now a man liues by faith, when he rests himselfe on God, and suffers himselfe wholly to be lead and guided by Gods written word. Example hereof we haue in <hi>Abraham,</hi> Heb. 11. 8. <hi>who by faith for sooke his owne countrey, and at Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement went be knew not whither.</hi> More particularly; a Christian mans life is twofold: spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,<note place="margin">A Christians life is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> and temporall: both which he must liue in this world, for heauenly life beginnes before we die: and both these kinds of life must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by faith. The <hi>spirituall life</hi> of a Christian, is that whereby he<note place="margin">1. Spirituall.</note> hath true fellowshippe with God: this beginnes in this life; and it stands in reconciliation with God, wherein a man is accepted to the right of eternall life. This reconciliation is life, and it is held by faith:
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:14013:245"/>
and faith onely in Gods word and promise in Christ alone is it that makes vs lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>old of, receiue, and keepe this our reconcillation. We must giue God this honour to beleeue his promise of remission of sinnes, and life euerlasting in Christ; and vpon our faith God vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth vnto vs remission of sinnes, and life euerlasting. Here some may aske whether euery thing that we beleeue be made ours, as riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and such like? <hi>Ans.</hi> No: but onely that which God promiseth in the Euangelical couenant of life euerlasting, vpon our faith. Here also some will say, If this be all, I am well, for I beleeue Gods promise. But herein many deceiue themselues, beleeuing the promise falsly. True faith is this; men must seeke the pardon of their sinnes, and in seeking beleeue it: but they that beleeue without vsing the meanes deceiue themselues, seeing God hath ioyned his promise to the meanes. We offend God daily, and therefore must daily re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ue our repentance, and by faith beleeue the pardon of our daily sinnes.</p>
               <p>Further, this spirituall life hath his fruits. It is no dead life, for he<note place="margin">Fruits of spirituall life.</note> that hath remission of sinnes liues in Christ, and this life shewes it selfe in the fruits of good workes: as mercie, loue, goodnes: and in euery good worke we must liue by faith, for to the doing of any good worke there is a double faith required: first, a <hi>generall faith,</hi> whereby we are perswaded that the worke is allowed and required of God: secondly, a <hi>speciall faith,</hi> whereby we are perswaded that the particular worke done is accepted of God. In the acceptation of the worker, God first accepteth the person in Christ, and then the worke in and for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Yea, we are mooued to euery good worke by faith, for it brings to minde Gods loue, mercie, and goodnes to vs: and so mooueth vs to performe the like duties of loue and mercie towards our brethren.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, spirituall life shewes it selfe in resisting and enduring temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:<note place="margin">Spiritual life is seene in temptation.</note> for euery child of God hath many and gricuous assaults, so as the righteous shall scarce be saued: and in all and euery one of these, we must liue by faith, and thereby relie on Christ, not on our selues. Example hereof we haue in Christ vpon the crosse, who euen then when he felt the wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In disputations in schooles it is a fault to sticke alwaies to the conclusion: yet in this combate with Satan it is no
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:14013:245"/>
fault, but a good practise of true faith.</p>
               <p>Temporall life stands in the practise of some particular calling:<note place="margin">How tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life is lead by faith.</note> and some men be of one calling, some of another: and euery one hath or ought to haue some one lawfull calling or other wherein to leade his temporall life. Now the workes of a mans particular calling they must be practised by faith, euen the duties of the bas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st calling that is, as of the shepheard. And that a man may doe the duties of his calling in faith, he must first haue a grounded conscience that his worke is allowed of God, and accordingly he must doe his worke. Againe, euery man in his calling must haue a care of his owne life and of those that belong vnto him, to prouide for them things necessarie, as meate, drinke, and cloathing; and this care must be ruled by faith, that is, a man must vse the lawfull meanes to get these things, and yet so as he leaue the issue and euent vnto Gods blessing: we may prouide for necessaries, but we must goe no further but vse the lawfull ordinarie meanes, and sanctifie them by prayer, leauing the blessing vnto God. <hi>Cast thy workes on God,</hi> saith Salomon, Prou. 16. 3. and S. Peter bids vs <hi>cast all our care on God,</hi> 1. Peter 5. 7. Lastly, euery calling hath his crosses: no life is so quiet that it wanteth all vexations. Now when crosses come vpon any man in his calling, then must he beare the same by faith: he must rest on Gods word, and quiet his mind with the good will and pleasure of God. <hi>He that beleeues</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>shall not make hast,</hi> Isay 28. 16. that is, he shall not be caried headlong with a desire to satisfie his owne pleasure and appetite either in seeking to be freed from euill, or to enioy some blessing, but shall content himselfe with the good pleasure of God. And thus we see what it is to liue by saith, which is the right way to life eternall.</p>

               <p>The first is a necessarie dutie in these times: for we are like vnto<note place="margin">I.

We must see what things we are to beleeue and doe, <hi>hauing the mysterie of faith in a good conscience,</hi> 1. Tim. 3. 9. Thirdly, we must walke in this way, Ier. 6. 16. for it is not<note place="margin">3</note> sufficient to know the will of God, and to make profession of religion, but we must put in practise the things which we know. And lastly, we must be circumspect to keepe our selues in the right way.

heart which nature desireth in all of vs; but we must restraine our selues thereof, and bring our mindes, our thoughts, affections, our wills, speeches, and actions into the straites of the word of God. This restraint of our naturall desire is two-fold: by the law, and by the Gospel. In the Law euery commandement ministreth his particular restraint, as we shall see in their order.</p>
               <p>The first Commandement concernes <hi>the hauing of the true God for</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How the law restraines our naturall desires. 1. Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> 
                  <hi>our God.</hi> By nature we take libertie to our selues to conceiue of God at our owne pleasure: for commonly men conceiue of God out of the Trimtie, and worship the persons, one out of another: the Iew, the Turke, and all the heathen will not be restrayned of this libertie: but the people of God who submit themselues to his word, they by this law are restrained of this naturall desire, and are taught to choose and haue to themselues the true God for their God; and to conceiue aright of this God; namely, that he is one in essence and three in person, and that the persons must be worshipped in the vnitie of the godhead: for as they are one in nature, so we must vnite them in one and the same worship. Againe, by nature we take libertie to our selues to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the true God, and in our owne hearts doe set vp a false god vnto our selues: some make riches their God, some honours, some pleasures: for looke whereon a man bestowes his heart and his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as his loue, his feare, and confidence, that he makes his god: and hence it comes that some in iudgement hold the true God, and yet haue a false god vnto themselues in their hearts: but the first comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement restrains vs of this libertie also: and it inioynes vs to bestow our whole heart, and all our affections on the true God: louing, fearing, and trusting in him aboue all. Thirdly, our nature is to exalt our selues, &amp; to ascribe some thing vnto our selues, esteeming the good things that be in vs, as of our selues; and as though they were our owne: whereby we take to our selues some thing that is proper to God, becomming like to the prodigall child which would haue his portion to himselfe seuered from his father. With this naturall pride was Dauid puffed vp, when he numbred the people. But the first commandement restraines vs of this also, perscribing vnto vs the dutie of inward adoration; which we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, first, when we giue vnto him all the honour that we can, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our selues but dust and ashes, and ascribing vnto him all the good that is in vs, as from him: secondly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we subiect our selues vnto him wholly as to our creatour, and doe submit our hearts, wills, and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his holy word: and these be the strait waies which this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement perscribes vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:14013:248"/>The 2. commaundement concernes Gods <hi>outward worship:</hi> and it<note place="margin">Restraints in the 2. Com.</note> puts vnto vs many restraints. Our nature desires to conceiue of God in some forme, and to represent him in some image; but the Lord is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and this commandement inioynes vs to worship him <hi>in spirit and truth,</hi> and to conceiue of him in his workes and properties, restraining our naturall desires of conceiuing and representing God. Secondly, it is our nature to performe outward worship vnto God onely, but for any further thing wee would take libertie to our selues; wee would giue him onely the outward bodily worship, as come to Church, heare the word, pray outwardly, and receiue the Sacraments: but the Lord in this commandement giues vs charge, that with as great care &amp; conscience, we should giue vnto him the inward worship of the heart; for god must be serued with the whole man, our loue, &amp; feare, &amp; trust in God, must be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to our outward worship. Further, euery man almost can be content to professe religion, and to performe so much as the laws of his countrie require for the seruice of God; but yet they would take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie in their callings, to liue as they list: but Gods commandement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straines this desire also. We must hold religion not only in the Church, but also shew the same in our liues and conuersations; and therefore is the second table ioyned with the first, to teach vs that wee must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme dutie to God in the seruice of man.</p>
               <p>The third commandement concernes <hi>the holy vse of the holy things</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Restraints in the 3. Com.</note> 
                  <hi>of God,</hi> especially of his word and Sacraments. Now for the outward worke of hearing the word, and receiuing the Sacraments, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to performe them; but we would haue God thinke himselfe satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the worke done. But this commandement restrains vs of this desire, inioyning vs not onely to vse his holy things, but also in an holy manner; that is, with repenting &amp; beleeuing hearts: for they are not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vs, vnlesse we vse them in and by faith and repentance. Againe, we take libertie to vse Gods name in oathes, and specially in vowes, as in baptisme, which we renue when we come to the Lords table: but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ordinarily abuse this his holy name, not hauing like care to make good our vowes vnto God, as we haue to make them.</p>
               <p>The 4. commandement concernes the <hi>time of Gods worship:</hi> wee our<note place="margin">Restraints in the 4. Com.</note> selues would haue all times in our owne disposing, &amp; we thinke it hard to be restrained of any time; but this commandement restraines vs of this desire, binding vs in conscience to giue one day in seauen to the honour of God in his publike and solemne worship.</p>
               <p>The 5. Comm, concernes the <hi>giuing of honour and reuerence to Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Restraints in the 5. Com.</note> and it restraines vs of our naturall desire, which is to seeke for, and

to take honour vnto our selues alone; for this inioyneth vs to giue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour one to another, especially to them to whome it belongs, as to all superiours in authoritie, in gifts or age: let this be your honour, saith <hi>Paul, to giue honour to whome it belongs,</hi> Rom. 13. 7.</p>
               <p>The sixt Commandement concerneth <hi>murther;</hi> and it restraineth our<note place="margin">Restraints in the 6.</note> naturall desire, which is, vpon small occasion to conceiue malice and to beare grudging against our brother, forbidding all thoughts, wordes, deedes, and gestures, which tend to the impairing or destroying of our neighbours life and person.</p>
               <p>The 7. Commandement concerneth <hi>chastitie:</hi> and it restraines mans<note place="margin">Restraints in the 7.</note> nature, which desires to take libertie in vncleannes and fornication both of heart and life: and it binds vs to abstaine from all speach, action, or gesture, which tends to the hindrance of our owne, or of our neighbors chastitie: for God is holy and pure, and so ought our bodies and minds to be, which are temples of his blessed spirit.</p>
               <p>The 8. Commandement concernes our <hi>neighbours goods:</hi> and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straines<note place="margin">Restraints in the 8.</note> our corrupt nature, which desires to haue libertie by all meanes good and bad to intich our selues. And it inioyneth vs both in will and word, and in trafficke also, to seeke the common good, and the good of those with whome we liue. Againe, this also restraines our naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of abundance, inioyning vs to seeke onely for necessaries, as foode and raiment: for we may not seeke to be rich, yet if God giue vs more then things necessary in the labours of our calling, then we are to blesse God for them, and to vse them to his glorie: this is a strait way to the worldly man, but it must stand, and we must walke in it, if we would enter into life.</p>
               <p>The 9. Commandement concernes our neighbours <hi>good name:</hi> and<note place="margin">Restraints in the 9.</note> it restraines vs of our naturall desire, which is to conceiue and speake vnto others, as also to receiue from others, euill report of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: and on the contrarie it inioynes vs, by all good meanes to seeke to preserue our neighbours good name and credit.</p>
               <p>The 10. Commandement is touching <hi>lust.</hi> When as we hurt no man in word or deede, then we take it for graunted, that we may thinke<note place="margin">Restraints in the 10.</note> what we will, no lawes restraine thought; that we hold to be free. But this Commandement restraines the very first motions of our hearts, which tende to hurt our brothers life, chastitie, goods, or good name, though they nouer come into practise, yea though we neuer giue consent of will thereto. And these are the restraints of the Law, whereto we must conforme our selues, if we would enter into life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="487" facs="tcp:14013:249"/>Now follow the restraints of the Gospel, which is a part of Gods word touching remission of sinnes and saluation. By nature we desire<note place="margin">Restraints of man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> Againe, it is our nature not to looke to be saued by any thing out of our selues; if we haue nothing els, our good meaning and good hope must saue vs: but the Gospel restraines vs of these desires, and enioyneth vs to renounce our selues in the matter of saluation, and all that is in vs: and to depend on a righteousnes out of our selues in the person of Christ, which is his obedience and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Againe, we naturally desire to enioy Gods mercie by sense and feeling; but the Gospel restraines vs of this kind of assurance, which comes by sense and feeling, and enioynes vs to hold and keepe Gods mercie by beleeuing onely, both in life and death, though we haue no sense thereof at all.</p>
               <p>Further, the Gospel renues the law for the manner of louing: for the morall law required that we should loue another as we doe our selues, but the Gospel requires vs to loue one another as Christ loued vs; which is a greater measure of loue then the law required. For Christ loued vs more then himselfe: for he gaue himselfe for vs: and so ought we to loue euen our enemies. And thus we see how the Gospel also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straines vs from following our owne naturall desires, and inioyneth vs to walke in the narrow way to life: whereto, as also to the restraints of the law, we must applie our selues, our thoughts, words, and deeds: so doing we walke in the straite way that leadeth vnto life: but if we any way exempt our selues according to our naturall desire from any of these restraints, we then walke in the broad way that leadeth to destruction.</p>

First, they say, <hi>God is mercifull,</hi> and therefore they will relie thereon, and take no further care for their soules. <hi>Answ.</hi> God indeede is mercifull: but his mercie is onely found of them that striue to enter in at the straite gate; as for those that walke in the broad way it belongs not to them: Deutr. 29. 19, 20. And <hi>if the righteous scarsely be saued, where shall the vngodly appeare,</hi> 1. Pet. 4. 18. Secondly, they say, at least in heart,<note place="margin">2. Excuse.</note> that it is the easiest matter in the world to come by life euerlasting: if they can call on God when they are dying, all is well: and therefore they will not lende their outward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ares to heare, nor apply their minds to conceiue and learne that which they may doe by nature: and if they doe come to the congregation, yet it is for custome, or for feare of punishment, not for conscience. But these men deceiue themselues, they consider not what Peter saith, <hi>that the righteous shall hardly be saued:</hi> and what S. <hi>Luke</hi> addeth to this exhortation of Christ, that <hi>many shall seeke to enter into the doore of life, and shal not be able;</hi> because they neglected the time of grace and vsed not good meanes in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Thirdly, they make this common obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that either they are elect<note place="margin">3. Excus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

neuer so religiously, yet they shall bee condemned: and many deceiue themselues with this reason. But they must know, that they iudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse of Gods decree; and the wickednesse of this reason may appeare by the like: God hath decreed the certaine tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e of euery mans life in this world, as well as his future estate after this life. Now if any man hereupon should reason thus; If God haue decreed that I shall liue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then I shall surely liue: if hee haue decreed that I shall liue no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then I shall surely die, for Gods decree must stand; and therefore I will neither eate, nor drinke, nor sleepe, nor vse meanes to preserue my life: if any should thus doe vpon this ground, would not all men iudge him to be a murtherer of himselfe? And surely, he is no lesse a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of his soule, that vpon Gods predestination, will take occasion of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, to liue as he list; for Gods decree of the ende, includes the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie meanes that bring thereto. Againe, they are to know, that there is a double will of God; his reuealed will made knowne in his word; and his secret or vnreuealed wil, whereby he hath determined with himselfe what shall be the eternall estate of euery person, which is not knowne to vs ordinarily, but by the euent. The reuealed will of God must bee the rule of our obedience, and according to it must we frame &amp; square our liues; but his secret will we must honour and reuerence, not making any rules from it, whereby to frame our liues. Now these persons they leaue the written word, and betake themselues to his vnreuealed will, and out of it will make rules how they will liue; but herein they sinne greatly, in framing to themselues new rules, leauing his word, whereby they should order and guide their liues. Thirdly, I answer, that this reason hath in it a plaine falshood; for they that are predestinate to life, are chosen to liue a godly life, in faith, repentance, and obedience, <hi>that they might be like to the image of his sonne,</hi> Rom. 8. 29. And indeede, it is impossible that he which liues in wickednesse all his life long, and so dies, should bee saued; as also that he which liues a godly life vnto the end, should be condemned: for God hath decreed the meanes, as wel as the ende.</p>

Secondly, besides the holding of some damnable errour in his owne heart, a false Prophet must also be a seducer, such a one as labours to make a faction, withdrawing men from true religion, and from true faith, and perswading them both in priuate and publikely, to receiue his errour.

So wee at the first did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly receiue the Gospel of Christ; but now many waxe wearie with it, and beginne to like of Popish doctrine, preferring their corrupt writers, before those that haue beene the restorers of true religion vnto vs.</p>

This is the principal point which Christ here aimes at, and therefore we must carefully learne it: and for this purpose let vs remember these particular directions which follow. First, that God<note place="margin">Directions to maintaine the truth.</note> hauing restored vnto vs true religion, doth require we should loue it as the chiefest treasure that euer this kingdome enioyed. Wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> could not abide <note n="a" place="margin">1. Ki. 21, 20</note> 
                  <hi>Elias</hi> and <note n="b" place="margin">Cha. 22. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Michaiah</hi> Gods true Prophets, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them; for which cause God left him to himselfe, and suffered him to be seduced by foure hundred false Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> and thereby brought him to destruction. And the Apostle speaking of the kingdom of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> saith, that <hi>God therein giues men vp to strong illusions that they should beleeue lies, because they haue not loued the truth,</hi> 1. Thes. 2. 10. 11. Now this loue we must shewe by our obedience in duties of pietie to God, and in the exercise of iustice and mercy towards our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:14013:253"/>
else God will translate his Gospel from vs, and giue it to a nation that wil bring forth the fruits thereof.</p>
               <p>A second rule to be obserued for the maintaining of true religion is<note place="margin">2. Rule. Restorers of religion ought to be had in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</note> this; that ministers especially, and those that intend that calling, should highly esteeme and reuerently account of those men and their writings, which by Gods mercie haue beene the meanes to restore vnto vs pure religion; for though they were men subiect to error, and in some things might slippe, yet they were the worthy instruments of Gods mercy, for the planting of his Gospel among vs, which since their time hath beene sealed with the blood of many Martyrs, in England, Germanie, and else-where: in which regard, though we must onely depend on the pure word of God for certaintie of truth, yet we are to giue much vnto them, and be followers of them, for the substance of religion, wherein they doe most soundly consent in one truth. This I note, because they beginne to be in disgrace with many, and corrupt Popish writers are farre better accounted of.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if any among vs doubt of any point in religion, let him doe<note place="margin">3. Rule.

But if there bee any false Prophet at this day, it is the Papist, and their writings are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to be read of those that are not well grounded in the truth; for by reading we haue a kind of familiaritie with them, and indeede many sucke out of them at vnawares, much venim in waighty points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and religion.

Cor. 11. 18.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The second point. The danger of false Prophets: They come in sheeps</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Danger of false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</note> 
                  <hi>cloathing, but inwardly they are rauening wolues.</hi> In these words Christ alludeth to the practise of false Prophets in former times, who counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the true Prophets in their attire; for the auncient Prophets were vsually cloathed in rough and course attire: <hi>Elias</hi> in regard of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is called <hi>an hairie man,</hi> 2. Kin. 1. 8. and <hi>Iohn Baptist had his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Camels haire,</hi> Math. 3. 4. And the false Prophets did counterfeit the true Prophets in their attire, for this ende; that they might the more easily deceiue the people; as is most plaine, Zak. 13. 4. where the Lord saith of false Prophets, <hi>that they shall not weare a rough garment to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue:</hi> for when they wore such course attire, made either of sheep skins, or sheeps wooll, wherewith the true Prophets were vsually cloathed, they sought hereby to perswade the people, that they had the hearts of the true Prophets; when as indeede they were ful fraught with da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable errors. Now Christs meaning in this allusion, is to shew that false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets haue plausible pretences for their da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable doctrine, and therfore are the more da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous. Yet that we may the better perceiue the danger<note place="margin">7. Pretences of false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets 1. Allegation of scripture.</note> of false Prophets, I will a little stand to describe their <hi>cloathing;</hi> that is, their pretences of deceit. They may be reduced to 7. heads: the first is <hi>allegation of Scripture,</hi> which they will as often vse as the true Prophet; &amp; hereby they blind the eies of many. But the truth is, that in alleaging Scripture, they depraue &amp; change the sense, &amp; either adde to, or detract from the words, following rightly their master Satan, Mat. 4. 6. who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged Scripture to Christ, but left out the principal point whereto the promise was made; namely, walking <hi>in thy waies.</hi> And thus deale the Papists as this day, sometimes they mangle the text, &amp; alter the sense, sometime they leaue the Scripture and go to traditions, to Councels, &amp; Fathers. This also is the practise of the family of loue, &amp; of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, who turne the naturall sense of scripture into mysticall allegories.</p>
               <p>The second cloake or pretence, is <hi>the depth of their learning.</hi> Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.<note place="margin">2.

               <p>This verse, &amp; those which follow to the 21. containe the third point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Christ laieth down concerning false prophets; namely, the means whereby we may discerne and iudge of them. And herein he obserueth this order; First, he giues vs a notable rule to direct vs in iudging of false prophets, <hi>Ye shall know them by their fruits.</hi> Secondly, hee explanes the same rule by a similitude drawne from trees, <hi>Doe men gather grapes of thornes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the rule, that we may vnderstand it the better, wee are to search what is meant by the fruits of false Prophets. A false Prophet must bee considered two waies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First, as he is a man taking vpon him the name &amp; profession of Christ, for so false Prophets vse to do: and secondly, as he is a false prophet: in both these respects hee hath his fruits. As he is a man taking vpon him the profession of Christs religion, hee may bring forth many outward duties of external obedience vnto the moral law; but these fruits are not here meant, for a false Prophet may dissemble much, &amp; goe farre in the outward duties of religion, so as he cannot be discerned by his generall profession, or by the works of his ciuil conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There be other fruits which come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him as he is a false prophet; &amp; by them must he be discerned: these therefore are to be considered.

                  </gap> he is a man of God appointed to teach Gods people.</p>
               <p>The fruits of a true Prophet be principally three: I. He teacheth<note place="margin">Fruits of a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</note> and preacheth in the name of God by vertue of calling from God, and otherwise dares not presume to teach: Rom. 10. 14. <hi>How shall he teach vnlesse he be sent:</hi> and the author to the Hebrewes saith, <hi>Christ tooke not the honour of beeing the high Priest and Prophet of the Church to himselfe: but was called thereto by his father,</hi> Heb. 5. 5. And this stands with reason, for euery true Prophet and teacher stands in Gods roome, and is Gods embassadour to deliuer his will to his people; which thing none can doe but he whome God calleth and sendeth for that purpose. Yet the calling of Prophets and teachers by God is diuers. Some are<note place="margin">God calleth Prophets di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly.</note> called by voice from God immediatly, as were <hi>Abraham, Moses,</hi> and <hi>Samuel:</hi> and all the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the new Testament by the immediate voice of Christ: for <hi>Paul</hi> was called by the voice of Christ from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, Act. 9. 4, 5, 6. Againe, others haue their calling from God, by the speciall message of some Angel, or some men. Thus was <hi>Aaron called by Moses; Elisha by Elias;</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> by an Angel to preach to the Eunuch, Act. 8. 26. Thirdly, others be called by the instinct and motion of Gods spirit: so, Act. 8. <hi>Philip</hi> was by ordinarie calling a Deacon, but by extraordinarie instinct he became an Euangelist, and a preacher of the Gospel for the building of Gods Church. These three kinds of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling men into the ministerie were extraordinarie, and are now ceased, and not to be looked for: neither are they to be regarded which say they are thus called at this day. A fourth way whereby God now calleth Prophets and teachers into his Church, is by his Church: for God hath giuen to particular Churches, a particular ministeriall power and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice whereby they may designe a place vnto the teacher, and also make manifest that God hath called him. Now this authoritie is but ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, to designe and manifest whome God hath called, for the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall calling is from God: for Act. 20. 28. the Elders of the Church of Ephesus, are said to be <hi>made ouerseers by the holy Ghost:</hi> when as they were designed thereto by men. And by one of these foure waies are all true Prophets and Teachers called.</p>
               <p>Here some may demaund, what kind of calling had they, who were<note place="margin">How the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storers of religion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Poperie were called.</note> the first restorers of true religion vnto vs in this our age, for they were by profession either Popish Priests, or Schoole doctors. I answer: their calling was partly ordinarie, and partly extraordinatie: for in the ministerie of a Prophet there be two things; his office, and the vsing or exercise of his office. Our first ministers that restored the truth vnto vs, had but an ordinarie office, beeing either Readers in
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:14013:257"/>
Schooles, or publike preachers: also they had their outward calling thereto, from the church of Rome, so as if there bee any part of good calling in that Church, then was their calling good; which may serue to stop the mouthes of all Papists, that carpe at our Church, as though our ministers had no calling. But for the vsing of their office, they were extraordinarily raised and stirred vp to doe that which they did, in regard of the manifolde abuses wherewith the ministerie of the Church was generally corrupted in their time: for God gaue vnto them grace and knowledge to discerne to teach, and to maintaine the right and true vse of the ministerie. And that they were thus extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily stirred vp by God, may appeare by the extraordinarie gifts and graces where with they were endued; for God that hath alwaies a care ouer his Church, when he saw the same so fearefully corrupted by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> did stirre vp these men to reforme the same: and besides their singular gifts of knowledge and wisdome, he gaue them extraordinary graces of true pietie, whereby they were inabled to seale and confirme with their own blood, the truth of that doctrine which they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse &amp; teach, which was an euident argument they were called of God.</p>
               <p>Now opposite to this, wee must make the first note of a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;<note place="margin">1. Not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And by this marke are false Prophets noted, Ier. 14. 14. <hi>I haue not sent them, neither did I commaund them—yet they prophecie in my name.</hi> And no lesse do these words of Christ import, when he saith here, <hi>they come vnto you,</hi> that is, of themselues, without a calling from God, though they pretend a calling, which is one of their cloakes: and therefore by Saint <hi>Iude,</hi> vers. 4. they are said to <hi>creepe into the Church:</hi> as also Acts, 20. 29. grieuous wolues shall enter in among you, without calling from God, or from the Church.</p>
               <p>Here some may aske, how shal we iudge of such, and know that they<note place="margin">2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Note of a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</note> haue no calling. <hi>Answ.</hi> For this purpose, I adde a second note of a true Prophet, which is the most principal, &amp; it standeth in the right &amp; whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling of the Scriptures of God.

both in sound iudgement, and Christian life.</p>
               <p>On the contrarie, the second fruit of a false Prophet is, to deliuer and<note place="margin">2. Note of a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</note> maintaine corrupt doctrine, contrarie to the wholesome doctrine of holy Scripture: and by this principally hee is to be knowne for a false Prophet, that intrudeth himselfe. For the better conceiuing of this note, we must know, that in the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, there are two things principally to be considered; the scope, &amp; the parts thereof: the scope of all their doctrine tendes to maintain Christ Iesus God &amp; man, the alone perfect Sauiour of the Church. And indeede, he which teacheth any doctrine tending to ouerthrow Christ, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his natures, or of his offices, the same is a false Prophet: 1. Ioh. 4. 3. <hi>Euery spirit that confesseth not that Iesus is come in the flesh, is not of God.</hi> The parts of Propheticall &amp; Apostolike doctrine, are the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of the Law, and the promises of the Gospel, &amp; he which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes, either directly, or by iust consequent, any comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of the the Law, or article of faith, must needes bee a false Prophet: so that a false Prophet must be tried by the analogie of faith, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prised in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Apostles Creed, and in the Decalogue which containes the summe of all the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles; and he which goeth against them, is a false Prophet.</p>
               <p>The 3. fruit of a true Prophet, is noted by our Sauiour Christ, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">3 Note of a true prophet &amp; of a false.</note> in his ministery <hi>to seeke Gods glory,</hi> Ioh. 7. 18.

               <p>2. <hi>Vse.</hi> Here also we haue to answer such among our selues, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce<note place="margin">Our church defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Brownists.</note> our Church, as beeing no true Church of Christ; because say they, we want true ministers, and so haue not a right ministerie among vs. But hence we answer, that we haue the true Church of God, and our ministers be the true ministers of God; for proofe hereof, our ministers haue the outward calling of the Church of England: they say indeede, our calling is nought, because they haue power from God to call, in whose hands it is. But to omit that question for this time, sufficient ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of our ministery may be had from the fruits of our ministers, as they are ministers; for to leaue the fruits of their liues, as sufficient meanes to iudge them by, our ministers teach through Gods blessing; the true and wholesome doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, and are alloued and called hereto by the gouernours of the Church, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of their people, whose obedience to the faith is the seale of their ministery: and this is sufficient to confirme the calling of our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; if it had not, Christ would not haue said, <hi>Ye shal know them by their fruits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Use.</hi> Whereas Christ saith, <hi>Ye shall know them,</hi> speaking to all his<note place="margin">The people ought to bee able to iudge of teachers.</note> hearers, he takes it for graunted, that euery beleeuer may bee able to iudge of false Prophets: and therefore euery one in the Church of God ought to labour for so much knowledge, whereby hee may bee able to knowe a Teacher by his fruits and doctrine. This then sheweth, that euery one ought to know the summe of true religion, comprised in the Articles of faith, and in the commandements of the Law, both for their true meaning, and right and profitable vse vnto themselues: which thing I note, because I know many deceiue themselues herein, thinking that God will excuse them for their want of knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not booke-learned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But let vs consider, wee haue euery one this care, to be able to iudge of meates which concerne our bodies, which be wholesome, and which not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should wee not then haue much more care of our soules, to be able to discerne of doctrines in religion, which be either the poison, or saluation of our soules.</p>

Againe, consider that the vertue and efficacie of the word and Sacraments administred by men, is not from the minister, but from God: a letter is not the worse because it is brought by an vnhonest or vnfaithfull carier. Neither doth the euill conscience of the minister, defile the good conscience of the honest hearer, and worthie receiuer. This must be remembred, because many take offence at the life of the minister, so as they will not heare his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, if his conuersation be scandalous.</p>
               <p>V. In that a Prophet is to be knowne by his fruits, and the maine<note place="margin">The maine dutie of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie.</note> fruit of a true Prophet stands in the good handling of Gods word for the edification and saluation of his hearers; hence the children of the Prophets, and those that are set a part for the ministerie of the word are taught, that they must make this the maine and principall ende of all their studies, to be able to bring forth the fruits of a true Prophet: that is, to interpret <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ight the word of God, and thence to gather out wholesome doctrines and vses for the edification of Gods people. And for the inforcing of this dutie let vs consider, first, that it is Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement so to doe: 1. Cor. 14. 1. <hi>Seeke for spirituall gifts, but speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to prophesie.</hi> Againe, the greatest skill of a Prophet stands in the true expounding and right diuiding of Scripture, so as it may become food for mens soules. 2. Tim. 2. 15. <hi>Show thy selfe a workeman that needeth not to be ashamed, in diuiding the word of truth aright.</hi> And lastly, this true fruit of a minister serues to build vp Christs kingdome, to beate downe the kingdome of sinne, and to feede the soules of men with the foode of euerlasting life. It will be said, this course is good among the common people; but this is not the learning which is required in the handling of the word in the schooles of the Prophets. I <hi>answer,</hi> It is the greatest learning that can be in a minister to be able thus to diuide the word of God aright: it goes beyond the gift of tongues and of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. 1. Cor. 24. 1, 2. I de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="507" facs="tcp:14013:259"/>
discourse vpon the same: But yet the worke of a Prophet stands rather in expounding Scripture by Scripture, and in diuiding the same aright, giuing thereout wholesome doctrine for the edifying of the people of God that heare. In former times when the studie of Scripture was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, men betooke themselues to expound the writings of men, and so prophesie was banished, and all sound knowledge in the truth of God: and hence arose diuersitie of opinions, and multitudes of foolish questions. And so will it be with vs if prophesie faile: for to leaue the right handling of Scripture is the way to bring in all errour and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme in religion.</p>
               <p>VI. Euery minister of the Gospel is hereby taught, that he ought<note place="margin">What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.</note> to be answerable to his calling, walking worthie of the same; for a good minister is knowen by his good fruites, and therefore he must be faithfull in performing all those duties which his calling doth binde him vnto. The titles and calling of a minister be high and excellent, but yet they will not commend any man for good vnles he bring forth the friuts of a minister in the faithfull discharge of his ministeriall duties.</p>
               <p>Lastly, hence we must learne, not to take offence though the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster failes in his life and conuersation, yea though there be contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the ministerie about matters of Doctrine: for these are not the friuts of the ministerie which is Gods ordinance, but of sinnefull men who bewray their imperfections in this holy calling.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Rule. Now followes the proofe and explication thereof, by a comparison drawen from nature, in these wordes, vers. 16. <hi>Doe men gather grapes of thornes or figges of thistles:</hi> vers. 17. <hi>So euery good tree bringeth forth good fruit, &amp; a corrupt tree bringeth forth euill fruit.</hi> vers. 18. <hi>A good tree cannot, &amp;c.</hi> The comparison standeth thus, <hi>As a tree is knowen of euery one by his fruit, so is a Prophet by his teaching.</hi> More particularly, <hi>As a good tree brings forth good fruit, and cannot bring forth euill fruit: and as an euill tree brings forth euill fruit, and cannot bring forth good fruit:</hi> euen so <hi>a true Prophet teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wholsome doctrine, and cannot teach false doctrine: and a false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet teacheth false doctrine, and cannot teach true doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching this similitude: first, obserue in generall from the ground of this comparison, that our Sauiour Christ here makes two kind of trees: a good tree, and an euill tree: by <hi>an euill tree</hi> meaning that which in regard of any fruit is as a rotten tree, as is the briar, the thorne, and thistle: for though they liue and growe, yet they are void of good fruit, and so are called euill. Now here it may well be demaunded,
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:14013:260"/>
whence this difference of trees doth come, for all were good by creation, Gen. 1. 31. <hi>God saw all that he had made, and lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ces becom euill.</note> 
                  <hi>good. Answ.</hi> Whether thornes or thistles were created of God I will not now dispute: it is not certen that they were: but now it is playne there remaines this difference among plants; <hi>some are good: some are bad:</hi> the goodnesse that is in some comes from Gods blessing: but the badnesse and barrennesse of others comes from the curse of God vpon the earth and vpon all creatures for the sinne of our first parents, as we may see, Gen. 3. 17. 18. <hi>The earth is cursed for thy sake: thornes also and thistles shall it bring forth vnto thee.</hi> And by this we may see the grieuousnes of our mother sinne, it hath made the earth barren and cursed, and many a goodly plant to become fruitles, and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and therefore when we behold these things in the world, we must take occasion hereof to consider our owne sinne, and blame our selues and not the creatures, for they were cursed for our sakes.</p>
               <p>Now more particularly: This comparison is here specially applied vnto Prophets: but if we compare this place with S. Luke, Chap. 6. 44. and 45. we shall see the holy Ghost their restraineth not this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Prophets alone, but inlargeth the same vnto other men, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things, and an euill man out of the euill treasure of his heart bringeth forth euill.</hi> Now by comparing these together we may see that this comparison reacheth both vnto Prophets and to all other men: from whence we may gather these instructions.</p>
               <p>I. What we are to conceiue and thinke of a man that is not rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate:<note place="margin">The state of the vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</note> we are all by nature branches of the wild oliue, and therefore as a thorne cannot bring forth a grape, nor a thistle figges; no more can a man vnregenerate bring forth a good worke. And this we may more plainely conceiue, if we consider a little the workes of man: they may all be reduced to three heads: some are <hi>euill,</hi> as works forbidden of God; some are things <hi>indifferent,</hi> beeing neither forbidden nor commannded; and some are <hi>good workes,</hi> as outward duties of the morall law. Now for <hi>euill works,</hi> they cannot possible be good in any man. For <hi>works indifferent,</hi> as eating, drinking, buying, selling, &amp;c. they are sinnes, not in themselues but in him that vseth them beeing out of Christ: and for the <hi>outward duties of the morall law,</hi> as euill iustice, liberalitie, and such like, they are good workes in themselues, because God requireth them, but yet in the vnregenerate they are sinnes: <hi>To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and vnbeleeuing is nothing pure,</hi> Tit. 1. 15. and, <hi>Without faith it is vnpossible to please God,</hi>
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:14013:260"/>
Hebr. 11. 6. It wil be said, that liberalitie, chastitie, &amp;c. be the good gifts of God. <hi>Ans.</hi> That is true, and they be good workes as they are giuen and commaunded of God: but as they are receiued and vsed of the naturall man, they are sinnes: for he failes from the right vse of those actions; both for the beginning of them, (for they proceed not in him from a <hi>pure heart, a good conscience, and faith vnfaigned</hi>) and also in the ende; he doth them not for the glorie of God simply, but withall he aimes at his owne praise and reputation, or some such sinister respect.</p>
               <p>The vse of this Doctrine is this: I. it teacheth vs to consider and<note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne.</note> acknowledge the greatnes of our originall sinne. Our naturall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is most grieuous and fearefull; it makes vs to sinne in whatsoeuer things we doe, though in themselues they be things indifferent, or els good works.</p>
               <p>II. This ouerthrowes the conceit of popish writers, which teach<note place="margin">Sauing grace is not vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall. Bellarm. de grat. &amp; lib. arb l. a. c. 5. G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But here we see, a naturall man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a good gift of God cannot of himselfe vse it well: the best things he doth, though they be good in themselues, yet they be sinnes in him.</p>
               <p>III. Here also we may see what a miserable case we are in while<note place="margin">The miserie of the vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate.</note> we remaine vnregenerate, for we can doe nothing but sinne: we be like to thornes and thistles which either bring forth no fruite, or els bad fruites and therefore we must labour to become new plants in Christs orchard, being ingraffed into him by faith, and made new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by regeneration, hauing beleeuing hearts and good consciences, that so we may bring forth good fruites vnto the praise and glorie of God.</p>
               <p>IV. We may hence learne a generall rule touching a righteous man:<note place="margin">Good works follow iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> namely, that a man must first be truly iustified and sanctified before he can doe a good worke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Trid. sess. 6. cap. 7. &amp; can. 32.</note> ouerturnes a point of naturall and popish religion, that a man may be iustified and saued by his good workes; but that which followes cannot be a cause of that which went before: the fruit cannot make the tree to be good, but onely declare and manifest that it is good, from whence it comes that the fruit is good, and so good works they proceede from iustification. They say iustification twofold: one, whereby a man of an

               <p>The first part is a most fearfull sentence against many that liue in the Church, that notwithstanding their profession of the name of Christ, yet they shall neuer be saued. And this is most true, beeing spoken by him that hath the power of life and of death, who is also the God of truth that cannot lie, saying, <hi>Not euery one that saith, Lord, Lord,</hi> that is, that professeth God to be his God, <hi>shall enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>

The second sort are more <hi>close hypocrites,</hi> which professe the name<note place="margin">Close hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</note> of Christ in some truth, and haue in them some good gifts of God, by reason whereof both before men and in their owne conceite, they are reputed members of the Church; and yet for all this they are indeed
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:14013:262"/>
but hypocrites which shall neuer be saued.</p>
               <p>And that we may somewhat discerne of them, I will note the<note place="margin">What gifts a close hypo crite may haue.</note> gifts which they may haue, whereby they may come to professe Christ truly: they may be reduced to fiue heads. The first, is <hi>the spirit of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>bondage to feare,</hi> Rom. 8. 15. This is a certaine gift of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man doth discerne the right meaning, and iudiciall vse of the law in himselfe concerning sinne and the punishment thereof: (for though a man by nature know something of the law, yet he knowes not all, nor the right vse thereof:) now by reason of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he sees himselfe in bondage, and in regarde thereof doeth feare; from whence may proceede many good things, as griefe for sinne, confession and humiliation for the same, and praier for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Thus wicked <hi>Pharaoh</hi> confessed the <hi>righteousnesse of God,</hi> and <hi>that he and his people had sinned,</hi> Exod. 9. 27. And so did <hi>Ahab</hi> at the heauie message of God by Eliah, 1.

A second gift which a close hypocrite may haue,<note place="margin">2</note> is <hi>faith;</hi> as had <hi>Simon Magus: for he beleeued, and was baptized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Act. 8. 13. neither was it a false and dissembling faith altogether, but in some sort a true, though not a sauing faith: for he beleeued and yet was in the gall of bitternesse. So Ioh. 2. 23. it is saide, <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine beleeued in Christ, but he durst not commit himselfe vnto them.</hi> And that we be not deceiued herein, we must know that this faith of an hypocrite hath in it three things; <hi>knowledge</hi> of the truth, <hi>approbation</hi> thereof with assent vnto it, and a <hi>kinde of perswasion</hi> that Christ is his redeemer. Of the second degree of this faith we haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, 2. Pet. 2. 18. where some are said <hi>to be beguiled with wantonnesse through fleshly lusts, who had cleane escaped from them that be wrapt in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rror:</hi> that is, in idolatrie. And of the third degree we haue example in the same chap. vers. 1. where some false prophets are said <hi>to denie Christ that bought them;</hi> because for a time they professed themselues to be redeemed, and were also perswaded in a generall sort that he had bought them: yet herein they failed, that they did not truly apprehend the merit of Christ, and applie it effectually vnto themselues. The third gift of a close hypocrite, is a <hi>taste of Gods fauour:</hi> Hebr. 6. 6. it is saide of some that fall quite away, <hi>That they were inlightned by Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and had a taste of the good word of God, and of the powers of the</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed nor filled therewith. The fourth gift, is <hi>good affections;</hi> good (I say) not in them but in their<note place="margin">4</note> kinde, and so farre forth as we can iudge: they haue <hi>ioy</hi> in the good things of God: Luk. 8. 13. <hi>They that are on the stones are they which when they haue heard receiue the word with ioy. They haue zeale for Gods glorie,</hi> as had Iehu, 2. king. 11. 15. and yet he departed not from the sinnes of his forefathers, v. 32. Thirdly, they haue <hi>reuerence to Gods Ministers,</hi> as Herod to Iohn Baptist, Mark. 6. 20. <hi>Herod knowing Iohn to be a iust and holy man, feared and reuerenced him.</hi> The fifth gift, is<note place="margin">5</note> an outward reformation of life: <hi>the stonie ground</hi> receiues the seede with ioy, and brings forth some fruit, but it lasteth not: of such it is said, Hebr. 10. 29. <hi>They tread vnder foote the sonne of God, and count the blood of the Testament an vnholy thing wherewith they were sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> that is, according to their profession and perswasion. And thus we see what kinde of gifts an hypocrite may haue, and yet neuer be saued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vses.</hi> 1. The consideration whereof must mooue vs to looke vnto our selues, that we haue better things in vs then these are: for here we see we may goe on to perdition carying the profession of Christ in our mouthes. And the rather is this to be considered of vs, because many looke to be saued who come short of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in knowledge, and of <hi>Saul, Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> in humilitie; yea and for faith, farre short of the deuill himselfe, who is saide <hi>to beleeue and tremble:</hi> but how canst thou looke to be saued, that in regard of grace, commest short of those which are now condemned?</p>
               <p>Secondly, hence we must learne to suspect our selues, and call our selues to a reckoning about our faith and obedience, and we must not flatter our selues herein: for these things before named will not saue vs: many haue had faith in some truth for some degrees thereof, and also good affections and other gifts, as we haue seene, who are yet for all this condemned.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, seeing there be two sorts of men in the Church that shal be condemned, the one whereof haue many worthie gifts, this must moue vs not to rest in these things, but to labour and striue to haue our hearts rooted and grounded in the loue of God in Christ, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new creatures in righteousnes and true holinesse; and then shall we be as the wise virgins hauing the oyle of grace in the vessells of our hearts, which will neuer be quenched till we come into the marriage chamber with our Bridegroome Christ Iesus.</p>
               <p>The second part of the conclusion laid downe by our Sauiour Christ
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:14013:263"/>
is this, That some men professing the name of Christ in the Church of God shall be saued. And these persons are here described vnto vs<note place="margin">What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors shal be saued.</note> by their effect or action, to wit, <hi>The doing of the will of the Father.</hi> And because this is an infallible note of them that shall be saued, I will briefly shew what it is <hi>to doe the Fathers will.</hi> The Scriptures best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound themselues, Iohn 6. 40. <hi>This is the will of him that sent me, that euery one that hath seene the Sonne, and beleeueth in him, should haue euerlasting life.</hi> 1. Thess. 4. 3, 4, &amp;c. <hi>This is the will of God, euen your sanctification: and that you should abstaine from fornication; and that euery one should know how to possesse his vessell in holines and honour,—that no man oppresse or defraud his brother, &amp;c.</hi> These two places of<note place="margin">Wherin the doing of God will standeth.</note> Scripture laide together, shew that the doing of the Fathers will stands in three things, in <hi>faith,</hi> in <hi>repentance,</hi> and <hi>new obedience:</hi> faith is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly expressed in the place of Iohn: and repentance which is a fruite of faith, as also new obedience the fruit of them both, in the wordes of the Apostle Paul: for by <hi>Sanctification</hi> is meant repentance, and new obedience by the duties following.</p>
               <p>For the first; in true sauing faith there are three things required.<note place="margin">Sauing faith comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds 3. things.</note> 
                  <hi>Knowledge, assent,</hi> and <hi>application.</hi> By <hi>knowledge,</hi> I meane the right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the necessarie Doctrines of true religion, especially of those which concerne Christ our Redeemer. <hi>Assent,</hi> is when a man knowing this doctrine, doth further approoue of the same as holsome doctrine, and the truth of God, directing vs aright vnto saluation. <hi>Application,</hi> is when we conceiue in our hearts a true perswasion of Gods mercie towards vs particularly in the free pardon of all our sinnes, and for the saluation of our soules: example of this particular applying we haue in the Apostle Paul, Gal. 2. 20. who professeth thus, <hi>Now liue not I, but Christ liueth in me, and the life that I now liue is by faith in the sonne of God:</hi> which what that is, he sheweth after, saying, <hi>who hath loued me, and giuen himselfe for me:</hi> and without this particular application, neither knowledge nor assent can saue vs: in the 6. of Iohn Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds himselfe vnto vs as the <hi>bread of life and water of life:</hi> now we know that foode vnlesse it be receiued will not nourish the bodie: euen so vnlesse we doe by the hand of faith particularly receiue and applie Christ vnto our selues, all our knowledge and assent will be as foode vneaten and vndigested. It may be said that hypocrits haue knowledge, assent, and a perswasion of Gods fauour, and therefore this is not a sure note of doing the fathers will. I answer, an hypocrite (as Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus) may haue true knowledge of Gods word, and giue assent thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, &amp; in regard of both these haue true faith in some degree; yea he may
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:14013:264"/>
conceiue a perswasion of Gods mercie in the pardon of his sins, though falsely in presumption vpon false grounds and insufficient. Now that a<note place="margin">Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>beginning</hi> of true faith is hearing the word of God preached, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Gospel: the law going before as an occasion or preparing meanes whereby a man comes to see his sinnes and his miserie thereby, and thereupon to desire reconciliation with God in the pardon of them: and hearing the promises of mercie, to desire faith whereby he may imbrace the same, labouring against vnbeliefe. This, though it be not a liuely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith, yet it is the beginning of true faith, and no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite hath the same soundly wrought in him. The <hi>fruite</hi> of true faith, is a chaunge of the whole man both in heart and life: making the heart contrarie to it selfe in moderating the naturall affections and passions thereof, and keeping them in compasse of true obedience, and causing a man in euery estate to rest contented with the will of God, as I say saith, <hi>he that beleeueth shal not make hast.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>constancy</hi> in true faith<note place="margin">Isa. 28. 16.</note> is knowen by this, when a man relyes wholly on God euen then when he feeles no tast of his mercie, but hath all tokens of his displeasure. Euery man will beleeue when he hath present signes and pledges of Gods louing fauour: but true faith beeing <hi>the euidence of things hoped for,</hi> will make a man beleeue aboue hope as Abraham did: and beeing <hi>the subsisting of things not seene,</hi> will cause a man to beleeue when he sees no tokens of Gods mercie: and indeede he that lets go the hold of Gods mercie when he is in distresse, may assure himselfe he neuer had true faith: for the iust shall liue by faith in all estate, and will with Iob, trust in God though he kill them.</p>

                     </gap>ce.</note> is to <hi>repent of our sinnes:</hi> and this is a fruite of faith. In true repentance there be two things; the beginning, and the nature of it: The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it is a godly sorrow when a man is greeued properly and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly because by his sinne he hath offended God, who hath beene vnto him so louing a father in Christ. This causeth repentance vnto salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to be repented of, 2. Cor. 7. 10. and it ariseth not so much from the feare of punishment, as from the consideration of Gods mercie, making a man displeased with himselfe for offending so louing a God, who hath beene so gratious and bountifull vnto him in Christ. The nature of repentance stands in the change of the minde: when any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<note place="margin">The nature of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> laies aside the purpose of sinning, and by Gods blessing and grace
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:14013:264"/>
taketh to himselfe a new purpose neuer to sinne more. This is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repent, and if this be in truth, hence will follow the change of the will, of the affections, and of all the actions of the life.</p>
               <p>It may be said, that an hypocrite may repent as Iudas did, Matth. 27. 3. and therefore this is not a good note of doing Gods will. <hi>Answ.</hi> Iudas did repent, hee was indeed grieued for his fact, wishing with all his heart that it had neuer beene done: but this was nothing, his sorrow was onely <hi>worldly, causing death,</hi> as the Appstle calleth it, 2. Cor. 7. 10. arising from the horror and feare of punishment, not from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of Gods mercy: it was without true hatred of sin committed, without hope of mercie, or purpose to glorifie God by new obedience, and so was no true repentance.</p>
               <p>The third worke wherein consisteth the doing of Gods will, is <hi>new</hi>
                  <note place="margin">New obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> 
                  <hi>obedience:</hi> and it is the fruite of both the former, whereby a man bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indued with faith and repentance, doth according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of grace receiued, indeauour himselfe to yeeld obedience to all Gods commaundements, from all the powers and parts both of his soule and his bodie: and this I call <hi>newe,</hi> because it is a renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that in man, whereto hee was perfectly enabled by creation. But here it will bee said, that many who shall neuer bee saued, haue attained to reformation of life; and therefore this is not a true and sufficient note of him that shall bee saued. <hi>Answ.</hi> True it is, many hypocrites haue reformation of life, but yet they faile two waies; First, their reformation is onely outward not inward, their thoughts, wills, and affections still remaine wicked and corrupt. Secondly, their obedience is partiall, onely to some of Gods commaundements, not to all: so <hi>Herod,</hi> he would heare <hi>Iohn</hi> gladly, and doe many things, but yet he would not leaue his brothers wife.

               <p>In these two verses Christ returnes to explane and confirme the first conclusion of the former verse, concerning those professors that shall not be saued. The words containe two parts: First, a description of the persons by their behauiour, v. 22. Secondly, a declaration of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, v. 23. For the first these professors are described by three ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments: I. by their number, <hi>many:</hi> II. by the time in which they shal plead thus for themselues, and stand on their profession of seruice done to Christ; <hi>in that day:</hi> that is, in that great and terrible day of the last iudgement: III. by their gifts and qualities wherewith they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, <hi>haue we not in thy name prophecied? and by thy name cast out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first: the number of professors which shall not be saued is<note place="margin">Of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that shal be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> great: <hi>For many</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>shall say vnto me.</hi> Indeede we are not able to say how many they be which shall not be saued, for that is a thing proper to God: and yet the Scripture teacheth vs that the number of those which shall be condemned, is greater then the number of those which shall be saued: for besides that the greatest part of the world in former times did neuer heare of Christ, here it is plaine that among the professors of the name of Christ, many shall be condemned: and v. 13. <hi>many walke in the broad way to destruction, few in the narrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereby we are taught, first, that we must not frame our liues accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the example of the multitude, to liue and doe as the most doe, because the most shall be condemned: but we must striue to enter in at the straite gate, and to be of that little flocke vnto whom the kingdom of heauen is promised.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hence we learne, not to content our selues to liue as most men and women doe that professe the name of Christ, but we must labour to goe beyond the multitude in regard of the truth of our faith and repentance. It was not sufficient for the wise virgins to beare the name of virgins, to haue lampes burning, and to goe forth to meete the bridgroome: for all these things did the foolish virgins also: but one
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:14013:266"/>
thing more they had, which was the oyle of grace, whereby they were inlightened to goe with the bridegroome into his chamber; which the foolish virgines lacking were shut out of the dooers and not admitted to come in. Matth. 25.</p>
               <p>The second argument whereby these reprobate professors are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, is the circumstance of time when they shal thus plead for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, why they should not be condemned, to wit, at the last day when they shall come to be arraigned at the tribunall feare of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is a point of great weight and moment worthy all obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; that men not onely in this life and in death, but euen at the last day shall thus plead for themselues.</p>
               <p>Hence we learne, that many professing seruice to Christ shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue<note place="margin">A dangerous conceit of a mans good estate.</note> in their minde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a perswasion that they are the true seruants and children of God: they shall liue and die in this perswasion; and yet for all this at the last iudgement they shall receiue the sentence of condemnation. A thing deepely to be waighed of euery one: And the consideration of it ought to teach vs all to take heed of spirituall pride and selfe-loue, whereby men flatter and deceiue themselues in their estate, ouerweening the good things they haue, and falsly thinking that they haue that blessing of God which indeed they haue not. This must mooue vs not onely to labour to be purged of this pride, but also teach vs to suspect the worst of our selues, and to iudge our selues seuerely in regard of vnbeleefe and hollownes of heart: for this will be a meanes to make vs escape the iudgement of condemnation at the last day, which Christ shal pronounce against many of those that thinke themselues to be his seruants.</p>
               <p>Further, obserue where Christ saith, <hi>in that day,</hi> he singleth out the day of iudgement as a most terrible day. And saying, <hi>they shall say vnto me,</hi> he makes himselfe the Iudge of all the world in that day; and further pointing out their particular pleading for themselues, he giues vs to vnderstand that he is very God, who knoweth long before not onely the speaches and actions, but the very secret thoughts and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of all men that haue beene, that are, or shall be, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the ende of the world.</p>
               <p>These things laid together and well considered, must stirre vp in our hearts a speciall dutie which the Apostle had learned, 2. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 11. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The terror of the Lord.</note> 
                  <hi>to know the terrour of the Lord:</hi> that is, not onely in iudgement to conceiue, but also in heart and affection to be perswaded of the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fearefulnes of the last iudgement; and in this regard not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selues with the gift of knowledge and with an outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:14013:266"/>
but to labour for soundnesse and sinceritie of faith, of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and new obedience, both in heart and life. This was <hi>Pauls</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, in regard of the resurrection to this iudgement, <hi>he endeuoured himselfe to haue alwaies a cleare conscience toward God, and toward man,</hi> Act. 24. 16. And this dutie is most necessarie: for such is our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and vnbeleefe that we little regard the terrour of this day, but either thinke it shall not come, or though it doe, we shall scape well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <p>The third argument here vsed is drawne from the gifts and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the persons which make this plea for themselues: they are such as haue <hi>prophesied in the name of Christ, cast out deuills, &amp; done many great works in his name.</hi> To <hi>prophesie</hi> here signifieth to teach the people of<note place="margin">What it is to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</note> God, by expounding the Scripture, and applying the same to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences for their edification: and this office is called prophesie, to grace and commend the office of a minister, because it was the principall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Prophets themselues thus to handle the word of God for the instruction and edification of Gods people, howsoeuer at some time they did foretell vnto Gods people things to come. And therefore he which hath this office, and dischargeth the same with good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, doth a worke no lesse honourable, then did the auncient holy Prophets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By thy name</hi>] The <hi>name</hi> of Christ here signifieth two things: I. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment<note place="margin">What it is to prophesie in Christs name.</note> and commandement from Christ: men that preach the word of God beeing rightly called thereunto, teach and preach in the name of Christ: for those whome the Church calleth lawfully, Christ himselfe calleth, and they preach by vertue of his name. Secondly, it signifieth to preach in the roome and stead of Christ, to preach that which Christ would preach, and in that manner also which Christ would vse: 2. Cor. 5. 20. <hi>We are embassadours for Christ, as though God did beseech you by vs, &amp;c.</hi> And here we may see a difference among the kinds of teaching which God requireth of men. Masters teach their serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; parents teach their children; and one neighbour and friend another: but all these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the teaching of the minister: for he teacheth beeing called by Christ and in stead of Christ: but the master teacheth not by like ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but onely by the right of mastership: the father by vertue of father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and one friend another by vertue of brotherly charitie. And this sheweth the dignitie of the calling of a minister, and the weight of his office: no master, no father, or ordinarie professor hath the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cast out deuills, and done many great workes</hi>] For the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing hereof we must entreat something of the working of miracles:
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:14013:267"/>
and first we are to see what a miracle is. A miracle is not only a strange worke done, but such a worke as is aboue the strength of all creatures,<note place="margin">What a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle is.</note> and beyond the whole power of created nature; for it is done by the power of God himselfe immediately, which is aboue the strength of all creatures: such a worke was the <hi>staying of the sunne,</hi> Iosua 10. 13. and the <hi>going backeward of the shadow of the diall,</hi> 2. King. 20. 11. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Lord God alone is the author of a miracle, who created<note place="margin">God alone can work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> miracles.</note> heauen and earth; as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Thou art great and doest wondrous things, thou art God alone,</hi> Psal. 86. 10. No angel, nor other creature in heauen or in earth, no not the manhood of Christ, though exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all creatures, is able to worke a miracle. How then, will some say,<note place="margin">How men worke mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> doe these men plead their working of miracles? <hi>Ans.</hi> Not as authors, but as instruments and ministers whom the Lord vsed in the working of them; for men worke miracles by beleeuing, on this manner: First, they receiue a speciall instinct and inward motion, that God will vse them as instruments in the working of a miracle, if they pray vnto him, and command the worke to be done: vpon this instinct, they beleeue that if they pray to God, and command in his name, it shall bee done: and lastly, they praie, and commaund according to this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> instinct, and so the thing they beleeued is done. And thus is this speech to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, <hi>Haue we not cast out deuils? &amp;c.</hi> that is, thou hast put an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie instinct into our minds, that if we prayed vnto thee, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the deuils in thy name to depart, it should be done: this wee haue beleeued, and accordingly practised, and so haue cast out deuils, &amp; done many great wonders by thy name. This gift of miracles doth not now befal the Church of God; all that the Church now hath (for ought<note place="margin">Miracles now ceased.</note> I see) is the gift of praier, ioyned with fasting, which also must bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall, depending on Gods glorie, the good of Gods Church, and of the partie troubled: they may not pray absolutely for this worke of casting out deuils, or for the doing of such like miracles, much lesse may they now giue peremptorie command for the beeing of them. If it be said, that Gods Church hath all needfull gifts, as well now as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times: I answer, it hath all gifts needfull to their saluation, and therefore prayer in the Church serues now either to deliuer the partie troubled, or else to procure as good a blessing as deliuerance is, which is patience and repentance. And thus wee see what manner of persons they be that shall say, Lord, Lord, and make apologie for themselues at the last day, and yet be damned; namely, some that haue beene excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent preachers of the word, and some that haue had extraordinary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to cast out deuils: and lastly, others that haue wrought many strange
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:14013:267"/>
cures and miracles by faith in Christs name.</p>
               <p>Now whence we learne, first, that most excellent gifts will not auaile<note place="margin">Excellent gifts wil not saue vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith.</note> to the saluation of any man or woman, vnlesse they haue true faith, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere repentance, and new obedience, whereby they doe the will of God: for what an excellent gift is it to be able to teach and preach the word of God? what a rare thing is it to haue heard Christ himselfe preach, and to haue giuen him entertainment? and yet neither of these can saue a man: Christ saith here, the apologie of preaching shall doe men no good, and the priuiledge of eating and drinking with Christ, and of hearing him teach in their streets will nothing auaile; Christ wil say, I neuer knew you, Luk. 13. 26, 27. It is likewise an excellent earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly priuiledge to be allied vnto Christ; and yet Christ preserreth spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all kindred by faith and obedience farre before it, saying to one that told him his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speake with him, <hi>Who</hi> (saith he) <hi>is my mother? and who are my brethren? and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 47, 48, 49, 50.</note> 
                  <hi>pointing to his 'Disciples, he said, behold my mother and my brethren; for whosoeuer shall doe my fathers will, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</hi> And with reuerence it may be truely said of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that howsoeuer it was a wonderfull priuiledge vnto her to be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Christ Iesus, yet if shee had not as well borne him in her heart by faith, as shee did in her bodie, shee had neuer beene saud: and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>though wee had knowne Christ after the flesh, yet henceforth knowe wee him no more; but if any man bee in Christ, hee is a newe creature,</hi> 2. Cor. 5. 16. and, <hi>in Christ neither circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion auaileth any thing, nor vncircumcision, but faith which worketh by loue,</hi> Gal. 5. 6.</p>
               <p>The consideration whereof, must mooue vs all to labour to become new creatures, and to get the graces of Gods children who are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, euen true faith, true repentance, and new obedience, and not to rest in other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gifts though they be most excellent.</p>
               <p>Againe, students that haue a great measure of knowledge and other excellent parts, as memorie, languages, &amp;c. must learne, not to be puffed vp therewith, (<hi>for knowledge puffeth vp,</hi> 1. Cor. 8. 1.) but withall to get the sauing graces before named; for without a repentant and beleeuing heart, all the gifts they haue wil neuer saue them: nay rather they must be abased thereby, for without true sauing faith, all other gifts bee but as so many mil-stones, to presse them deeper into the pit of destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here note, that many learned preachers, who haue soundly handled the word of God for the conuersion of others, shall
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:14013:268"/>
yet themselues be condemned, like to the Carpenters that built <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, and yet were drowned in the flood. The consideration whereof, must teach all Ministers, according the counsell of the Apostle, Act. 20. 28. <hi>to take heed,</hi> first, <hi>vnto themselues,</hi> and then <hi>to their flockes:</hi> so <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy, Take heed vnto thy selfe, and vnto learning, continue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; for in doing this thou shalt both saue thy selfe, and them that heare thee,</hi> 2. Tim. 4. 16. Secondly, to be followers of <hi>Paul</hi> in the practise of mortification, <hi>who did beate downe his bodie, and bring it into subiection, least by any meanes after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e had preached to others, he himselfe should be a reprobate,</hi> 2. Cor. 9. 27. Thirdly, the people of God are here also taught their dutie; for seeing this fearefull iudgement shall befall some ministers of the word, that notwithstanding their preaching they shall be condemned; therefore Gods people must not rest vpon the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their ministers liues, but cleaue fast vnto that wholesom doctrine which they gather soundly and directly out of the word of God: his life and practise is no sure rule to follow, further then it agreeth with the word of God: and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Be followers of me, as I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ,</hi> 1. Cor. 11. 1. But the word is a true rule and square, &amp; as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as walke according to this rule, <hi>Peace shall be vpon them, and mercy,</hi> Galat. 6. 16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, seeing some workers of miracles must also be condemned,<note place="margin">Receiue no new doctrine though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a miracle.</note> this teacheth vs not to trust them which bring vnto vs doctrines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are confirmed by wonders; for such as worke wonders may deceiue themselues in the matter of their owne saluation, and therfore much more may they deceiue vs in this or that particular point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Whereas therefore sundrie points of poperie, as Purgatorie, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, inuocation of Saints, and such like, are auouched to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by miracles (which no doubt were but forgeties, and lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) yet let it be graunted that they were true miracles, that prooueth not that we should beleeue them, because the word of God doth not confirme the same vnto vs; for beside that which is reuealed and recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Verse 23. <hi>And then will I professe to them I neuer knew you: depart from me ye workers of iniquitie.</hi> Here Christ sets downe the iust con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of those men which make an apologie for themselues at the day of iudgement, and wonder at their condemnation: and withall he answereth them in that wherein they shall plead for themselues. The words containe three parts; I. A profession made by Christ to these men, <hi>that he neuer knew them.</hi> II. A commandement of Christ vnto
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:14013:268"/>
them, <hi>Depart from me.</hi> And III. a reason of the commandement, <hi>Ye workers of iniquitie.</hi> For the profession of Christ; <hi>Then,</hi> that is, in the day of Iudgement, at that time when men shall wonder at their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, making apologies of their seruice to God; euen <hi>then,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>will I professe. &amp;c.</hi> In this phrase Christ alludeth to the fact of these hypocrites, for they professed the name of Christ, and did plead seruice done vnto him; as if he should say, Many in that day which haue professed my name in the world, shall plead their seruice done to mee: but I will make another profession vnto them, that is, I will make it cleere and manifest vnto all the world, that I neuer knew them, &amp; that their profession of me was in vaine.</p>
               <p>The words of Christs profession are of great waight and moment,<note place="margin">Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his creature.</note> containing some difficultie in regard of the sense, which must bee sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out. The knowledge of God whereby he knowes his creatures is two-fold; Generall, and Speciall. Gods generall knowledge is that,<note place="margin">1. Generall.</note> whereby he vnderstands and sees all things, both past, present, and to come: and in regard of this it is said, <hi>All things are naked and open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eies with whom we haue to doe,</hi> Heb. 4. 13. And by vertue of this, Christ here foretelleth what shall be the apologie of some wicked men at the last day. And in regard of this generall knowledge, all men are knowne vnto God, and the most secret actions of wicked wretches, Ier. 32. 18. <hi>His eies are open vnto all the waies of the sonnes of men, to giue vnto them according to their waies, and according to the fruite of their workes.</hi> The speciall knowledge of God, is that whereby he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth,<note place="margin">2. Speciall.</note> approoueth, and accepteth of his creature to bee his, vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing vnto it his speciall fauour: now this enlargeth not it selfe to all &amp; euery man, for some there be, on whom he will shew his fauour, and of them it is said, <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous,</hi> Psal. 1. 6. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there be on whom he will not shew forth his mercie, and of them it is said, <hi>The way of the wicked shall perish.</hi> Which opposition sheweth, what is meant by Gods knowledge of the godly. So likewise, Rom. 11. 2. <hi>will the Lord destroy his people whom he knew before;</hi> that is, whom he approoued and loued: and of this speciall knowledge hee speaketh in this place. <hi>Neuer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> This word excludeth all times, as if he should say, I doe not now, neither euer did approoue and accept you for mine owne; yea euen in that time when you professed me, preached, and wrought wonders in my name, euen then I say, I did not accept and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue of you.</p>
               <p>From this forme of confession we are to learne sundrie points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;<note place="margin">Vniuersall redemption confuted.</note> First, hereby is plainely confuted and ouerthrowne the opinion
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:14013:269"/>
of some Protestants, who hold that Christ shed his blood for all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man without exception, and that in regard of Gods purpose and will he died for all men; for <hi>Caine</hi> as well as for <hi>Abel,</hi> for <hi>Iudas</hi> as well as for <hi>Peter,</hi> and for them which shal be condemned, as wel as for them which shall be saued. But marke what Christ saith here to them that shall be condemned, I neuer knew you, nor approoued of you for mine. But if Christ died effectually for all and euery man in the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, then hee bought all and euery man without exception, with the price of his blood; and if that, then euery one without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Christs: and those which are truely his, Christ will vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge for his owne. But here we see Christ wil not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all and euery man to bee his, and therefore vndoubtedly he did not purchase by the price of his blood, all and euery man to bee his without exception. I denie not, but that Christ died for all men in the sense of Scripture; but the word of God neuer saith, that on Gods part, and in regard of the purpose of his wil, Christ died for euery man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception. And whereas it is thought to be an hard speech, to say<note place="margin">God deales not hardly in denying redemption to some.</note> that God would haue some particular men depriued of grace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Christ, let vs well consider this one thing, and it will not seeme strange, no not in mans reason. God created man in his owne i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, in righteousnesse and true holinesse, and he gaue vnto him a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed estate in an earthly paradise, and that not onely for himselfe, but for all his posteritie; for whatsoeuer he receiued by creation, hee receiued not onely for himselfe, but for his posterity, beeing then a publike man, and bearing the person of whole mankinde, both in the state of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, and in his fall: whereupon <hi>Adam</hi> falling from that happie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, all mankinde beeing in him, fell with him, and so lost Gods image, and that good estate which they enioyed by creation in <hi>Adam.</hi> Now consider this well, if God had neuer indued man with grace, nor giuen him meanes to come by happinesse, and yet had beene excluded from all means of grace and happinesse, this indeed might haue seemed hard; but considering that by creation he gaue man happinesse, and likewise abilitie to perseuere in the same, if he would; is it any maruell, seeing all men haue of themselues lost their owne felicitie, that some should bee depriued of it for euer? nay, rather it is a wonder that all are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned which come of <hi>Adam;</hi> for God in his iustice without all cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie might haue condemned euery man: and indeede it is his endlesse mercie, that he hath giuen Christ to be a Sauiour vnto some, and that any are made partakars of this saluation by Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ here saith of some, <hi>I neuer knew you:</hi> yet speaking
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:14013:269"/>
of others he saith, <hi>I know my sheep,</hi> Ioh. 10. 14. and againe, <hi>I know whom</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation prooued.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue chosen,</hi> Ioh. 13. 18. and <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> 2. Tim. 2. 19. Now fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these places we may gather, that there is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall worke of God, whereby hee puts a difference and distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and man, angel and angel, acknowledging some to bee his owne, and denying the same of others. If God himselfe had not auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched this in his word, no man might haue taught it; but beeing here plainely expounded, it is with all reuerence to be acknowledged &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: and that it may be the better conceiued, two points are here to be handled. First, vpon what ground and reason God doth know<note place="margin">The ground of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination.</note> some to be his, and doth not know nor acknowledge others for his owne. Secondly, what is the fruite of this knowledge of God in man. For the first, why God should know some to be his, and not others, no other reason can be giuen, but Gods good pleasure alone: Matth. 11. 25. Christ setteth downe this distinction betweene man and man, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>his father hath hid the mysteries of the kingdom of heauen from some, and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau Paul</hi> shewes this distinction of mankind, <hi>I haue loued Iacob and hated Esau,</hi> saith the Lord: neither did this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence come from their workes, either good or euill, for this difference God put betweene them, before <hi>either of them had done good or euill:</hi> but it is wholly ascribed to the will of God, <hi>who will haue mercie on whom he will haue mercie, and whom he will he hardeneth.</hi> This must not seeme strange vnto vs: we permit vnto men to vse their owne discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their owne affaires, and this is a sufficient reason to stoppe any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans mouth; <hi>It is mine owne, may I not doe with mine owne what I will?</hi> Againe, in Princes Proclamations wee submit our selues to this clause <hi>(It is our pleasure:)</hi> so likewise, a man hauing a flocke of sheepe, may send some of them to the fatting for the slaughter, &amp; others keepe for breed: this God permitteth vnto man, and it is not counted cruelty among men; now if wee giue this libertie vnto man ouer the creature, why should we not much more giue it to the creator ouer man, seeing the basest and least creature is something in regard of man, but man is nothing vnto God? and therefore though these mysteries cannot b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Vpon this ground of difference and distinction betweene man and
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:14013:270"/>
man, we may well bee admonished to beware of the errour of some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, who thus define of Gods will touching mans estate; they say it is<note place="margin">For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ecne workes are not the ground of Gods decree</note> the first wil of God, that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world should be saued, if they would, and therefore (say they) he ministers vnto them all helps both of nature and grace, whereby they may repent and beleeue if they will. And hauing laid downe this his first will, he then (say they) foresees that some men will not beleeue, nor perseuere in the faith: and hereupon it is (in their conceit) that he will not know some men for his owne. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, foreseeing that others will beleeue and perseuere in faith, them he knowes and acknowledgeth to bee his; dealing herein like vnto a good father that hath many sonnes, who would haue them all to doe well, and to haue each one a good portion; but yet seeing that some wil not become frugall and obedient, he changeth his minde, and doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherite them: or like vnto a good Prince, who would haue all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to doe well; but seeing some to be rebels, hee is of another minde, and willeth their death. <hi>Answ.</hi> But this opinion is a meere inuention of mans braine; for whereas they say, that God by a second acte of his will acknowledgeth some for his owne, and not others, vpon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of their faith and vnbeleefe, whereas by his first will hee would haue all men to be saued, it is not true; for the first will of God, is to know some, and not to know others: the ground whereof, is his good pleasure alone, and no foreseene workes in them. And therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, that he should will all men to be saued equally, <hi>Caine</hi> as well as <hi>Abel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iudas</hi> as well as <hi>Peter.</hi> Againe, their opinion confutes it selfe, for God foresees mens faith and vnbeleefe, because hee hath decreed the same, and his decree depends vpon his owne will alone: and therefore vnlesse we make the same thing in the same respect, both the cause and the effect, we cannot make foreseene workes the ground of difference betweene man and man. Then their comparisons are not fit: a father would haue all his children to doe well, and to enioy his portion: true; and more then that, he would make all his children to doe well, if it lay in his power; neither would he disinherite any, if it lay in his power to make them good: the change of his purpose in disinheriting his sonne, ariseth vpon the impotencie of his will, that cannot doe that he would. And the same must be said of the will of Princes toward their subiects: but if their should be such a will in God to haue all men saued, if hee could saue them; then vndoubtedly all men should bee saued, <hi>for who hath resisted his will?</hi> nay, whatsoeuer the Lord willeth, that doth he in heauen, in earth, and euery where, Dan. 4. 32.</p>
               <p>A second point to be considered in the distinction of men, whereby
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:14013:270"/>
God knoweth some to be his, and doth not acknowledge some others for his, is the fruite of this knowledge of God. It is an effectuall and<note place="margin">The effect of Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of some to be his.</note> powerfull knowledge, working mutuall and strange effects in mans heart, towards God; for from this, that God knoweth some to bee his, there followeth another knowledge in mans heart, whereby he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God to be his God. So Christ saith, Ioh. 10. 14. <hi>I know my sheepe, &amp; am knowne of mine:</hi> looke as the sunne casts downe his beames vpon vs, by meanes whereof we againe see the body of the sunne; euen so the knowledge of God, whereby he knoweth vs for his, worketh in our hearts a knowledge of God in vs, whereby we know him for our God. So Gal. 4. 9. <hi>Seeing ye know God, or rather are known of God:</hi> so that the knowledge of God, whereby he knoweth vs to be his, is the grounde of our knowledge of him to be our God. Againe, in this knowledge of God, whereby he knoweth his elect, is contained his loue towards them, for he knoweth and accepteth of man, and therefore loueth him: &amp; this brings forth in man loue to God againe. <hi>We loue God because hee hath loued vs first,</hi> 1. Ioh. 4. 19. So likewise God by his knowledge chooseth vs to be his peculiar people: and hence comes our choosing of God to be our God; for looke, as the seale sets a print in the waxe like vnto it selfe, so the knowledge of God bringeth forth such fruits in vs to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as therewith God beareth and manifesteth towards vs.</p>
               <p>On the other side, there he some whom God neuer knewe, and the fruits hereof in them, bee the fruits of iustice; God not knowing them, they knowe not God: and the fruits of this knowledge, as loue, and giuing their hearts vnto God, they haue not. Indeed the sinnes which men commit come not from this, that God knoweth them not, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the corrupt will of man: and yet these wants of knowledge, of loue, &amp; faith to God, as they are punishments, come from this, that God doth not know, nor acknowledge men for his.</p>
               <p>Now whereas this knowledge of God is powerfull in his elect to<note place="margin">A motiue to know and loue God.</note> produce from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true knowledge, affiance, &amp; loue of God againe; we are to bee admonished to labour to feele in our hearts these graces which are the impressions and fruits of Gods knowledge of vs, that by them wee may be able to say, I knowe God to be my God, and Christ my redeemer. Let vs therefore labour to knowe God aright, and to loue God in Christ, &amp; in his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, by true loue; &amp; to choose the true God to be our God, bestowing our hearts &amp; affections on him: for by these graces wee shall know certainly that God knoweth vs, loueth, and chooseth vs for his sonnes and daughters in Christ; because these graces in vs are the proper fruits of the knowledge &amp; loue of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs; euen as wee may knowe the Princes broade seale by the
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:14013:271"/>
forme of it in waxe, though wee neuer see the seale it selfe. And on the contrarie, wee must take heed of that heauie iudgement of God, whereby men goe on without knowledge, loue, and affiance in God; for these are fearefull tokens of his wrath, befalling those whom he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The vse.</hi> 1. Whereas God knoweth some men for his owne, and will not acknowledge the same of others, and that onely vpon his will &amp; pleasure, we may see here a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful &amp; vnsearchable mystery; which first of all ought to stirre vs vp, not to plead with God, but in an holy reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der at, &amp; to admire his vnspeakable power &amp; soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ouer his creature: Rom. 11. 32. <hi>God hath shut vp all vnder vnbeleefe, that he might haue mercie on all,</hi> saith the Apostle. Now he doth not reason the case further, but there staies himselfe, with an admiration of Gods wonderfull power and wisdome, crying out, <hi>O the deepnes of the riches, both of the wisedom and knowledge of God, how vnsearchable are his iudgements, &amp; his waies past finding out!</hi> v. 33. 2. This must strike<note place="margin">2</note> our hearts with feare &amp; trembling towards God in regard of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaking to the Gentiles of Gods auncient people saith, <hi>the Iewes are cut off through vnbeleefe, and thou standest by f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Hence we are taught, not to sooth vp our selues<note place="margin">3</note> (as vsually we doe) on hope of mercie in the death of Christ, without some ground hereof through true grace; but rather with feare &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, so long as we haue time, to labour in the means of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is Gods word, prayer, Sacraments, to become true members of Christ, because we may deceiue our selues with a vaine profession: for though Gods mercie be endlesse in it selfe, yet it admits restraint to vs-ward; &amp; indeed it shall neuer be extended to all, nay not to many that in their life time made full account thereof in their vaine perswasions.</p>
               <p>A third point here to be obserued is this; that such as professed Christs<note place="margin">The Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For this wee must learne and hold as the truth of God, that where true faith, loue, and hope are truely wrought, there they remaine for euer, at least in the roote; they may seeme for a time to bee lost, but yet neuer can be quite extinct, <hi>for the gifts and calling of God are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance,</hi> Rom. 11. 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="531" facs="tcp:14013:271"/>Fourthly, here it is plaine, that those whom Christ will not saue, hee neuer knewe; hence it followes, that whom he knowes to bee his, them he wil know to be his for euer. This point must be remembred, because it is the true foundation and ground of the saluation of mens soules: we are said to bee saued by faith, and by the word of God, yet onely as by meanes, not as causes: but the onely cause of our saluation, and of the meanes that brings vs thereto, is <hi>this knowledge of God,</hi> whereby he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth and approoueth vs to be his owne.</p>

This knowledge of God, is <hi>that foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which remaineth sure,</hi> 2. Tim. 2. 19. The first grace of all is Gods fauour, choosing some men to be his of his meere good will; and this first grace, to whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it is vouchsafed, remaineth for euer, admitting no change nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, nor interruption. This doctrine must be remembred, as the staie of our faith, and a sure foundation of sound comfort in any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse: for true beleeuers in time of affliction finde in themselues much vnbeleefe, and great pronenesse to fall away from God. Yet here they haue a sure stay whereon to rest, they must goe out of themselues, and fasten their faith on Gods election, knowing hence, that though they be fraile and subiect to fall away of themselues, yet their saluation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines fast, grounded on the knowledge and election of God. So the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> comforts himselfe and the godly, Rom. 8. 32, 33. <hi>It is God that iustifies, who shall condemne?</hi> and verse 35. <hi>Who shall seuer vs from the Loue of God in Christ,</hi> whereby hee loueth vs? And indeede, if a man haue receiued true assurance of Gods fauour, though but once in all his life; yet by that one signe hee may assure himselfe of his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, vpon this ground, that Gods loue is vnchangeable, though euer after he liue in temptation; <hi>for whom God loueth, hee loueth to the end,</hi> Ioh. 13. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Depart from me</hi>] This is Christs commandement to those whom he neuer knew, though they professed his name; and it is a most fearefull commandement, beeing all one with that, Matth. 25. 41. <hi>Goe ye cursed into euerlasting fire.</hi>

So Deut. 4. 6. the peoples obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Gods commandements, is counted by <hi>Moses,</hi> their wisdome: &amp; for this cause he there saith, <hi>they shal be counted the wisest people vnder heauen,</hi> because they serued &amp; obeyed the true God: to which purpose it is said, <hi>The feare of God is the beginning of wisdome, a good vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding haue all they that doe thereafter,</hi> Psal. 111. 10.</p>

                  <pb n="538" facs="tcp:14013:275"/>Thirdly, hauing found a good foundation we must build thereon. Our soules and our saluation must be builded on Christ. This is done<note place="margin">3. Part. How we are built on Christ.</note> by our faith in Christ: for as mutuall loue ioynes one man vnto an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; so true faith makes vs one with Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eph. 3. 17. the holy Ghost saith, that <hi>Christ doth dwell in our hearts by faith:</hi> and, Psal. 125. 1. <hi>He that trusts in the Lord is as mount Sion that cannot be remooued.</hi> Yet here two ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ats must be remembred: <hi>I.</hi> That Christ is a rocke, yet not euery way that man frames in his owne heart, but onely so as he hath offered himselfe in the promise of the Gospel, which is the word of the couenant of grace. And for this cause we must labour that this word of Gods grace may be rooted and grounded in our hearts by faith: for it is all one to beleeue in Christ, and to beleeue the word that reueales Christ vnto vs: so saith our Sauiour, <hi>He that refuseth me and receiueth not my word, hath one that iudgeth him,</hi> Ioh. 12. 48. And, <hi>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you,</hi> Ioh. 15. 7. We therefore must be like the good ground: for as it receiues and keepes the good seede, so doth the good heart receiue and keepe the word of grace, which beeing rooted in our hearts keepes vs vnited vnto Christ, and therefore it is called the <hi>engraffed word,</hi> Iam. 1. 21. which beeing mingled with faith in our hearts is profitable, for it knits vs fast to Christ, and makes vs growe vp in him vnto perfection. <hi>II. Caueat.</hi> We must set all the maine affections of our heart on Christ: for hereby must we shew forth our faith. We must so esteeme and loue Christ, as that in regard of him <hi>we count all things losse, and dung,</hi> with the Apostle; yea we must so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Christ, that we desire him wholly, and receiue nothing into our hearts but Christ alone. <hi>Thomas</hi> desired but <hi>to put his finger into his side,</hi> but we must goe further, and desire to haue our soules washed in the blood that issued thence, and to haue our hearts possessed by his spirit, whome he giueth to his Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Use.</hi> Seeing Christ Iesus is the rocke of our saluation, our dutie is to haue our hearts rooted and founded on Christ. They which be as the stonie ground, heare and receiue the word, and it takes some rooting in them, and brings forth some fruit: but as the rooting is not deepe, so the fruit is neuer ripe, and therefore when heat commeth it withereth: so it is with professors; a man may be one in name, and bring forth some fruit of the word which he heares, and yet be deceiued in the matter of his saluation, because he is not rooted and founded in Christ. This is the point which <hi>Paul</hi> stands much vpon in sundrie of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 20, 21. and 3. 17.

when the parching heat of persecution comes, vnlesse we be throughly rooted in Christ, we shall neuer continue to the ende, nor bring forth fruit with patience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III.

                     </gap>, notwithstanding the the falling of the raine, the beating of the floods, and the blowing of the windes,</hi> vers. 25. A most notable fruite which nothing els but true obedience can procure vnto vs: wealth cannot minister this comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table securitie; nay the more wealth, oft times the more trouble; and vnto many, riches are the causes of a fearefull downefall. No strength of man, nor power of any Princes can procure this safetie, &amp; yet Christ vouchsafeth the same to them that heare his word and keepe it.</p>
               <p>The consideration hereof must mooue vs to be most willing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<note place="margin">A motiue to obedience.</note> to performe obedience to that holy word of God which we read and heare: for such a benefite comes by it as no creature in the world can procure besides: and the rather we must inu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, from this fruite of true obedience we may gather, that<note place="margin">True faith cannot be lost.</note> he which once hath true saith in Christ rooted in his heart, shall neuer loose the same either wholly or finally, but shall continue therein vnto the ende and enioy the fruite thereof for euer. For by faith a man is truly built on Christ as on a most sure foundation, so as neither temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations nor persecutions can driue him off: though they may assault and shake him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they can neuer throw him down: but if a man might quite loose his faith, then might he be beaten downe that is built on Christ, which thing this text denieth.</p>
               <p>Lastly, this teacheth vs that he that is built on Christ by faith,<note place="margin">True belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers must haue their trialls.</note> must looke for fearefull tryalls and temptations: for he is like an house built one the sea banke, against which winde and raine and waues doe all beate and rage. Gods seruants must not looke to goe to heauen in ease; but they must waite for trialls and temptations comming hand in hand, as winde and raine, and winde and waue commonly doe: and therefore the more carefull and earnestly must we labour to be surely grounded on Christ, that though they assault vs, yet they may not throw vs downe.</p>

               <p>In these verses our Sauiour Christ layeth downe foure other points contrarie to the former, belonging to an euill hearer.

Point.</hi> The practise of a bad hearer from which Christ would<note place="margin">The practise of a badde hearer.</note> terrifie all men in this place is, <hi>To heare and not to doe.</hi> This is no small fault. The ground that receiueth seede and raine both in measure and season, and yet bringeth forth either bad fruite, or none at all, is by all men condemned for bad ground; the Apostle saith, it <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> neere vnto cursing, whose ende is to be burned,</hi> Hebr. 6. 8. The waters that come and issue from vnder the threshold of the Sanctuarie, Ezek. 41. 1. whereby is meant the word of God, when they come into any ground they are of this nature, if they make it not fruitefull they <hi>turne it into barrennes,</hi> vers. 11. A subiect that knowes his Princes will, and doth it not, is indeed no better then a rebell: how much more then is he that heares the word and Doctrine of saluation by Christ, and yet makes no conscience to doe the same, to be iudged for bad and barren ground, yea for a rebell against God himselfe. 1. Sam. 15. 25. Samuel telleth Saul that <hi>rebellion is as the sinne of witchcraft, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression is wickednesse and Idolatrie:</hi> And the reason is plaine, for they<note place="margin">How all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</note> that submit themselues to heare Gods word, are sundrie wayes bound to performe obedience: first, by the law of creation, as they are Gods creatures: Secondly, by the law of redemption, as they are Christs ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants bought by his precious blood: Thirdly, in regard of their Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they are, and at least hold themselues to be his children in Christ: and fourthly, in regard of his mercifull prouidence whereof we haue daily experience: in regard of all these we ought by way of thankfulnes, to shew our selues obedient vnto his word. And therefore he that heares the word of God and will not doe the same, sinneth grieuously against God, which in it kind God hateth as the sinne of witchcraft. Now this sinne of disobedience is a common sinne: We are all hearers, but where almost is the man that answerably is a doer?
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:14013:276"/>
Men content themselues with the bare action of hearing, like vnto the Papists who thinke God is well serued with the worke done: but the principall thing we omit, which is the treasuring vp of Gods word in our hearts, that vpon iust occasion we might practise the same: yea, which yet is more lamentable, men are so farre from yeilding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable obedience to the word, that the endeuour thereunto is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly iudged superfluous nisenesse and curious precisenesse: but this sinne of hearing and not doing will bring many fearefull iudgements vpon vs, vnles by true repentance it be cut off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> The propertie of this bad practise. It is a point of great<note place="margin">The follie of professors.</note> follie: <hi>he that heareth and doth not, shall be likened vnto a foolish man.</hi> This the author of all wisdome Christ himselfe auoucheth: and the holy Ghost by S. <hi>Iames</hi> doth notably describe this part of follie: <hi>They</hi>

                  <hi>that be hearers and not doers, deceiue themselues, beeing like vnto a man that beholdeth his naturall face in a glasse:</hi> either to spie out some spot, or discerne his owne countenance; <hi>but when he hath considered himselfe, he goeth his way, and forgetteth immediately what manner of one he was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, this follie will further appeare in this: if a man should shew forth great parts of wisdome in sundrie things pertaining to his bodie, and yet faile in the maine point of all, euery man would count his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome but follie: Now such are all they that heare the word of God and doe it not: they shew some parts of wisdome in comming to heare, and in seeking to vnderstand: and yet if they come not to practise, they faile in the maine point of their saluation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which indeed ought to be sought for in the first place.</p>
               <p>I. By this we may see how to correct and reforme our foolish<note place="margin">Our commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> error in iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging men to be wise.</note> conceite we haue of men in the world. We thinke of those that haue worldly wisdome to be able to goe beyond others in the greater affaires of this life, that they are the onely men, deseruing best place of gouernment both in Church and common wealth: But we must know, that these men, though they haue neuer so good heads for the things of this life, yet if they faile in the knowledge of this dutie to God, or in the practise thereof, are here by our Sauiour Christ noted with the brand of follie. The rich man in the Gospel had notable forecast for the augmenting of his wealth: when his substance increased, he could pull downe his barnes and make them greater, but yet because he failed in the maine point of his saluation, he is noted for a <hi>rich foole,</hi> Luk. 12. 20. And therefore in all sorts and estates of men, he is the wisest, who hath grace to know and answerably to obey the will of God.</p>
               <p>

This must excite vs to a carefull endeauour after true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<note place="margin">A motiue to obedience.</note> to God in all his commandements. We all desire to be freed from the reproach of folly among men, and we take it for a great disgrace to be counted fooles: well, if we would auoid this ignominie indeede, let vs be willing to heare, and carefull to obey the word of Christ, both in thought, word, and deede: otherwise, let men iudge as they list, God will account vs fooles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. Point.</hi> The practise of this follie, which consists in this; that <hi>he builds his house vpon the sands:</hi> whereby is signified another thing concerning the soule; namely, to build our saluation vpon insufficient foundation: and that doth euery hearer of Gods word that makes not conscience of obedience: for profession is as it were the erecting or rearing of an house: and the not performing obedience withall, is the<note place="margin">Who build on the sands. I. Papists. Concil. Trid. sess 6. cap. 7. 10. 16.</note> setting of this house vpon the sands. There be three sorts of men that thus build vpon the sands. I. The Papist that will be iustified and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Christ: but yet withall he must haue works of grace to concurre for the increase of his iustification, and for the accomplishment of his saluation. Now this is to build vpon the sands, when we ioyne workes with Christ in the matter of saluation: for though Christ be a sure rocke in himselfe, yet if we will fortifie him by our works, we fall from this rocke into perdition, and our foundation is no better then sand. Gal. 5. 2. <hi>Behold I Paul say vnto you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing:</hi> and, v. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Ye are fallen from Christ whosoeuer will be iustified by the law:</hi> in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>laces the Apostle labours to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the opinion of the Galatians learned of the false Apostles, which was, to ioyne works with Christ in the matter of iustification: Rom. 9. 32. <hi>Christ became vnto the Iewes a rocke of offence, when as they would be saued by the works of the law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A second sort that build vpon the sands, are the common Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants:<note place="margin">2 Common Protestants.</note> by whome I meane such as beare the name of Christians, and yet rest themselues contented and satisfied with their ciuill liues; thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that because they abstaine from outward euill and grosse sinnes, and doe no man wrong, therefore God will hold them excused: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they professe religion more for obedience to the lawes of men, then for conscience to God. But this will not serue the turne, these men though they professe Christ outwardly, yet in deede they denie him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for by their course (though it may be they thinke not so) they will needes become Sauiours, and so Christs vnto themselues: which thing they doe, when as they stay themselues on their owne ciuill life. The Scribes and Pharisies for outward actions were very godly, and many
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:14013:277"/>
of them liued vnblameably: but yet Christ saith to his Disciples, Math. 5. 20. <hi>Except your righteousnes exceede the righteousnes of the Scribes and Pharisies, ye cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen.</hi> 1. Cor. 4. 4. <hi>I know nothing by my selfe</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) and yet I am not thereby iustified:</hi> this was a notable thing, for a man to walke so vprightly in his calling, that his conscience could not accuse him of any offence against God or man, and yet this is nothing in the matter of Iustification, because eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man therein must answer to God.</p>
               <p>The third sort of those that build vpon the sand, is the Protestant<note place="margin">3 The more forward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant.</note> that is more forward in religion then the former: I meane such as doe heare the word and receiue it with ioy, bringing forth some good fruit thereof. It had beene hard, I must confesse, to haue called such men foolish builders, vnles Iesus Christ had reuealed them to be such: and yet that these doe build on the sand, it is plaine in the parable of the seede that fell on stonie ground, Luke 8. 13. whereby are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled such men as heare Gods word, and receiue it with ioy, and bring forth some fruit, but yet in the time of temptation doe fal away: for though they professed Christ, yet they were not founded on him, they wanted sound humilitie and true faith, which want in the time of peace they could not espie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uses.</hi> I. Seeing that men which heare and receiue the word of God with ioy, may build on a fandie foundation, we must pray to God for this one blessing, that he would write his word in our hearts by the finger of his spirit, as he writ the law on the tables of stone in Mount Sina: for our hearts are deceitfull, and will counterfeit grace till the time of triall come: now God hath promised this blessing to his Church in the new Testament, and therefore we must pray for it, that hauing his law written in our hearts, we may be the doers of it.</p>
               <p>II. This must mooue vs to looke vnto the deceitfulnes of our hearts: for faire shewes will not serue the turne in time of triall; and our hearts be deceitfull aboue all things: for when a man shall receiue the word with ioy, and bring forth some fruit thereof, how should he not thinke himselfe to be in a good case? and yet in time of triall this will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint him and deceiue him. Wherefore we must looke that in our profession we carie a true heart vnto God, and to our selues: and for this cause must see that we be throughly humbled in our selues for our sinnes, that we may make God and his feare to be our chiefe treasure; for which cause we must remember that we are not our owne, but Gods; and so must not haue the disposing of our selues, but subiect
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:14013:278"/>
our selues wholly to his will in all things: and if thus we make him our treasure, we shall be sure to make him our rocke also.</p>
               <p>III. We must not content our selues only to know Christ to be our Sauiour, and to imbrace religion in profession: but we must labour further to feele in our selues the power of Christs death to mortifie sinn in vs, and the vertue of his resurrection, to raise and build vs vp againe in newnes of life, learning to know Christ vnto our selues by experience in our selues: for knowledge in the braine will not saue the soule: but he that is truly founded on Christ, feeles the benefits of his death and resurrection in some measure in himselfe.</p>

Pet. 1. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> We now haue by Gods mercie true religion among vs, and<note place="margin">Our dutie in regard of trialls.</note> are freed from the bondage of the Turke, Iewe, and Papist: we must therefore stand fast in our profession, and not suffer our selues to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of true religion: for times will come when we must be tried: and therefore in this happie time of peace and truth, which is to vs the day of grace and mercie, we must labour seriously to haue our hearts indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with some good measure of lasting grace, as of faith, hope, and loue, which as good gold may abide the triall of afflictions; otherwise we shall not stand: for all painted shewes of grace in time of triall will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish

away like drosse and stubble before the fire.</p>
               <p>The second point in this effect, is the qualitie of this ruine and fall, it is great and fearefull; <hi>It fell, and the fall thereof was great.</hi> The thing resembled hereby is most fearefull, to wit, that such professors of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as in the daies of peace did not ioyne practise with their profession, shall fall away in the time of triall, and come to most fearefull perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: this is the principall point that Christ here aimes at, whereby he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to terrifie men from dissembled profession. And the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it must worke effectually in our hearts, for we by Gods mercie and blessing haue had the light of the Gospel for many yeares together in such measure as neuer was in this land before: and yet, though all of vs be hearers, where is our obedience? alas, some among vs grow to be flat and peremptorie Atheists, denying God and Christ Iesus; others and the most, vnder the name of religion, root their hearts in the world, some in profits, and some in pleasures, and none of these almost regard religion: others professe religion, and yet liue in grosse sinnes, as swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, drunkennesse, vncleannesse, &amp;c. making no conscience of grosse impietie in their liues: so that if we looke into the generall state of our people, we shall see that religion is professed, but not obeied: nay, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is counted precisenesse, and so reproached: but we must know that in the ende this prophaning of religion will soone turne all Gods blessings temporall and spirituall, into fearefull curses both of bodie and soule. If euer any thing bring ruine vpon vs, it will be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods word professed: and therefore let vs in the feare of God endeauour our selues not onely to know and heare the word of God, but to turne vnto God from all sinne, and especially in regard of this sinne of disobedience to the word of God.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Christ notes the qualitie of this fall to be exceeding great, to<note place="margin">Daunger of hypocrisie.</note> shew vnto vs the great daunger of hypocrisie: for there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene these three sorts of men: a sinner that makes no profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of religion, an hypocrite that makes a great shew of pietie in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and a true beleeuer whose life and conuersation is answerable to his profession. For a true professor may fall into sinne very fearefully, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> did, and yet recouer againe. Also he that is a most notorious sinner, as <hi>Manasses</hi> was, may be conuerted and repent. But when a professor that is an hypocrite in religion is tried, he falls quite from Christ, and makes apostacie from his profession; and in this regard his fall is called <hi>great.</hi> And therefore seeing professors may thus feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fall away; let vs in the feare of God labour in some truth of heart to yeild obedience to that we heare.</p>

               <p>These two verses containe the issue and euent of this Sermon of our Sauiour Christ in his hearers. And in them we may obserue two points: first, the good fruit that came of this sermon, v. 28. secondly, the cause &amp; reason thereof, v. 29. The fruit was the astonishing of the people: which <hi>S. Matthew</hi> sets out by three circumstances: I. of the time, when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, to wit, after the Sermon was ended: II. of the persons in whom it was wrought, <hi>the people,</hi> that is, the multitude: III. of the matter whereat they were astonished, namely, at the <hi>doctrine of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching this Astonishing of the people, in it many things are to<note place="margin">The maiesty of Christs ministerie.</note> be obserued: I. That though the person of our Sauiour. Christ were lowly and base, yet his doctrine in preaching was of that force in the minds of his hearers, for it did amase and astonish them. This caused the officers that were sent to take him to returne without him, allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the maiestie of his doctrine for the reason of their fact, <hi>Neuer man spake as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this man did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Ioh. 7. 46. and when the gouernours came with a band of men to apprehend him, so soone as he did but tell them <hi>he was the Christ,</hi> they went backward, and fell to the ground, Ioh. 18. 6.</p>
               <p>This sheweth vnto vs, that the voice and sentence of Christ giuen at the last day of iudgement will be most fearefull and terrible. For if his wordes were thus powerfull in his base estate of humilitie, what force will they then haue, when he shall come in glorie and maiestie in the cloudes, accompanied with thousands of Angels, when as his sight shall be so terrible, that men shall call to the mountaines to fall vpon them, and to the rockes to grind them in pieces, if it were possible? well, let the consideration hereof mooue vs to be obedient to his voice in the ministerie of his word; otherwise, will we nill we, we shall one day be subiect to that fearefull voice of condemnation, <hi>Goe ye cursed into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting fire.</hi>

               <p>This we are to obserue for speciall cause: for it is the ordinarie maner of the most of our hearers to marke more or lesse what is spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to approoue the doctrine, and to speake well of the minister, which be good things in their kind: but yet this is not enough: we must further labour to receiue the word by faith, to repent of our sinnes, and to conforme our hearts and liues vnto the word: Luk. 11. 27. when a <hi>woman,</hi> through admiration at Christs doctrine, <hi>pronounced her blessed that bare him, and the paps that gaue him sucke:</hi> Christ tooke occasion thence to giue vnto her, and to the rest of the hearers this lesson: <hi>nay, rather blessed are they that heare the word of God, and doe it.</hi> Act. 2. 37. at the first sermon of <hi>Peter</hi> after the giuing of the holy Ghost, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were greatly amased at his doctrine, and <hi>being pricked in conscience, cried, Men and br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thren, what shall we doe?</hi> now <hi>Peter</hi> suffers them not to stand still in this astonishment, but labours further to bring them to true faith and repentance, and to haue the same by baptisme confirmed vnto them, saying, <hi>Amend your liues, and be baptized,</hi> v. 38. And so<note place="margin">Act. 16. 27. 31</note> dealt <hi>Paul</hi> with the Iayler that would haue killed himselfe vpon the sudden sight of the prison doore beeing open; for after he was truly humbled he brought him to beleeue.</p>
               <p>It may be here demanded, why our Sauiour Christ at this Sermon<note place="margin">Quest. Why Christ conuerted so few. Act. 2. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> did no more to the most of his hearers, but caused them to wonder, when as the Apostles conuerted many thousands at some one Sermon; and after brought the whole bodie of the Gentiles to the faith. <hi>Ans.</hi> No doubt he was able to haue conuerted them all, and we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our selues here were many conuerted though it be not recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and though indeede the most were onely astonished. But this came so to passe that his promise made to his Disciples might be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Ioh. 14. 12. which was, <hi>that they should doe greater workes then Christ did;</hi> whereof this questionlesse was one, to conuert moe in their ministerie then Christ did. And the causes hereof were two: I. that our Sauiour Christ might shew himselfe willing to vndergoe that base e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of a seruant wherein he was borne and continued till his exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore he was content to restraine the power of his Godhead
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:14013:280"/>
euen from his ministerie, vntill he were exalted into glorie: II. that he might make it manifest in his Apostles times, that beeing ascended he did not onely sit at the right hand of his father, that is, rule as a king o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all in his princely office; but also that he did indeede gouerne his Church by his word and spirit: and this reason Christ addeth, Ioh. 14. v. 12. to prooue that his Disciples should doe greater workes then he did, <hi>because he went vnto his father,</hi> there to rule and gouerne his Church.</p>
               <p>It may yet further be asked, why Christ did not conuert them all, seeing he was able beeing true and very God? <hi>Ans.</hi> No doubt (as hath beene said) many were here conuerted, yet not all, because Christ was now <hi>the minister of circumcision,</hi> (as the Apostle speaketh) that is,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>om. 15. 8.</note> though in regard of his person he were the Prophet of the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church: yet at this time in this action he was preacher onely to the Church of the Iewes: in which regard he performed this dutie as man onely, and so could doe no more but deliuer his fathers will vnto them, and shew himselfe willing to conuert them. And in this manner he speakes vnto Ierusalem, Matth. 23. 37. <hi>O Ierusalem, Ierusalem,—how often would I haue gathered thy children, as a henne gathereth her chickens, I would, but ye would not:</hi> that is, as the minister of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in mine owne person, and as God in the ministerie of my Prophets. Thus much of the astonishment it selfe. Now follow the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whereby it is amplified and set out, and they are three.</p>
               <p>The first circumstance is the <hi>time</hi> when they were astonished, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>when the sermon was ended.</hi> No doubt they were amased in the<note place="margin">Silence in the holy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of the Church.</note> time of his deliuerie: but yet they were silent all that while and shewed no signes of their affection till the sermon was ended. And this good order ought to be obserued of all Gods people in the publike ministerie of the word. In the bulding of the materiall temple, there was no noise or knocking heard so much as of an hammer: whereby was signified that in the assemblies of the Saints where Gods spirituall temple is bulding, there should be the like heauenly order obserued; men should heare with quitetnes and silence, and shew their affection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> afterward.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are here taught to labour not onely to be affected in the Act of hearing while the doctrine is deliuered, but to treasure it vp in our hearts, that we may afterward be affected with it as this multitude was.</p>
               <p>The second circumstance here noted, is the <hi>persons</hi> who were thus astonied: to wit, the <hi>people</hi> or the <hi>multitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for after the sermon was
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:14013:280"/>
ended they gathered themselues into companies, and make knowne one to another the affections of their hearts toward Christs doctrine. Hence we may gather, that our Sauiour Christ deliuered his dostrine<note place="margin">Christ prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched plainly.</note> plainely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnto the conscience of the meanest, and to the capacitie of the simplest; els they could not thereby haue beene brought to wonder. And this is a president for all Ministers to follow in the dispensation of the word: so did Paul, 2. Cor. 4. 2. 3. in such plainenesse deliuer the word of God, that <hi>if it were hid,</hi> he saith, <hi>it was hid to them which perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third circumstance, is the <hi>obiect</hi> of their astonishment; that is, his <hi>doctrine: They were astonied at his Doctrine.</hi> This teacheth vs, that the word of God must be so deliuered, that the Doctrine it selfe<note place="margin">Carnall preaching.</note> may affect the hearers. It is a carnall thing for a man so to preach, as the consideration of his wit, of his memorie, of his eloquence, of his great reading may affect the hearers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many worthy parts (no doubt) were in our Sauiour Christ, for which he might well be admired; and yet in the dispensation of his word, he labours by his doctrine onely to affect his hearers: and so must all they doe that will be followers of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Point.</hi> Thus much for the fruite of Christs sermon: Now follows<note place="margin">The authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Christs ministrie.</note> the cause thereof, which is <hi>Christs authoritie</hi> in teaching, v. 29. <hi>for hee taught a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> heauenly doctrine; thus much his enemies the Scribes that came to tempt him did confesse, Mar. 12. 14. <hi>Master, thou art true, and teachest the way of God truly.</hi> And this was long before confirmed by <hi>Moses,</hi> who deliuered the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> promise of Christ vnto the people, <hi>into whose mouth God would put his word,</hi> Deut. 18. 18. and Ioh. 7. 16. Christ confesseth, that <hi>his doctrine was not his owne, but his fathers that sent him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. The manner of his teaching was heauenly: and this shewed it<note place="margin">2.

Christ taught in his owne name as a Lord of his doctrine, and not as a messenger or interpreter thereof, as the Prophets were: II. His speach and deliuerie was with speciall grace: Luk. 4. v. 22. <hi>The people wondred at the gratious words that proceeded out of his mouth,</hi> wherein he expressed his humilitie, his meekenes, loue, mercie, and compassion, plainly shewing by his speech that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with all gifts of the spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

And lastly, his zeale for his fathers glorie, and his earnest desire to bring the soules of men vnto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which were principall ends of his ministery, did also adde grace and authoritie thereto.</p>
               <p>III. The things that went with his doctrine did also cause autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie<note place="margin">3. things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying his ministery</note> in his ministerie; and these were two: I. <hi>Miracles;</hi> as curing the sicke, and casting out deuils; which did greatly confirme his doctrine vnto his hearers: Mark. 7. 37. when hee had cured one that was both deafe and dumbe, <hi>the people were beyond measure astonished.</hi> II. An <hi>vnblameable life;</hi> for hee was <hi>Iesus Christ the righeous,</hi> who performed all things that the law required, fulfilling the will of God in suffering, and suffering in his obedience.</p>
               <p>Further, note the phrase, in the originall it is said here, <hi>Hee was tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching;</hi> that is, it was his vsuall manner and custome, thus to preach with authoritie.

               <p>Secondly, hence also Gods ministers (if they wil be followers of<note place="margin">Right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</note> Christ) must learne not onely to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hee that can discourse well in Philosophie, cannot therupon presently preach &amp; dispense the word of God aright; for preaching is a spirituall dutie, which cannot be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by naturall gifts only.
