         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very man is to approve himselfe, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to God for his actions his conscience leads him to; and next, to good men, as much as in him lyeth. I have thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to enter into publique, for these reasons:</p>
            <p>First, because it is well knowne unto many, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore I suffered imprisonment, and a kind of banishment out of this good Land, for some acts construed to oppose, and as tending to subvert Episcopacie, and the setled Ecclesiasticall government of <hi>England</hi>: therefore now I desired to purge my self of so great a scandall; and wherein I have offended, to intreat all my Superiours, and others, to impute it rather to my ignorance, for the time, then any wilfull stubbornnesse.</p>
            <p>Secondly, seeing that since my comming home, I find that multitudes are corrupted with an opinion of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnesse of the Church-government by Diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, which opinion I beleeve is the root of much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; having now had experience of divers govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I see not how I could with faithfulnesse to God, my King and Countrey, be any longer silent, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering some of these late troubles occasioned, among other sins, I fear, much through this evill opinion. Happy
<pb facs="tcp:63984:3"/>
shall I be, if any be made wiser by my harmes; I wish all men to take heed, how they shake hands with the Church of God, upon any such heedlesse grounds as I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most had done.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that I might (though unworthy) in a fit season, acquaint the learned and pious Divines of <hi>England</hi> with these my slender observations, quaeres, and experiments, to the end they may come the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, upon any publique occasion, for the consideration of such matters, and so at length, those good things that are shaken among us may be established, and truth confirmed.</p>
            <p>It is enough for me, being a Student or Practiser at Law, faithfully to put a Case, which will be this: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Episcopall Government by Provinciall and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesan Bishops, in number about <hi>26.</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> being, if not of absolute Divine authority, yet nearest, and most like thereunto, and most anciently here embraced, is still safest to be continued?</p>
            <p>Or a Presbyterian government, being (as is humbly conceived) but of humane authority, bringing in a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous company of above <hi>40000.</hi> Presbyters to have chiefe rule in the keyes, in <hi>England,</hi> be fit to be newly set up here, a thing whereof we have had no experience, and which moderate wise men think to be lesse consonant to the Divine patterne, and may prove more intolerable then the said Episcopacie?</p>
            <p>Or an independent government of every congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Church ruling it selfe, which introduceth not onely one absolute Bishop in every Parish, but in effect so many men, so many Bishops, according to <hi>New-Englands</hi> rule, which in <hi>England</hi> would be Anarchie &amp; confusion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63984:3"/>I would entreat those that stand for this last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned manner of government, to be pleased to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>1.</hi> That the very terme of <hi>leading,</hi> or <hi>ruling</hi> in the Church, attributed to Elders, forbids it; for if all are Rulers, who shall be ruled?</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>2.</hi> The maine acts of Rule consist of receiving into the Church by Baptisme, or otherwise, and ejection out of the Church by censure, binding and loosing; now these are committed to the Apostles, and their successors, and not to all the members of the Church.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>3.</hi> All have not power to baptize, therefore not to receive into the Church, nor to cast out of the Church. <hi>My brethren, be not many masters,</hi> saith S. Iames, <hi>3.1. The words of the wise are as goads, and as nayles, fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one Shepheard,</hi> Eccles. <hi>12.11.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas some may say, that this power of ruling is but ministerially in the Officers, and initiatively, conclusively, and virtually in the people: If so, what power ordinarily have the people to contradict the ministeriall works and acts of their Officers? Must the whole Church try all those whom their Ministers convert abroad, suppose among Indians, before they may baptize them? How can all the Church examine and try such? All have not power, warrant, leisure, pleasure, ability, for, and in such works, nor can all speake Indian language.</p>
            <p>Doubtlesse the acts of rule by the Officers is the rule of the whole Church, and so to be taken ordinarily without contradiction, else there would be no end
<pb facs="tcp:63984:4"/>
of jangling: And thus taken, the whole Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> command, (<hi>sc.</hi> by their Ministers) were to put away that wicked person, and deliver him up to Satan, <hi>1 Cor. 5.13.</hi> and restore him, and forgive him, <hi>2 Cor. 2.</hi> and so all the doubt on that Text is (neer I think) resolved.</p>
            <p>Now that the government at <hi>New-England</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to make so many Church-members so many Bishops, will be plaine by this ensuing Discourse: for you shall here find, that the Churches in the <hi>Bay</hi> governe each by all their members unanimously, or else by the major part, wherein every one hath equall vote and superspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with their Ministers: and that in their Covenant it is expressed to be the duty of all the members, to watch over one another. And in time their Churches will be more corrupted then now they are; they cannot (as there is reason to feare) avoid it possibly. How can any now deny this to be Anarchie and confusion?</p>
            <p>Nay, say some, we will keep out those that have not true grace. But how can they certainly discerne that true grace, and what measure God requireth? Besides, by this course, they will (it is to be feared) in stead of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Gospel, spread heathenisme; in stead of gaining to the Church, lose from the Church: for when the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part are unbaptized, as in twenty years undoubtedly they will be, by such a course continued, what is like to become of it, but that either they may goe among their fellow-heathens the Indians, or rise up against the Church, and break forth into many grievous distempers among themselves? which God, and the King forbid, I pray.</p>
            <p>And that you (courteous Reader) may perceive I have
<pb facs="tcp:63984:4"/>
from time to time dealt cordially in these things, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring them impartially to my friends, as I received light, I shall adde in the last place certaine passages out Letters, sent by me into <hi>England</hi> to that purpose, and conclude.</p>
            <p>And I doe not this, God knoweth, as delighting to lay open the infirmities of these well-affected men, many of them my friends, but that it is necessary, at this time, for the whole Church of God, and themselves, as I take it: Besides, many of the things are not infirmities, but such as I am bound to protest against; yet I acknowledge there are some wise men among them, who would help to mend things, if they were able, and I hope will do their endeavours. And I think that wiser men then they, going into a wildernesse to set up another strange government differing from the setled government here, might have falne into greater errors then they have done.</p>
            <p>Neither have I the least aime to retard or hinder an happy and desired reformation of things amisse either in Church or Common-wealth, but daily and earnestly pray to God Almighty, the God of Wisdome and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, that he please so to direct his Royall Majesty, and his wise and honourable Counsell, the high Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that they may fall upon so due and faire a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as may be for the glory of God, and the peace and safety of his Royall Majesty, and all his Majesties dominions, and good Subjects. <hi>Vale.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their Church Covenant.</note>To forsake the Devill, and all his workes, and the vanities of the sinfull world, and all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer lusts, and corruptions, they have lived and walked in, and to cleave unto, and obey the Lord Jesus Christ, as their onely King and Law-giver, their onely Priest and Prophet, and to walke together with that Church, in the unity of the faith, and brotherly love, and to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves one unto an other, in all the ordinances of Christ, to mutuall edification, and comfort, to watch over, and support one another</p>
               <p>Whereby they are called the Chruch of such a place, which before they say were no Church, nor of any Church except the invisible: After this,<note place="margin">Election of their Church Officers.</note> they doe at the same time, or some other, all being together, elect their own Officers, as Pastor, Teacher, Elders, Deacons, if they have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63984:6"/>
fit men enough to supply those places; else, as many of them as they can be provided of.</p>
               <p>Then they set another day for the ordination of their said officers,<note place="margin">Their ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and appoint some of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to impose hands upon their officers, which is done in a publique day of fasting and prayer. Where there are Ministers, or Elders, before, they impose their hands upon the new Officers: But where there is none, there some of their chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest men, two or three, of good report amongst them, though not of the Ministery, doe, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the said Church, lay hands upon them. And after the said ordination, if there are any Elders of other Churches present, (as of late I have knowne divers have been present, under the names of the Messengers of the Churches) they give the new Officers the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,<note place="margin">The right hand of fellowship by messengers of Churches.</note> taking them by the right hand, every one severally, or else, sometimes, one forraine Elder, in the name of all the rest, gives the right hand of fellowship, with a set speech unto them. Notice is given in divers Churches or other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, before-hand, of the gathering of every Church, divers weeks before; and so also of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordination. And some Ministers, or others, as Messengers from other Churches, are usually present at such gatherings of Churches, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations: For sometimes, Magistrates, Captains, Gentlemen, and other meaner Brethren, are made messengers of Churches, for those and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purposes, never having had imposition of hands: And at planting of a Church, or gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63984:7"/>
as they tearme it, one of the Church mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers of forraine Churches, examines and tries the men to be moulded into a Church, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns their faith and repentance, and their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant being before ready made, written, subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and here read and acknowledged, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns and pronounceth them to be a true Church of Christ, and gives them the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, and all this in the name of Christ, and of all the Church-messengers present, and their Churches: so did Master <hi>Weld</hi> at the founding of <hi>Weymouth</hi> Church, or to this effect.</p>
               <p>And the generall Court will not allow of any Church otherwise gathered.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Some differ.</note>Some Ministers have there heretofore, as I have heard, disclaimed the power of their Ministery received in <hi>England,</hi> but others among them have not. Generally, for the most part, they hold the Pastors and Teachers offices to be distinct; the Teacher to minister a word of knowledg, the Pastor a word of wisdome, but some hold them all one; as in the Church of <hi>Watertowne,</hi> there are two Pastors, neither will that Church send any messengers to any other Church-gathering or ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How members are received, or added to the Church there.</note>When a man or woman commeth to joyne unto the Church so gathered, he or shee commeth to the Elders in private, at one of their houses, or some other place appointed, upon the weeke dayes, and make knowne their desire, to enter into Church-fellowship with that Church, and then the ruling Elders, or one of them, require,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63984:7"/>
or aske him or her, if he bee willing to make known unto them the worke of grace upon their soules, or how God hath beene dealing with them about their conversion: which (at <hi>Boston</hi>) the man declareth usually standing, the woman sitting. And if they satisfie the Elders, and the private assembly, (for divers of the Church, both men and women, meet there usually) that they are true beleevers,<note place="margin">The usuall termes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</note> that they have beene woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their hearts for their originall sinne, and actuall transgressions, and can pitch upon some promise of free grace in the Scripture, for the ground of their faith, and that they finde their hearts drawne to beleeve in Christ Jesus, for their justification and salvation, and these in the ministerie of the Word, reading or conference: and that they know competently the summe of Christian faith. And sometimes, though they be not come to a full assurance of their good estate in Christ. Then afterwards, in covenient time, in the publique assembly of the Church, notice is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by one of the ruling Elders, that such a man, or woman, by name, desireth to enter into Church-fellowship with them, and therefore if any know any thing, or matter of offence against them, for their unfitnesse to joyne with them, such are required to bring notice thereof to the Elders; else, that any who know them, or can say any thing for their fitnesse, be ready to give testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thereof, when they shall be called forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Church.</p>
               <p>If there be matter of offence, it is first heard

before the Elders,<note place="margin">Matters of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence how heard in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</note> and if the party satisfie them, and the offended, in private, for private offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and promise to satisfie in publique, for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique offences; then, upon another day, one of the ruling Elders calleth forth the party, by name, in the publique assembly of the Church, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore strangers, and whomsoever present, most commonly upon the Lords day, after evening exercises, and sometimes upon a week day, when all the Church have notice to be present.</p>

Then after some silence he proceedeth, Seeing no man speaketh to the contrary of his admission, if any of you know any thing, to speak for his receiving, we desire you, give testimony thereof to the Church, as you were also former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desired to be ready therewith, and expresse your selves as briefly as you may, and to as good hearing. Whereupon, sometimes, men do speak to the contrary, in case they have not heard of the propounding, and so stay the party for that time also, till this new offence be heard before the

Elders, so that sometimes there is a space of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers moneths between a parties first propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and receiving; and some are so bashfull, as that they choose rather to goe without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, then undergoe such <note n="*" place="margin">Whether Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Auricular confession, and these publique confessions be not extremes, and whether some private Pastorall or Presbyteriall collation, left at liberty, upon cause, and in case of trouble of conscience, as in the Church of England is approved, be not better then those extremes, I leave to he wise and learned to judge.</note> publique confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and tryals, but that is held their fault.</p>
               <p>But when none speaketh to the contrary,<note place="margin">Testimonials and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations.</note> then some one, two, or three, or more of the Brethren speak their opinions of the party, giving instances in some godlinesse and good conversation of his, or some other recommendation is made, and that they are willing (if the Church thereto consent) for their part, to give him the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship.</p>
               <p>Which done, the Elder turneth his speech to the party to be admitted, and requireth him, or sometimes asketh him, if he be willing to make knowne to the congregation the work of grace upon his soule; and biddeth him, as briefly, and audibly, to as good hearing as he can, to doe the same.</p>
               <p>Thereupon the party,<note place="margin">Publique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> if it be a man, speaketh himselfe; but if it be a woman, her confession made before the Elders, in private, is most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (in <hi>Boston</hi> Church) read by the Pastor, who registred the same. At <hi>Salem</hi> the women speake themselves, for the most part, in the Church; but of late it is said, they doe this upon the week dayes there, and nothing is done on Sunday, but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63984:9"/>
their entrance into Covenant. The man in a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne speech, sometimes a quarter of an houre long, shorter or longer, declareth the work of grace in his soule, to the same purpose, as that before the Elders formerly mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of faith.</note>Then the Elder requireth the party to make profession of his faith; which also is done either by questions and answers, if the party be weake, or else in a solemne speech according to the summe and tenour of the Christian faith laid downe in the Scriptures, defining faith, and shewing how it is wrought by the Word, and Spirit of God, defining a Church to be a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of beleevers gathered out of the world, by the Word preached, and holy Spirit, and knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by an holy Covenant, that there are in the Church remaining such and such officers, and members,<note place="margin">Officers in the Church.</note> as aforesaid: That is to say, Pastors and Teachers, ruling Elders, Deacons and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conesses, or Widowes; and such and such are their offices and duties in particular,<note place="margin">Their duties or offices.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor to exhort, and besides to rule; the Teacher to instruct in knowledge, and likewise to rule; the ruling Elder to assist Pastor and Teacher in ruling, as the Levites were given to the Priests for helps, and to see to whomsoever comming into, or to goe forth of the Church, by admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or excommunication; the Deacon to receive the contributions of the Church, and faithfully to dispose the same; the Deaconesses to shew mercie with chearfulnesse, and to minister to the sick and poore brethren;<note place="margin">Members du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> the members all, to

               <p>Notwithstanding,<note place="margin">A Sermon of</note> there was a Sermon lately made by Master <hi>Cotton</hi> in <hi>October, Anno</hi> 1640. upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. touching heresies, which was since commonly there called the Sermon of the twelve Articles, wherein was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that there are twelve Articles of Religion, which maintained by any, the Church may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and keepe fellowship with them; but the ignorant of them after instruction and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous sins unrepented, exclude from the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Church.<note place="margin">twelve Articles of Religion.</note> The said Articles were to this effect: First, that there are three Persons in one God, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Spirit. Secondly, that this God made, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all the World, and that he is a rewarder of the good, and punisher of the evill. Thirdly, that this God alone is to be worshiped. Fourthly, this worship of God is instituted in his written Word, not the precepts of men. Fiftly, that from the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> we have not so worshiped God, but have all sinned, and deprived our selves of the reward promised, and therefore are under the curse by nature. Sixthly, that we are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture utterly unable to rescue our selves from this curse. Seventhly, that Jesus Christ the eternall Sonne of God, in fulnesse of time took upon him our nature, and was made flesh for us, and by his death and sufferings, redeemed his elect from sin, and death. Eighthly, that Christ Jesus, and salvation by him, is offered, and given in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63984:10"/>
Gospell, unto every one that beleeveth in his name, and onely by such received. Ninthly, that no man can come unto Christ, nor beleeve on him, except the Father draw him by his Word and Spirit. Tenthly, whom the Lord draws to him by his Word and Spirit, them he justifies free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his grace, and according to his truth, not by works. Eleventhly, where the soule is justified, it is also regenerate and sanctified. Twelfthly, this regeneration and sanctification is still imperfect in this life. And unto all is added this generall Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, That such as walke after this rule, shall arise to everlasting life; and those that walk other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, shall arise to everlasting condemnation, in the day of Judgement: That the knowledge and beliefe of these are of the <hi>foundation of Religion:</hi> But things touching the <hi>foundation of Churches,</hi> as Baptisme, Imposition of hands; ignorance in these may hinder the measure of our reward in heaven, not communion with the Church on earth. Exceptions against the Apostles Creed were these: That it is not of necessity to beleeve Christs descent into hell in any sense; That it is not in that Creed contained, that the Scripture is the onely rule of Gods worship; nor doth it so directly set forth the point of Justification.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This done, sometimes they proceede to admit more members, all after the same manner, for the most part, two, three, foure, or five, or more together, as they have time, spending sometimes almost a whole afternoone therein.<note place="margin">Their ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</note> And then the Elder calleth all them, that are to be admitted, by name, and rehearseth the covenant, on their parts, to them, which they publiquely say, they doe promise, by the helpe of God, to performe: And then the Elder, in the name of the Church, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Churches part of the covenant, to the new admitted members.

But these opinionists are held, by the wiser sort, not to know the dangerous issues and consequences of such tenets.

all actions and causes civill and criminall, and also Ecclesiasticall, especially touching non-members: And they themselves say, that in the generall and quarter Courts, they have the power of Parliament, Kings Bench, Common Pleas, Chancery, High Commission, and Star-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and all other Courts of England, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers cases have exercised that power upon the Kings Subjects there, as is not difficult to prove.

                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:63984:18"/>
And a draught of a body of fundamentall laws, according to the judiciall Laws of the Jews, hath been contrived by the <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and offered to the generall Court to be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and published to the people to be considered of, and this since his Majesties command came to them to send over their Patent: Among which Lawes, that was one I excepted against, as you may see in the paper following, entituled, <hi>Of the Church her liberties, presented to the Governour and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, a by-law, to that or the like effect, hath been made, and was held of force there when I came thence: yet I confesse I have heard one of their wisest speak of an intention to repeale the same Law.</p>
               <p>Matters of debt,<note place="margin">Tryals.</note> trespasse, and upon the case, and equity, yea and of heresie also, are tryed by a Jury. Which although it may seeme to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and the Magistrates may judge what is Law, and what is equall, and some of the chief Ministers informe what is heresie, yet the Jury may finde a generall verdict, if they please; and seldome is there any speciall verdict found by them, with deliberate arguments made thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which breeds many inconveniences.</p>
               <p>The parties are warned to challenge any Jury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man before he be sworn; but because there is but one Jury in a Court for tryall of causes, and all parties not present at their swearing, the liberty of challenge is much hindred, and some inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies doe happen thereby. Jurors are returned
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63984:19"/>
by the Marshall, he was at first called the Bedle of the Societie. Seldome is there any matter of record, saving the verdict many times at randome taken and entred, which is also called the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And for want of proceeding duly upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, the government is cleerely arbitrary, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the discretions of the Judges and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates for the time being. And humbly I appeale to his royall Majesty, and his honourable and great Counsell, whether or no the proceedings in such matters as come to be heard before Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Judges, be not fit to be upon Record; and whether Registers, Advocates, and Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, be not necessary to assist the poore and unlearned in their causes, and that according to the warrant and intendment of holy Writ, and of right reason. I have knowne by experience, and heard divers have suffered wrong by default of such in <hi>New-England.</hi> I feare it is not a little degree of pride and dangerous improvidence to slight all former lawes of the Church or State, cases of experience and precedents, to go ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer out new, according to severall exigencies; upon pretence that the Word of God is sufficient to rule us: It is true, it is sufficient, if well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. But take heede my brethren, despise not learning, nor the worthy Lawyers of either gown, lest you repent too late.</p>
               <p>The parties in all causes, speake themselves for the most part, and some of the Magistrates where they thinke cause requireth, doe the part of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates without fee or reward. Most matters
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63984:19"/>
are presently heard, and ended the same Court, the party defendant having foure dayes warning before; but some causes come to be heard again, and new suits grow upon the old.</p>
               <p>Profane swearing,<note place="margin">Prophanenesse beaten downe.</note> drunkennesse, and beggers, are but rare in the compasse of this Patent, through the circumspection of the Magistrates, and the providence of God hitherto, the poore there living by their labours, and great wages, proportionably, better then the rich, by their stocks, which without exceeding great care, quickly waste.</p>

               <p>WHereas you have been pleased to cause me to transcribe certain Breviats of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, delivered to the last generall Court, for the establishing a body of Lawes, as is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for the glory of God, and the wel-fare of this People and Country; and published the same, to the intent that any man may acquaint you, or the Deputies for the next Court, with what he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives fit to be altered or added, in or unto the said lawes; I conceive it my duty to give you timely notice of some things of great moment, about the same Lawes, in discharge of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which I shall, as <hi>Amicus curiae,</hi> pray you to present with all faithfulnesse, as is proposed, to the next generall Court, by it, and the reverend Elders, to be further considered of, as followeth:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is propounded to be one chiefe part of the charge, or office of the Councell intended, to take care, that the <hi>conversion</hi> of the <hi>Natives</hi> be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is proposed, as a liberty, that a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <note n="*" place="margin">Although some have held that three or two may make a Church, yet I have heard Master <hi>Cotton</hi> say, that a Church could not be without the number of sixe or seaven at least, and so was their practise while I was th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63984:21"/>
to plant together in this Jurisdiction, may gather themselves into a Church, and elect and ordaine their Officers, men fit for their places, giving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to seven of the next Churches, one moneth before thereof, and of their names, and that they may exercise all the ordinances of God according to his Word, and so they proceede according to the rule of God, and shall not be hindered by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Civill power; nor will this Court allow of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Church otherwise gathered.</p>
               <p>This clause <hi>(nor will the Court allow of any Church otherwise gathered)</hi> doth as I conceive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the first proposition.</p>
               <p>My reasons are these.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. If the <hi>conversion of the Natives</hi> must be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, then some wise and godly men (they should be of your <hi>gravest and best men</hi>) must bee sent forth to teach them to know God.</item>
                  <item>2. When such are sent, they must bee either sent immediately by the Lord, or mediately by his Churches.</item>
                  <item>3. If the Churches send men, they that are sent must be sent by imposition of <hi>hands of the Presbyterie.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:63984:21"/>Now when Churches are thus gathered or planted, they are gathered by Ministers, doing the works of Apostles and Euangelists, which hath ever been, and is the ordinary and regular way of gathering or planting Churches, (and not as is proposed, a convenient number of Orthodoxe Christians, gathering themselves into a Church) and yet when such a Church is gathered by Church-messengers and Ministers, this Court is advised not to allow the same; which, I conceive, is to say, The conversion of the Natives shall not be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, orderly, according to the rule of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, it would be considered, that when men are sent forth, whether they should not be sent forth <hi>two,</hi> and by <hi>two</hi> at least, as the Scriptures beare, and for divers good reasons, which lye not hid to your wisdomes.</p>
               <p>That you would be pleased to shew unto the Elders these things to be considered, and that they would well weigh, whether or no those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Messengers sent by-Churches, should not visit the Churches which they plant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Other things there are, wherein, I think, I could also, to good purpose, move somewhat to your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, which lyes more directly in the way, and calling, I have been educated, if I were required, but this thing lying upon my <hi>conscience,</hi> I could not well passe by: Wherefore I shall request it may be considered.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Whether it be not fit to leave out, at least,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63984:22"/>
that contradictory clause, <hi>viz. Nor will this Court allow of any Church otherwise gathered?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. Whether it be not better to let the liberty run thus, in generall, <hi>The holy Church of God shall enjoy all her just liberties?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Then consider, whether by the Kings leave, some Churches may not be appointed to send their chiefe Pastors, and other Ministers, to doe such works.</p>
               <p>Also with some kind of subjection, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of authority of the Ministerie in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if it be but by way of advice, which is cleare to me you may doe:</p>
               <p>I make no doubt but in all things requisite for the state of the Country, they will yeeld you all faire liberties.</p>
               <p>Nay, I am perswaded, the Kings Majesty will not send any unexperienced Governour to afflict, but make you Patentees againe, or at least, after the manner of other Plantations, restoring not onely favour, but other benefits, whereof, under God, to us <hi>Englishmen,</hi> he is the Fountaine. The Kings Attorney did offer some of you this in my hearing, I meane, the renewall of your Patent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:63984:22"/>Nay further, if you would invent, and devise what the King may doe for the Country, you might obtaine.</p>
               <p>The very conversion of these poore naked people, which is very hopefull, and much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for <hi>per accidens,</hi> or Gods owne providence, bringing good out of evill, will rejoyce the hearts of all Christians in our deare native Countrey, and here: and of it selfe (if there were no other desirable things here, as blessed be God there are many) would cause a continued confluence of more people then you can tell well where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow for the present.</p>
               <p>The Fishing trade would be promoted with authority.</p>
               <p>Hereby would you give the greater testimony to the cause of Reformation.</p>
               <p>Hereby will you, under God and the King, make Church-work, and Common-wealth work indeed, and examples to all Countryes.</p>
               <p>You will enrich your Countries both, in short time. The Heathens in time, I am perswaded, will become zealous Christians, then will they labour, get cloathes, and substance about them. In vaine doe some think of civillizing them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the sword, or otherwise, till (withall) the Word of God hath spoken to their hearts: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I conceive great advice is to be taken.</p>
               <p>For which purpose a Presse is necessary, and may be obtained, I hope, so that wise men watch over it.</p>
               <p>Consider how poorely your Schooles goe on,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63984:23"/>
you must depend upon <hi>England</hi> for help of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men and Schollers, bookes, commodities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite almost.</p>
               <p>No doubt but the King, this way, will make your authority reach even to the Dutch South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to the French Northward. <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> indeede without fraction. A facile way, taking out the core of malice.</p>
               <p>The conversion and subduing of a Nation, and so great a tract of ground, is a work too weighty for subjects any much longer to labour under without Royall assistance, as I apprehend, I think, in religious reason.</p>
               <p>If any shall suggest, that your Churches may send forth men of their own authority;</p>
               <p>Consider, if it may be done warrantably by the Word of God, as peradventure it may be so.</p>
               <p>Yet you will be in danger, <hi>rebus sic stantibus,</hi> of great imputations.</p>
               <p>That you infringe <hi>Regall power,</hi>
               </p>
               <p> And Ecclesiasticall.</p>
               <p>Wheron adversaries will sure enough make fearfull worke.</p>
               <p>And besides, some reformations (under favour) have been too deep, at least for others to follow.</p>
               <p>They were also unexperienced of mission to convert Infidels.</p>
               <p>Is <hi>Geneva</hi> without her faults? or <hi>Holland, Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam, Amsterdam,</hi> without theirs? what experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they of mission, or ever had?</p>
               <p>Now I beseeech you grave Sir, doe you thinke it good, honourable, safe, for us poore men here,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63984:23"/>
or for the Religion and Professors thereof in generall, in the whole world, that such as have the name of the most zealous, should be the first example of almost utmost provocation to our owne Soveraigne?</p>

That he</hi> (the said Father, and other holy men of the Church) <hi>suffered the tumultuous perplexities of other mens causes touching secular affaires, either by determining them by judging, or in cutting them off by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties: which labour</hi> (saith he) <hi>we endure with consolation in the Lord, for the hope of eternall life. To which molestations, the Apostle tyed us, not by his owne judgement, but by his judgement who spake in him.</hi> Besides, should they judge these things, and labour for, and watch over us in the Lord, and not be recompenced as long as they doe well? I speak not to countenance undue exactions, bribes, or other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. I intend brevity, and therefore make bold to refer my Reader to the many learned arguments both in Law-books and Divinity of this subject.</note> Probats of Testaments, and granting of Letters of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, are made and granted in the generall or great quarter Courts. At Burials, nothing is read, nor any Funeral Sermon made, but all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, or a good company of them, come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by tolling of the bell, and carry the dead solemnly to his grave, and there stand by him while he is buried.

Of late some thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty persons went in two small Barks for the <hi>Lords Isle of Providence,</hi> and for the Maine thereabout, which is held to be a beter countrey and climate by some: For this being in about 46. degrees of northerne latitude, yet is very cold in winter, so that some are frozen to death, or lose their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or toes every yeere, sometimes by carlesnes, sometimes by accidents, and are lost in snowes, which there are very deepe sometimes, and lye long: Winter begins in October, and lasts till Aprill. Sixty leagues Northerly it is held not habitable, yet again in Summer it is exceeding hot. If shipping for conveyance were sent thither, they might spare divers hundreds of men for any good design. The jurisdiction of the <hi>Bay</hi> Patent reacheth from <hi>Pascattaqua</hi> Patent Northeast to <hi>Plymouth</hi> Patent Southward.

Seldome they are abroad in extremity of Winter, but keep in their <hi>wigwams,</hi> till necessity drives them forth; and then they wrap themselves in skins, or some of our English coorse cloth: and for the Winter they have boots, or a kind of laced tawed-leather stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins. They are naturally proud, and idle, given much to singing, dancing, and playes; they are governed by <hi>Sachems,</hi> Kings; and <hi>Saggamores,</hi> petie Lords; by an absolute tyrannie. Their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are of comely feature, industrious, and doe most of the labour in planting, and carrying of burdens; their husbands hold them in great sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, yet never knowing other, it is the lesse grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to them. They say, <hi>Englishman</hi> much foole, for spoiling goodworking creatures, meaning wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: And when they see any of our <hi>English</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men sewing with their needles, or working coifes, or such things, they will cry out, Lazie <hi>squaes</hi>! but they are much the kinder to their wives, by the example of the <hi>English.</hi> Their children, they will not part with, upon any terms, to be taught. They are of complexion swarthy and tawny;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63984:30"/>
their children are borne white, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawbe them with oyle, and colours, presently. They have all black haire, that I saw.</p>
               <p>In times of mourning, they paint their faces with black lead, black, all about the eye-brows, and part of their cheeks. In time of rejoycing, they paint red, with a kind of vermilion. They cut their haire of divers formes, according to their Nation or people, so that you may know a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by their cut; and ever they have a long lock on one side of their heads, and weare feathers of Peacocks, and such like, and red cloath, or rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands at their locks; beads of <hi>wampompeag</hi> about their necks, and a girdle of the same, wrought with blew and white <hi>wampom,</hi> after the manner of chequer work, two fingers broad, about their loynes: Some of their chiefe men goe so, and pendants of <hi>wampom,</hi> and such toyes in their ears. And their women, some of the chiefe, have faire bracelets, and chaines of <hi>wampom.</hi> Men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of them, come confidently among the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish.</hi> Since the <hi>Pequid</hi> war, they are kept in very good subjection, and held to strict points of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, so that the <hi>English</hi> may travail safely among them. But the <hi>French</hi> in the East, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the South, sell them guns, powder and shot. They have <hi>Powahes,</hi> or Priests, which are Witches, and a kind of Chirurgions, but some of them, notwithstanding, are faine to be beholding to the <hi>English</hi> Chirurgions. They will have their times of <hi>powaheing,</hi> which they will, of late, have called Prayers, according to the <hi>English</hi> word. The
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63984:30"/>
                  <hi>Powahe</hi> labours himselfe in his incantations, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame sweating and wearinesse, even to extasie. The <hi>Powahes</hi> cannot work their witchcrafts, if any of the <hi>English</hi> be by; neither can any of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations lay hold on, or doe any harme to the <hi>English,</hi> as I have been credibly informed. The <hi>Powahe</hi> is next the King, or <hi>Sachem,</hi> and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he dyes, the <hi>Powahe</hi> marryes the <hi>Squa Sachem,</hi> that is, the queene. They have marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges among them; they have many wives; they say, they commit much filthinesse among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But for every marriage, the <hi>Saggamore</hi> hath a fadome of <hi>wampom,</hi> which is about seven or eight shillings value. Some of them will dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently attend to any thing they can understand by any of our Religion, and are very willing to teach their language to any <hi>English.</hi> They live much the better, and peaceably, for the <hi>English</hi>; and themselves know it, or at least their <hi>Sachems,</hi> and <hi>Saggamores</hi> know so much, for before they did nothing but spoile and destroy one another. They live in <hi>Wigwams,</hi> or houses made of mats like little hutts, the fire in the midst of the house. They cut downe a tree with axes and hatchets, bought of the <hi>English, Dutch,</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> &amp; bring in the butt-end into the <hi>wigwam,</hi> upon the hearth, and so burne it by degrees. They live upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched corne, (of late, they grinde at our <hi>English</hi> mills.) Venison, Bevers, Otters, Oysters, Clammes, Lobsters, and other fish, Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, Akornes, they boyle all together in a ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Their riches are their <hi>wampom,</hi> bolles, trayes,

kettles, and spoones, bever, furres, and canoos. He is a <hi>Sachem,</hi> whose wife hath her cleane spoons in a chest, for some chief <hi>English</hi> men, when they come on guest wise to the <hi>wigwam.</hi> They lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mat, with a stone, or a piece of wood under their heads; they will give the best entertainment they can make to any <hi>English</hi> comming amongst them. They will not taste sweet things, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their habit willingly; onely they are taken with tobacco, wine, and strong waters; and I have seene some of them in <hi>English,</hi> or <hi>French</hi> cloathes. Their ordinary weapons are bowes and arrowes, and long staves, or halfe pykes, with pieces of swords, daggers, or knives in the ends of them: They have Captaines, and are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good at a short mark, and nimble of foot to run away. Their manner of fighting is, most commonly, all in one fyle. They are many in number, and worship <hi>Kitan,</hi> their good god, or <hi>Hobbamocco,</hi> their evill god; but more feare <hi>Hobbamocco,</hi> because he doth them most harme. Some of their Kings names are <hi>Canonicus, Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomy, Owshamequin, Cushamequin, Webbacowitts,</hi> and <hi>Squa Sachem</hi> his wife: She is the Queene, and he is <hi>Powahe,</hi> and King, in right of his wife. Among some of these Nations, their policie is to have two Kings at a time; but, I thinke, of one family; the one aged for counsell, the other younger for action. Their Kings succeed by inheritance.</p>

               <p>And particularly, Master <hi>Peter</hi> went from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> on foot to <hi>New Dover,</hi> alias <hi>Pascattaqua,</hi> alias <hi>Northam,</hi> to appease the difference betweene Master <hi>Larkham</hi> and Master <hi>K.</hi> when they had been up in Armes this last Winter time.

               <p>Againe he went a second time, for appeasing

the same difference, and had a Commission to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Gentlemen, master <hi>Humfrey,</hi> master <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streate,</hi> Captaine <hi>Wiggon,</hi> and master <hi>Simons,</hi> to assist, and to heare and determine all causes civill and criminall, from the <hi>Governour of the Bay,</hi> under his hand, and the publique seale, and then master <hi>K.</hi> went by the worst.</p>
               <p>Master <hi>Wilson</hi> did lately ride to <hi>Greens harbour,</hi> in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Patent, to appease a broyle betweene one master <hi>Thomas,</hi> as I take it, his name is, and master <hi>Blindman,</hi> where master <hi>Blindman</hi> went by the worst, and Captaine <hi>Keayne</hi> and others went with master <hi>Wilson</hi> on horseback.</p>

               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the which I received an Answer the same day:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO the first, the Answer is affirmative; for though the people in this Countrey are not wont to gather themselves into a Church, but (as you would have it) with the presence and advice of sundry Ministers; yet it were lawfull for them to gather into a Church without them. For if it be the priviledge of every Church to choose their owne Ministers, then there may be a Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have Ministers of their owne; for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of another Church have no power but in their owne Church.</p>
               <p>To the second and third; The second and third <hi>Questions</hi> are coincident, and one Answer may serve for both: The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> did impose hands upon the <hi>Levites, Num.</hi> 8.10. and if the people have power to elect their owne officers, they have power also to ordaine them; for Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is but an Installment of a man into that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63984:33"/>
office, whereto election giveth him right, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse such a Church as hath a <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> ought to ordain their Officers by a <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> according to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Answer was brought me by Master <hi>Oliver,</hi> one of the Elders, and Master <hi>Pierce,</hi> a Brother of <hi>Boston.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When I was to come away, one of the chiefest in the Country wished me to deliver him a note of what things I misliked in the Country, which I did, thus:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doubt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. WHether so much time should be spent in the publique Ordinances, on the Sabbath day, because that thereby some necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duties of the Sabbath must needs be hindred, as visitation of the sick, and poore, and family.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether matters of offence should be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely handled, either before the whole Church, or strangers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether so much time should be spent in particular catechizing those that are admitted to the communion of the Church, either men or women; or that they should make long speeches; or when they come publiquely to be admitted, any should speak contradictorily, or in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of any, unlesse before the Elders, upon just occasion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether the censures of the Church should be ordered, in publique, before all the Church, or strangers, other then the denunciation of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63984:33"/>
the censures, and pronunciation of the solutions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whether any of our <hi>Nation</hi> that is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ignorant or scandalous, should bee kept from the Communion, or his children from <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. That many thousands in this Countrey have forgotten the very principles of Religion, which they were daily taught in <hi>England,</hi> by set forms and Scriptures read, as the Psalmes, first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Lesson, the ten Commandments, the Creeds, and publique catechizings. And although concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Prayer be good and holy, and so publike explications and applications of the Word, and also necessary both in and out of season: yet for the most part it may be feared they dull, amaze, confound, discourage the weake and ignorant, (which are the most of men) when they are in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary performed too tediously, or with the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the Word read, and other premeditated formes inculcated, and may tend to more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and inconvenience, then many good men are aware of.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I doubt there hath been, and is much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of endeavours, to teach, civilize, and convert the <hi>Indian Nation,</hi> that are about the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Whether by the received principles, it bee <hi>possible</hi> to teach, civilize, or convert them, or when they are converted, to maintain Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship among them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That electorie courses will not long be safe here, either in Church or Common-wealth.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:63984:34"/>10. That the civill government is not so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually administred, nor can be, divers orders or by-laws considered.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That unlesse these things be wisely and in time prevented, many of your usefullest men will remove and scatter from you.</p>

(would to God I had known it sooner) which while I have in my place stood for here these two years, and not agreeing to this new discipline, impossible to be executed, or long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, what I have suffered, many here can tell; I am kept from the Sacrament, and all place of preferment in the Common-wealth, and forced to get my living by writing petty things, which scarce finds me bread; and therefore sometimes I look to planting of corne, but have not yet here an house of my owne to put my head in, or any stock going: Whereupon I was determined to come back, but by the over-entreaty of some friends, I here think to stay a while longer, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that the Lord will shortly give a good issue to things both in our native Country, and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and here, as well as in all other his Majesties dominions.</p>
                     <p>I was very glad to see my Lord Bishop of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Book; it gave me much satisfaction. If the people may make Ministers, or any Ministers make others without an Apostolicall Bishop, what confusion will there be? If the whole Church, or every congregation, as our good men think, have the power of the keyes, how many Bishops then shall we have? If every Parish or congregation be so free and independent, as they terme it, what unity can we expect?</p>
                     <p>Glad also was I to see Master <hi>Balls</hi> Book of the tryall of the grounds of Separation, both which are newly come over, and I hope will work much good among us here.</p>

                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:63984:40"/>And whereas I was sometimes mis-led by those of opinion that Bishops, and Presbyters, &amp; all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, are of the same authority; When I came to consider the necessary propagation of the truth, and government of the Church, by experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall foot-steps here, I quickly saw my error: For besides, if the congregations be not united under one Diocesan in fit compasse, they are in a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, notwithstanding all their classicall pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, how can the Gospel be propagated to the Indians without an Apostolicall Bishop? If any Church, or people, by the Kings leave, send forth Ministers to teach and instruct the poore Indians in the Christian Religion, they must have at least Apostolicall power to ordain Ministers or Elders in every congregation among them; and when they have so done, they have power of Visitation where they plant: Nor can they without just cause be thrust out from government without great impiety; and where they have planted, that is their line or Diocese. Thus I came to see, that of necessity a Diocese, and Bishop Diocesan, is very neere, if not altogether of Divine authority.</p>
                     <p>I am also of opinion, that it were good for our Ministers to learne how to doe this work from some of our reverend Bishops in <hi>England,</hi> for I feare our Ministers know not how to goe about it. Whether must not some Ministers learne their language? It is a copious language, as I am informed, and they have as many words to expresse one thing as we have. And when they teach Indians to pray, will they not teach them
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63984:40"/>
by a forme? and how can Gods worship be maintained among ignorant persons without a forme? I am firme of opinion, that the best of us have been much beholding to the Word read, and formes of Prayer.</p>

                     <p>IN a word or two, we heare of great disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in our deare native Countrey; I am hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily sorry, &amp;c. I beseech you take my briefe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; We here are quite out of the way of right government both in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as I verily think, and as far as I can judge upon better consideration, and some pains taken
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63984:41"/>
in searching after the bottome of some things. Some electorie wayes tend to the overthrow of Kingdomes: No such way for government of Englishmen, as a Monarchie; of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as by Diocesan Bishops in their line: Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yeeld to many pressures in a Monarchie, then for subjects to destroy, and spoile one another. If I were worthy to advise a word, I should desire you to have a care, and so all your friends, you prejudice not your estate, or poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by too much opposing the Regall power: For I verily beleeve the Kings Majesty hath in generall a good cause touching Episcopacie: My reasons I could better deliver in presence, if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God give opportunity to see you, or if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it hereafter, I will be ready to present my thoughts unto you. All this, as I shall answer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, without any by-respects. If you were here, I presume you would see more then I can, but I think you would be much of my mind.</p>

                     <p>YOu knew my condition and employment, and how ill it went with me in <hi>England,</hi> by reason of the trouble of our friends, and my own danger therby. For my outward subsistence here, at this time, God knowes it is but meane; some say it is my owne fault, and that I stand in my owne light, and you, and others may so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; but the God of heaven is my witnesse, I have endeavoured in all things to keep a good conscience, though sometimes I have failed; I have endeavoured, laying all by-respects aside, to joyne with the Church here, but cannot yet be satisfyed in divers particulars, whereby I am kept from all place of employment or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I have had overtures made unto me of, if I would or could yeeld, but hitherto I have not dared to doe it, for good reasons best knowne to our heavenly Witnesse. I must give you a taste.</p>
                     <p>They hold their Covenant constitutes their Church, and that implyes, we that come to joyne with them, were not members of any true Church whence we came, and that I dare not professe. Againe, here is required such confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and professions, both in private and publique, both by men and women, before they be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that three parts of the people of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try remaine out of the Church, so that in short time most of the people will remaine unbaptized, if this course hold, and is (we feare) of dangerous consequence, a thing not tending to the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63984:42"/>
of the Gospel in peace: Which, though it have a colour of sanctimony and strictnesse, whereby many well-affected or affectionate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but weak in sound experience and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are the rather drawn thereunto, and they are in a manner necessitated to it, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their election of Magistrates and Ministers in their owne way of popular or Aristocraticall government; I dare not (for my part) yeeld unto neither in my own conscience, nor for the credit of those persons with whom I have been educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in whose causes I have been seen. A Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is the best government for Englishmen; better to suffer some pressures under that kind of government, then to spoile one another with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular elections. Againe, I cannot yeeld to Lay-Elders, nor that Lay-men should impose hands upon any to the Ministerie, nor that any Minister should renounce his calling to the Ministerie which he received in <hi>England,</hi> as Antichristian: It is a grosse error, and palpable schisme; then our Baptisme is not right, and so there will be no end of separations. Also I beleeve there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Church, without a true Minister; nor can any gather themselves together into a Church without a true Minister; nor can they ordain their own Ministers; ordinarily, I meane; what may be done in an extraorninary case, <hi>pro prima vice,</hi> is another question; I hold there ought to be an Apostolicall Bishop, by succession from Christ and his Apostles, superiour in order or degree to his brethren; which Bishop ought to ordain, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63984:42"/>
rule with other Presbyters, or alone, but Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cannot without him. And if so be any thing in word or act passed from mee to the contrary hereof, I do professe it was in my ignorance. Their calling is of Divine authority, or nearest thereunto, else the Church of God could not have subsisted in any tolerable way of peace, through all this by-past time of 1600. yeeres. I feare they know not what they say, that say the contrary: let them come here, they will quickly change their minde, if they study the point, and follow it home; for, besides the keeping of peace and unity, and a pure and able learned Ministery, how can the Gospell be propagated without some speciall Ministers, having the power Apostolicall, to goe forth to convert <hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Pagans</hi>? If a Pastor, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, or Christian, of any Church shall doe so, what hath he to doe with Infidels? as hee is a Pastor, he is no Pastor to them. Therefore if any are sent to convert, and establish Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Infidels, such as are sent are Apostolick messengers, Bishops or Ministers to them, and ought to be sent with fasting and Prayer, and by imposition of hands of the Presbytery, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving converted Infidels, may plant Churches, and ordain Ministers among them, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards visit them; and is not this Episcopacie, and their line wherein they have gone their Diocesse? These things naturally flow from, and are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Word, or equity thereof, and meere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. Now if all Ministers should ordinarily have this authority, to go forth to these works,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63984:43"/>
without mission, what quarelling there would be for division of Lines or Dioceses, let the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of former ages tell, yea of the Apostolique times, wherein were not wanting those that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe, about his Line or rule, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. Now unto this confusion, tends the opinion, that saith, a Bishop and Presbyter is all one and equall; it is of <hi>Acrius,</hi> it is false, and it is confusion. The reformed Churches and Writers that held so, had little experience of mission to convert &amp; plant Churches among Infidels. That reformation goes too deep that tends to pulling downe of Cathedrall Churches, and Bishops houses: Should not Apostolick Bishops, and the chiefest Ministers have houses to dwell in, and Churches to recide and officiate in, whither all the Churches of their Line may send and come together in Councel, or Synod, and so do nothing of great moment without their Bishop, a <hi>Timothy,</hi> or a <hi>Titus</hi>? Again, Baptisme is admission and initiation into the Church; to whom Baptisme is commited, <hi>viz.</hi> Apostles and Apostolick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, they have power of admission, that is, of loosing, and consequently of binding, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication or expulsion. Where is now the peoples power in the keyes? are they all Apostles, and Apostolick Ministers? what confusion is this? who can yeeld to it knowingly? I beseech you pardon my zeale, and when you have considered all, pity my condition, and pray for me still. Well I am assured, that master <hi>Prynne</hi> &amp; master <hi>Burton</hi> would never yeeld to these things, especially,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63984:43"/>
if they had experience of them. It is good for us to see our errours, and acknowledge them, that we may obtain peace in the day of account.</p>

                     <p>SOrry and grieved we are at the heart, to heare of the troublous estate and condition of our native countrey; wee here also meete with our troubles and distresses in outward things, and some in spirituall matters also. Here wants a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple commodity to maintain cloathing to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. And for my own particular, hitherto I have beene much distressed here by reason I cannot yet so clearely understand the Church proceedings, as to yeeld to them, there are therein so many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult considerations, that they have sometimes bred great confusion in my thoughts. Never since I saw you have I received the Sacrament of the Lords supper. I have disputed in writing, though to my great hinderance, in regard of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, yet blessed be the Lord, to my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter satisfaction at the last. I never intended open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to oppose the godlyhere in any thing I thought they mistooke, but I was lately taken at advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and brought before the Magistrates, before whom, giving a quiet and peaceable answer, I was dismissed with favour, and respect promised me by some of the chiefe for the future. Our chiefe difference was about the foundation of the Church and Ministery, and what rigid separations
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63984:44"/>
may tend unto, what is to be feared, in case the most of the people here should remaine unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; considerations which may trouble the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest among us. Rigid separations never did, nor can propagate the Gospell of Christ, they can do no good, they have done hurt. It is dangerous to found Church government on dark &amp; uncertain interpretations of Propheticall, or other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; foundations ought to be full of evidence, &amp; demonstration. Blessed be the Lord, now some of the chiefe leaders of the Churches here hold the Churches in <hi>England</hi> true Churches, and your Ministery lawfull, though divers corruptions there may be among you; yea some there bee of the chiefe among us that conceive the government by godly Bishops superintendent over others to be lawfull. Churches are not perfect in this world. We may not for every disagreement in opinion, or for slender pretended corruptions, separate from the Church: separate so once, and no end of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>

               <head>To conclude.</head>
               <p>SUppose there are foure sorts of Government, which are used in Church, as in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; Monarchicall absolute without Lawes, which is tyrannie; Monarchicall bounded by Lawes; Aristocraticall, and Democraticall: Episcopall absolute, which is Popish tyrannie;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63984:44"/>
Episcopall regulated by just Lawes; Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and Congregationall: Which of these will all men like, and how long? Some have well compared the humour of the people in this kind, to a merry relation of an old man and his sonne, passing through the streets of a City, with one horse betweene them: First, the old man rode, then the people found fault with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse, in that he did not cause his son to ride with him: then the young man gets up too, now the people say they are both unmercifull to the beast: downe comes the old man, then the young man is unmannerly to ride, and his father walk on foot: at last downe goes the young man also, and leads the horse, then they were both unwise to lead the horse, and neither of them to ride. Well, but alter the inconstant vulgar will; if so, God grant it be for the better. But then consider stories, one alteration follows another; some have altered sixe times, before they were setled againe, and ever the people have paid for it both money and bloud.</p>
               <p>Concerning Church-government, what the Presbyterian way is, and how sutable for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Monarchie, I leave to the pious experienced Divines to set forth, and the Church and State thereof to judge.</p>
               <p>And for the Congregationall independent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whereof I have had some experience, give me leave instead of a better intelligencer thus to present to my deare countrey, now in a time of neede, my impartiall opinion in these confused
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63984:45"/>
papers: And in brief-thus: Although it had some small colour in Scripture, and a great pretence of holinesse, yet no sound ground in the Scripture; Again, if it be neither fit nor possible long to bee continued in <hi>New-England,</hi> as not I alone, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more eye and eare witnesses doe know, and the learned can and will judge undoubtedly, it must needes be much more unfit and impossible to be brought into <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or any other populous Nation.</p>
               <p>All which upon the whole I humbly submit unto the sacred judgment and determination of holy Church, his royall Majesty, and his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses great and honourable Councel, the high Court of PARLIAMENT.</p>
