         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd no lesse honoured Lord. I see
many make use of your lines,
few acknowledge, none return
to give thanks: but no cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
like the fellony of wit;
for hee which theeves that, robs the
owner, and coosens all that heare him.
Why I presume to make use of your name, is
not hard to divine; your interest being so
just, and great, both in the man, and
matter: it is not my respect onely, but your
right; and for encouragement, your own words
may serve mee for a sufficient both plea,
and protection. It is your Lordships, that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
of love, feare not to be ill taken of
<pb facs="tcp:21296:3"/>
strangers.</hi> Nor could I more fitly dedicate
this Book, which (so much crossing the stream
of natur all corruption) may happily provoke
some insolent, yea, potent offenders.</p>
            <p>I cannot so over esteeme these lines, as to
hold them worthy your judicious eyes, much
lesse your patronage: yet, as the case standeth
with mee, it would bee no lesse then injurious,
not to look so high; and I should offend, if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
not. Benefits received, are bonds obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory:
and if so, both my duty and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
make my best services your debt, and if
neither of these, my most endeared affection:
VV hether should the Riverreturn, if not to the
Occan, from whence it received it's streams?
And I have not alone watered my Garden
from your Fountain; but a great part of this
my Candleslight, took it's being (next the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods word) from the shining Lamp of
your Workes. Many of these are Flowers from
your Garden, Sciences from your Orchard, I
have taken a great part of my Seed from your
Granary: if I shall seeme to saucy, in plucking
and taking them, without leave from the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
I humbly crave, that restitution and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
may serve for part of amends.
If this Posie and new fruit answer your sent
and tast, I have obtained my desire: or if the
<pb facs="tcp:21296:3"/>
graine of this new Crop chance to differ, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the fault to the Soyle, and Seeds-man;
though it was not my purpose to impaire the
quality, by improving the quantity.</p>

Wax; from another, Honey; from a third,

Daw, which was drest and pranked in other
Birds feathers, being otherwise naked and

this Nosegay of strange Flowers, I have put
little of mine owne, but the Thread to bind
them; and that to all this Frame, I have not
much more then made the Pins, which fasten

the Magazine of my memory is better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with matter, then the Store-house of
my invention; yet each are so meanly, as I am
forced both to pity and disdaine my felfe.</p>
            <p>Who knoweth not, that the suggestion of
one new thought, is harder, and better, then
many repeated? wherein your Lordship excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> you loath to repeate any thing
againe, be it never so pleasing, or profitable;
as it appeares by your compositions you do: yet
far be it from you, to barre others that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit;
when the same God, by whose Spirit
your Pen was guided, gave command, that
his children should lay up his words in their

and between their eyes, teach them their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
repeat them sitting and walking, lying
down, and rising up, yea, write them upon the
posts and gates of their houses.</p>
            <p>Besides, experience shewes that the oftner
these Nayles are hammered, the deeper they
pierce; and pierce too deep they cannot; for five

which caused <hi>Alexander</hi> to bee angry with
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> for making his Bookes common:
and a peevish condition, which made <hi>Aspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
that cunning Musitian, to play always
<pb facs="tcp:21296:6"/>
so softly on his Harpe, that none conld heare
but himselfe. Vertue is destributive, and had
rather accommodate many with selfe-injury,
then bury benefits that might pleasure a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
and that which is good of it selfe, is so
much the better, by how much the more it is
communicated; yea, to conceale goodnesse is a
vice.</p>

            <p>If then I detract not from their worth, who

but such incongruous, and untuneable de

as piety, humility, affability, temperance, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,

and the like; which by a rare and happy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination,
have met together, as Diamonds

God, and pray for the continuance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease

Wherefore I will passe over with a dry

that they are onely led by sensuality, that

streame comparable to the mire wherein
they wallow, that seeming a heaven to
them which to a sober and religious man
is little better then an hell; yea, who
thinks it not lesse labour to plow all day,
then to pot it, that it is a taske almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicible,
to make them owne those words
and behaviours when they are sober,
which in their pots they were authors
of, that notwithstanding drink hath often
made them as sicke as ever was Sea-man,
and exposed them to a thousand perills,
yet they are never the wiser afterwards,
that they have no more conscience nor
feare of God, then beasts: yea, tell them
of God, their hearts will make reply, as

thinke to beare off the judgments of God
with head and shoulders, that like bruite
beasts they will beleive nothing but
what they are led to by sense, that they
consider no more how time passeth away
then a beast is able to tell the clocke;
whereupon their departure is commonly
so suddaine, that when they looke for a
pleasant peale, behold, it is their passing
bell, that they are no more ashamed of
their deeds then beasts; yea lesse, for a
very Dog, though he cannot blush, will
goe away, as if he were ashamed, when he
hath done a shrewd turne, and is taken in

1 First, it is not so bad to be a Beast, as<note place="margin">Beasts know when they have enough</note>
for a man (who hath more noble endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
to live like a beast, which is the
Drunkards case, who in their practise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
beasts, saving that beasts are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
better then they: as for example, beasts,
whether Horses, Oxen, or any other
brutish creature (as knowing when they
have enough, when once they have drank
sufficient to quench their thirst, and to
satisfie nature) have so much reason
and good manners in them as to forbeare
to drinke any more then they neede; yea,
they cannot be forced by any violence to
drinke againe; which shewes that excesse
is a most unnaturall and abominable sin:
whereas the drunkard drinks double and
treble, yea, ten times more then hee
needs, and not onely satisfies nature, but
also gluts and oppresseth it with superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
even unto surfeit.</p>
                     <p>Yea, this even one of their owne Poets
have confest; who, when his wife askt
him whether hee were not ashamed to lye
drunke in the streets like a beast; replyed,
thou lyest like a whore, for if I were a
beast I would not be drunke. I marvell
how a Drunkard could give so good a
reason.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:21296:15"/>
Neither is this all, for as beasts know
when they have enough, these brutish
Animals are so far from having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over their affections, from putting
a knife to their throate when they have
taken enough, as <hi>Salomon</hi> adviseth, <hi>Pro.</hi>
23. 2. that they will be ready to sheath it
in the Drawers belly, if hee shall but offer
to set bounds to their throats; at least
they will unblesse themselves, when
meanes, and time, and company, will not
permit another Sacrifice to their <hi>Bacchus</hi>
(their belly) so that to say the truth, and
give beasts their due in this particular, it
is a wrong to beasts, to call drunkennesse
their sinne, for generally they are sober,
and these so much worse then beasts, as
they ought to be better.</p>

and whereas other sinnes deprive a
man of Gods Image, this deprives him
of mans, leaving him neither the use of
reason nor speech, without which (but
for the name and dimensions of a man) he
is no better then a beast, as the Foole said
of his Coulestaffe, when he rid upon it
into the water; as good no horse but
for the name of a horse: yea, the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
soule is made a slave to his sense,
and whilst this rebells, she that worst may
must hold the Candle.</p>
                     <p>Now a man having lost the use of his
soule, is worse then a beast which keeps
the use of his instinct; yea, a man that
hath lost his senses, is therein worse then
a beast that hath them, as sure as a living
Dog is better then a dead Lyon: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this regard also the Drunkard
should have a name inferiour to that of
beast, and not be reputed so good.</p>

onely of the use of his reason, but
also of his senses; not of his understanding
alone, but of his standing and motion also;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21296:16"/>
beasts have no reason, no more have
they, but beasts can use their limms, and
so cannot they: drinke not onely robs
him of reason and speech (which two
things distinguish beast and man) but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of sense and motion, wherein beasts
excell stocks and stones, yea, it so blocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
him for the present, that neither hand
nor foote can doe their office, as <hi>Terence</hi>
hath it.</p>
                     <p>It is no rare thing in our swinish age,
for men to imitate the ancient <hi>Persians,</hi>
who though they were able to carry
themselves into their banquetting rooms,
yet they were alwayes carried out of
them; in which case they can neither
prevent future danger, nor feele present
smart: why, he is gone, according to the
Drunkards phrase, that is gone in his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
gone in his standing, gone in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
                     <p>Indeede, as there is a meane in drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
which is lawfull, so there bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of drunkennesse: the first draught
f wine comforteth the heart and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
the second inflames the liver, the
third fumeth into the head, and makes
men fooles, the fourth quite takes away
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21296:16"/>
their senses, and makes them to adore
their god <hi>Bacchus,</hi> like beasts upon all
foure, or rather like blockes, as having
never a leg to stand upon; so what is
feighned of <hi>Proteus, viz.</hi> that he was
transformed, first, into a Lyon, then into
a boare, and at last into a tree, is really
verified in many a Drunkard: as have
you not knowne some of them towards
their latter end, in <hi>Cleomenes</hi> condition,
who carrousing after the manner of the
<hi>Scythians;</hi> dranke so much, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
and continued ever after senselesse.</p>
                     <p>What shall I say of a Drunkard? that
little mouth of his, hath swallowed
downe himselfe, his paunch hath buried
the wine, and in the wine is his wit buried,
his senses, his soule, and perhaps his last
wealth; yea, hee is dead as well as buried:
for you may ring a bell in his eare, hee
heares not, much lesse can he speake, yea
scoffe him, rob him, spurne him if you
will, he feeles not, he stirres not, much
lesse can he quarrell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Matheolus</hi> writing of the Asses of
<hi>Thuscia,</hi> saith, that when they have fed
upon Hemlockes, they sleepe so soundly
that they seeme to be dead, in so much as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21296:17"/>
the countrymen many times more then
flea off halfe their skins before the Asses
will awake; these Drunkards are such
Asses, when they have drunke stiffe, and
are fallen asleepe, you may halfe flea
them before they will awake: I have
knowne it so in effect by one of them,
whom no violence, or paine could awake,
so that hee is more like a stocke or stone
then a reasonable or living creature.</p>
                     <p>Or if he be not so dead as a dore naile,
yet at least the drinke hath turned him
out of dores, for whosoever would
speake with him, must stay untill hee
come home againe to himselfe: and
hereupon, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> in his childhood
was asked by his Grandfather <hi>Astyages,</hi>
why at such a feast hee dranke no
wine? he returned this answere, full of
witty simplicity: because, said he, I tooke
it to be poyson, for I have seene it to
spoyle men of their wit, sense, speech,
health, strength, and motion: neither
proves it lesse hurtfull to Drunkards
then ranck poyson, but farre more; for
it intoxicateth the braine, benummeth
the senses, enfeebleth the joynts and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes,
and bringeth a man into a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21296:17"/>
Lethargy, besides the evill that it
brings to the soule, which is farre worse;
so that a beast is a man to such a man: for
what is he better then a walking tankard
at best, as <hi>Aurelius</hi> called <hi>Bonosus,</hi> that
quaffing Emperour, who afterward (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overcome by <hi>Probus</hi>) hanged himselfe,
leaving this to be spoken in his praise, that
he was not borne to leade an Army, but
to lift a pot. But in case aforesaid, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when they have drunke themselves
deafe, and blind, and dumbe, nay, dead
and senselesse, to what can I so firly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them, as to the Idolls of the heathen,
which have eyes, and see not; eares, and
heare not; tongues, and speake not; noses,
and smell not (no not their owne vomit)
hands, and handle not; feete, and walke
not, being as dead men, that can neither
sit, stand, nor goe, nay worse by farre: for
hee that is dead, can doe neither good nor
ill, but drunkards are dead to all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
whatsoever; and alive, yea, very
active to all wickednesse; so that their

beasts that pepith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 12. 20.</p>
                     <p>But admit the best, namely, that they
are beasts, you cannot but grant that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21296:18"/>
these uncleane beasts, which wallow in
the mire of sensuality; these brutish
Drunkards, which transforme themselves

whom the Legion carries headlong to the

                     <p>Or will they have themselves to be
men? Surely to come to drinke, as to a
Sacrifice unto the belly, is a most base
and brutish Idolatry; and what men are
they like, or to whom may they fitly be
compared? surely unto none, except
<hi>Epicurus,</hi> who maintained, that sensuall
pleasure was the only <hi>Summum bonum:</hi> or
<hi>Cerinthus</hi> the Hereticke, who verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived,

where, being a few live embers, hee fell

had his belly puckerd together like a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell,
before the Chamberlaine could
come to helpe him; whereupon, being in
great torture, hee dranke off twenty two
double jugs of beare, and so dyed, roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and crying that he was damned, for
breaking his vow which he had made of
reformation: some againe fall into the

their faces, bruise their bodies, breake

a temporary forfeiture of the wits,

                     <p>The wine, which of it selfe is a good

taken, of excellent use; becomes to them
which use it to surfeir, as the water of the

those mad that drinke of it: other vices
doe but alter and distract the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whereas this utterly subverteth the

makes a man a beast, but drunkennesse
makes a man mad, and if so, how odious
is this sinne! For if it be a hatefull thing
for a man to wound his owne flesh, and
willfully to maime the members of his
body; how abominable is it to wound
the mind it selfe, and to offer violence
unto our reason and understanding! If it
be a crime to offer violence against the

upon the King himselfe, and to pull him

out of his Regall throne, must needs bee
condemned as an outragious wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                     <p>Or lastly, suppose them men, they are
but like that man spoken of, <hi>Marke:</hi> 5. 2. to

And indeed as in Justice, all vertues are

are lapt up together as it were in a bundle,
for it is a confluence or collection of all
the rest: and as he said of old, prove a
man to be ingratefull, and you prove him
naught all over; so prove one to bee a
Drunkard, and you prove him guilty of
every thing that is evill, reprobate to all
that is good: for what sinne is it which a
drunken man will sticke to commit,
when wee reade that <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his Sonne
being drunke, slew his Father, and his
Mother great with child, hurt his two
Sisters, and defloured one of them, as <hi>St.

Drunkennesse, Adultery, or Murther; he
chosing the first, in his drunkennesse he
abused the wife of him in whose house he
was, and her husband comming in the

that one, he committed all three: which

that shall admit of more wine then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;

is, endure such rogues for her bed-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
(so many filthy lusts as are in the

as smoake drives Bees from their hive:
so drunkennesse drives all the graces from

Holy-Ghost (which delights to dwell in

be an inmate, where drunkennesse is an
inhabitant; noysome lusts, and evill co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations
drive him away; if the Divell

And therefore the Scripture tells us, that
the spirit went from <hi>Saul</hi> when he sinned,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 14. and so on the contrary,
when the Holy Spirit enters into the

of sinne in any heart, when there is
a perpetuall concourse of all filthinesse,
hinders, yea, kills every good motion as
fast as it springs up; and this is a sinne
which turnes a man wholly into sinne.
The Drunkard resembles <hi>Vejovis</hi> that
Heathen god, who could doe no good,
but hurt at will: and is like Ahab, who
sold himselfe to worke wickednesse; yea
worse, if worse can be, for the Drunkard
wholely dedicates, resignes, surrenders,
and gives himselfe up to serve sinne and
Sathan; his whole imployment is onely
to drinke, drab, quarrell, sweare, scoffe,
slaunder, and seduce; as if to sinne were
his trade, and he could doe nothing else;
like the Devill, who was a sinner from
the beginning, a sinner to the end. To
say that sinne were in him, would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,
for hee is nothing else but sinne
in the abstract, as <hi>St. Austin</hi> speakes, even
a very <hi>Chaos</hi> of sinne bunged up, for as
when a man is overcome with anger, we
say hee is in heate; and when wee say
such a man is in drinke, we imply more
then that drinke is in him; yea, when we
call a man a Drunkard, we imply more
then that he is drunke, or hath beene
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21296:27"/>
drunke, for it argues frequency; and
lastly, as when <hi>Simon Peter</hi> told <hi>Simon
Magus</hi> thou art in the gall of bitternesse,
and in the bond of iniquity, hee implyed,
that not onely these were in him, but hee
in them: so both more is implyed, and it
is more proper to say of a sotted and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Drunkard, hee is sinne, then a sinner;
yea, that man of sinne is not fuller of sin,
then such an one: so that as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith,

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21296:29"/>
shorten the life; the procurer of all infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and acceleration of death; which
is the reason that men are ordinarily now

                     <p>Neither can there be any other cause al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged,
why men in this our age are so
weake, diseased, and short lived, but our
excessive drunkennesse and intemperance.</p>
                     <p>It is true indeed, that the world now
waxing old, and, as it were, hoarehea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
cannot generate children of such
strength and vigour as it did in time of
youth and full strength; and therefore
wee must needs decline, as the world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth:
it is true also, that the mother
earth is infeebled with much bearing,
and hath her strength much abated with
so innumerable childbirths, and being
now come to her cold melancholy age,
cannot bring forth her fruits so full of
vertue and strength, and so fit for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
of our bodies, as shee did in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times: but that there should be such
a change, so suddaine and extraordinary,
in the great difference of our health,
strength, and long life, betwixt this our
age, and that which went next before it;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21296:30"/>
can be imputed unto nothing more, then
that now drunkennesse and intemperance
is, after an extraordinary manner, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
whereby the naturall and vitall
heate of men is drowned, and extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
before it be neare spent; like a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle

                     <p>Indeed, drunkards pretend they drinke
healthes, and for health. Yea, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they thinke wine another kinde of
Panace, which is good for all diseases;
or some Moly, good against all sorcery
and mischiefe. But to whom, saith <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
are all kinde of diseases, infirmities,
deformities, if not to Drunkards? Who
can recount the hurts that by this meanes
come to the whole body, especially the
head, stomack, liver, and the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Rhumes, Gowts, Dropsies, Aches,
Imposthums, Apoplexes, Inflammations,

which Drunkards know better

To whom are pearle faces, Palsies,

and, in short, plagueth the whole man
with diseases of a Horse, the belly of a

Believe a man in his owne Art;
The distempered body, the more it is
filled, the more it is spilled, saith <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates:</hi>
and to this the Prophet sets his
seale, <hi>Hosea:</hi> 7. 5.</p>
                     <p>And indeed but for the throats indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;
<hi>Paracelsus</hi> (for all his Mercury)
had dyed a begger: which made <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes</hi>

feede upon graines with <hi>Diogenes,</hi> in his

with him, in this standing cup; for of all
the gods, said hee, I love not <hi>Aesculapius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a word: though wine, being mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
taken, is physicall; yet, if it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
immoderately, there is nothing more
banefull, saith <hi>St. Austin:</hi> for by it the
body is weakened, strength decayed, the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21296:31"/>
members dissolved, the whole body di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered,
and out of order; so that the
Drunkard drawes death out of that
which preserves other mens lives.</p>
                     <p>That many have perished by this
meanes we read, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 37. 30. 31, &amp; if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
then, surely many millions now: for
in former ages it was as rare, as now it is
common. For wee read that the <hi>Locrians</hi>
would not permit their Magistrates to
drinke wine; whereas now with us, the
meanest (by their good wills) will drinke
nothing els. We read also that the ancient
<hi>Romans</hi> would not suffer their women to
drinke wine; whereas many of ours are
like <hi>Cleio,</hi> who was so practised in drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
that shee durst challeng all men
whatsoever to trye masteries who could
drinke most, and overcome all. And
lastly, wee reade that they would never
drinke wine before they were twenty
yeares of age; whereas many of our
children are halfe killed, before they
are borne, with distempered drinkes:
at least, when they are borne, no
day, no meale, must they be without sip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
downe wine, their over indulgent
parents (who like Apes, many times kill
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21296:31"/>
their young with making much of them)
will have it so: whereupon not a few be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Drunkards and company keepers
very betime, and before any would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;
as <hi>St. Hierome</hi> telleth of one, that

so early, that no one so much as drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of it.</p>
                     <p>In a word, wine and strong drink hath
drowned more men, then the sea hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured;
and more dye of surfeits, then
by the sword. Yea, as drunkennesse hath

35. Bee not deceived with shewes and
shadowes; a man may be drunke, though
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21296:32"/>
his eyes be not out; and may be deceived,
though his eyes be in too. All is not gold
that glisters, all is not paid that is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
wine promiseth much for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
but it will deceive thee in the end: it
promiseth health, but it payes sicknesse;
it promiseth comfort, but thou shalt find
sorrow; it promiseth helpe, but thou shalt
receive hurt; it is a poysoned potion, a
flattering, but cruell Hyaena: much like
that double headed serpent Amphisbae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
or one of those Locusts, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 9. 10.
that carries a sting in the taile, though the
face bee smiling and flattering. Not that
wine in it selfe (which is a good creature
of God) is any way evill, or the use of it
unlawfull. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was out, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
all the Vines to prevent drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
he had done farre better, if he had
made more Wells, that so the heat of the
wine might have beene alayed with the
coldnesse of the water. For though God
will not allow us to be drunk with wine,
yet he doth not forbid us to drinke wine:
use a little wine for thy stomacks sake,
and thine often infirmites, sayes <hi>Paul</hi> to
<hi>Timothy, 1 Tim.</hi> 5. And give strong drink
to him that is ready to perish, and wine to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21296:32"/>
them that have griefe of heart, are the
words of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 6.
But a little proofe will serve the turne to
perswade men that wine is lawfull; all the
matter is, how to have them use it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                     <p>And thus the drunkard is injurious to
his body. First, by deforming it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

                     <p>OF which there is a double reason.
First,<note place="margin">Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the cause of murther.</note> as they are fiery of face, so are
they as cholerick of condition; and how
should they choose, when they feed only
upon fire, their bread, and flesh, their first
and second course, being drinke, and salt
meates (which turneth all their nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into choller, the froth of blood)
yea, little else then drinke doe they swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
for, that they are no trencher-men
is all their boast, and all they have to bee
proud of: yea, they drinke downe their
throats, belch out of their mouthes, and
breath out of their nostrells, nothing but
meere flames: yea, that which theyvent
forwards is the same, for it comes out as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21296:34"/>
sheere wine as it goes in. Now no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
that <hi>Starchaterus</hi> did exceed other
men in strength and savagenesse; when
he fed onely upon Beares flesh, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
drank their blood.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, another reason is, when the
drink is in, the wit is out and so having
lost the stern of reason, hee is apt to say
or doe any thing hee can stand to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
except vertue, a meere stranger to
him.</p>
                     <p>And it shall go hard but he will either
give offence, or take it: for having once
fallen out with his owne wits, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
(that one goes one way, and another
another way) he can agree with no body,
but becomes raging mad, as a heathen
hath it in <hi>Salomons</hi> words. A drunken
man, you know, will make a fray with his
own shadow; suppose he but nods against
some post or table (for they will even fall
a sleepe as they sit) he is so stupified, that
in revenge he will strike his opposite for
the wrong, and then call for drinke to
make himselfe friends againe, which
friendly cup gives occasion of a second
quarrel; for whether he laughs, or chafes,
he is a like apt to quarrell; or let but a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21296:35"/>
friend admonish him, hee were as good
take a Beare by the tooth.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Cambyses</hi> being drunk was admo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nished

O that either wealth, or any other bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

suppose he bee a labouring man, and must
earne it before he have it, he will drinke as
much in a day (saith <hi>St. Ambrose</hi>) as hee
can get in a weeke, spend twelve pence
sooner, then earne two pence. And
hence it commeth to passe, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

                     <p>Thus the Drunkard having spent all in

he is constrained to drinke water: yea,
hee throwes his house so long out at win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,

unthrift, an Epicure, a belly-god, a filthy
beast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea what sinne is so disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?
what can discredit a man more, then
to be counted a common drunkard? yea,
this sinne bringeth such an ill name upon
a man, that it will never bee done away;
at least so long as he lives in this sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance.</p>
                     <p>Wherein could <hi>Noah</hi> (that was but
once drunke) have so much shamed and
dishonoured himselfe? how could hee
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21296:42"/>
have made himselfe so contemptible, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to his owne children, as he did by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drunk? so, what greater shame to any
man, then to make himselfe a beast, yea,
worse then a beast, in his gesture, behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
nonsense, and abominable spewing?
besides his communication, his cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
his lusts, and affections, are all most
beastly and shamefull: so that nothing
disguiseth or disgraceth a man more.</p>
                     <p>Neither need others defame him: for
he either spues himselfe out, or gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to be spurned out of all civill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                     <p>In briefe, all that are sober minded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
drunkards but the very scumme of
the Nation, and good for nought but
to stand in the middest of a breach,
when the Ordnance play, and bullets flie
thick about their eares. And certainly
there is nothing in the world more piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
an Ape-carrier is honourable, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with a drunkard; and heare but
their wives speak, you will grant that his,
of the two, is farre more happy in her
choyse.</p>
                     <p>Yea, it is such a sinne, for which a man
shall bee disgraced even of his drunken
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21296:43"/>
companions themselves; who murther
him behind his backe, by taking away his
good name; howsoever they seeme to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
him before his face.</p>
                     <p>And no man thinkes him sit or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to beare the meanest office either in
Church or common-wealth; nay, he is
not able to subject himself to, or be ruled
by, either civill or ecclesiasticall Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
(indeed he often disturbes the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of both) nay, hee is so farre from all
respect, that he either is, or should be, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from all Christian society, and
thrown out of the Church by excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, he thinks to get credit and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
applause by his drinking, to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
commend him, forsooth, for a good
fellow, and joviall, and so purchase a
name: but indeed hee gets the name of a
common drunkard, which will sticke by
him to his dying day, and perhaps after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
yea, let him be commended by one
for a notable good fellow, (which is the
height of his ambition) another that is
wiser, will reply, the better the worse.</p>
                     <p>Again, who will trust a drunkard with
either money or commodity? A frugall
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21296:43"/>
man that is worth but little, shall be trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with more, then a drunkard which
hath tenne times his estate: and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for the one his diligent hand maketh
him rich, while the drunkards belly
makes him go in rags.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, to borrow of every man hee is
very importunate; but to pay he never u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
except it be his Hostesse for super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
liquor, that when money failes,
hee may drinke upon credit; as hee is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
indebted to my Hostesse, and his
belly to him, but he never to that, so long
as his purse, credit, or shame, can make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with it.</p>
                     <p>Yea, in many cases they will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
themselves unworthy to be trusted;
for they have an order amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(which you may see set up in Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mionds

Bonds, Indentures, or any other convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
whatsoever, made or caused to bee
made in the afternoone, bee utterly void,

set forth a book of his drunkennes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he proved those pranks which he play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(when he was overcome with wine) to
be good and lawfull: though in all reason
he that doth evill in his drinke, should bee
twice punished; first, for being drunke,
then, for the fact he committed in drinke,
as <hi>Pittacus</hi> in his statute-law enacted.</p>
                     <p>And as hee disgraceth and shameth
himselfe; so he shameth his parents, Pro.
28. 7. kinsfolks, friends, and all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;
and maketh them so ashamed
of him, that they are afraid and ashamed
to owne him.</p>
                     <p>Yea, drunkennesse disgraceth and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crediteth
the Gospell, unto which it is
cleane contrary; for whereas the Apostle
would have our conversation such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST
<hi>phil.</hi> 1. 27. both the Gospel and the name
of God is blasphemed among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
through such ill livers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
                     <p>Yea, it bringeth a scandall upon all that
professe the same Religion with him,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                     <p>Yea, the Apostle tells us that their
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21296:44"/>
workes of darknesse which are done of
of them in secret, are so shamefull, that it
is a shame even to speak of them, or once
name them, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5, 11. 12. Wherefore
the drunkard shall bee filled with shame,
and shamefull spewing shall be all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Hab. 2. 15,</hi> 16. untill he be trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                     <p>Thus drunkards by their drinking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
much hurt; some, in their bodies;
some, in their braines; some, intheir e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
whilst they are called from their

Now of his inwards, and more odious
qualities; for although the drunkards sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
strife, shame, poverty, and diseases,
together with his untimely death, as one
would thinke, were enough to make this
sin odious: yet looke we further into him,
as namely, into his more inward parts, his
secret abominations, which follow and
are occasioned through drunkennes; that
will make it hidious, and fearefull, at least

                     <p>It is said of <hi>Rome,</hi> that during the time

oyle that so much, that it cannot sticke;
and makes it so laskitive, that it cannot
hold from bewraying hoth himselfe
and others: and whatsoever is in the heart
of a sober man, is found in the tongue of
a drunkard.</p>
                     <p>Drink disapparells the soule, and is the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21296:50"/>
betrayer of the mind; it turnes the key of
the tongue, and makes it unlocke that
counsell, which before wisdome had in
keeping; even the thoughts of the heart,
which God hath secluded from the very
Divell, by this do suffer a search. He that
would anatomize the soule, may doe it
best when wine hath benummed the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
no such rack for confession as wine,
nor could the Divel ever finde a cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
baite to angle with: even the most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted
cogitations of the soule, in this
flood doe tumble from the swelling
tongue. For as steele is the glasse of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
so wine is the glasse of the minde, saith
<hi>Euripides.</hi> And experience shewes, that
when a man is drunke, you may thrust
your hand into him, like an Ele-skin, and
strip his inside outwards. And nothing
more common with States-men and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litians,
then to make drinke their <hi>Dalilah;</hi>
to draw out of their enemies those secrets
which nothing else will doe.</p>
                     <p>When any Embassadors came unto
<hi>Bonosus</hi> the Emperor, his manner was to
make them drunk, that so he might heare
all their secrets. And <hi>Iosephus</hi> speakes of
another politick Prince, who used when
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21296:51"/>
any Embassador was sent unto him
from his enemies, to ply him with drink;
and thereby he wrested all his secrets out
of him. Yea, this was the onely sauce that
<hi>Bacchus</hi> gave <hi>Ceres,</hi> when hee fell in love
with <hi>Venus.</hi> And did not <hi>Noah</hi> being
drunke reveale those secrets, which lay
hid above six hundred yeares before.</p>
                     <p>I confesse, there is no generall rule but
admits of some exceptions; and this rule
is not alwayes infallible: for wine makes
some quick spirited, others dull; this man
talkative, another dumb; according to the
disposition and constitution of the party.
Yea, I confesse the complot and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

                     <p>And all this hee sets out with the same

like <hi>Hecuba</hi> the wife of <hi>Priamus,</hi>
into a Dog, whose chiefe property is to
barke with open mouth, at such as hee
knowes not: for without question, their
wits are shorter, and their tongues longer,
then to demonstrate them rationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>Secondly he hath a <hi>beastly tongue</hi> in his
<hi>mirth:</hi> the drunkards communication is
ever filthy and beastly, ful of all ribaudry

like men desperately diseased, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
and filth comes from them at
unawares. And as by much labour the
hand is so hardened, that it hath no
sense of labour: so their much swearing
causeth such a brawny skin of senselesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to overspread the heart, memory,
and conscience, that the swearer sweareth
unwittingly; and having sworne hath no
remembrance of his oath, much lesse,
repentance for his sinne.</p>
                     <p>O the numberlesse number of oathes
and blasphemies that one blacke mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Drunkard spits out in defiance, as it

contrary! Yea, I dare affirme it, had some

Annum,</hi> his meanes would hardly pay
those small twelve penny multes, which
our Statute imposes upon swearers, were
it duly executed. And if so, to what
number wil the oathes amount, which are
sworne throughout the whole land, yea,
in some one Alehouse, or Taverne?
where they sit all day in troopes, doing
that in earnest, which wee have seene
boyes doe in sport, stand on their heads<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and shake their heeles against Heaven:
where even to heare how the name of the
Lord Iesus is pierced, would make a
dumbe man speake, a dead man almost
to quake. Did you never heare how <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>

bee a question, whether there bee more
oathes broken or kept; for woe is mee;
one, sells an oath for a bribe; another,
lends an oath for favour; another, casts it
away for malice &amp;c. but the Drunkard,
without any incitement, tumbleth out
oathes at adventure, and is as lavish of
them, as of ill language. O misery! O

                     <p>Whereas in the primitive times, more
of them were wonne to the faith by the
holy lives of Christians, then by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which they taught: they made
the world to reade in their lives, that they
did believe in their hearts; and caused
the Heathen to say, this is a good God,
whose servants are so good: for thus
they reasoned; these men are surely of
God, and without doubt, looke for a

witnesseth, that in his time a Christian

the holinesse and uprightnesse of his life

their labours, their learning, their sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

God to judge, nor Hell to punish; and
so live, as though they had no soules to

hee hath habituated errors into man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners)
be in place where he is afraid to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
or sure to pay twelve pence for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
oath; he can wholly forbeare, or if he
doe chance to forget himselfe once or

nothing. Now the easier the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21296:59"/>
of it; and the lighter the injuction, the

                     <p>Or suppose thou pretendest thou hast
beene so long accustomed to it, that thou
canst not leave it; yet this is but a witlesse,
gracelesse, and shamelesse excuse. For
first, custome of sinne is the very heigth
of sinne: and nothing more aggravates it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, will a thiefe or murtherer at

that it hath beene his use and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of a long time? or if hee doe, will
not the judge so much the rather send
him to the Gallowes?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, because it is a sin, to which
of all other sinnes wee have the <hi>fewest
temptations:</hi> for whereas other sins have
commonly some sensible profit to mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
them into the world; as the Usurer
finds an increase of wealth, who desires
to live with lesse faith, and more securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
or pleasure, as the Adulterer finds his
stoln bread of Sathans seasoning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
far sweeter, then what God hath
given him of his owne; or credit, as the
Hypocrite sindes, who like that Romane
Woolfe, talkes of Religion, when hee
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21296:60"/>
meanes policy, and playes the foule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
under the shape of an Angel of light,
and may be resembled to an ugly Toade
in an Ivory box, or a painted pot full of
deadly poyson. These and many other
sinners, which I could name, have some
inducement to provoke them, some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to alledge; (indeed they are all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the Divels Lectures) but the
<hi>swearer</hi> hath <hi>nothing to provoke</hi> him, nor
nothing to say, but that he loves this sin,
because it is a sin, and because God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
it; which is most fearefull and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and (as a man would thinke) should
make it unpardonable; I am sure, this
makes it inexcusable. For what hast thou
to say for thy selfe? this sinne is neither
pleasing, nor profitable, nor laudable, but
hath a more pure corruption and venome
in it, then any of his fellowes, and must
needs issue from meere malice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of God; for all thou canst expect
by it, is, the suspition of a common lyer,
by being a common swearer.</p>
                     <p>Yea, thou canst but procure this fruit
by thy swearing, that thou shalt vex o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

swilling? and on the other side, to vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
reproach, and undervalue all that
hate, and loath it in their judgments, or
else renounce it in their practice? is it
possible that the reasonable soule of man
(not professedly barbarous) should be
capable of such a monster? certainely, if
I did not know the truth and probate of
it, by ocular and experimentall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
from day to day, I could hardly
bring my understanding to believe, that
men, that Christians should be of so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
a judgement, as to affect, admire,
adore, &amp;c. so foule, so base, so beastly,
so unamiable, so unfruitfull, unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
unpleasant, unnaturall a vice as this
is in most mens judgements and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Nay, I cannot believe what I both
see and heare in this case; for it is not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21296:80"/>
possible for the most corrupted heart to
thinke that any should be honoured for
villany, and for honesty be contemned;
but rather, that every Drunkard, in his
more serious cogitations, thinkes of his
fellow, dying in this sinne, a fit saint to be
canonized for the Devill: for not sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

                     <p>And so we see, that what <hi>Seneca</hi> said

shops, and dranke rather in time
of sicknesse, then in health; namely, that
the time would come, when honour
should be ascribed unto drunkennesse,

of Vines there, so it was in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
the first time hee had tryed and
experimented the operation of wine.</p>
                     <p>And as for <hi>Lot,</hi> he drank liberally, with
intent only to comfort himselfe, and his
daughters, in regard of the losse of their
mother, and many other crosses lately
sustained, and was overtaken unawares.
Neither did any of these drinke with an
intent to exceed measure, and to bee
drunke, neither did they use it often; the
one, only once; the other, but twice; and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:21296:89"/>
that by the instigation of his ungracious
daughters: and so makes nothing, or very

that, which past with the most and

<hi>Seneca,</hi> regard not what the multitude do,
for number is but an ill signe of a good
cause, yea, it is the best note of the worst

                     <p>Yea, this is so cleare a truth, that even
common sense may see it: for look we up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole frame of nature, and every
creature in the Universe, even from the

from substances to accidents, this rule
holds good, that the basest things are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

But should their examples be followed
because they are great, or because they
are set by God to rule over us in matters
civill, politicke, and judiciary? no, for
God doth not make every one good
whom he hath made great, neither makes
he difference between the Voble and the

                     <p>Yea, God is so farre from being are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spector
of persons in the dispensing of his
grace, that as <hi>he hath put downe the mighty
from their seates, and exalted them of low
degree; so he hath filled the hungry with good
things, and the rich hee hath sent empty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
Luk. 1. 52. 53. <hi>he hath chosen the poore

                     <p>Neither is this the manner of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

onely, but of his acceptation also;
for, as our Saviour chose rather to bee

of a Maid servant fearing God, before
<hi>Michols,</hi> a scoffer, though shee were
Queene, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 22. So God esteemes
more of vertue clad in raggs, then vice in
Velvet: hee respects a man, not for his
greatnesse, but for his goodnesse; not for
his birth, but for his new birth; not for his
honour, but for his holinesse; not for his
wealth, but for his wisdome: with him <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi>

accepted both of God and man, whereas
the contrary maketh us hated and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of both. While <hi>Saul</hi> was little in his

                     <p>The best Nobility, is the Nobility of
faith; and the best Genealogie, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy
of good works. The blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
was more blessed in being the child
of her Saviour, then in being his mother:
the onely true greatnesse is to bee great in

<hi>Luke.</hi> 1. 15. which if we bee, it is no great
matter how the world esteemes of us: and
he that is regenerate, is greater and more

them, for <hi>the righteous,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> is
more <hi>worthy then his neighbour, Prov.</hi> 12.
26. and <hi>better is the poore that walketh in
his uprightnesse, then he that perverteth his

<hi>Paul</hi> preached, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. Whence it is
that <hi>David</hi> thought it not so happy for

branded by the Holy Ghost for wicked;
and yet this nation was Gods peculiar

And lastly, when the Rulers sate in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell

                     <p>God giveth to every man a stocke of
knowledge, more or lesse, to occupy

same well, viz. to his glory, and profit of
himselfe, and others, he giveth more, as
to the Servant which used his Talents wel,
hee doubled them; which makes the
Holy Ghost frequent in these and the
like expressions; If any will doe Gods

                     <p>But as for him which useth it not,
much more, if he abuseth his knowledge
to his owne hurt, and Gods dishonour, as
too many doe, he taketh from him even
that which he had formerly given him;
as he tooke away the odd Talent from the
servant which had but one, and did not
use the same, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 24. That this is
Gods manner of dealing, you may see
<hi>Mat. 21. 43. Gen. 4. 11. Acts, 26. 18.

As <hi>Eliah's</hi> spirit is doubled upon <hi>Elisha;</hi>
so the good Spirit departed from <hi>Saul.</hi>
As the <hi>Gentiles</hi> became beleevers, so the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:21296:100"/>
                        <hi>Iewes</hi> became Infidells. As <hi>Saul</hi> became

As <hi>Iohn</hi> groweth in the spirit, so <hi>Ioash</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth

<hi>Zacheus</hi> turneth from the world, so <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
turneth to the world, and God is no
lesse the permitter of the one, then the
cause of the other, if we consider him as
a righteous Iudge, punishing one sinne
with another by way of retaliation.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon, when Christ meets with
good <hi>Nathaniell, a true Israelite, in whom
there was no guile,</hi> he saith unto him, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevest
thou, because I saw thee under the

the idle servant was but a type of many

the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were but a type of many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
which should have their minds

meant of naturall, or speculative know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
wherein the wicked have as large
a share as the godly; but of spirituall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall,

Now God esteemes none wise, that

is meere foolishnesse in Gods account,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. and 3. 19. and no lesse then

1. 2. Whence it is that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and

                     <p>Alasse! the greatest Clarkes, and they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:21296:101"/>
that know most, are not always the wisest
men; many of the wise, and the ancient,
and the learned, with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> are to
learne this lesson, that <hi>except they be borne

of Heaven, Iohn.</hi> 3. 4, 9. and they that
give themselves to be so bookish, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
times so blockish, that they forget
God who made them.</p>
                     <p>Now as our Saviour said to him,
which thought he had done all, <hi>One thing
is behind, Luk.</hi> 18. 22. so may I say to
these, who thinke they know all, one
thing is behinde, and that is the true
knowledge of God, of Christ, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and how they may be saved: and
hee which knowes not thus much, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I cannot say he is a starke foole,
yet I may truely say hee is halfe a foole,
and halfe a wise man: as <hi>Ona-Centaure</hi> was
halfe a man, and halfe an Asse: for all
learning and knowledge, without this, is
but as a wodden Diamond in a Lattin ring,
and others who know lesse, and are lesse
learned, may be more wise.</p>
                     <p>It was a true and just reprehension,
wherewith the High Priest snib'd the
Councell, as they were set to condemne
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:21296:102"/>
Christ, and a great deale better then hee
meant it, <hi>Ye know nothing at al, Iohn,</hi> 11. 49.
hee spake right, for if wee know not
the Lord Iesus, we know nothing at all;
our knowledge is either nothing, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worth. What saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> no
more then the knowledge of goodnesse,
maketh one to be named a good man; no
more doth the knowledge of wisdome,
onely, cause any person properly to bee
called a wise man; saving knowledge of
the trueth, workes a love of the trueth
knowne: yea, it is an uniforme consent
of knowledge and action: hee onely is
wise, that is wise for his owne soule; he
whose conscience pulleth all hee heares
and reades to his heart, and his heart to
God, who turneth his knowledg to faith,
his faith to feeling, and all to walke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of his Redeemer, he that subdues his
sensuall desires and appetites to the more
noble faculties of reason, and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and makes that understanding of his
serve him, by whom it is, and doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
he that subdues his lusts to his
will, submits his will to reason, his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to faith, his faith, his reason, his will,
himselfe, to the will of God; this is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:21296:102"/>
experimentall, and saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to which the other is but a bare
name or title: for what is the notionall
sweetnesse of honey, to the experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
tast of it. It is one thing to know
what riches are, and where they be, and
another thing to be master of them; it is
not the knowing, but the possessing of
them that makes rich.</p>
                     <p>Faith and Holinesse are the nerves and
sinewes, yea the soule of saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
the best knowledge is about the
best things, and the perfection of all
knowledge, to know God and our selves,
as being the marrow, pith, or kernell, of
Christianity; and it is much, to know a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in this kinde. What said <hi>Aristippus</hi> to
one that boasted how much hee had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
learning consisteth not in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
but in the quality; not in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but in the goodnesse of it. Wee
know a little gold, is of more worth then
much drosse: a precious stone is a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
thing, yet it is preferred before many
other stones of greater bulke: yea, a little
Diamond is more worth then a rockie
mountaine: so one drop of wisdome, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the feare of God, is more worth
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:21296:103"/>
then all humane learning; one sparke of
spiritual, experimental, and saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
is worth a whole flame of secular
wisdome and learning; one scruple of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
one drame of faith, one graine of
grace, is more worth then many pounds
of naturall parts.</p>
                     <p>But learning and grace do not alwayes
keepe company together: yea, oh Lord
how many are there that have a depth of
knowledge, yet are not soule wise! that
have a library of Divinity in their heads,
and not so much as the least catechisme
in their consciences! No rare thing for
men to abound in speculation, and be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
in devotion; to have full braines, and
empty hearts; clear judgement, and defiled
affections; fluent tongues, but lame feet;
yea, you shall heare a flood in the tongue,
when you cannot see one drop in the life.</p>
                     <p>But see how justly they are served; they
might bee holy, and will not; therefore
though they would bee soule wise, yet
they shall not; <hi>the scorner seeketh wisdome,
but findeth it not, Pro.</hi> 14. 6. Let them know
never so much, they are resolved to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Luk. 24. 45. Ioh. 15. 15. Rom,</hi> 8. 14. 15.</p>
                     <p>No learning, nor experience will serve
to know the riches of the glory of Gods
inheritance in the Saints, to know the <hi>love
of Christ which passeth knowledge, Eph.</hi> 1.
17. 18. and 3. 19. for as meere sense
is uncapeable of the rules of reason:
so reason is no lesse uncapeable of the
things that are supernaturall. Yea, the
true knowledge of the nature and state of
the soule, must come by his inspiration
that gave the substance. As the soule is
the lamp of the body, and reason of the
soule, and religion of reason, and faith of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:21296:104"/>
religion: so Christ is the light and life of
faith.</p>
                     <p>2. God reveales himselfe savingly to
none but the godly, and such as he knows
will improve their knowledge to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
even as husbandmen will not cast their
seed but into fruitfull ground, which will
returne them a good harvest; <hi>the secrets of
the Lord,</hi> saith <hi>David, are revealed to them
that feare him, and his covenant is to give

them: the faithfull are like <hi>Moses, to whom

no more then hee tells the wicked.
<hi>They which love God,</hi> saith S. <hi>Iohn, know

                     <p>Now will you know the reason; <hi>the

of wisdome, Prov.</hi> 1. 7. as if the first
lesson to be wise, were to be holy. For as
the water ingendereth yce, and the yce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geine
ingendereth water: so knowledge
begets righteousnesse, and righteousnesse
again begetteth knowledge. It is between
science and conscience, as it is betweene
the stomack and the head; for as in mans
body, the raw stomack maketh a rheuma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tick
head, and the rheumaticke head ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a raw stomack: so science makes our
conscience good, and conscience makes
our science good. It is not so much <hi>scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
capitis,</hi> as <hi>conscientia cordis</hi> that knowes
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:21296:105"/>
Christ and our selves; whence <hi>Salomon</hi>
saith, <hi>give thine heart to wisdome,</hi> Pro. 2. 10
<hi>and let wisdome enter into thine heart,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs 4. 4.</p>
                     <p>Againe, if it be ask'd, why <hi>the naturall
man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit
of God?</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> answers, he cannot know
them, <hi>because they are spiritually discerned,
1 Cor.</hi> 2. 14. and indeed, if they be spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
discerned; how should they discerne
them, that have not the Spirit?</p>
                     <p>Now if it be so, that men may bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitely
wise, and incomparably learned
in the worlds opinion; and yet very fools
in the judgement of heaven: if <hi>not many
wise men after the flesh are called,</hi> but that a
great number of them go the wrong way;
yea, if God turnes their wisdome into
foolishnesse, that abuse their gifts; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales
himselfe savingly to none, but such
as feare and serve him; then is their no
safety, in following their example, or in
building our faiths upon their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>Indeed we are too prone to <hi>imitate</hi> the
<hi>learned,</hi> and to thinke we go safe enough,
if wee tread in their steps, although they
tread awry: for say wee, they know the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:21296:106"/>
will of God, what hee requires, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
what they thinke will bring them to
happinesse, especially so much as is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to salvation; and they do
so and so, or else they speake not as they
think, because they do not as they speake;
for none live worse then many of them.</p>
                     <p>But should this be, should we thinke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the better of error, though a thousand
of the learned should countenance and
maintaine the same? no, one <hi>Micaiah,</hi> a

of God, is more worthy of credit,
then 400. <hi>Baalites, 1 Kin.</hi> 22. 6, 12, 13, 14, 17

the truth, against the whole Councell

find more wisdome in <hi>Ioseph,</hi> a poore <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
servant, and receive more solid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
from him, wherby a famine through
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:21296:106"/>
out the whole world was prevented, then
hee could in all the Wisemen and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers
of <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 41. 8. to 32? Did
not <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> finde more depth in
<hi>Daniel,</hi> a poore captive <hi>Iew,</hi> then he could
in all the wise men of <hi>Babylon, Daniel</hi> 2.
and 4? yes, and the reason is, one eye
having sight, is better then a thousand
blind eyes; and one poore crucified thief,
being converted, had a clearer eye then
all the <hi>lews</hi> Rulers, Scribes, and Pharisies,
who being naturall and wicked, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and crucified JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>In the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> there was of
270. Prelates, 187. chose out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and
of the rest, the Pope (who was himselfe
Moderator) and his creatures, excluded
and tooke in, whom themselves would,
and none else; what marvaile then if they
concluded what they listed? Yea, how
many Schollers in all ages of the world,
have resembled <hi>Trajan,</hi> who was endued
with great knowledge, and other singular
vertues, but defaced them all by hating
Christianity, and opposing the power of
godlinesse? How many are so farre from
doing good, that they doe great hurt with
their gifts, and not seldom the more gifts
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21296:107"/>
they have, the more harme they do? For
as the best soyle, commonly yeelds the
worst aire: so without grace, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more pestilent then a deepe wit.
Wit and learning well used are like the
golden earerings, and bracelets of the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites;</hi>
abused, like the same gold cast
into a molten Idoll, then which nothing
more abominable. No such prey for the
Devill, as a good wit unsanctified: great
wits oft times mislead not only the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
but many followers besides: as how
many shall once wish they had been born
dullards, when they shall finde their wit
and learning to have barred them out of
heaven.</p>
                     <p>And let them looke to it; for as, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of others, their offence is greater;
for better many <hi>Israelites</hi> commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
or idolatry, then one <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
The least moate that flies in the Sun,
or between our eyes and the light, seemes
a greater substance then it is: and the
more learned the person, the more noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
the corruption: as the freshest som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
day will soonest taint those things
which will putrifie; so in respect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
their sinne is, and their punishment
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:21296:107"/>
shall bee greater: for the more glorious
the Angels excellency, the more damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
their apostacie. If the light become
darknesse, how great is that darknesse?
If <hi>Achitophel</hi> prove a villaine, how mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
is his villany. Putrified Lillies
smell farre worse than weeds; if vertue
turne into vice; the shame is triple. For
many <hi>Iewes</hi> to deny Christ, was not so
much as for one <hi>Peter.</hi> Yea, if all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the world had done filthily, it were
short of this wonder, <hi>the Virgine daughter
of Sion is become an harlot, Isaiah</hi> 1. 21. If
<hi>Iudas</hi> become a traitor, how great is his
treason? If <hi>Absalom</hi> rebell, how unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

whether in respect of the persons, or

was wisely wont to say, in civill

the patterne of our Saviour Christ.</p>
                     <p>And to <hi>imitate him</hi> is the marrow of all
Religion, and the true worship of God;
for then are our actions and intentions
warrantable, and praiseworthy, when
they accord with his, (and what Painter
would not rather make his picture by the
living face, then by any other picture)
wheras to square our lives by other mens
lives, without respect to his, is to set our
Clocks by others Clocks, without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Sun, which is the readiest way
to have them go wrong; for many times,
hee that is most unfit to observe man, is
the most fit to serve God. The <hi>Sybarites</hi>
desirous to know from <hi>Apollo,</hi> how long

                     <p>And thus wee see, the Word of God
to the faithfull is an Armory, out of
which they may furnish themselves with
all kind of munition; a Magazine, out of
which they may be furnished with all
manner of needfull provision: whereas
on the contrary, he, which lives, without
making this his rule; he, who sets not
the Diall or Clocke of his life by this
Sunne; hee who directeth not his course

                     <p>God hath made a promise to us, <hi>to keep
us in all our wayes, Psalm.</hi> 91. 11. but not
out of them: we are in our wayes so long
as we have a <hi>command,</hi> or warrant out of
the word for what we doe: to be kept by
God, is so to have him watch over us by
his fatherly providence and protection,
that nothing shall befall us, but what is
good for us: and to have a continuall
guard of Angles, to protect and keepe us
from every approaching evill, <hi>Psalme</hi> 91.
10, 11, 12. How safe then and happy is
the man, that is resolved to doe nothing
without God; who commands all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
both in Heaven, Earth, and Hell,
and they obey him? the consideration of
which made <hi>Luther</hi> so couragious, that
(being perswaded by his friends to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
himselse from the Diet at <hi>Wormes)</hi>
hee made answer, though all the tyles of
the houses were so many Divells, yet
would I goe thether: he knew he should
have more, and mightier with him, then
against him, being in his way, that is, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a warrant out of the Word for what
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:21296:118"/>
hee went about. Neither could he want
examples to encourage him herein; wee
see <hi>David,</hi> being in his way, it was not the
Lion, nor the Beare, nor that great <hi>Goliah,</hi>
nor <hi>Saul</hi> himself, though he darts a speare
twise at him, sends to seek him through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the thousands of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and layes
so many plots to take away his life, could
doe him any harme. <hi>Elisha,</hi> being in his
way, rather then the <hi>Assyrians</hi> mighty
Host shall hurt him, the mountaine shall
bee full of Horses and Chariots of fire to
reskew him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 17. neither shall <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi>
or <hi>Iesabel</hi> hurt <hi>Eliah,</hi> though they
threaten much, and do their worst, I <hi>Kin.</hi>
19. 2. Let <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three children be
in their way, do nothing either for through
feare or flattery, but what they have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for out of Gods Word; and then
throw the one into the Lions den, and
the other into the fiery furnace, Gods
providence shall so keepe them, that <hi>not a
haire of their heads shall perish, Dan.</hi> 3. 27.
and 6. 22.</p>
                     <p>Let the same consideration prevaile
with us. Have wee a <hi>warrant</hi> out of the
word? are wee in the path of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection?
in the way wherein the Angels
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:21296:118"/>
guard and watch? Let us go on valiantly,
and not feare what men or divels can doe
unto us. When <hi>Ioseph</hi> had a command
from God, to goe out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the
Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> after <hi>Archelaus</hi> succeeded
his father <hi>Herod,</hi> he was sore affraid, and
(as it seemeth) loath to go; yet considering
that God had commanded him, he dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
no longer with flesh and blood, but
goeth his way, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 22. It is too much
tendernesse to respect the scoffes, and
censures and threats of others, when wee
have a direct word from God: the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>sluggard will cry, a Lion in the way, Pro.</hi>
26. 13. yea, but the Scriptures cry, an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
yea, many Angels to stop the Lions
mouth: the Lion is in those by-wayes, in
which the Prophet walked, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 13. 24.</p>
                     <p>On the other side: if God take no
charge of us, but when wee are in our
wayes, yea, in his, by having a warrant
out of the Word; how are they in their
wayes, who spend their whole time in
drinking, swearing, whoring? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who
persecute the godly, for keeping close to
this Word? If that be Gods way, where
did he chalk it out, where, or in what part
of his Word hast thou a warrant to doe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:21296:119"/>
these things, or to hate, persecute, revile,
slander, reproach, contemne, deride, or
censure men for being holier and more
temperate then thy selse? If thou want
his word, looke not for his protection:
and miserable is that man, who in dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
actions is left to his owne keeping;
it fares with him, touching his spirituall
adversaries, as with the Deere that leapes
over the Park pale, and straggles abroad,
which a hundred to one doth cost her her
life: or as it did vvith <hi>Shemei,</hi> vvhen hee
past his bounds set him by the King, vvho
lost his life for his labour, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 42.
43. 46. As for example, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his
Host were out of their way, when they
pursued the children of <hi>Israel</hi> going out
of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but now sped they? the Sea
devided to let the <hi>Israelites</hi> pass, but fwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

was out of his way, when hee rode
to <hi>Balack,</hi> with an intent to curse <hi>Israell,</hi>
when God had forbidden him so to doe;
but the Angel of the Lord met him with
a naked sword, and had slaine him, if the
Asse had not turned away, <hi>Numb. 22. 33.
Sampson</hi> was out of his way, when hee
went in to the harlot <hi>Dalilah,</hi> or els God

for any act: we that are Christians must
not live by prophane examples, but by
Gods holy precepts. Indeed, common
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:21296:121"/>
errors carry away many, who inquire
not into the reason of ought, but the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
and judge of truth, not by weight,
or value of voices, but by the number.
But what sayes the Proverbe, of bad cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
bad opinions, and bad servants,
They are better to hang then to keepe.</p>
                     <p>I confesse, where the Law written
doth faile, we ought to observe what is
approved by manners and custome: but
though, in this case, custome be of great
authority, yet it never brings prejudice to
a manifest verity: and there are other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
wherein singularity is not lawfull on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but laudable; when vice groweth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
fashion, singularity is a vertue; when
sanctity is counted singularity, happy is
he that goeth alone, and resolves to be an
<hi>Example</hi> to others; and when either e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
is to be done, or good to be neglected,
how much better is it to goe the right
way alone, then to erre with company?
Yea, most happy is he that can stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
when the world declines, and can
endeavour to repaire the common ruine
with a constancy in goodnesse; that can
resolve with <hi>Ioshuah,</hi> what ever the world

It was <hi>Noah's</hi> happinesse in the old

                     <p>The pleasure of the world is like that
<hi>Colchian</hi> hony, whereof <hi>Zenophon's</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
no sooner tasted, then they were
miserably distempered; those that tooke
little, were drunk; those that took more,
were mad; those that tooke most, were
dead: so most men are either intoxicated,
or infatuated, or killed out right with this
deceitfull world, that they are not sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of their feares or dangers. It is like a
kind of melancholy, called <hi>Chorus Sancti
Viti,</hi> which who so hath it, can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but laugh and dance, untill they be
dead, or cured; as it made <hi>Argos</hi> in the
Poet, and another, mentioned by <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
sit all day laughing and clapping their
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:21296:129"/>
hands, as if they had beene upon a stage
at a Theater.</p>
                     <p>Wickednesse makes guilty men feare,
where is no cause; these have cause e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
but no grace to feare: they are so
besotted with a stupid security, that they
are not affected with any danger; yea,
they account it the chiefest vertue, to be
bold, fearelesse, and carelesse; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. where the Prophet
complaines unto God, <hi>thou hast smitten
them, but they have not sorrowed; thou hast
consumed them, but they have refused to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
correction; they have made their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
harder then a stone, and have refused to
returne, verse,</hi> 3. which was <hi>Pharaoh's</hi>
case, who though his backe were all blew
and sore with stripes, yet he must still
persist and presume; yea, because his
time was not come to perish, God lets
him alone in pursuing his children, even
to the Sea, and halfe way over; faire
way he had, and smoothly he ran on, till
he came to the midst, not so much as one
wave to wet the foote of his Horse; but
when he is too farre to escape, then God
begins to strike, neither he could, nor
these can be quiet, without their full
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:21296:129"/>
vengeance; as filching leaves not the
Pilferer with raw sides, but brings him to
a broaken necke; they have such festred
and putrified hearts, that ordinary stripes
will not reach to the quicke; their long
tugging at Sathans Oares, and wearing his
Shackels, hath so brawned their flesh, that
they are not sensible of an ordinary lash.
And this likewise is the Saylers case, who
although the Philosopher would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them to be numbred amongst the
living, (as not amongst the dead) yet for
all their many and eminent dangers, no
men are more regardlesse of their soules.</p>

is alwayes the <hi>harbinger</hi> to some

God will give over men to his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he first gives them over to this
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:21296:130"/>
judgement, of an <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>impenitent
heart:</hi> and what doth <hi>impenitency,</hi> but
turne all deliverances into further curses
and judgements? so that such a mans
deliverance is a worse judgment, then
the judgment from which he is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
for it argues, either Gods utter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
of them, as desperate Patients are
given over by the Physitian; <hi>why should
yee be smitten any more, for yee fall away
more and more,</hi> saith God to the stiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked
<hi>Iewes, Isaiah,</hi> 1. 5. or else it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
a reservation of them for some more

<hi>yee will not be reformed by me,</hi> (saith
God) <hi>but walke stubbornely against me;
then I will walke stubbornely against you, and
smite you yet seven times more for your sins:
Lev.</hi> 26. 18. to 40. So that an impenitent
mans preservation out of one judgment,
is but a further reservation of him to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
judgments. What did it availe
<hi>Cham,</hi> that he escaped drowning with
the multitude? he had better have peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in the waters, then have lived unto

<hi>Lot's</hi> wife, to escape turning into ashes in
<hi>Sodom,</hi> when suddenly after she was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:21296:131"/>
into a pillar of salt in the plaine?
Or what did it availe <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was not smitten with many of those
judgements, wherein others perished?
it was farre from being a mercy; yea,
it was a reservation to the greatest tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
judgment of all here, and to that
eternall judgment also in the burning
lake, from which there is no redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So that it is not simply our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
but our thankfulnesse for it, and
obedience after it, that gives sufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to our consciences, that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
us in mercy and favour.</p>
                     <p>Yea, to prosper in ill designes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious
courses, to goe on in sinne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled,
is the greatest unhappinesse,
the heaviest curse: for he that useth to
doe evill, and speeds well, never rests,
till he come to that evill from which
there is no redemption. <hi>Ioab</hi> kills <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
and scapes; againe he embrues his
hands in the blood of <hi>Amasa,</hi> and is not
indited for it; now <hi>David</hi> is old, and
<hi>Adoniah</hi> towardly, he furthers him in the
usurpation, and big with prefidence of
his owne command, he thinkes to carry
it; but this carryed him to his grave.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:21296:131"/>
Faire <hi>Absalom</hi> was proud and ambitious,
yet he flourisheth; hee kills his owne
Brother, yet escapes; he insinuates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
into the affections of the people,
and bold of their fidelity to him, he swels
even against his owne royall Father, and
becomes a disloyall Traytor. God owes
that man a grievous paiment, whom he
suffers to runne on so long unquestioned;
and his punishment shall be the greater,
when he comes to reckon with him for
all his faults together. Yea, though
prosperous wickednesse is one of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
strongest chaines, yet the currant
passage of ill enterprises is so farre from
giving cause of encouragement, that it
should justly fright a man, to looke backe
to the Author, and to consider, that he
therefore goes fast, because the Devill
drives him.</p>

while the Arke and <hi>Israel</hi> were in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse.
And yet <hi>David's</hi> case was no more

those proofes of his Deitie, were enough,
to have fetcht all the world upon their

there is a Factor of Hell present,

refuge of melancholy sinners, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and never failing friend, to which
also they are as constant: for when did
the Sunne ever see some men sober? and
how are our Cities and Townes peste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and our streets strewed with these
filthes? and this is the maine ground of
all. For as they that have curst and
shrewish wives at home, love to stray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
so these men being molested with
a scoulding conscience, are faine conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to drinke, play, riot, goe to bed
with their heads full of wine, and no
sooner awake then to it againe; so that
their consciences must knocke at the dore
a thousand times, and they are never
within, or at leasure to be spoke withall:
indeed at last they must be met, and
found by this enemy, even as <hi>Ahab</hi> was
by <hi>Eliah;</hi> stay they never so long, and
stray they never so farre, they must home
at last; sicknesse will waken them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
must speake with them, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
with his truant Scholler, after a long

Heaven, who more neede that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>Lord have mercy upon them;</hi> for a
wicked mans peace will not alwayes last,
in the end his guilt will gnaw him, with
so much a sharper tooth; yea, they are
not more jocund in prosperity, then in
disasters they are amazed.</p>
                     <p>Whereas they should eate, and drinke,
and doe all things to the glory of God;
they <hi>drinke,</hi> to this end onely, that they
may the easier <hi>forget God,</hi> forget him in
his threats, which sticke in their soules
after some Sermon; forget him in his
judgments, which have taken hold of
some of their companions; they <hi>drinke,</hi>
to the end they may <hi>drowne conscience,</hi> and
put off all thoughts of death, and Hell,
and to hearten and harden themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the messages of God, and
threats of the Law; as that franticke Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
fell to tuning his Violl, when his
house was on fire about his eares. For
most men take no notice at all of the
strokes of Gods wrath, but with the
mirth and madnesse of wine and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
take away the knowledge of it, and
the noyse of conscience when it cryes; as
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:21296:140"/>
the Sacrificers in the valley of <hi>Hinnon,</hi>
by the noyse of Instruments, tooke away
the cryes of their sacrificed children:
and so much the rather, that others may
not take notice thereof; for though their
consciences be often in paine, yet they
will not complaine that this shoe wrings
them.</p>
                     <p>Their consciences would faine speake
with them, but they will by no meanes
heare them; whereas if they had wit,
and were not past grace, they would both
invite, and welcome this Angell, or mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singer
of the Lord, so soone as the waters
be troubled, with sackcloth, ashes, fasting,
going into the house of mourning, and
pouring forth whole Buckets of water,
as is the manner of Gods people, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
7. 6. But many a time is poore Christ
(offering to be new borne in thee) thrust
into the Stable; while lewd companions,
by their drinking, playes, and jests, take
up all the best roomes in the Inne of
thine heart.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, blind worldlings and besotted
sinners, may call it <hi>melancholy,</hi> or what
they will; but in Gods Dictionary (the
holy Scriptures) it hath no such name.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:21296:141"/>
And they may thinke to drive it away
with carnall delights, but this will not
doe it: yea, let ten Consorts of musicke
be added, it shall not drowne the clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
cryes of conscience. These are but
miserable comforters, and Physitians of
no value, and no way a fit expiation for a
griefe of this nature; neither can the
world afford an expurgation of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</p>
                     <p>Alasse! this is but like some spritly
musicke, which though it advanceth a
mans mind while it sounds; yet leaves
him more melancholy, when it is done,
as <hi>Euripides</hi> observes. Yea, I'le appeale
from your selves in drinke, to your selves
in your sober fits, whether it fares not
with you, as it did with <hi>Menippus,</hi> who
went downe into Hell to seeke content:
for what is this other (in mitigating the
pangs of conscience) then as a saddle of
gold, to a gal'd Horse; or a draught of
poyson, to quench a mans thirst.</p>
                     <p>Alasse! <hi>Lot</hi> being expuls't <hi>Sodom,</hi>
dranke somewhat freely to drive away
<hi>melancholy</hi> (as we may conjecture) but
what came of it? the wine made him
commit incest, whereby he became ten
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:21296:141"/>
times more melancholy, then he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And surely, they which strive to
cure their present misery, with present
mirth; have not their misery taken away,
but changed, and of temporall, made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall;
<hi>thou hast taken thy pleasure,</hi> saith
<hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives, therefore art thou now
tormented, Luke</hi> 16. 25. I love no such
change; I love not to cure one evill by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
yea, by a worse mischiefe: as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricks
in curing one disease, cause ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is worse. And let them looke
to it, for surely if men call for pleasure, to
please the conscience, as the <hi>Philistins</hi>
did for <hi>Sampson</hi> to make them sport, it
will but pull downe the house upon their
heads. No sooner were the bellies of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doniah's</hi>
guests full of meat, and their
heads full of wine; but their eares were
full of clangor, their hearts of horror, the
Trumpets at once proclame <hi>Salomon's</hi>
Triumph, and their confusion: the feasts
of the wicked end in terror, as it fared
with <hi>Belshazzar, Daniel</hi> chap. 5. v. 1. to 7.
after the meale is done, ever comes the
reckoning. Wherefore let my spirit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come and enter into their Paradise,
yea ever abhor to partake of their brutish
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:21296:142"/>
pleasures, lest I partake of their endlesse
woes. And indeed who would buy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and misery so deare? as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi>
answered <hi>Lais</hi> the harlot, when
she asked him ten thousand Drachmes of
money, for her company but one night;
who would pay so deare for so short a
lease? as the Country man replyed, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great preparation, labour, cost,
and study for a great triumph, when they
told him it was to last but an houre: for
could they have <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambrosia</hi> to

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opatra,</hi>
the riches of <hi>Egypt</hi> at a draught,
and that upon free cost, (which as <hi>Diogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
conceived, did adde sweetnesse to the
wine) yet it is but a draught, and quickly
downe the throat.</p>
                     <p>Yea, as vaine and comfortlesse are all
worldly joyes, when they are used to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate
the panges of conscience, as it was
for <hi>Callico</hi> to stuff his pillow (a brasse pot)
with straw to make it soft.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, your charmes may, with their
pleasantnesse, bring conscience into some
short slumbers; but it waketh eftsoones,
and in spite of all your spells, rageth as
before. Yea, if but sicknesse come, these
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:21296:142"/>
carnall delights will runne from you, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
like Rats from a house on fire:
pleasure, like <hi>Orpah,</hi> kisses, but parts; only
griefe, like <hi>Ruth,</hi> weeps, and tarries with
you: no joy will downe till there be hope
of a pardon; so that no hand can heale
you, but the very same which wounded
you: the wounds of the mind can only be
cured by the word of God, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what may bee said, what is to bee

                     <p>Thus instead of repenting, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in a lawfull calling, which is the only

and incredible to believe, how the divell
blindes them in this particular, but I passe
it, for an Angel from heaven shal not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them to the contrary, but that it is
very profitable for them; though a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by may plainly see, that they spend
more in time, then in money; and more in
money of times then they get by their
drunken customer; as it is usuall with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Dutchmen,</hi> to spend the best part of
three whole dayes and nights in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne,

goe away with this conceit, that each

(as the Crow of her owne Birds)
that it is fairer and better then ordinary,
or else they would not be at such char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to have you heare it. If ye doubt his

But wherein doth his vainelye, and the
excellency of his braine consist? The
Beane of all his honour lyes in scoffes,
and jeeres; for take from these Aspes
but their poyson and sting, you undoe
them, they have nothing left of any use;
all their worth lyes in witcrackers, as
some in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> have their wealth
in Squibs and fire-workes, others in
Mouse-traps and Tinderboxes. Now
in case he hath broken a jest well, he sits
him downe, and sings <hi>plaudits</hi> to his own
braine, and not onely falls in love with
all, as <hi>Pygmalion</hi> fell in love with his Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Image, but if others doe not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
and admire it for rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
as though it were found in the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix</hi>
nest, he thinkes he hath great wrong.
It is not enough, that he thinkes himselfe
wise; but we also must thinke him so,
though he knowes in his conscience wee
thinke wrong: as once a Souldier, to
have his friends in <hi>England</hi> thinke him
somebody, gave it out that he was Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of a hundred, when his conscience
told him, and one of the company was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Vermine, which were under his conduct.</p>

Indeed it were happy for him, if he

should doe him a greater pleasure, if
he did not so prompt him in scoffes; for,
like <hi>Absalom's</hi> haire, it proves but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
to hange himselfe withall: the
best office his wit doth him, is either to
spit out friends with his tongue, or laugh
them into enemies. When one brake a
bitter jest upon his friend, he requited
him with his Dagger, saying, I cannot
breake a jest, but I can breake your head.
Now he payes deere for a jest, who
spends his time, and mony, and sells his
honesty for it: but most unhappy is that
wit, which stirres up enemies against the

the chiefe: for though there be many

worse then all his seede. I'le make it
plaine. As there are sundry other crafts,
so there is a <hi>craft</hi> of <hi>tempting,</hi> whereof
Sathan is the crafts-master, and the rest
are but his Apprentises, or Factors under

                     <p>And these his servants are so at his

                     <p>It was a noble answer of a great

I will pray for the Kings health,
but drinke for mine owne. And surely
none but sots will bring themselves into
grievous diseases by drinking healthes to
other men; and such is the case of health
drinkers. What said <hi>Callisthenes</hi> to one

                     <p>Nay, it's well if they prevent not the

they save the Physitian a labour, and

                     <p>At one supper, which <hi>Alexander</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

there was no lesse then one and forty;

and thereupon sent for twenty of the

they answered they would willingly doe,

the Queene in the meane time provides a

them, and presents it to them all, to
drinke the King her husbands health;
they to testifie their love and alleagiance

were much addicted to the <hi>drinking</hi> of

and swarmes of Rats and Mice, as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Popelus,</hi> his wife, and all his children
from place to place, both by Sea and

to the strong castle of <hi>Oraccovia,</hi> where
they were drowned, and eaten up of
these Rats and Mice, in despite of Guard

                     <p>Indeed if the word <hi>pledge</hi> were used
seriously, properly, opportunely; and not
altogether mistaken, and used in a wrong
sense, I should grant it a duty, when any
shall bee called thereunto. But sotted
drunkards understand not what they
speake, when they use the phrase: for the
word <hi>pledge,</hi> implies no intention of drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
as looke we but to the originall, and
first institution thereof, and we shall find,
that when in the borders of <hi>Wales</hi> twelve

<hi>Englishmen,</hi> as they were holding the
cups to their mouths; it grew to that, that
none would drinke at any publike meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:21296:173"/>
except they had some friend present
who would undertake to be their <hi>pledge,</hi>
and carefully see that none should hurt
them the while; but hee who useth the
word now, makes himselfe ridiculous, the
occasion being taken away, for (God bee
thanked) we have no such cause of feare,
having the Lawes of God to guide the
vertuous, and the Lawes of the Land to
restraine the wicked.</p>
                     <p>Yet their mistake is no more in this
their challenge, then it is in the combate it

whereas they make a sport of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
counting him a malefactor in the

and fit to be carried before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
to render an account of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacie;
and delight to make men drink,
till they vomit up their shame againe, like
a filthy Dog; or lye wallowing in their
beastlinesse, like a brutish Swine; this is
the most sad and woefull spectacle that
can be to a rectified understanding.</p>

be imagined. For what a barbarous, grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,

his Spirit grieved, his name blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

cause ill suspicions; and surely he that
suspects another to be ill, without just
ground, by so doing proclaimes himselfe
to be guilty; for in things uncertaine, a
bad construction must needs flow from a
bad mind: suspicion, for the most part,
proceeds from a selfe defect: vertuous
men rarely censure; as great labourers

our fearing of God, then their owne
blaspheming of him,; and thinke it a
more heinous offence, for us to be sober,
then for themselves to be drunke. What
then are their censures of us, when wee
do offend?</p>
                     <p>Yea, if mens passions and affections
did not make them strangely partiall; how
could they suffer their faithfull and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

and complaine he keeps no hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
though indeed even books would

and carriage indeed a miracle.</p>
                     <p>3. Another reason is,<note place="margin">4 They see and look to us not to themselves.</note> as these drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
can see us, but not themselves:
(without a glasse) so they looke to us, not

made use of their eyes, when they went

came home; and they have much the
more quiet for so doing, a wicked mans
conscience being like a bad wife, that wil
either bee gadding abroad, or scoulding
at home.</p>
                     <p>In surveying their owne evill actions
they are beetle eyed, or like him, <hi>Iohn</hi>
the 9. who had never a seeing eye; or at
least like <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> who had onely one
eye; but in spying ours, they have the eyes
of a Basiliske, and are as quick sighted as
<hi>Argos,</hi> who had his head compassed with
an hundred eyes; yea, as <hi>Lynceus</hi> (who as
<hi>Varro</hi> speakes) could see through a wall;
or if they have two seeing eyes, yet, like
the purblind, they see double, or like those
women of <hi>Scythia</hi> called <hi>Bithiae,</hi> they have
two sights in each eye: for if they looke
upon our actions, it is with an evill eye,
judging of us by what wee should bee; if
upon their owne, it is with a tender eye,
and so judge by what they are in their
owne opinion, and the judgement of
sense.</p>
                     <p>And to mend the matter, Sathan, like
our cunning men, presents unto them spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
things in a false glasse, stamping his
own image on Gods silver, and Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:21296:188"/>
on his owne drosse, and so comes
their often mistake in censuring.</p>
                     <p>Neither are their <hi>memories</hi> lesse <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi>

                     <p>As first, they will lie in waite to finde
faults in us, and pry more narrowly into
our actions, then the best man would
willingly they should: and a reserved
mans behaviour, you know, is like a verse,
wherein every syllable is measured; yea,
what is scarce thought a fault in other

to fasten on a scab or ulcer;
resembling our Prognosticators, that are
more diligent to make mention of foule

they much harpe upon, but calme and
serene dayes passe them unobserved;
dealing by good men, as one did by <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
who (as <hi>Erasmus</hi> relates) collected
all the lame and defective Verses out of
his workes, but past over infinite others,
which were by him most excellently
made.</p>
                     <p>Or, if in case they finde not spots,
they will feigne them; for malice makes
them so nimble eyed, that they'le finde

                     <p>The which if thou well considerest,
will make thee so farre from beleeving

why drunkards and vicious followers

of us, because they cannot doe evill
unto us; or, they doe it to incite and stir
up others to doe the like; or, because
God hath put an enmity betweene the
men of the world, and his children; or
they doe it, because Sathan will have
them doe it; or else to have themselves
thought as good as any other; they will
not have any thought good that dwells
neere them, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But the chiefe reason and end why they
doe the same, is, that they may discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
us in the way to Heaven, floute us
out of our faith, and draw us backe to the
world; that so they may have our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
here in sinne, and hereafter in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

by this meanes, they may draw away the

while they are fixed and busied upon a

                     <p>The imbellick Peasant, when he comes
first to the Field, shakes at the report of
a Musket; but after hee hath ranged
through the fury of two or three Battels,
he then can fearelesse stand a breach, and
dares undaunted gaze death in the face:
so the first <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>sinne,</hi> are for the most
part trembling, fearefull, and full of the
blush; it is the <hi>iteration</hi> of <hi>evill,</hi> that gives
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:21296:221"/>
forehead to the foule offender: it's easie
to know a beginning swearer, he cannot
mouth it, like the practised man; he oathes
it, as a cowardly Fencer playes, who
as soone as he hath offered a blow,
shrinks backe, as if his heart suffered a

                     <p>The first time the Fox saw the Lyon,
he feared him as death; the second, he
feared him, but not so much; the third
time, he grew more bold, and passed by
him without quakeing. There is no man
suddenly very good, or extreamely evill,
but growes so: as a River is small and
foredable at the head, but greatens as it
runnes on, by accession of new waters.
<hi>Salomon</hi> first takes two wives, then three,

the stakes of the Law, and all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
he is ready to lose himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

                     <p>As men eate divers things by morsels,
and digest them with ease, which if they
should eate whole, would choake them:
so fares it with sinners. We deale with
our consciences, as with our Apparell,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:21296:221"/>
when we have got on a new sute, fresh
and faire, we are very chary of abusing it,
we take heede where we sit, what we
touch, or against what we leane; but
when it is once growne a little old, soyled
and sullied, we have no such regard of it,
we little passe what we doe with it, nor
minde where we cast it; so the uxorious
husband, at the first idolizeth his wife,
no noyse must disturbe her, the cold
wind must not blow upon her, the Sunne
must be shaded from her beauty, her
feete must scarce touch the earth, nothing
must offend her, she commands all, her
will is a law; it may be, after a while
none of all this, but the contrary: even
such is our dealing with conscience; as
we see in <hi>David,</hi> who at first was so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it, that the lap of <hi>Saul's</hi> garment
onely troubled him to the heart; but
giveing way to his owne corruptions,
and Sathans temptations, to what a height
of sinne was he risen? at first he onely
loosed the raynes to idlenesse; from idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
he proceedes to lust; from lust, to
drunkennesse; from drunkennesse, to
murther, &amp;c. Murther shall be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to hide adultery, the fact which wine
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:21296:222"/>

turne their backes upon their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
much blood of <hi>Israel</hi> must be spilt,
many a good Souldier cast away, that
murther must be seconded with dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,
and all this, to hide one A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery.</p>
                     <p>O how many, by this meanes, have

Devills! resembling <hi>Domitian,</hi> who
(when first chosen Emperour) did so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
cruelty, that he would not suffer
any beast to be kill'd for sacrifice; yet
after by degrees, and when custome had

too much, to put in execution against

was beloved, and well reported of, was a

Hypocrites talke of him, time-servers
make use of him, Politicians pretend him,
prophane men sweare by him, millions
professe him; few love him, few serve
him, few care to honour him: godly
men, even amongst us Christians, are
like timber trees in a wood, here one,

                     <p>Sinne that is done abroad, ceaseth to be
single, for it is many sinnes in one, and
that in a double respect; it stumbles o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
it infects others. First, it stumbles o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and this doth much to increase it.
It did wonderfully aggravate <hi>David's</hi> sin,
that it <hi>caused the enemies of God to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme:</hi>
and made the sinne of <hi>Elie's</hi> sons
(whose scandalous lives, made men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
the offerings of the Lord) so hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
that God even swore unto <hi>Ely,</hi> that
<hi>the wickednesse of his house should not bee
purged with sacrifice, nor offering for ever,
1 Sam.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                     <p>O the difference between thy practise,
and what it ought to be: Christians ought
to be blameles, pure, and without rebuke,
yea, to <hi>shine as lights to other men, in the
middest of a naughty and crooked nation,
Phil.</hi> 2. 15. whereas thou by thy deboy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
life: and abominable licenciousnes,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:21296:245"/>
doest scandalize the Gospell and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
yea, make it odious to <hi>Turkes</hi> and
Infidels, according to that of the Apostle
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it infects others, in which
regard, saith <hi>I siodore, It is a greater offence
to sinne openly then secretly; for he is doubly
faulty, who both doeth, and teacheth the
same.</hi> To sinne before the face of God, is
to dishonour him; but withall to sinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the face of men, whereby others are
taught and incouraged to doe the like, is
doubly to dishonour him. An exemplary
offender, is like a malicious man sicke of
the plague, that runs into the throng to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperse
his infection, whose mischiefe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighes
all penalty: Many an <hi>Israelite</hi>
committed fornication, and yet upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
got pardon; but <hi>Zimry</hi> that

dost thou looke for <hi>Caine</hi> or <hi>Iudas</hi> to

                     <p>But this is not all; for though he <hi>calls</hi>

in, till repentance hath swept the house.</p>
                     <p>Why wast thou not with thy harlot,

were undevided in the flame of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
While thy mouth is opened to
sweare and blaspheme, why is it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
fild with fire and brimstone?

yet presume not; for as when

                     <p>But what doe I nominating particulars,
when thou hast had <hi>more warnings,</hi> and
<hi>invitations,</hi> then thou hast haires on thy

are without number, though thy sinnes
strive with them, which shall be more.
If thou couldest count the numberlesse

Not to enter into particulars, which
were endlesse, but to give you the summe
or epitomy of them; for I had rather
presse you with weight, then oppresse

Lord Christ hath not onely ransomed

torments hereafter; but also pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
every good thing thou dost enjoy,
whether for soule, or body, even to the
very bread thou eatest, and that with
the price of his owne precious blood;
and, as if all this were too little, he reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
for thee <hi>such pleasures at his right
hand, as never entred into the heart of man
to conceive;</hi> and to the end onely, that
thou shouldest serve, and set forth the
praise of his Name, who hath done all
this.</p>
                     <p>As he descended into Hell, that we
might never come thither; so he ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into Heaven, to prepare a place for
us, which we have no right unto.</p>
                     <p>What should I say? If we looke <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
we finde our Creator's <hi>mercies;</hi> if

his owne Sonne to redeeme us. whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoever

                     <p>O consider of these his mercies, you
that forget God; and then, though there
were no Hell, no punishment for sinne,
yet you would not transgresse. Hast
thou any braines, or heart to conceive
what it is he hath bestowed, what thou
hast received, what thou hast deserved?
No surely, for if thou hadst braines, and
wert a wise man, it would make thee
mad, as <hi>Salomon</hi> speakes in another sense,
<hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 7. or if thou hadst a heart not
like a stone, or an Adamant, the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of Gods love, and thy odious

Sixtly, and lastly, he would have thee

The Apostle could not finde out a more
heart-breaking argument, to enforce a
sacrificing of our selves to God, then to
conjure us <hi>by the mercies of God in Christ,
Rom.</hi> 12. 1. and indeed, we could not be
unthankefull, if we thought upon what
the Lord gives, and what he forgives:
but if the thought of these things will not
move thee, Lord have mercy upon
thee. For, as it is a fearefull marke of a
reprobate, alwayes to abuse Gods mercy
and patience, to the hardening of our
selves in our evill courses: so good turnes
aggravate unkindnesses, and our offences
are increased with our obligations: yea,
there is not one of these favours, of those

which made Israel to sinne;</hi> and not they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but the people with them. It is easie
for a mans sinne to live; when himselfe is
dead; and to leade that exemplary way
to hell, which, by the number of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
shall continually aggravate his
torments. The imitaters of evill, deserve
punishment; the abetters, more; but there
is no hell deepe enough, for the leaders
of publike wickednesse: he that invents a

for himselfe a large patrimony of
unquenchable fire.</p>
                     <p>Though few men will confesse their
sinnes; yet many mens sins will confesse
their master. To beget a president of
vice, is like the setting a mans own house
on fire, it burnes many of his neighbours,
and he shal answer for al the ruines. Alas!
while I live, I sinne too much; lerme not
continue longer in wickednesse; then life.</p>
                     <p>Sin hath an ubiquity; one sinners ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:21296:257"/>
infects others, and they spread it
abroad to more; like a man that dyes of

whole City; so that hee must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
even for the sinnes of a thousand;
yea, they have so much to answer for, that
have thus occasioned so much ill, that it
had beene happy for them, if they had
never beene at all, then being, to be laden
with the sinnes of so many.</p>
                     <p>O what infinite torments doth <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
endure, when every <hi>Turke</hi> that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth

so each sinner, according to his proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the number of soules, which mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
through the contagion of his evill
example; for they shall speed at last, like
him that betrayed a City to a Tyrant;
who when he had conquered it, first han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
up the party that help'd him to it.</p>
                     <p>Yea, perhaps God will even in this life
make them an example of his just venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and provoked indignation; as he did
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> as their sinne hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
many, so their fall and ruine may
perchance convert many: the life of <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>

                        <pb n="498" facs="tcp:21296:258"/>
made many Christians: God will
teach men to feare him; even by their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
that taught them not to feare him.
Yea, the D vell, who now is their good
master, will in the end reward these his
subjects, as that Emperor, which <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
speakes of, did by one that kild a
great man, who first crowned him, for

                     <p>History reports, how one being to
fight with a Duke in a Duel, or single
combat; that he might be more expert,
and doe it with the greater courage, got
his picture, and every day thrust at it with
his sword: and onely to deface the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of an enemy, when we cannot come
at his person, hath a little eased the spleene
of some. It contents the Dog, to gnaw
the stone, when he cannot reach the
thrower. It was well pleasing to <hi>Saul,</hi>
since he could not catch <hi>David,</hi> that he
might have the blood of <hi>Ahimelech,</hi>
who used him so friendly, and relieved
him in his great distresse, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. so
though these men cannot wreake their
malice upon God, he being out of their
power and reach, yet, that they may doe
him all the mischiefe they can, have at
his Image, they will wreake it upon his
children, in whom his Spirit dwells: as
<hi>Mithridates</hi> kild his Sonne <hi>Siphares,</hi> to
be revenged of the mother: or as <hi>Progne</hi>
slew her Sonne <hi>Itys,</hi> to spite her husband
<hi>Tereus;</hi> or as the Panther, that will fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:21296:265"/>
assault the picture, for the inveterate
and deadly hatred which he beareth to
man: or as <hi>Calignla</hi> caused a very faire
house to be defaced, for the pleasure his
Mother had received in the same; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as true of malice, as it is of love, that
it will creepe, where it cannot goe.</p>
                     <p>Which being so, shewes that this thy
sinne is not small: for if one <hi>revile or
slander</hi> his <hi>equall,</hi> it is an offence, and may
beare an <hi>action of the case;</hi> but if a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
man, it is Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
sharper punishment; and if the
<hi>King,</hi> it is <hi>Treason,</hi> and worthy of death:
then how foule must that sinne be, which
is a <hi>trespasse</hi> committed directly <hi>against
God,</hi> the King of Kings, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25.
and how fearefull the punishment?</p>
                     <p>Wherefore take heede what thou dost,
for as verily as Christ is King of Kings,

God hath chosen to his Kingdome of

It is given to the great Dragon, and the

predestination. A fire in the heart over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
all other fires without, as wee
see in the Martyres, which when the
sweet doctrine of Christ had once gotten
into their hearts, it could not bee got out
again, by all the torments, which wit, and
cruelty could devise: and the reason is,
they over-looke these bug-bears, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Christ calling, the Spirit asisting,
the Father blessing, the Angels comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Word directing, and the Crown

Indeed, the timorous Snaile puts out her

God regards not so much what

of anothers wife, he never attaines
it, perhaps never attempts it; yet he is
an Adulterer. A man would steale, if he

whereof all the family drinkes, with a

Thou maist as well conclude, the Sunne
stood still in the dayes of <hi>Ioshua;</hi> therfore,
it shall doe so in my dayes: for it was a

would honour the ignominy of his

a second crucifying of Christ, as
such a second Thiefes conversion at the

should spurre his Beast till hee speake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Baalams</hi> Beast did once speake: yet
even so wise, and no wiser is hee, that

Now it is usuall with Princes, to save
some heinous malefactors at their Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
when they enter upon their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes

faith S. <hi>Augustine, that none might despaire;
there was but one, that none should presume.</hi>
That suddaine conversion of one, at the
last howre, was never intended, in Gods
purpose, for a temptation; neither will
any, that have grace, make mercy a Cloak
or warrant to sinne; but rather a spurre, to
incite them to godlinesse; well knowing,
that to wait for Gods performance, in
doing nothing, is to abuse that Divine
providence, which will so worke, that it
will not allow us idle: and yet by Sathans
policie, working upon wicked mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved

in wresting this Scripture, it hath proved,
by accident, the losse of many thousand

                     <p>The flesh prophesies prosperity to sin,
yea, life and salvation, as the Pope pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised

that thou shalt have them; but thou <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest
not</hi> his <hi>precepts,</hi> to doe them; nor
his <hi>threatnings,</hi> that thou shalt suffer
them, for thy <hi>not believing</hi> and disodedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
which sheweth, that thou truly <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest
neither:</hi> yea, this makes it apparant,
that either thou believest there is no God
at al, or else that God is not just and true,
nor speakes as hee meanes in his Word,
which is worse; or if thou doest believe
that hee is a just and true God, thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest
also, that thou shalt bee punished,
(as hee threatens) for thy provoking of
him; and thou provokest him, that thou
mayest be punished, which is worst of all:
so that take thee in the best sense, thou
art but one of <hi>David's</hi> fooles, <hi>which say in
their heart, there is no God,</hi> and livest ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
which is never a whit strange, for
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:21296:288"/>
it is usuall with them to thinke there is no
God, for whom it would make that there
were none; what we would have to bee,
we are apt to believe.</p>
                     <p>I confesse, it is hard for men to believe
their owne unbeliefe, in this case; much
more hard to make them confesse it: for
he, whose heart speakes Atheisme, will
professe with his tongue, that he believes
there is a God, and that hee is just and
true, and that every tittle of his word is
equally true; which being but granted,
this must necessarily follow, that God
will as well punish the impenitent, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the repentant.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore bee no longer faithlesse,
touching what is threatned against obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
sinners, but faithfull: for he that will
not believe these witnesses of Gods seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
against sin, shall everlastingly perish.</p>
                     <p>But, suppose the Scriptures were lesse
expresse and cleare in this point: the Law
must not be interpreted according to the
delinquents judgement, but after the will
and meaning of the Law-giver, which
made the same.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, a world of men believe, with <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen,</hi>
that <hi>God</hi> is so <hi>mercifull,</hi> that al in the
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:21296:289"/>
end shall bee saved, both reprobate men,
and Divells: they presume that God must
needs save them, because hee made them,
without any other ground; though in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
fit, they are as apt to despaire, and
to say with the same <hi>Origen, should all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sinners obtain mercy, yet not I:</hi> yea, it is
to be feared, that many die with this fond
presumption of mercy in their minds, as
the <hi>Israelites</hi> with meat in their mouths;
but shall they therefore be saved, because
they think they shal be saved? no, no more

the whole word of God is true, but that
Christ, and all his benefit doe belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

grace, alwayes accompanied with
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:21296:294"/>
other graces, over bearing fruit: and <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>

and a justifying faith? it will manifest it
selfe, by a <hi>holy life.</hi> For, as fire may bee
decerned by heat, and life by motion: so
a mans <hi>faith</hi> may bee decerned by his
<hi>workes:</hi> for, though <hi>faith alone justifieth,</hi>
yet, <hi>justifying faith</hi> is <hi>never alone,</hi> but ever

proved by the fruits of our sanctification:
<hi>faith</hi> and <hi>workes</hi> are as <hi>inseparable,</hi> as the

actuall; of omission, as of commission; les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser

conscience, and such a true filiall feare of
God, that we shall feare to displease him;
not so much because hee is just, to punish
us, as for his mercy and goodnesse sake;
and more feare the breach of the Law,
then the curse: which we may know, by
asking our owne hearts these questions.
Whether we would refuse a booty, if we
had as fit an opportunity to take it, and no
man perceive the same, as <hi>Achan</hi> had?
Whether wee would refuse a bribe, like
<hi>Elisha,</hi> though wee should meet with
one, which were as willing and able to
give it as <hi>Naaman?</hi> Whether we would
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:21296:295"/>
not deceive, though we were in such an of
fice as the false Steward, whose Master
referred all unto him, and knew not when
he kept any thing backe? Whether wee
would not yeeld, in case it should be said
unto us, as the Divell said to Christ, <hi>all
this will I give thee,</hi> if thou wilt commit
such a sinne? Whether we have a <hi>Spirit
without guile? Psa.</hi> 32. 2. and be the same
in Closet and Market, as being no lesse
seene in the one, then in the other? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we more love to be, then seeme, or be

<hi>Phocion,</hi> and seeke more the <hi>power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,</hi>
then the <hi>shew</hi> of it, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 1. For
Christians should be like Aples of gold
with Pictures of silver, whose inside is

and hee serveth God best who serveth
him most out of sight; that wheresoever
hee is keepes a narrower watch over his

him more then his owne.</p>
                     <p>Againe, whether wee are as carefull to
avoide the occasions of sinne, as sinne it
selfe, and not now and then, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally?
Whether we seare our own corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:21296:296"/>
as well as Sathans temptations?
Whether we esteem the Word, as if God
immediately spake to us in particular?
&amp;c. So likewise if our saith be true, our
obedience is constant, like the fire of the
Temple, which never went out, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 7
and universall, making conscience of all
Gods Commandements, one, as well as
another; the first table, as well as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
and the second, as well as the first;
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 19. for a regenerate minde can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consist with a determination to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in any one sin; as when Christ cast
out one divell, we read that he cast out all,
even the whole Legion, <hi>Marke</hi> 5. 12.
God loves those best, that stick closest to
his Word in every tittle: and as Parents
most affect those children, that most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
them: so doth God.</p>
                     <p>It is true (saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi>) <hi>God
gives us Commandements impossible to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that wee may the rather seeke unto him
for grace:</hi> and <hi>corruption</hi> will mix with our

all the weake dispatches of our palsied
soules.
<q>

                           <l>And our perfection, imperfection is.</l>

Neither is it to any man given,<note place="margin">Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wilmix with our purest devotion.</note> to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in any thing: yea, the very best of us,
have not done one action Legally justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
all our dayes; so, that we are as farre
from <hi>perfection,</hi> as the center of the earth
is from the circumference, which semedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter
or space is judged, by the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert,
to bee three thousand five hundred
miles.</p>
                     <p>What then, because we cannot obey in
all, shall we obey in nothing? if we cannot
performe our duty, as we ought; let us do
our good will, and endeavour what wee
can: for it is better to hault in the right
way, then runne in the wrong; especially,
when God expects no more then wee can
do, and accepts of what we are willing to
doe; for if we purpose before hand not to
sin, and in the act doe strive against sinne,
and after the act be sorry for the sinne, sin
shall never bee laid to our charge; if wee
hate our corruptions, and strive against
them, they shall not be counted ours. <hi>It is
not I,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, but sin that dwelleth in me</hi>
for what displeaseth us, shal never hurt us;
and wee shall bee esteemed of God to be,
what we love, and desire, and labour to be.</p>
                     <p>Now let this point bee argued in the
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:21296:297"/>
Court of the conscience (for although o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may give a shrewd guesse, yet the
mother knowes best, whether the child
bee like the Father or no?)</p>
                     <p>Say, whether thou art guilty of these
graces, or not guilty? He who makes not
conscience of sin, hath no true faith; and
the true method of grace is, first, <hi>cease to
do evill,</hi> then, <hi>learne to do well, Isa.</hi> 1. 16. 17
for, as we die to nature, ere we live to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
so we must dye to sin, ere we can live
to righteousnesse; there can be no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
between light, and darknesse, Christ
and <hi>Belial,</hi> the Arke and <hi>Dagon</hi> cannot
lodge under one roof; the house must first
be cleansed, ere it can be garnished; in a
payre of Tables nothing may well bee
written, before the blots and blurs be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
out; the good husbandman first stubs
up the thorns, and puls up the weeds, then
soweth the good seed: if the wax receive
a new image the old doth cease: at least, as
the increase of light, makes a decrease of
darknesse (it being impossible, that two
things of contrary natures should bee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in one subject, the one not expell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the other, either wholly or in part)
so it is betweene <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>corruption.</hi> In a

I repent heartily of that is done, I abhor

it is not so; for <hi>if they were wise,</hi> saith Saint

and wil stands thee in no stead in the next

how the waters should stand upon an

<pb n="618" facs="tcp:21296:318"/>
grossely mistaken, for wherein doth this
their great wisdome consist, but first, in
being wise to deceive others, as the old

thinke how he had cosened the Crow of

got by deceit, is like a peece of buttered

that he may keepe it in banke, for the

we shall take them for wise men, and so

thing else the simpliest creatures
that live: or the fish Polypus, which is a

great skill, in taking of other fishes: yea,

a witch neither can, nor will doe good:
3. a witch will sell her soule to the divel,
that shee may a little excell others in mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe;

and their end in hell, which is

                     </p>
                     <p>Againe, if <hi>innocency</hi> be acknowledged
meere <hi>simplicity,</hi> then none are so simple

Yea, as <hi>Plistonax</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Pausanias,</hi>
when an Orator of <hi>Athens</hi> said, the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians</hi>

thine ill conditions: so may I say to these;
the godly, of all others, have learnt none
of your Atheisticall practises.</p>
                     <p>But let the Holy Ghost determine, that
knowes better how to judge then any:
and then, he is <hi>most wise,</hi> that is <hi>most holy:</hi>
for <hi>goodnesse,</hi> in the Scripture, is tearmed
<hi>wisdome;</hi> and vice, folly; <hi>sinners</hi> and <hi>fooles,
Synomina, Prov.</hi> 1. 7. In the dialect of the
wise man it is plaine, that the <hi>greatest sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
is the <hi>greatest foole:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> thinkes
there is no <hi>foole</hi> to the <hi>Atheist, Psa. 53. 1.
whose wayes utter his foolishnesse, Ps.</hi> 49. 13.
And though worldly men call the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
fooles, yet God <hi>calls</hi> the <hi>crafty, fooles,
Ieremiah 8. 9. Luke 12. 18. 20 Mat. 6.</hi> 23.

with the Spirits helpe, the meanes can
never be too weake; without, never
strong enough. One excellent and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
prerogative of the spirituall man,
is this, he hath God for his teacher, he
learnes the counsells of God, of that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which only knoweth God's counsells,
<hi>Luke,</hi> 21. 15. For though his outward
man receives the elements and rudiments
of Religion, by breeding and education;
yet his inward man receiveth them by
heavenly infpiration. For as spirituall
wisdome is not the fruite of time and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as the naturall is: so it hath a higher
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:21296:337"/>
fountaine then nature to feede it, even the
Spirit of God; which is no small privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
for the Scholler learnes quickly,
when the Holy Ghost is his teacher; the
eye sees distinctly, when the Holy Ghost
doth enlighten it.</p>
                     <p>When Christ taught in the Temple,
they askt, <hi>how knoweth this man the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
seeing he never learned them?</hi> so it
is a wonder what learning some men
have, that have no learning: like <hi>Priscilla</hi>
and <hi>Aquila,</hi> poore Tent-makers, which
were able to schole <hi>Apollos,</hi> that great
Clarke, a man renowned for his learning.
What can we say to it? for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
can be given for it, but as Christ said,
<hi>Father, so it pleaseth thee.</hi> For as <hi>Iacob</hi>
came so soone with his Venison, that his
father askt him, how he came by it so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly;
and <hi>Iacob</hi> answered, <hi>because the
Lord thy God brought it suddenly to my
hands:</hi> so holy and righteous men, can
give no other reason, why they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the words of God so easily, and the
wicked doe conceive them so hardly, but
that God brings the meaning suddenly to
their hearts, as we reade, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. that

<pb n="658" facs="tcp:21296:338"/>

Christ, in faith; faith, in good workes;
to know Gods will, that thou mayst doe
it; and before the knowledge of all other

things, desire to know thy selfe; and in
thy selfe, not so much thy strength, as thy
weakenesse: pray that thine heart may
be insteed of a Commentary, to helpe
thee understand such points of religion
as are most needfull and necessary, and
that thy life may be an exposition of thy

harmony betwixt Gods truth, thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

what the naturall man knowes by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells <hi>Timothy, 2 Tim. 3.</hi> 15. we
must not, in the search of heavenly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
either follow the blind guide, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
reason; or the deceitfull guide, our
corrupt hearts; but the <hi>undeceiveable guide</hi>
of Gods <hi>Word,</hi> which is <hi>truth</hi> it selfe.</p>
                     <p>And great need there is. For, as we
cannot see the foulenesse of our faces, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be told us by some other; or wee
take a glasse, and looke our selves therein:
so neither can we see the blemishes of our
soules (which is a notable degree of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
vvisdome) but either God must
make it knovvne unto us, by his Spirit;
or vve must collect the same out of the
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> that Coelestiall glasse; though
this also must be done by the Spirits
helpe.</p>
                     <p>Now if thou wilt truly profit by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures, resolve to make them
the <hi>rule</hi> of thy life. What is the reason
many are conversant in those divine and
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:21296:341"/>
heavenly mysteries, all the dayes, of their
life, and yet are neither the wiser nor the
better, resembling Wormes in a booke,
or fish in the Sea, which though they are
bred and nourished therein; yet, the one,
is never the more learned, nor the other,
one jot the salter: or like some <hi>Athenian</hi>
Gentlemen in our City, who were wont
to spend all their time in measuring of
<hi>Pauls,</hi> yet know not the length of it: or
some Innes of Court Gentlemen, that
studie the Law, but, being borne to great
meanes, never intend to practise it: or, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
some Physitians, who learne the use
of Physicke, and prescribe it to others,
finding sweetnesse and profit thereby, but
will not once tast thereof themselves,
knowing it unpleasant.</p>
                     <p>Yea, what is the reason, that in study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> they resemble the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
Sayler, who sees Gods <hi>wonders in
the deepe,</hi> but so, as they rather appeare his
playfellowes, then the stirrers of his
zeale? yea, that the very meanes of their
reformation, should become the very fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
of their wickednesse? whereas, the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, makes others no lesse good
then wise, who improve their time by it;
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:21296:342"/>
as some do at a game at Chesse, who by
way of returne, learn both Arithmeticke,
and Geometry.</p>
                     <p>The reason is this, naturall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
men read and heare the Scriptures,
and mind not; or mind, and understand
not; or understand, and remember not; or
remember, and practise not; no, this they
intend not, of all the rest; and they which
are unwilling to obey, God thinks unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to know.</p>
                     <p>When the Serpent taught knowledge,
hee said, if ye <hi>eat the forbidden fruit, your
eyes shall be opened, and you shall know good
and evill, Gen.</hi> 3. 5. But God teacheth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
lesson, and saith, if ye will not eat
the forbidden fruit, your eyes shall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
and you shall know good and evil,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, an holy submission to the word
is the A B C: the Primmer and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
the first lesson and the last lesson of a
Christian: so to <hi>know the good, and perfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and acceptable will of God,</hi> that wee our
selves become good, and perfect, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
in Gods sight, <hi>Romans</hi> 12. 2. is
all in all. Touching wisdome, it is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
the middle, and the end; they
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:21296:342"/>
that <hi>observe the Commandements have a
good understanding,</hi> saith <hi>David, Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> 111.
10. and proves it true, by his owne exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and experience. <hi>I understood,</hi> saith he,
<hi>more then the ancient; and became wiser then
my teachers, because I kept thy precepts,
Psalme</hi> 119. 97, 98, 99, 100. and he was
brought up to little else but keeping his
Fathers sheep; only his aym was; that the
word might make him not witty, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
teach him to follow vertue and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
wisdome, not talk of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God gave him both goodnesse, and
wisdome, as hee gave <hi>Salomon</hi> wisdome,
and riches, and honour, when his petition
was only for wisdome.</p>
                     <p>Briefly, he that can say with <hi>David, I
love thy Law, and keep thy precepts, and
hate all the wayes of falshood, Ps.</hi> 119<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 79.
104. may follow, with <hi>David, I have more
understanding then my teachers and know
more then the ancient, verse</hi> 98. to 107.
But, as <hi>David</hi> could not understand why
the wicked prospered, <hi>untill he went into
the Sanctuary of God, Psalm</hi> 73. 17. and as
<hi>Aaron,</hi> might not enter into the sanctuary,
where God did answer, untill hee had
sanctified himselfe; so, if we will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

shall be like images, that have eares, and
cannot heare, <hi>Psal. 115. 6. 1 Cor. 2.</hi> 14.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, bee studious in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>

Yea, there is use to bee made of our

&amp;c. they neither consider what

                     <p>If you would know in speciall, whom
they are, that in using their gifts, seek not
the glory of God; you may discern them
by these marks. First, they will have al the
talk, wheresoever they come, like Parrats.
2. They contemne others, like the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</hi>
                        <pb n="672" facs="tcp:21296:345"/>
3. They will be wiser then God, and
not submit their judgements and opinions
to his word, like the <hi>Romish</hi> Pontifician
Doctors, who because the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thwarts their opinions, and stands
plainly forbidding images; that images
may stand, they forbid the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
4. They spurne at him which tells
them of their faults, like <hi>Abner.</hi> 5. They
jump with their superiours in every thing,
like the <hi>Herodians.</hi> 6. They turn with the
time, like <hi>Demas.</hi> 7. They seek their own
credit, by the discredit of others, like the
enemies of <hi>Paul.</hi> 8. They love to heare
their own praise, like <hi>Herod.</hi> 9. Above all,
they would have their owne wills, like <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel;</hi>

Yea, I would faine know what fruit, or

whether he seekes not more the praise of

                     <p>Briefly, so many as are puft up with
their knowledge, or doe not part with
their sinnes, shew, that they never sought
it for <hi>Gods glory,</hi> but for their own honour

dissolved to nothing. Alasse! the world
is no more fit to judge of cases of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
then a blind man is fit to judge of
colours. Wherefore as the Orator would
admit none but Rhetoricians, to judge of
his Orations: so henceforward, admit
none but spirituall men to sway thee in
spiritual matters, and follow our Saviours
counsell, seeke to justifie thy judgement
and practise to the children of wisdome,
of whom wisdome is justified; and not to
fooles, by whom shee is daily crucified.
Only condole these blind mens disasters,
and drop some teares in pity and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
for their great and greivous misery.
And so much for the objection.</p>

his word to the hearts of some,

<pb n="690" facs="tcp:21296:354"/>
knowne, the cure is halfe done: so if we
could see corruption in the true forme,
we would loath it. But as the conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Devill appeares not to the Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancer
in hidious and frightfull shapes,
but in some familiar representation: so
vice ever shrouds and shewes it selfe, in
formes most delectable to flesh and
blood: whereas here you have drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse
(in part) disapparelled of her
robes, at least her face is unvailed, to the
end, the sight of it may cause a loathing;
and that loathing, a forsaking; that thou
maist know, abhorre, and beware their
allurements, strive againe the sinne, shun
all occasions of it, bewaile their cases,
that are led captive to it, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And nothing (as <hi>Anacharsis</hi> holds)
will sooner reclaime a man from drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
then the seeing and remembring
of a drunkards odious condition, and
beastly behaviour: which made the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
ever bring their Slaves (when drunk)
before their children, that by beholding
them, they might learne to detest the
vice.</p>
                     <p>Yea, the Persians, and Parthians, to
this end kept; one, the picture of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picure;
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:21296:354"/>
the other, the picture of a Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
alwayes in their houses; and found
by experience, that nothing was so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative
against ebriety and whoredome,
as the continuall seeing of those ugly and
deformed descriptions; which yet were
amiable to this monster, in the judgement
of an understanding clarified.</p>

                        <hi>Quest:</hi> But thou wilt aske,<note place="margin">He the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berest and honestest man, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles this drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard least.</note> how thou

remedy, for thy best advantage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ:</hi> Vpon every occasion examine
what the drunkard (here set forth) does,
and doe thou the <hi>contrary:</hi> as <hi>Domitian</hi>
was answered, demanding, how he might
rule? <hi>to be no lesse loved of the people, then
his Predecessors in the Empire were hated:</hi>
for he is the most <hi>sober</hi> and honest man,
that <hi>resembles</hi> this <hi>Drunkard least:</hi> as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maratus</hi>
replied to an ill liver, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of him, who was the honestest
man in <hi>Sparta? he that is most unlike
thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Doe but conne this lesson, t'is enough.
Neverthelesse, least I should imitate
those, who kindle a fire under greene
wood, and leave it so soone as it but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to flame; turne over the leafe, you

have <hi>compleate Armour against evill So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</hi>
For considering a vision of the
sinne, without a provision against it; a
discovery how they tempt, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
how to avoid their temptations,
is not enough: as in the former Treatise,
I have shewed what drunkards doe; so in
that which followes, I will shew them and
others what they should doe.</p>

Indeed, our outward afflictions here

16. to 19. Alasse! what should they
feare? they prosper in their wickednesse,
they doe what they list, and the Lord lets

pleased with them, and with their actions,
and that which way soever they take, the

yea, this makes them thinke they

he had dispoyled an Idolls temple of all

himselfe, saying, <hi>see how the gods approve

Psal. 10.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>Besides, they have good <hi>hearts</hi> and

<pb n="734" facs="tcp:21296:379"/>
they make not such a shew to the world,
they have as good a heart as the proudest,
and hope to be saved as well as the best,
and so let who will say to the contrary,
they are sure to goe to Heaven, as streight
as a Sickle; and so they shall, for they
shall goe into Heaven (if they amend not
their lives) when the <hi>Sodomites</hi> come out
of Hell; and in the meane time their
soules are so much the sicker, by how
much lesse they are sensible of paine;
<hi>they were wretched, if they felt their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;

but Sathans servants <hi>thrive</hi> more under

in <hi>grace:</hi> the reason is this, Sathan, who
is the god of this World, <hi>blindeth the
minds of all unbeleivers, that the light of the
glorious Gospell of Christ should not shine
unto them, 2 Cor. 4. 3. 4. Eph. 2. 2. 2
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:21296:379"/>
Thes.</hi> 2. 9. 10. for as Sathan is the <hi>Prince
of darkenesse,</hi> so he rules in the <hi>darknesse</hi>
of the <hi>understanding,</hi> dealing with wicked
men, as Faulkeners doe with their
Hawkes; who, that they may carry them
quietly, and doe what they list unto them,
first blind their eyes with a hood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hercules</hi> when he stole away the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Aples from the <hi>Hesperides</hi> (who, as
the Poets feigne, had an Orchard of
them) first, slew the Dragon that kept
them: the keeper and watch of our <hi>soules</hi>
is the <hi>understanding;</hi> now if <hi>Sampson's</hi>
eyes be once puld out, the <hi>Philistins</hi> may
bind him with fetters, put him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
make him grind at the mill, make
him a subject of scorne, and what not? If
the Raven can but first pick out the
poore sheepes eyes, he may easily prey
upon the whole body: if the Eagle can
but throw dust in the Harts eyes, she
makes it nothing afterward to kill him:
if the Dragon have once bereaved the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant
of sight, his whole body easily
becomes a prey to his fury: all these,
namely, the <hi>Philistins,</hi> the Raven, the
Eagle, and the Dragon, are fit emblems
of Sathan, who first seizeth upon the eye
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:21296:380"/>
of the <hi>understanding,</hi> and then preyes free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the rest of the soule.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, what may not an enemy
doe to him which wants his sight? If the
<hi>Assyrians</hi> be once blinded, how easily
may one leade a thousand of them, into
the mid'st of any <hi>Samaria,</hi> even to their
ruine? 2 <hi>King. 6. 18.</hi> 19. Yea, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
is it for a man, not to ruine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
when he wants his sight? <hi>Polyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
so soone as <hi>Vlysses</hi> had puld out his
eye, runs reeling and rushing against eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rocke, untill he had dasht out his
braines. So much <hi>darknesse</hi> as is left in
the <hi>soule,</hi> so much roome is there left for
Sathan to deceive us. While the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
is out, it is safe for rogues to play their
trickes in the darke. Indeed, he will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
his servants any degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
whether it be divine, humane, or
mundane, so it be not a practicall, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentall,
and saving knowledge: he will
allow them an understanding, like that of
the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to condemne them, but not to save
them: yea, let the Devill, like <hi>Nahash,</hi>
onely obtaine our right eyes of faith to be
puld out, it fufficeth, he cares for no more,
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:21296:380"/>
he will then let us enjoy our peace, our
pleasure, and what other priviledges we
doe desire.</p>
                     <p>It is more true of vertue and God's truth,
then it was of that <hi>Creetish</hi> beauty, <hi>no man
loved her, that never saw her; no man ever
saw her, but he loved her:</hi> neither could
concupiscence bring forth sinne, without
the consent of Reason; and this would
never consent, so long as the eyes are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
Wherefore the Devill to utter his
damned commodities, dealeth as some
tradsmen about their bad wares, puts out
the true lights, and sets up false lights in
their stead. If the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>knowledge</hi>
might freely shine in the <hi>soule,</hi> Sathans
suggestions would soone make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed,
and vanish with all his workes of
<hi>darkenesse.</hi> If temptations might be but
turned about, and shewen on both sides,
the kingdome of darkenesse would not be
so populous. But when the Tempter sets
upon any poore soule, he shewes the baite,
hides the hooke; all sting of conscience,
wrath, judgement, torment is concealed,
as if they were not; nothing may appeare
to the eye, but pleasure, profit, and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
happinesse in the enjoying of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:21296:381"/>
those other wofull objects are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for the farewell of sinne, that our
misery may be seene and felt at once.
Thus he delt with <hi>David</hi> in his adultery
and murther, he presented to him, through
the false glasse of the flesh, the pleasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and over amiable delight of his sinne;
but concealed that shame, that griefe,
those wounds of conscience, those <hi>broken
bones, Psal.</hi> 51. and sharpe corrections
that were to follow, that he could not so
much as thinke of them: and so he dealt
with our Saviour, he <hi>shewed him all the
kingdomes of the world, and glory thereof;</hi>
but there was also much griefe as well as
glory in the world, he would shew him
none of that: so in every sinne there is
farre more gall and bitternesse, then hony
and sweetnesse; yet he suffers not our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
hearts to take any notice thereof,
till it be too late; as it fared with our first
Parents, who could not see what they did,
until they had eaten the forbidden fruite:
but then, saith the Text, were <hi>their eyes
opened;</hi> the Divell that shut them before,
opened them them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>Yea, for the most part he labours to
keepe men <hi>blind,</hi> during the presumption

                     <p>It was the practise of the primitive
Church, in her first love, that shee might
shine in beauty and fairenes above alother
Synagogues, not to admit any scandalous
person, or open offender into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints; untill their foule spots
were carefully washt off, and taken away
by the teares of repentance. The <hi>bread</hi> of
the <hi>children</hi> was not given unto <hi>dogs;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by an equall bounty, to the godly
and the wicked, was there an equall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to godlinesse and iniquity,
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:21296:403"/>
but a separation was made betweene
the sick and the whole; and this <hi>separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
had no other intent, but <hi>edification;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
an edification of the spirit, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the flesh: so that men could
find no fault with the dispensers of this
power, having nothing to complaine of,
but that their lives thereby were sought
to be <hi>amended,</hi> and their <hi>soules</hi> to be <hi>saved.</hi>
I confesse, that was a <hi>separation</hi> of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
nature, the power of the keyes being
added, they were <hi>delivered up to Sathan,</hi>
shut out of heaven; herein it is not so, but
this serves to the same end, and is done
only in cases of like fact.</p>
                     <p>The cause was weighty, for which the
gates of heaven, were to be locked; great,
in the thing done; or great, in the wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the doer; and this not without
reason: for the doome was heavie, and fit
for the back of a strong and mighty evil: it
was a short damnation, a temporall hell,
a shutting out of heaven upon earth, yea,
heaven in heaven, even the joyes, and
comforts of the spirit of consolation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could it be but an excellent remedy,
for, besides that it was Gods institution,
the remedy was fitted to the disease: a
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:21296:404"/>
degree of presumption, was encountered
with a degree of despaire; the Scorpion
was made a medicine, against the sting of
the Scorpion; Sathan was set on worke, to
take him downe by terror unto salvation;
whom before hee animated and puffed
up to destruction; he, that said at first, sin
boldly, for <hi>ye shall not dye at all;</hi> now hee
changeth his voyce, and saith, <hi>thy sinne is
greater then can be forgiven thee.</hi> But the
wisdom of dispensation suffered this ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Lion no longer to terrifie, but untill
his terror did mollifie: hee aimed indeed
at despaire and destruction; but the
Church aimed at humiliation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
yea, at consolation and salvation.
And indeed <hi>humiliation</hi> for sinne, is the
only way to <hi>conversion</hi> from sinne; <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi>
from sin, the only way to the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations</hi>
of the Spirit; and the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
spirit is both the guide and the way to
life eternall: therefore, when the man is
humbled, Sathan is casheired; the horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leech
is taken away, when he hath suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
abated the vicious and superfluous
blood.</p>
                     <p>Thus were men <hi>healed,</hi> by <hi>wounding;
exalted</hi> by <hi>humbling:</hi> O admirable use and
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:21296:404"/>
command of Sathan! hee is an enemy to
God, and yet doth him service; he is an
adversary to man, and yet helpes him. A
strange thing, that Sathan should help the
incestuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> to the <hi>destruction</hi>
of his flesh, his concupiscence, and the <hi>edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
of his soule. A strange thing that
Sathan should teach <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
not to blaspheme: he is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of blasphemies, and yet he teacheth
not to blaspheme.</p>
                     <p>But is Sathan contrary to himselfe, and
is his kingdome divided in it selfe? no
surely: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ut one that is stronger then hee
both in wisdome and power, manageth
both his craft and malice, to ends, which
himselfe intendeth not. The divell is one
and the same still, even purely malicious;
but God suffers him to go on in his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
just so farre as temptation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
and no further: therefore while
Sathan is driving the offender to despaire,
God stops his course, when the sinner is
come to due humiliation: and then, as
it was with <hi>Christ</hi> in the wildernesse,
so is it with the humbled sinner, Sathan is
dismissed, and the Angels come and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
unto him.</p>

This was the nature, manner, and end
of publike excommunication: private
hath relation to it; both touching cause
and end. First, publike had respect to the
cause; that it was to be used, only in case
of scandalous, open, and notorious impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
so hath the private; wee do not breake
off society with any for weaknesses, and
sinnes of infirmity. Secondly, that did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aime at their amendment, conversion,
and salvation: so doth this; we desire only
to have them <hi>looke</hi> into themselves, where
the <hi>fault</hi> lyes, and seeke to <hi>amend</hi> their
course: and certainly nothing will sooner
make the adulteresse or drunkard bethink
themselves, then when they see, all that
are honest and sober, even their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and old associates, shun their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and despise them, as if they were not
worthy of humane society: and if they
have the least desire to be reputed honest
and sober againe, and admitted their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
converse, (without which, they are,
as it were, banished into exile) they will
do what possibly lyes in them to redeeme
their credit, and merit their good opinion,
by a more sober, honest, and holy demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
the disparity lyeth only in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:21296:405"/>
and severity of the agents; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
we doe not, we desire not to deliver
them up to Sathan; but heartily pray that
they may bee delivered from him, and all
evill.</p>

There is a pliable disposition in all
men naturally to evill; we follow it, as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
doth the Loadstone, by a naturall and
hidden propensity: our corrupt nature is
like fire, which, if there be any infection
in the roome, drawes it streight to it self:
or like Jet, which omits all precious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and attracts nothing but straws and
dust: or, if a man hath both good and bad
in his nature, either of them will fortifie,
as they meet with their like; or decline,
as they finde a contrary: as <hi>Sampson</hi> did
in his strength, who, at first being hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for all the Princes of the <hi>Philistins,</hi>
at last, by keeping <hi>Dalilah</hi> company, they

                     <p>Yea, suppose a man stands indifferent; his

him into a new nature; and by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
he shall grow up to the same height
with them, as the Hop groweth to the

he himselfe shall do the like to others; as
one peece of Iron, being rub'd with the

                     <p>A good man in ill <hi>company</hi> is like a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
pearle, fallen into the mud; vvhich

teacheth, company comforteth,

in such places the force of <hi>custome,</hi> is in
her exaltation: which made the mother
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the twenty sixth Emperor
of <hi>Rome,</hi> so carefull of her sonnes educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that she kept continually a guard of
men to take heed, that no vicious persons
came unto him, to corrupt him in evill.</p>
                     <p>It was a good conceit of <hi>Themistocles,</hi>
and not triviall, when he set up a bill of an
house, which he had to let, that he added,
aye, and <hi>there be good neighbours too:</hi> for
it shall go hard, but neighbourhood will
somewhat mould the whole familie into
better or worse, as themselves are. The

It were happy, if the injury of a wicked
man could bee confined to his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
that he only might fare the worse
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:21296:407"/>
for his sinnes; that it were but <hi>selfe do, self

roome, or place where he is, and reacheth
to the times, upon which he is unhappily
falne: so after generations are the worse
by meanes of him. An ill president, is like
<hi>Goodwin</hi> Sands, which not only swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up his patrimony, but still continues a
dangerous place, where too many have
miscaried. Hee is a very meane person,
that drawes not some Clyents after him:
even <hi>Thewdas</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> had their foure

of sin is not spent in the act.</p>
                     <p>Sinne among men, like the Murraine
in Cattell, or scab among Sheepe, is of a
catching and <hi>infectious</hi> quality: and, like
the Plague or Leprosie, will runne along
from one to another: our corrupt nature
is like tinder, which is kindled with the
leaft sparke: wherefore it behoves us to
avoid all provoking objects: as a man that
hath Gunpowder in his house, keepes it
safe from fire: and well were it for us, if
<pb n="792" facs="tcp:21296:408"/>
lewd ones were forced to cry, as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

                     <p>Every thing labours to make the thing
it meets with like it selfe; fire, converts all

man will bee busie in dispending that

can converse with nothing, but will work

not eate into the Emerald; that though
the Load-stone draweth Iron after it, yet
it cannot stirre Gold; nor the Jet steele,
though it doth straw; that though the

that if a Ship hath a sure Anchor, it may

security; which therefore an experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

(the while) upon his owne guard. No
charity binds us to a trust of those whom
we have found faithlesse. Credulity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
weake grounds, after palpable disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,
is the daughter of folly. He
that hath once broken his faith, will not
easily be trusted. I know Physitians may
converse with Leprous persons, uninfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
but then they must have stronger
Antidotes, then their natures give them,
or else themselves shall stand in the same

The note which comes too neere in the

Margent, will skip into the Text, at the
next impression. He that will goe as
neere the ditch as he can, will at some
time or other fall in. He that will doe
all that he may, will sometimes doe what
he ought not. It is hard for the best man
to say how farre he will be tempted. If a
man will put him selfe among <hi>Philistins,</hi>
he cannot promise to come forth inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
or if he doe, that soule which lives
among thornes, shall hardly thrive in
Grace. How many have fallen into a
fashion of swearing, scoffing, drinking,
out of the usuall practice of others: as
those that live in an ill ayre, are infected
with diseases? A man may passe through
<hi>Ethiopia</hi> unchanged, but he cannot dwell
there, and not be discoloured. When
once a man gives himselfe over to be the
companion of vice, in the end he becomes
the very slave of vice. The Oxe being
tyed to the Figg-tree, looseth his strength.
Many strokes overthrow the strongest
Oke. Many drops of raine, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Snow and Ice cannot be so hard congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

either the insinuative power of evill, or
the treachery of their owne hearts, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it, or the importunity of wicked

                     <p>An Egg covered with falt (as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers

consumed, whilst the shell is whole. And
we reade of many Townes, which have
in time beene undermined, even with the
most impotent and weake Creatures, as
one in <hi>Spaine</hi> with Coneyes; in <hi>Thessalia</hi>

                     <p>Many an one receives poyson, and
knowes not when he tooke it. Many

even to their gravesend, without waking,
to thinke where they are.</p>

the Army of <hi>Israel;</hi> and when they
light upon wood, they kindle; when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

they blow up all. They therefore
that love such intricate and perplexed
walkes, had need of Iron shoes.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that <hi>Christ</hi> conversed and
kept <hi>company</hi> with <hi>Publicans</hi> and sinners,
(as the Physitian with the sicke) to
heale their soules: neither did they make
him <hi>worse,</hi> but he made them <hi>better:</hi> but
as true it is, that he was without the levell
of temptation; and so is no generall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
I will therefore not only <hi>shun evill,</hi>
but the <hi>meanes</hi> to come to it; and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void

shot: neither will I presume, being but a
man, to follow my master in that which
he did as God. Indeed, many are so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
of their strength, that they
thinke they can come in any company,
and yet come off cleare: but he which
comes to save one drowning, must be
stronger then the other, or else he will be
drowned himselfe.</p>

us to doe that herein which our Saviour
did. Our minds have not that ballast in
them, which his had, and so are sooner
endangered, by the floods of wickednesse.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, whereas they object: that
we may <hi>gaine</hi> by their <hi>company:</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
it possible, for even the most veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and ravenous things that are, have
their commodities, as well as their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyances:
And the Cocke by scraping

<hi>Virgil</hi> from <hi>Enniu's</hi> dunge did Gold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract:
and Apothecaries of Vipers flesh
can make an Antidote against poyson:
an Harlots face may suggest chastnesse:
and a sinfull surfet may prove an Antidote
for sinne: yea, as externall cold kindles
the heate of the stomacke: so we finde it
recorded in holy Writ, that some, by a
spirituall <hi>Antiperistasis,</hi> have growne hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in their zeale, by being encompassed
with the outward cold of wicked an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious
company: like Roses and Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
which flourish the more for being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:21296:413"/>
with Thornes: and Violets, which
are the sweeter and more odoriferous, for
being beset with Garlike and Onions;
for as much as they suck and draw all the
ill savours of the ground unto them. Thus
it fared with <hi>Lot,</hi> who served God better
among the beastly <hi>Sodomites,</hi> then when
he was separated from them. And some
others there are no doubt, who, as they
owe not this grace to themselves, so they
are more for wonder, then imitation. For
if <hi>Daniel</hi> found a guard in the Lyons Den,
shall another thrust himselfe there into for
shelter? and if <hi>Peter</hi> walkt upon the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the water, did the rest of the
Disciples step forth and follow him?
No.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> But say some. By keeping them
<hi>company</hi> we may <hi>winne</hi> them, and happily
<hi>convert</hi> their soules.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer. Hope not so much to
<hi>convert</hi> them; as feare that they will <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi>
thee: for vertue is not so alluring as
vice: the one spreads it selfe, like poyson
in a vessell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other is not halfe so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersive.
Sinne, and <hi>Hagar,</hi> are more
fruitfull then vertue and <hi>Sarah:</hi> false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
more successefull then truth. The
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:21296:414"/>
sore eye infecteth the sound: the found
will not mend the sore. Vinegar will mar
wine; wine will not mend vinegar, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
is spreading and catching: health
is not so. An hundred sound per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
shall sooner catch the plague, from
one infected person; then he receive his
health from them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Salomon</hi> that wonder of wisdome,
might thinke by joyning in affinity with
his neighbour Princes, and marrying
their Daughters, to winne those Heathens
to the Kingdome of God: but he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
for he could doe no good upon
them; they wrought him too much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.
And doth not experience teach us,
that the good are sooner perverted by the
bad, then the bad converted by the good?
even as a tainted ayre doth more easily
infect a sound body, then an wholesome
can cleare the sicke.</p>
                     <p>We reade of certaine Magneticall, or
Adamantine Rockes, in the Iles of <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ole,</hi>
which draw all ships unto them, that
have any Iron pinnes, holding them so
fast, that they are not able to stirre: evill
society, are such Rockes; holy men, the
ships; naturall and inbred corruption,
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:21296:414"/>
the Iron pinnes: he that will be safe, let
him keepe farre enough from such Rocks.</p>
                     <p>A good man, joyned in league with
one that is wicked; is like a living man,
bound to a dead corps, which will sooner
suffocate him, then he revive that: or,
like an Isickle, can endure the rough nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
wind of persecution well enough,
but melteth with the heate of the Sunne,
sweete allurements of the world, and the
flesh. The children of God are, as it
were, dead to their lusts; but if they
should tempt God, by a too familiar so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
with the vicious; who knowes, but
as live coles will kindle dead ones; so
their evill speeches and actions may kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
and enflame them with the love and
liking of lewdnesse? Indeed, as one said
to his suppliant, <hi>make me a Diviner, and I
will make thee rich:</hi> so may a good man
say to a vicious; make me Angelicall,
that is, incapable of being seduced, and
I'le doe my best to make thee a Convert.</p>

and though I bee no Hermit, to sit away
my daies in a dull Cell, yet will I choose,
<pb n="812" facs="tcp:21296:418"/>
rather to have no companion then a bad

                     <p>When <hi>Cato Vtican,</hi> in vacation times,
and at his best leasure, went to recreate
himselfe in the country, hee used to cary
with him the best Philosophers, and
choisest bookes. <hi>Algerius</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre
said, <hi>Hee had rather be in prison with</hi>
Cato, <hi>then with</hi> Caesar <hi>in the Senate house:</hi>
so was it more comfortable, to bee with
<hi>Philpot</hi> in his Cole-house, then with <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
in the Palace: <hi>Boner's</hi> conscience made
his Palace a Cole-house, and a dungeon;
whiles <hi>Philpot's</hi> made the Cole-house a
Palace. The state of grace is heaven upon
earth; and he that knowes the sweetnesse
of Gods presence, wil deeme it more tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
to bee ever alone, then never able
to be so.</p>
                     <p>When I read of <hi>Hiero</hi> the Tyrant of
<hi>Syracusa,</hi> and other such, that gave over
their Kingdomes, to live a solitary life, I
somewhat wonder: I should not, to heare
of a religious and Christian King that did
so. It is impossible for the naturall man to
be so merry, in company; as the believer
alone; yea, saith S. <hi>Augustine, the teares of
those that pray, are sweeter then the joyes of
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:21296:418"/>
the Theater.</hi> Indeed, a witty jest may
make a man laugh more, and lowder: but
he who hath an inheritance fallen to him,
feeles a more solid joy within: so hee that
enjoyes his Saviour, and hath the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of heaven, is truly merry at the
heart, and keepes <hi>Hilary Tearme</hi> all his
life. And indeed, nothing in the world is
worth envie, besides the condition of a
true Christian.</p>
                     <p>But to what end doe I tell a blind man,
how glorious and bright a creature the
Sunne is? or a poore man, what summes
of money are in the Kings Exchequers?
To so many as are unrenewed I speake
in Parables, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 17. Yea, this seemes
to them a <hi>Paradox,</hi> that the people of
God should be a merry people: for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise,
they dreame of nothing but so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarinesse,
and melancholly: as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people thought <hi>Tully</hi> to bee most i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
when he studied most: or as the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
in <hi>Aesope</hi> objected idlenesse to
the Poet: but as he replyed, <hi>I am never so
idle as in thy company:</hi> so may the religious,
we are never so solitary, never so melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly;
as when in society with you that
are vicious. This was <hi>David's</hi> case, which

of Kedar:</hi> he found it a heavie yoke to bee
yoked with irreligious companions.</p>
                     <p>And a double reason may be given of
it, though we feare not to suffer either in
our persons, goods, or good names (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you have it.) For first, the soule that
lives among thornes, shall hardly thrive,
they are such Backbyasses to a godly life,
that they will do what they can, to hinder
our goodnesse to heaven, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of heaven to us; they will wither all
our good parts and qualities which are in
us; like an evill North-wind, they blow
upon the buds of our graces, and nip
them.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondly, It would make a mans heart
to bleed, to heare and consider, how swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
blaspheming, cursed speaking, railing
slandering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quarrelling, contending, jesting
mocking, scoffing, flattering, lying, dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
vaine, corrupt, and filthy scolding,
scurrilous, lose, and idle talking, doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow
with them in all places: so that
such as feare God, had better bee any
where; then in the company of most men.
Now I were madd, if I should so affect
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:21296:419"/>
company, as to live voluntarily where
vexations shall daily salute me.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, a man is not rightly said to
live, untill he hath abandoned wicked so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
<hi>Similis</hi> having lived seven yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from the world, after a long time
spent in a military life, he left this Epitaph
behind him, <hi>Here lies old</hi> Similis, <hi>yet one
that lived but seaven yeares.</hi> This made
<hi>Frederick</hi> the third, Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> when
some such friends of his desired his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
to answer, <hi>I have lived enough to you;

Lord Christ.</hi> Yea, Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> tenne
dayes before he dyed, desired none might
come to him, that so, in that time, hee
might the better fit him self for God. And
indeed, that soule can never enjoy God,
that is not sometimes retired.</p>
                     <p>O that wee could, in any reasonable
time; give a stop to our madding and
straying fancies: that we could, after so
long time spent in the lusts of the flesh,
and pride of life, bring home our cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and intentions unto our selves, shake
off these violent hold-fasts, bid our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
farewel, which have too long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
our soules, and estranged us from
our selves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="816" facs="tcp:21296:420"/>
But when we are so wedded, combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and glewed to the world, it is no ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
matter to make a safe retreat: it is a
fleaing to some to bee sundred; thereby
you pull away some peece of themselves.</p>
                     <p>In this case, what we cannot doe all at
once, let us gaine upon our selves by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
go back step by step; first, block up
one passage, then another. Will you know

him abroad, according to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome)
withdraw him from his study
and bookes, caused the haire of his head
to be shaved off; and after took an order,
that they should not peepe out, untill hee
had shook off his consorts, by continually
making them loose their labours. It
were happy for our young studients, if
they would a little imitate him; if they
were not overmuch affected and addicted
to company keeping; if they would but
consider, that friends are the thieves of

better, in good sadnesse to bee saved with

good fellowship, with the multitude, to
bee drowned in sinne, and damned for

                     <p>We are content (<hi>saith one</hi>) to passe, through
somewhat more unsociably, into happinesse;
it sufficeth wee shall meet with good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:21296:421"/>
at our journeys end, in the kingdome of
heaven, even an innumerable company of
Saints and Angels.</p>
                     <p>The men of the world practise, what
once a Jester spake, who, when a great
Lord asked him, whether he would goe
to Heaven or Hell? answered, <hi>to hell, for
there</hi> (quoth he) <hi>I shall bee sure to meet your
Lordship, and the greatest part of mine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</hi>
But it is not so with the true
Christian: he little loves <hi>Christ,</hi> that will
not follow him without company: and
his zeale is cold to heaven, whom the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of numbers can turn another way.
Wherefore let us say, as much as <hi>Peter</hi>
said; and do more, then <hi>Peter</hi> did; <hi>though
all men should forsake thee, yet will I nt
leave thee,</hi> O Saviour: neither magnitude
of Princes, nor multitude of people, shall
prevaile with me.</p>
                     <p>But the world wrongs religion, when
they accuse it to bee an enemy to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowship:
for she hath not a follower,
which doth not say with <hi>David, Psa,</hi> 119.
63. <hi>I am a companion to all them that feare
thee, and keep thy precepts:</hi> for the godly
mans chiefe <hi>delight is in the Saints, and
such as excell in vertue, Psalme</hi> 16. 3. Yea,
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:21296:421"/>
and their fellowship is so good, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and delectable, that as <hi>Synesius</hi> was of
opinion, that King <hi>Hieron</hi> got more by
<hi>Simonides</hi> acquaintance, then <hi>Simonides</hi>
did by his; and as we read that <hi>Pharaoh,
Saul,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> were more
pleasured by <hi>Ioseph, David,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi>
then <hi>Daniel, David,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> were by
them: so I perswade my selfe, great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
would finde themselves more then
required, if they would vouchsafe the
company of some poore Saints: for a wise
and holy Christian (like his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster)
wheresoever he goes, makes better
cheare then he findes, in an happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
of spiritual repast for bodily. Yea,
as <hi>Plato</hi> accounted it one of the foure
great privelidges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for which he was espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
bound to nature, <hi>that he lived in the
time of</hi> Socrates: so they should thinke it
none of the least favours, for which they
were bound to blesse God, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
so religious and holy society.</p>
                     <p>It is true indeed, there is a supposed
good fellowship, to which religion is an
enemy; because it is an enemy to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fellowship of the Saints: and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the one are to the other, as Wolves
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:21296:422"/>
are to the Lambes: now is it any marvaile
if the Lambes care not greatly for the

would not willingly be alone; yet it is far

                     <p>Generous mindes will associate with

being a King, when he was expulsed

to speak the naked truth; which if we do,
will breed a quarrel. As for instance; one,
jests pleasantly with his Maker; another,
makes himselfe sport with Scripture; a
third, fils his mouth with oathes of sound;
a fourth, scoffs at the religious; one, speaks
villany; another, laughs at it; a third, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends

Every evill we see doth either vex, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

man either sad, or guilty: if we see it, and
be not sorrowful, we are sinful. If <hi>Lot</hi> had
not beene vexed vvith the beastly <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi>
God had beene vexed vvith him:

therefore he is punished with hearing of
their destruction, that was too remisse in
hearing of their transgression. It is easie to
be guilty of anothers wickednesse, even
our very permission appropriates crimes
to us: we need no more guiltinesse of any
sinne, then our willing tolleration. All
sinnes which we give allowance to, being
committed, or not hindered by us, if we
may, are ours, as if we committed them:
first, Commanders; 2. Abbettors; 3.
Counsellors; 4. Consenters; 5. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menders;
6. Connivers; 7. Concealers;
8. not hinderers; each of these will be
found guilty before Gods Tribunall.
What saith the Prophet to King <hi>Iehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,
wouldest thou helpe the wicked,</hi> and
not only so, but <hi>wouldest thou love them
that hate the Lord? therefore for this thing
the wrath of the Lord is upon thee, 2 Chron.</hi>
19. 2. we need doe no more to bring the
wrath of God upon us, then even to love
and favour those which hate him.</p>
                     <p>How much better then to oppose thy
friend by reproving him, then that God
should reprove thee for being at one with
him.</p>
                     <p>But this is no <hi>friendly part:</hi> yes, the

Diogenes</hi> when they called him

Indeed, a flattering friend is a bitter
enemy, yea (as one sweetly) <hi>no enemy can
be so mortall, as those officious Clyents, whose
flattery soothes a man up in wickednesse;</hi> for
they are traytors to the soule, and by a

Whence <hi>Euripides</hi> exhorts men to
<hi>get such friends, as would not spare to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please

those that being new are hard and harsh,

and indeed, he that loves not such a friend,
hates himselfe.</p>
                     <p>A wise man will say to his friend, love
heartily, and then speake what thou wilt.
And for a man not to chide his friend,

it is more policy and discretion to gaine a

                     <p>Againe, as in Gods and their owne

are in company when, and where our

                     <p>My answere shall be such another

what needs the hand cast it selfe betwixt
a blow and the head, though it be cut off
by this meane? what needs the eye serve
more to the use of the other members, in
being watchfull rightly to direct them,
then for it selfe? A good heart cannot
abide to be happy alone; which is a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
answer, to a reasonable question
unreasonably moved. Yea, admit it were
not a duty for one member to seeke the
good of another, or of the whole, and
that God had not enjoyned us so to doe:
I am sure it is a pardonable fault, to doe
lesse good to our selves, that we may doe
more good to, and for others.</p>
                     <p>But suppose we offend them not this
way; yet we shall another, if we keepe

slasht one another, that there was an end
of their voyage. Out of their gallant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
you shall have one kill another,
upon the interpretation of a word; a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
confession, that their life is not
much worth, sith they will sell it so good
cheape: yea, there are not wanting of
them that resemble <hi>Fimbria</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
meeting a Citizen that he hated, gave
him a deadly thrust into the body with his
sword, and the next day entred an action
against him, that he had received but part
of his blade into his body, and not all, as
he meant it.</p>
                     <p>Yea, perhaps they may make you to

doe that which you never dreamt of: like
<hi>Herod,</hi> who cut off <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist's head,
only to answer the expectation of the

it never wants welcome, while selfe-love
is at home: but the plaine dealing
man cannot live among these Vipers, and
not be stung by them: yea, he lives most
in trouble, that most seekes to have peace
with them by a familiarity.</p>
                     <p>Well then, if they are so offensive to
the stomacke of our company, that they
will not let us be at peace; our best way
wil be to spevv them out, to deale with our

into the water, by degrees, drew
them all into a lock of Wooll, which he
had in his mouth, and then left it swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming;
even leave them, without taking
leave of them; or if you like not to teare
friendship asunder upon the sudden, you
may unsowe it by little and little. He
that would not continue a friend, may

To the second part of the objection,
I ansvver. That <hi>true love</hi> and <hi>friendship</hi> is

talke of it, and one drunkard may professe
to another that hee loves him as well as
himselfe; and therein speake truth, for,
saith <hi>Augustine</hi> most elegantly, to such
an one, <hi>thou lovest thy selfe, so as thou wilt
destroy thy selfe; and thou wilt destroy him
whom thou lovest as thy selfe;</hi> yea, better
then themselves; for you shall have one

sweare away himselfe with, <hi>God damn me
Sir:</hi> now how can any wise man thinke
him a friend, that is his own enemy? he
that is evill to himselfe, to whom will he
be good?</p>
                     <p>But see the depth of such a mans love,
and whether it be not to damn thy body
and soule everlastingly. S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> tels
us of one, who solicited a godly woman
to incontinency, saying, <hi>he infinitely loved
her:</hi> she answers, <hi>if you love me so well as you
seeme, put one of your fingers into the flame,
till your flesh be burnt off:</hi> he replys, <hi>that
was no part of love in her to require it:</hi> yes,
said she, <hi>if yours be love, to cause both my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="844" facs="tcp:21296:434"/>
and soule to be burnt in hell fire, for ever,
which by consequence will follow, if I yeeld
to your request, and take your counsell.</hi> Oh
that thou hadst the wit to answer the
drunkard, when he tempts thee, thus.</p>
                     <p>Indeed there is a kind of <hi>agreement,</hi>
which is strengthened by sinne it selfe:
as if one fee the keeper of a wench, his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy
is bought for ever. But all this
while, if one call another, friend, it is but
to give him a nick-name, whereof hee is
not guilty: for true friendship is so sacred,
holy, and pure, that it will not be used in
evill: which made <hi>Pericles,</hi> when hee was
desired by a friend of his, to aide him
with false witnesse, answere, <hi>that hee
would be friend him as farre as the Altar,</hi>
meaning so farre, as stood with piety and
religion, or his duty to God, but no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and <hi>Phocion</hi> refuse to help his son in
law <hi>Cariles</hi> in judgement, being accused
for bribery, saying withall, <hi>that hee had
made him his friend and allie in just and
reasonable matters, and in them only;</hi> and
this likewise made <hi>Papinian,</hi> a Pagan, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

all that are truly religious. There is not
any one (quoth the sincere Christian)
either in blood, or otherwise so neare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, but if he fall from God, I will fall
from him: why? our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> hath

which is in heaven, Matth.</hi> 12. 46. to 51.</p>
                     <p>Whereas on the contrary, in things

Christians, that is their peculiar:
nature, makes husband and wife but one
flesh; grace makes them even one spirit:
<pb n="846" facs="tcp:21296:435"/>
and it is a question, whether naturall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are to be loved above spirituall: we

                     <p>But to goe on. Surely, as grace in her

in a farre more durable bond. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
hearts are joyned one to another,
with so fast a glew, that no by respects
can sever them: as you may see in that
paire of friends, <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>David:</hi> none

<hi>Ionathan;</hi> none in all <hi>Israel,</hi> should be such

and yet all this cannot abate one dramme
<pb n="847" facs="tcp:21296:435"/>

That our Saviour, while he looked upon
the <hi>Pharisies</hi> angerly, <hi>mourned for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their hearts. Zeale</hi> is a <hi>compounded</hi>
affection of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>anger.</hi> When <hi>Moses</hi>
was <hi>angry</hi> with the <hi>Israelites</hi> and chid
them sharply; at the same time he prayed
for them heartily. And <hi>Ionathan,</hi> when he
was angry with his Father, for vowing
<hi>David's</hi> death; did still retaine the duty
<pb n="849" facs="tcp:21296:436"/>
and <hi>love,</hi> both of a Sonne to his Father,
and of a subject to his Soveraign. A good
man cannot speake of them without pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and compassion: yea, they weepe not
so much for their own sinnes, as we doe,
(according to S. <hi>Chrysostome's</hi> example)
O that our prayers and teares could but
recover them.</p>
                     <p>Those that are truly gracious, know
how to receive the blessings of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
contempt of them who want; and
have learned to be thankful, without over
lines; knowing themselves have beene, or
may be, as wretched and undeserving, as
S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speaks. A true Christian can
distinguish betweene persons and vices;
offenders, and offences; and have no peace
with the one, while hee hath true peace
with the other; love them, as men; hate
them, as evil men; love, what they are, not
what they doe; as God made them, not as
they have made themselves; not so hate,
as to be a foe to goodnesse; nor so love, as
to foster iniquity. It is a question, whether
is worst of the two, to be vices friend, or
vertues enemy. Now saith <hi>Augustine,
He is not angry with his brother, that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with the sinne of his brother:</hi> yea, if we

26. 4. 5. and in <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. He is bold to ask
the Lord this question; <hi>Who shall dwell in
thy Tabernacle? who shall rest in thy holy
mountaine?</hi> the answer he receives, is this,
1. <hi>He that walketh uprightly, and worketh
righteousnesse. 2. And speaketh the truth
from his heart. 3. Hee that slandereth not
with his tongue, nor doth evill to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,

                        </hi> and he
cannot be sincere who doth not honour
vertue in raggs, and loath vice, though in

asked <hi>Iehosophat, 2 Chron. 19. 2. wouldest
thou help the wicked, and love them that hate

Christians be friends with them who are

yet to the men, separate from their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
we have no quarrell, but wish them
better, then they either wish to us, or to
themselves.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, if we should contemn them, as
they think we doe; it were but a just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of their folly and wickednesse:
for as one speaking of the poverty of the
purse, saith, <hi>that poverty is justly contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
which is purchased by following of
vice:</hi> so may I, of the poverty of the mind;
that poverty of wit and grace is justly
contemptible, which is purchased by a
wilfull rebellion against God, and the
great meanes of knowledge and grace
which we enjoy. To conclude this point,
we think it's better to leave them, and be
thought proud, wrongfully; then stay
with them, and be knowne bad, certainly.</p>

But all vvhich God hath commanded
must be done; and all vvhich he hath left,

or ought to censure the doing of it. The
precept is plaine, <hi>one believeth that he may

of the same, namely, to be excluded

imitate <hi>Athanagor as,</hi> who (as <hi>Tully</hi> report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
would alwayes complaine of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,

men are neither sensible of doing injury,
nor patient in suffering for it. It's a rule of
justice, that what men deserve, they
should suffer: yea, in this particular case,
Gods rule is, if thou <hi>take away the precious

them suffer this exclusion no longer, then
till they deserve it no more: let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

being in his youth vicious and deboyst,

And good reason there is for it, in a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall

<pb n="855" facs="tcp:21296:439"/>
but the strings that bee in tune, are never
stirred, nor medled with: though indeed I
might have stopped their mouthes with
this very question, whether is better to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
God, or humour sensual men? As our
Saviour Christ stopt the high Priests
mouthes, when they asked him, by what

cast the buyers and sellers out of

<hi>whether Iohns baptisme was from heaven

                     <p>But in case they will not returne unto
