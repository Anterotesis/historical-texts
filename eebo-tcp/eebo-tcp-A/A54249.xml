         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

but ſince I underſtood that it is the inſpiration
of the Almighty that gives underſtanding; I durſt not

Common good: upon this ground then I have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured

how this our tottering Fabrick both in Church and

I have not ſo managed it, as a buſineſſe of ſo

rather then a rationall or Chriſtian Spirit. And heere
I could wiſh I might not ſay ſo of ſome which bite and

truely becauſe of offence, if it could have beene time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Excellency of this outward Forme, which indeede
ought to be obſerved; yet I hope none is ſo ignorant
as to thinke that the true glory and beauty of Chriſts
Church is not more principally within; but ſince
both are concerned in reference to the outward and
inward man; therefore it was that Iſraels deliverance
out of Aegypt was a deliverance in an outward way
of Worſhippe for both; upon which ground it is not

in their proper place, orderly and ſweetly diſpencing an equall
diſtribution, to God, and each particular being. The rules and
bounds for which, was the law of nature, reaſon, &amp; morallity.</p>
            <p>The diſciplin was by inſtruction, exhortation, example, and
ſuch like, to draw forth and exerciſe daily the intellect of all
intelligible creatures in the things before recited. So as from
non-age, to ful-age, each particular according to their meaſure
and proper place, might become ſerviceable to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
and publicke good. There being yet this difference in
the ſtate of innocency (though continued) between <hi>Adam</hi>
and his progeny, that as he was created a perfect man, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
faculties was acted readily from himſelfe as ſeveral
objects and relations were preſented in their time and
place, whereas his poſterity ſtood in need of a continual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcation
of inſtruction from others, before they could act
their inward principle, dexteriouſly, and habitually in a
way of nature and reaſon, to which, other parts of diſcipline
before expreſſed in this ſtate of corruption, is neceſſarily to be
added, ſharpe reproofes and ſevere corrections. The next and
laſt particular appertaining to this Government, is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
end: Namely the preſervation of each mans propriety
in name, goods, and other things of this life. And herein the
particular and intire intereſt of this and all other civil ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
doth conſiſt. A firſt Teſtament and Covenant once in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103027:6"/>
power of man to keepe moſt perfectly, which ſince through
weakeneſſe of the fleſh, fruits and effects of the fall, is now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
preciſely to be performed: All men in nature thereupon
by a juſt ſentence, as under the firſt breach of this Law, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
children of the curſe, wrath, and death: wee need not
wonder then at the revolutions and changes of Government, ſince
every thing elſe now is reſtleſſe, untill it returne to its primitive
and ſupreme center, from whence there was ſuddainely ſo great
an Apoſtacy, that the whole earth was filled with violence, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
immediately after, mans commecall ſcheane of Tereſtiall
glory, became diſſolved into a watery Tragedy, a few inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
perſons for number, only excepted, preſerved from being
overwhelmed in that univerſall deluge, which no ſooner by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
had againe filled the ſurplaſe of the earth, but the like uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
corruption appeared: All fixed principles for pure Nature,
Reaſon, and Morallity, was by it eaten out, and became oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
which doubtleſſe was the cauſe why God in the next Age
did againe minde the ſame through the figure of circumciſion, as
alſo, not long after in that terrible manner upon Mount <hi>Synaia</hi> in
<hi>Iudea,</hi> the Hemiſpheare of Nations, give out his Law, to ſhew
man once more, not onely from whence he was fallen, but to
ſtirre him up thereby to his former duty, the matter whereof was
engraven in Tables of ſtone, evidently to be ſeene and read of
all men.</p>
            <p>And although heere againe, the forme of this Government
then was Monarchicall; yet was it not therein an indiſputable
preſident and patterne for other Nations or ſucceeding times, for
though it ſhould be admitted that this was moſt Primitive, and in
Gods eſteeme moſt Excellent, either in <hi>Adam,</hi> and thoſe other
Anoynted Kings, to whom extraordinary aſſiſtance and abilities
was given for performance of ſuch a truſt, as particular Types
of Chriſt: Yet experience tells us through changes; and reaſon
and providence dictates no leſſe; that where this immediate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Aſſiſtance is wanting, to guide any ſingle ſupreme in evill
times of defection, that Government proves dangerous, and
thoſe Governours probably moſt ſafeſt for that people, which
ſhall through providence be admitted to Rule, after a ſenſible
feeling, and late deliverance with them from under a yoke of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103027:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It not to me ſeeming likely, that ſuch who have ſeene
juſtice done upon others, themſelves in it being inſtrumentall,
ſhould through Tiranny by any Law, make heavy yokes for their
brethren, and in it their owne Poſterity (which if) they would
be moſt inexcuſable, becauſe they of all other, in this latter Age
of the world have ſeene moſt examples and preſidents of the
good, and evill of Government: Thus much then of the firſt
particular, in which is briefely ſhewed the Miniſters, matter,
Forme, Lawes, diſcipline, end, and intire Intereſt of all Civill
Government, both at firſt and ſince, which becauſe it was held ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
forth in the Common-wealth of the Jewes: It was
called a Sanctuary<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 9. v. 1.</note> yet worldly and fleſhly, far different from
that, which concernes the inward and ſpirituall man, which
though the miniſtration of it be in the fleſh; yet it is not after,
nor for the preſent, little appertaining thereunto: It being untill
the day of our bodily redemption,<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 3. v. 23.</note> under the diſcipline of the
firſt Teſtament; for corrupt fleſh, as all now is, muſt as graſſe and
the flower of the field, firſt wither, become dead, &amp; vaniſh away in
the judgement of thoſe, which are to be fit matter for the ſecond
and new Teſtament, for the body<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. v. 10.</note> muſt be dead becauſe of
ſinne, when the ſpirit is to live for a better righteouſneſſe ſake.</p>
            <p>And ſo I come to the ſecond particular, the Government Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall,
which imediately receded the other in the Infancy
thereof. The inſtruments and formes whereof, hath alſo beene
various before the time of Chriſts fleſhly preſence; the reaſon
of which was, the good pleaſure of the Fathers will, the divine
myſtery of his Grace, ſince revealed to us in the fullneſſe of time,
for the moſt part hid in<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. v. 6, 7.</note> him, whoſe diſpenſations &amp; works
alwayes appeare moſt perfect in the end. During the infancy and
minority, of the myſticall body of Chriſt the Church then begun;
it ſeemed good to him here and there to enlighten, and by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and inward call, to ſeperate and ſegregate from the Common
maſſe of mankinde, ſuch as ſhould hold forth according to the
meaſure of faith then diſpenced, the word of life: That in divers
wayes, manners,<note n="e" place="margin">Heb. i. v. 1.</note> and formes of diſcipline, were made inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
in their generations, to congregate as time and place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded,
the children of truth. Gradually firſt preparing, and then
through union of affection couching them in their due place, as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103027:7"/>
ſo many polliſhed ſtones, upon that precious corner, and firſt
foundation ſtone of the ſpirituall Temple Chriſt Jeſus: I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
not here for brevity ſake, to write ſeverally of the particular
Formes in thoſe Ages paſt; but rather with the<note n="*" place="margin">Shrill cry.</note> Authour of
that forenamed Pamphlet, I ſhall fall in with his Method in that
Forme ſince, as a Government for us more practically imitable:
It was evident then according to Scripture, when the full time
appoynted of the Father, for the ſpirituall liberty and age of the
Church was come: He ſent forth his Sonne into the world, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
him with humane fleſh, and in the ſubſtance and ſhape of
man put him under the Law:</p>
            <p>That in his pure fleſh, in mans ſtead, and for his benefit,
he might actively and paſſively performe, what God or man, by
any Law could poſſibly require; and though he knew no ſinne,
neither was a tranſgreſſor of any Law; yet he being inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
in the Creation of man, the firſt, and ſupreme<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 2. 6. 7. 8.</note> head of man,
by relation a<note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 13. 14,</note> brother to man, and by a peculiar right had an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in man; it was both juſt and reaſonable, that he onely as the
fitteſt perſon ſhould principally tranſact the affaires of man, and
for that end, he was by God in the behalfe of all fallen man, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
a ſinner, numbred amongſt tranſgreſſors, made a curſe by
ſuffering upon the Croſſe, as a Thiefe and Murtherer, that ſo tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
this, Gods peculiar ordinance and acceptance, he might no
more remember or puniſh eternally the tranſgreſſions commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt the firſt Teſtament; as alſo to give a ſure ground of
future hope, that the bodies of the faithfull one day, ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
redeemed from the power of ſinne, death, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
unto which by a righteous ſentence, they became with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
moſt miſerably captivated, with all to give good aſſurance
to all ſuch, by the death and ſealing bloodſhed of this Sonne
of God, which was appoynted to be both the teſtator and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
of the new Covenant<note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 9. 15.</note> eternally ſtabliſhed upon ſure
promiſes, their ſpirits once cleanſed from the filth and guilt of
the old: May now by a new and living way thorough the vaile
of his fleſh, have a free paſſage into the moſt holy Sanctuary and
preſence of our heavenly Father, in the glorious liberty of the
Sonnes of God; and for that end this our great high Prieſt and
Apoſtle of that faith, which wee ſhould profeſſe during the time
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103027:8"/>
of his abode upon earth, he made it his own; becauſe the Fathers
worke, to diſpence light according to his will in matters of this
Nature, that ſo by it, he might publiquely gather unto himſelfe all
thoſe children of God that were capable Subjects for an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
adminiſtration; and for that cauſe he was pleaſed to elect,
not onely twelve principall, but many others, to whom he did
impart thoſe myſteries, that they might afterwards as good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Scribes before inſtructed, communicate the ſame. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom after his aſcention he poured out his ſpirit, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
of extraordinary gifts; that ſo by them the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
begunne, and forme preſcribed for ſuch a ſprituall ſtructure
might ſucceſſively be carried on in all ſucceeding times, untill
the very top ſtone ſhould be layed, and grace, grace, cryed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
Its eaſily conceived then by thats paſt, who were the
Mr. workemen, and what was the matter for this building; but
for evincing a double miſtake in our pretended Mr. Builders: Its
neceſſary the matter of it be a little further conſidered: It being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by ſome on the one hand, that all perſons in a Nation; yea
infants are fit materialls for this Caeleſtiall Fabricke: The folly
of which opinion appeareth, in that it is not onely contrary to
the practice and direct precept; but alſo the true nature and end
of this inſtitution by Chriſt: Beſides, what benefit can acrew to
Infants, and others almoſt as uncapable to be made Members by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
initiating ordinance, ſince they are in no capacity (through na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
weakeneſſe) viſibly to doe or receive any good, neither
hath God at any time, or any where (as is falſly by them premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
engaged through an unwarrantable uſe of Baptiſme, to
waſh away originall ſinne, Regenerate, viſibly unite to himſelfe,
and ſave Infants; for why then doth not anſwerable effects fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
Time quickly ſhewing that many thouſands ſo baptized,
become Abhominable and Reprobate to every good worke:
Strange therefore it is to ſee how theſe men have been puſled to
evade the cleare light of this Scripture; Go diſcipline and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
and that other Scripture, he that believeth and is baptized
ſhall be ſaved; but to theſe perſons it ſeemeth fulfilled, if they
injoyne others to profeſſe faith for them, which viſibly have none;
as if one mans bare profeſſion, which is not probably reall, were
with God meritoriouſly ſaving for others, in like manner are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103027:8"/>
they puſled about Circumciſion, which they ſay Baptiſme cometh
in the roome of, when its clear to them which wil underſtand, that
Circumciſion was no initiating ordinance for a Church, and
Goſpel fellowſhip? It being but a ſigne of an externall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and ſtipulation made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, for a revive
of the firſt Teſtament, touching a civill and unblameable conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
in the fleſh: For ſayth God, my Covenant ſhall be in
your<note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 17. ver. 13.</note> fleſh: So that all Iſrael after the fleſh, by the Law gende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to bondage, were not Iſrael after the ſpirit, borne of the
free woman, gendering to a ſpirituall liberty: And this I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
verily to believe, for theſe Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe all thoſe that partook of Circumciſion, by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
proof were rigedly bound to a perſonall and perpetuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the Morall Law, in reference to the outward man
<note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 5. 2.</note> which our Saviour yet teſtifieth, none of them did<note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 4. 19. 23.</note> keepe,
nor indeed could, as they might the Ceremoniall and other Lawes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From the nature of the law it ſelfe, which in
Scripture, is compared to fire, hammer, Sword, &amp;c. whereof
circumciſion was a figurative ſigne, ſhewing it to be no leſſe
then a keen cutting inſtrument, through the penalty, which by
a ſecret inſition was to ſeperate that caule, skin or film ſpread
over the Spirit, eye, &amp; judgement of reaſon, at firſt occaſionally
entering in by the ſences, &amp; now through cuſtome being ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually
contracted in mans nature, as it proves to ſome many
times an incureable diſeaſe.<note n="i" place="margin">Coloſ. 2. v. 11. 12. 13.</note> Neceſſary it was then, that
from the eight day of the wombe,<note place="margin">A good note for a timely inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.</note> at the firſt budding
of the ſences they ſhould bee gradually and regularly
diſciplined accordingly. And as for time, ſo for place,
this ſigne was very ſignificant, it being done there, from
whence inſtrumentally was to bee acted, the ſtrongeſt and
moſt burning luſt of humane and naturall concupiſcence, the
difficulty in ſuppreſſing which, and the danger of neglecting,
was ſecretly hinted by the paine, ſorrow and bloodſhed in this
ceremonial tranſaction, neither is the perſons leſſe obſervable,
God ſhewing by ſuch an adminiſtration, that it was the male,
not the female that was firſt intruſted, from whom as
the head and ſtronger veſſel, he cheifly of him required perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
or elſe his blood muſt go, or ſome others for him muſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103027:9"/>
doe and ſuffer, what in Gods account is a ſatisfaction equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Iſay 42. ver. 22,</note> When circumciſion and the Law, was moſt in
force, and highly exalted, and through a ſence thereby of mans
weakneſſe, though it became inſtrumentall to beget as upon
<hi>Hagars</hi> knees faithfull children unto <hi>Abraham:</hi> Yet Goſpell
and Evangelical righteouſneſſe, as a ſpring and river of life,
ſweetly, yet ſecretly was then running under allegories,
tipes and ceremonies, in a miniſtration diſtinctly differing from
the former, for they all dranke of the ſame ſpirituall Rocke
that followed them, and that Rocke was Chriſt, and they all
were baptized as wel as circumciſed, though miſtically under a
cloud and in the Sea, where water and not blood, was the
materiall ſubſtance of this ordanicall Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, From the nature and end of baptiſme it ſelfe,
which is not to bee paraleld ſo, as to come in the roome of
circumciſion. The matter and manner of which holy inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
preſenteth to our view aud ſerious conſideration, theſe
ſeverall things following. Firſt, That it is neither circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
nor any other ceremoniall reparation, but an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Sacramentall diſſolution of our bodily elements, into
their firſt principles, as beſt ſuiting with a viſible Goſpell ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
From which ſecondly, was lively repreſented
to the eye of faith, not ſence, by the death of the body, a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
freedome from the imputation of ſin,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 6. v. 9, 10, 11.</note> power of the
law, curſe, death and the devill. The ground of which, is
this, in that God at firſt gave this Law principally to be bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ſenſitive and weaker part, the inward man from it
being deſtinct, although united, makes but one perſon<note n="l" place="margin">For want of a true diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of theſe natures lit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le of the Scriptures and heavenly miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the goſpel is underſtood.</note> upon
which the outward, being firſt in the tranſgreſſion, and by
occaſion an inlet of ſin to the other. It pleaſed God, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
that ſin, and charge the puniſhment upon it, when yet
by a decreed union. If faith in an unexpected promiſe had
not intervened, the inward had alſo been in the ſame predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament,
from the neerneſſe of which union of theſe two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
natures, there is a communion of operations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties,
ſo that what may be affirmed of one and the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
at one and the ſame time, in referrence to one nature,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103027:10"/>
may be denyed of the other, ſo that by one he may be ſaid to
be earthly, dead under the law, &amp;c. and by the other, he may
be ſaid to be yet heavenly, not living under that Law, holy, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and under the protection of God for ever. And yet again,
where faith in a promiſe is not, there a perſon in both natures is
perpetually miſerable, but where it is, that perſon in both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
is eternally happie.</p>
            <p>Yet in order, firſt the one and then the other, this then aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
is cleared, if we obſerve that when God came to execute
judgement, he progreſſively paſt ſentence upon that which was
the firſt occaſion of ſin, beginning with the Serpent, then the
woman, and laſt of all, with the earthly man, making good his
former threatning, <hi>That in the day it did eat, it ſhould die,</hi> For
<hi>earth it was, and to earth it ſhould return,</hi> which was the ſubſtance
of the outward, not the inward<note n="m" place="margin">For if God had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to paſſe a ſentence of an eternall death on this breach, ſince it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily without any condition of faith in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which if God had been true of his word (a thing not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted) man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily then had in both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures eternally periſhed. It was the earthly part then that lay under that temporall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which before one thouſand yeers, Gods day, it perfectly expired, from which firſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence it was hourely declining, beſides this alſo appeareth in that the ſatisfaction was made in the fleſh of Chriſt, which through the Union was not without extream anguiſh of ſpirit, <hi>Rom. 8. Hebr.</hi> 10. and elſewhere.</note> man. Thus then this exact com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
elementarie ſubſtance, at firſt a fit inſtrument for the
celeſtiall Spirit, to tranſact a terreſtial ſervice, being under the
ſentence of death, it became not only unſerviceable through
a declining weakneſſe, but it cauſed alſo a ſpirituall death, dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the edge and quenching the ſparklings in the Intellect of the
divine off-ſpring, for the cheering and reviving again of which,
he was pleaſed by a promiſe in a bleſſed ſeed of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
to give hope to the one, by dying, of a better Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and through the quickning ſpirit, for the preſent to give the
other deliverance from a ſinful captivity. Now a figure of this death
of the body was lively held forth by the bodies &amp; blood of Beaſts,
which were to be offered up in Sacrifice, as a preſent attonement
for the reprieve of all ſublimary created things of the ſame elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
ſubſtance, until the ſubſtance of that which was chiefly tipifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and intended, namely the body of Chriſt; in which as a ſpiritual
publike perſon, all the bodies of the Saints was included, in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
up of which, the wil of God being done, he hath conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for ever (through that will) thoſe which by faith in his blood
were ſanctified. Thirdly, Baptiſme was alſo ordained, that it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103027:11"/>
might be not only a ſimilitude of that union and communion
of the body of Chriſt with the faithfull, but alſo that it might
hold forth by this union to a viſible part in the behalf of the reſt
of the members of the inviſible body, a community of the ſame
Spirit, vertue, life, reſurrection and glory, of the Head.</p>
            <p>And this we find excellently ſet forth to us; worthy our ſerious
peruſall, in the ſixt and ſeventh Chapters to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
in the ſeventh ſhewing, That now the firſt husband the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
to whom the Spirit by union was marryed, it was dead to
the Law in the body of Chriſt; ſo that now the ſpirit without
being counted an Adultereſſe, might make choice for a husband
him that is raiſed from the dead: That by ſuch a union it might
bring forth fruit unto God, for faith he, when we were in the
Fleſh, the affections of ſin which were by the Law, had force in
our members to bring forth fruit unto death, but now we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the Law, he being dead, that is to ſay, the body, in
whom we were holden, that we ſhould ſerve him in newneſs
of Spirit, and not in the oldneſſe of the Letter. Fourthly and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the water in Baptiſme, covering the earth of mans body, it
being plunged therein, was further ſignified, the ſanctifying and
renewing again of the body through that Spirit, which by a firſt
moving on the ſurface of the waters, gave being in the creation
to all things of the ſame Elementary ſubſtance, which ſhould be
as certainly performed, as mans body came forth of the waters; a
ſure teſtimony of which was evident in the head, and others the
firſt fruits of the ſame: by this then as I conceive, hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
the firſt error, ſhewing that Infants and many others,
upon theſe grounds, are not fit matter for a viſible Church
or Congregation, and though I have in this exceeded an intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
brevity, yet in things ſo greatly Important; it will I truſt be
excuſable, for this ſeriouſly conſidered will put an end to thoſe
bitter long diſputes, and voluminous Treatiſes about the Law,
and Goſpel. Gods ſeeing, or not ſeeing ſinne, in reference
to the one, or the other Covenant, &amp;c. The Error on the other
hand is, in ſome that conceive them only fit, which for knowledg
and practiſe are ſeemingly more eminent, whereas at firſt a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
conviction, and need of a Chriſt, and a voluntarie ſubmiſſion
to his government, for a further Inſtruction through doctrine
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103027:11"/>
and diſcipline was a good ground of admiſſion. For Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in the Church, is a Kingdom of Grace, long-ſufferance, and
meeknes. The Subjects whereof at firſt are very rough hewed,
not poliſhed ſtones, weak in knowledge, and many times more
in practice. Thoſe Miniſters and ſtrong Chriſtians then intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ought to bear the Infirmities of the more feeble, carrying
theſe Lambs in the boſome of Love, leading gently, and guiding
theſe younglings in grace, like good Paſtors, ſo truly knowing
the ſtate of their flock, as to diſtinguiſh them by their names,
natures, and manners, that ſo he might accordingly feed them
with knowledge and underſtanding; Not in civill contentions,
but Evangelicall concluſions, but how rare are ſuch at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
&amp; what plenty of thoſe ſhepherds that God ſo<note n="*" place="margin">After the manner of men.</note> paſſionately
and pathetically reproves in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> time, that he ſaid, Eat the
fat, and clothed themſelves with the fleece of the Sheep,<note place="margin">Ezek. 34.</note> but did
not care to feed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Zach. 11. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters worthy to be obſerved of all ſuch as are intruſted with the care of Souls.</note> ſo as to ſtrengthen the weak, heal the ſick, binde
up the broken, bring again that which is driven away, neither
ſought that which was loſt, but with cruelty and rigour did they
rule them. The Lord himſelfe then the great and living Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
there promiſeth to ſupply their place, and doe that for
his Sheep which was neglected by thoſe evill Shepherds, that is
to ſay, to lead them into green Goſpel paſtures, refreſhing them
with the ſweet and pleaſant ſprings of ſalvation, ſtrengthening the
weak, healing the ſick, &amp;c. As it followeth excellently in the
ſame Chapter.</p>
            <p>The next thing then to the matter, is the form of this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was firſt, thoſe Miniſteriall officers, as to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and perpetual, were Paſtors, to inſtruct and teach. Deacons,
to collect, keep, and disburſe the publike ſtock. Elders, among
themſelves to over-rule and end all civill and occaſionall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences;
Seers, to watch over each particular Member, which was
to preſent, as need required, the true ſtate of things to the
Church; there was alſo a forme of Sacraments, one of Baptiſme,
of which is already ſpoken. One other and main end of which
was to diſtinguiſh all viſible members within, from them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
putting ſuch into a viſible capacity thereby of thoſe benefits
before expreſt, to which then was added the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, through which, thoſe before baptized were made
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103027:12"/>
to drinke into that one Spirit, which ſpiritually quickned it by
faith in the blood of Chriſt, running through the veins of the
whole body, typically repreſented by way of Communion in
the Element of wine, to the very ſenſes of the faithfull, all thoſe
benefits of Chriſts death and reſurrection, which upon frequent
meeting they were publikely to hold forth in remembrance of
the ſame.</p>
            <p>After theſe, next in order was the forme of doctrine, that is
to ſay, firſt, To acknowledge God even that Father of whom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
and effentially were all things either temporall or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
according to whoſe ſupream will, all the diſtinct families
in heaven and earth was both ordered and named; As alſo that
Jeſus Chriſt his firſt begotten ſon, was that perſon by whom all
things was made, is now preſerved, redeemed, and ſhall again,
what belongs to him, be reſtored; for which cauſe he deſcended,
ſuffered, aſcended according to the Scripture, <hi>ſitting now at the right
hand of God, untill all enemies are made his footſtool,</hi> which once
performed, <hi>he ſhall then deliver up the kingdome to God the Father,
which then ſhall be all in all</hi> to the whole body, filling every part
according to their meaſure with his owne fullnes; as he now
doth the head, for the effecting of all which glorious promiſes,
in the behalf of the holy viſible, inviſible, militant, and at laſt
triumphant Church. That there is one infinite, inviſible, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible,
moſt omnipotent Spirit, which is that of the Fathers,
communicated to the Son and from him, as head, to the whole
body. The fift was the form of diſcipline, which was this, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Officer in their proper place, through meeknes and love, by
exhortation, inſtruction, reproof, and if need require, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the Church, through excommunication, to uſe their utmoſt
endeavour to preſent ſuch, who have voluntarily ſubmitted unto
their Government, blameleſſe in the day of Chriſt; And then
the laſt of all is the ſupream end, namely, the preſervation of
each Saints propriety in their ſpirituall names, priviledges and
benefits of an eternall life, ſo as each member in their proper
place, may according to the effectuall working and power,
which is in the meaſure of every part, receive the increaſe of
the body unto the edifying it ſelfe in love, untill we all meet
together in the unity of Faith, and that acknowledging of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103027:12"/>
Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the age
of the fulneſſe of Chriſt. Thus as briefly as I could, hath been
ſhewed alſo the Governours, Government, matter, forme, of
doctrine and diſcipline, with the diſtinct and ſupream end, of
this Eccleſiaſticall Government of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The third thing promiſed to be conſidered was this, In
what reſpect theſe two Governments, ſo diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
as heaven and earth, may yet agree and dwell together in
a Nation, City, Family or perſon. Firſt, they may agree in
this, that the ſon of God is conſtituted, and by publicke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration,
is Crowned and anoynted King and Head of both
theſe principallities and powers, with their ſeverall Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and weapons, whither Carnall or Spirituall. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
they may accord in this, that the ſpirituall deſerves
the right hand of fellowſhip, ſince all ſublimary things had
a being with the externall, for ends ſubſervient to this, which
when it ſhall perfectly be accompliſhed in the Nations. This
exterior Government ſhall be diſſolved and ceaſe. The Kings
and Rulers of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> rejoycing to bring their glory to
it; caſting their Crownes at the feet thereof, as a due hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to this eternall Excellency.<note n="*" place="margin">Iſay 60 to the end.</note> Thirdly, they may ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ecco in this, to pray for, rejoye in, and wiſhing well,
to the proſperity and peace of each other. And Fourthly,
They may be unanimous in this, namely to aſſiſt and preſerve
each other, in their diſtinct ſphere and equipage, ſo that God
as ſupream may have his due, and man as ſubordinate his.
Fiftly and laſtly, That they may and ought to aſſent in this,
that each perſon in reſpect of his outward man, is under the
command, approbation, and puniſhment of a Civill ſtate, as
it ſhall act publickly for the good, or to the apparent preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of the ſame, when at the ſame time the inward, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of faith, as they concerne another life, is under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
approbation, or puniſhment of the Church, whereof
he is a Member, As it ſhal publickly act for the good or the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
prejudice thereof. Thus having paſt the ſecond, I come
to the third.</p>
            <p>Well then, as for the lawfull authority of thoſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
that through the over ruling hand of the moſt high,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103027:13"/>
we are at this preſent under, I diſpute not. Of which, thoſe
that are doubtfull and deſire to be informed, may do well to
read that forementioned<note n="*" place="margin">Shrill Cry.</note> ſheet or two, which perfectly ſpeaks
my judgement therein. This premiſed, I proceed to the third
and laſt generall head of this diſcourſe, namely firſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
by way of propoſal to our Honourable Worthies, ſome
probable meanes whereby their Government may be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to themſelves, and proſperous to the people. And here
with the beloved Diſciple <hi>John,</hi> I ſhall minde them of that
which was from the beginning, according to that which
hath already been in part, ſhewed, that is to ſay, Firſt, that
they would aime at the ſame end, in all tranſactions, which
God did in the Primitive Inſtitution of a Civil Government,
which briefly was this, that they would be ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Magiſtrates, giving God and man his due, after the two
Tables, according to nature and reaſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for purſuing of which, becauſe not ubiquitarie,
<hi>Jethroes</hi> counſel might be taken, to chuſe out in the Nation men
fearing God, hating covetouſneſſe, which in their places may
judge and determine leſſer matters.</p>
            <p>Thirdly that accordingly as at firſt, there may be a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not onely Magiſticall, but ſympatheticall, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall.
That ſo it be not endangered to ſplit upon the Rock
either of a juſt calumny, or a puſillanimious contempt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That for the protection and praiſe of them
that doe well, they would take notice of evill doers, diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of publick peace, to make them exemplary for the ſame,
which principally now are the<note n="*" place="margin">Deſpiſe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The firſt of which, upon what male contented ground, or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
I know not, indeavour machevile and Jeſuite like, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
and diſtract, and as much as in them lyes to confound the
Councells of our experienced grave and honourable Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
out of a pretended Jealouſie before tryall made, after all
their winnowing, may probably betray their truſt, which to
me, certainly neither the law of Nature, God or Nations, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gave private perſons ſuch a power, to anticipate and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge,
the tranſactions in dubious matters of their ſupreame
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103027:13"/>
Governour, which doubtleſſe muſt needs have more knowledge
(through experience) in the affairs of State then the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
private ſpirit amongſt the giddy multitud. And as for
thoſe other, which pretend to be Sacred, calling themſelves Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
of Chriſt, which if they were indeed: They would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſpeak reproachfully evil of the rulers of the people, as they
do in Pulpits, and did in their late Letter to the General and
Officers of the Army, a Paper, in it ſelfe moſt ſalfe and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
ſince thoſe that they aſperſe are publicke perſons; And
themſelves (though preſumed publick) are in civill things
private, which if no more were ſaid, it was a ſufficient anſwer
to their Letter. Againe, if it ſhould be admitted, that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Governours, and thoſe under them intruſted<note n="*" place="margin">The General.</note> now in
being, were an uſurped power, and not agreeing with the
law of the Land, as they falſly inſert, yet Gods bare permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſuch a power, were ground enough not only of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
but their prayers alſo. If the precept of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> be by them thought imitably practicall.</p>
            <p>But theſe men preſume (doubtleſſe of a more extraordinary
ſpirit) like the Prophets of old, taking upon them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
Magiſtrates, which they by viſions, many times confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by miracles, they had an immediate Miſſion. Thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gods, to whom peculiarly the word of God then was
ſent. Which if they can prove ſuch a calling, they ſhall be no
more private but publicke perſons, To whom not only Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
but all others in doubtfull exigences ſhould repaire as
to the divine Oracles of God.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing they cannot, It is not a groundleſſe, or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
title of an Ambaſſador, or Goſpel-miniſter, that in caſe
of a publicke civill breach of conſcience towards men, that
ſhould free them from puniſhment, when yet liberty of
conſcience, in doubtfull matters of faith towards God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
ſtill as a Rock unmoveable? Therefore I verily thinke,
the day of Gods juſt viſitation,<note place="margin">Hoſea 9.</note> ſpoken of in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> is come
upon theſe men, in that hee hath given up theſe deviners and
ſpirituall perſons,<note place="margin">More like then a ra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ionall or Chriſtian ſpirit</note> to a dog-raging * madnes, each pretended
Prophet, like fools, not knowing the ſeaſons &amp; interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
workings of the Almighty. But I ſpare them, as objects
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103027:14"/>
for our pitty and Prayers, rather then envie, ſince through
their words already, which every where frets like a Gangreen,
this their madneſs is in a manner ſeen and known of all men.</p>
            <p>Fiftly and laſtly, the way to promote a bleſſed ſettlement in
the Civill State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is for our Honourable Rulers not as Magiſtrates,
by any coercive power to ſettle an Eccleſiaſtical<note n="*" place="margin">A thing hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God as derogatory ro his word and ſpirit, he ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in no need at all of man, much leſſe a forced obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence eſpecially in ſpirituall matters.</note> government,
But as Chriſtians eminent in their places, through a prudent and
godly example to improve their utmoſt abilities, to reſtore the
Church to her former beauty, and then ſhall they be indeed the
Repairers of the Antichriſtian breach, and reſtorers of the ancient
paths for Saints to walke in; ſo ſhall God bleſſe their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with <hi>Potiphar</hi> for a <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſake, and as he did the houſe
of <hi>Obed Edom</hi> for the Arks ſake. But it will be demanded,
what is the government neereſt to the word of God, ſince one
ſaith, here it is, others there, and ſome that there is none at all?
I have already ſhewed that God in all ages hath had a viſible
Church, and that cannot be without a goverement, although it
hath not been alike alwaies in forme, nor viſibility, but as for
that viſibility of a Nationall Church, it having neither matter
nor form according to the Primitive Inſtitution; its a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more in name then in reallity, the times of the Apoſtles
being then our pattern. I ſhall therefore in this laſt <hi>Series</hi> of my
diſcourſe, as a ſecond branch of the laſt particular, Firſt, ſum up
all that hath been ſaid touching this Primitive Eccleſiaſticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of government, in a compendious form, as it was then
held forth. And then ſecondly, the grounds and reaſons of the
firſt defection and Apoſtacle from the ſame. And laſtly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
ſome means to re-eſtate the ſame in its former pureneſs.
As for the firſt, I thinke I cannot doe better then only word for
word to circumſcribe what that Author hath ſet down touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame, in the <hi>Shrill cry,</hi> where after he had ſhewed that
the Covenant did not require conformity to a Nationall Church,
becauſe the word of God acknowledgeth no other, but that one
viſible Catholike Church, which is in all Nations diſperſed into
congregations and families, that Congregation then, ſaith he,
or family whereſoever it is, that in matter, form, doctrine, or
diſciplin, ſhal conform to theprimitive inſtitution, that muſt needs
be the pureſt Church, which we are bound by Covenant to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103027:15"/>
hold forth in theſe Nations, and that is conceived to be this:
when at the firſt, by the preaching the ſincere word of the
Goſpel, ſo many as heard it that were convinced of their loſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
by reaſon of ſin, were incited therby publickly to profeſſe
repentance from dead works, and faith towards God through
the Lord Jeſus, deſiring thereupon to bee baptized into the
viſible Church, and under his Government, to obey both in
doctrine and diſcipline, what they ſhall clearly be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to bee his will, and for that end frequently to meete in
their ſeverall Aſſemblies, and there orderly and decently exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
each others gifts, for the edification one of another, in
their moſt holy faith, that ſo upon very good experience had
upon ſuch gifts, they might out of themſelves, and for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſucceſſively chooſe, as they ſtood in need, Paſtors and
other Officers as they conceived neceſſary to the well-being
and governing thoſe who had voluntarily ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
therunto, So that then doubtles this conſtitution, would
have continued as a patterne to all ſucceeding Congregations
Thoſe extraordinary Meſſengers only excepted, that by their
Miracles ſhewed their authority from God, to lay this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and preſcribe the forme for this ſpirituall building,
Thus far the <hi>Shrill Cry.</hi> But for the ſecond, touching the firſt
grounds of apoſtacy, its evident, that from thoſe very times
this defection began, the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> teſtifying, that there
was then many <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> which by their carriages, doctrines,
and cunning practices, did deny the comming of Chriſt in the
fleſh, which was in truth no leſſe then to deny both the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Son, for he that doth deny the end of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming,
which was to redeem, inlighten, fanctifie, rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
his Church after his own mind: doth in effect deny his
very comming, as alſo both father and ſon, and is a very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.
To this alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gives teſtimony, that
then this miſtery of iniquity began to worke, which firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the defection and apoſtacy of ſome of thoſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that were firſt intruſted, and furniſhed with ability to
preach the word, which afterward through a Satanicall pride,
and corruption in judgement began to fall off from the true
Apoſtles, uſurping authority, not onely over them, but to
reigne as Kings over the conſciences of the Brethren, whom
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103027:16"/>
then they did in the next place, Secondly ſeduce from the
ſincerity of the Goſpell, pretending yet to be the Apoſtles of
Chriſt, which <hi>Paul</hi> calls notwithſtanding, falſe Apoſtles, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of Sathan, transformed into the appearance of Angels
of light, becauſe indeed they had a zeale for God, after the
righteouſneſſe of the law, but not according to knowledge,
in that they could not diſtinguiſh between that active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
righteouſneſſe of the Law and Goſpell, the one requiring
and exacting obedience, when it gives no power to performe,
the other freely giving a power to performe more than it at
all times requires an exact performance to.</p>
            <p>Beſides from the womb of this error proceeded many more,
for as in the Law ſo in the Goſpell, there is ſuch a concati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Goſpel truths, that an error in one foundation truth
cauſeth the like in others. So that by falling off to the Law
though they did profeſſe faith in Chriſt. They had no benefit
thereby, through the neglect of the Goſpel, either of an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
vocation, juſtification, true Sanctification, or glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was only in this as Gods way to be found. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
to the <hi>Gallatians</hi> teſtifying, that notwithſtanding their
profeſſion of faith in Chriſt, in that they preferred mans righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
before Gods, they were yet in their ſins, Chriſts
death was in vaine to them. And that all his benefits ſhould
profit them nothing, which is as was ſaid, all one to them
as if they had denyed Chriſts comming in the fleſh. And then
thirdly having loſt the purity of the Goſpell, they fell alſo
from the forme and diſcipline of the ſame, preferring circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
before baptiſme, not aſſembling themſelves as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
refuſing communion and fellowſhip, with thoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
Churches, diſpiſing and contemning thoſe Sacraments,
which preſented the benefits of Chriſts body and blood, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
as the Apoſtle ſaid in way of reproofe, that if a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
death followed the breach of one of <hi>Moſes</hi> Laws, how
much ſhall he bee guilty of a ſorer puniſhement, which by
the neglect of Goſpell truths, and Ordinances, trample under
foot the blood of the Sonne of God. Finally, After this,
corruption in doctrine, there was ſo great a departure from
the faith, that ther followed as univerſal a corruption in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103027:16"/>
and then the man of Sinne, the Antichriſt not long after
came indeed to be revealed) whoſe onely worke was, to ſet
himſelf againſt and above Chriſt, in all his goſpell-miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
confounding all primitive order, and forme both of
doctrine and diſcipline, admitting none but himſelfe and his
corrupt Clergy to be ſole Judges in matters of faith, which
did aſſume to themſelves onely the name of the holy Church,
that ſo he might the better ſit in the conſciences of thoſe hee
calls the Laiety, as if it belonged not to them, either to know
or receive any benefit by Chriſt, through a faith of their own,
over which he did ſo lord it, that he compelled them contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to their owne light implicitly to beleeve and obey, many
times thoſe things that were both contrary to nature, Law, and
Goſpel. Which together with many more horrid abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that for brevity ſake is here remitted.</p>
            <p>So then by this, ſuch a thick, and cloſe darknes covered the
eyes of the people, that very few had in thoſe dayes any true
underſtanding in the miſtery of the Goſpell; the Goſpell then
being turned into the Law, and other humane traditions,
And when that darkeneſſe began a little to be expeld about
<hi>Luthers</hi> time, yet by and by after, there was againe ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
mixture, of the Law and Goſpell, that it was hard to
ſay which was either: Which<note n="*" place="margin">In Com. on Gal. pag. 201. and elſewhere.</note> 
               <hi>Luther</hi> indeed prophetically
foretold ſhould come to paſſe, through the ignorance of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
after his time, which ſince by woefull experience wee
have found too true, that covering Cherub of Antichriſtian
darkneſſe, ſtill in a great part remaining.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhewed in the ſecond place, the riſe, groweth,
and cauſe, of continuance of this firſt defection, It remains now
that ſome meanes bee propounded, according to the third
particular, for the re-inſtating the ſame unto its primitive
pureneſſe, which now might more generally and eaſily be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
if God ſhall be pleaſed to give firſt to our Magiſtrates and
then more generally to others, a heart to follow the councel
of our Lord and head Chriſt Jeſus, given to the Church of
<hi>Epheſus</hi> in another caſe, which conſiſteth in three things. Firſt
to remember from whence we are fallen, that is to ſay, from
the primitive conſtitution. Secondly to repent of all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wayes and abominable apoſtacies. Thirdly, to doe our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103027:17"/>
firſt workes that is, to conforme in all things to the mind of
Chriſt, which was from the beginning, for we ought in this
Eccleſiaſticall Government, as in the other, to make Gods
aime and end, in ſuch a ſpirituall conſtitution our own, which
if we would doe, we muſt ſubſcribe to his wiſdome, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ours, to follow his direction in the ſame. We read that
<hi>Moſes</hi> in building the Tabernacle, a figure of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church
he ſhould doe all things according to the patterne. Even ſo
now, if we would build this ſpirituall Tabernacle that is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
down, ſo as that the reſidue of men might ſeek after God,
It muſt be according to the plat-forme laid down by Chriſt,
and his Apoſtles, who was faithfull in all things as a Sonne,
over his owne houſe: and truely it were well, if after the
ſame manner, and way of defection and apoſtacy we ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily
declined downwards, we might now more lieſurely ſtep
by ſtep aſcend up again into this holy Mountaine.</p>
            <p>And here then is firſt to be conſidered according to that which
hath been formerly hinted, that is to ſay, the foundation
being laid and confirmed by miracles, there was afterwards
no need of a ſucceſſion of extraordinary Meſſengers or Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which was at firſt to confirme the truth of the Goſpell
among Heathens and Infidels, that then, which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinne
to poſterity, unto which if we will conforme it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that all diſtinctions brought in by Antichriſt, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
in reference to humane learning, ſo as to make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity
touching the office of the Miniſtery, be laid aſide, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
and repented of. As alſo that cuſtome of laying
on of hands, for the formall conſtitution of any Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
as if he were therby better inabled to preach the truth, be
alſo omited, ſince the Apoſtles in their laying on of hands did
convey not ordinary, but extraordinary gifts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That in regard of our late confuſion there
might be appointed a certaine number, that for their abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the knowledge of the myſtery of the Goſpell, as alſo
reputed to be of an holy and unblamable converſation,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Tim. 3. 1. &amp;c.</note> every
way quallified according to the rule of the Apoſtle</p>
            <p>Thirdly that theſe with the aſſiſtance of Godly Magiſtrates
<pb facs="tcp:103027:17"/>
and other Chriſtians might make choice in all parts, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of perſons, ſo many as they have good experience of their
abilities,<note place="margin">* In reference to humane learning.</note> agreeing not only in doctrine and diſcipline, but with
boldneſſe and other parts for an Intelligible utterance, that
they might be ſent forth into all places where there is need, to
preach the ſincere word of the Goſpel, and to perform other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Miniſtery without the intermedling with the civill
Government.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that all Chriſtians which ſhall live within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
of their Miniſtery, being convinced of the truth of Baptiſme,

And then that all others, as the Miniſtery of the Goſpel

be ſtill added to each particular viſible Congregation,<note place="margin">* And now if yet Baptiſme ſhall not be thought fit to bee an ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

to the ſeverall diviſions, either of Pariſhes or places equally devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by authority of Magiſtracy, All others, without ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
and way of admittance, to be accounted as without.</p>
            <p>Fiftly that beſides the publike Directory for worſhip, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of publike preaching for converting of men, ſome other
day might be permitted, or weekly allowed, anſwerable to the
firſt practice for the meeting of the Saints in the participation of
Ordinances, as alſo for an orderly and decent exerciſe of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
gifts, that ſo by frequent cuſtome their wits through exerciſe
might diſcern things that differ, that ſo upon very good experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
had of the manifold wiſedom of God ſeen in the Saints, they
might not haſtily (as they doe now in ſome Churches otherwiſe
commendable) chooſe out their Officers, eſpecially the Paſtors,
publikely to preach, which might ſucceſſively ſupply the place
of thoſe that ſhould deceaſe, or otherwiſe be imployed.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, that all doubtful points about the Trinity or others, might
by fair and meek diſputes eſpecially writing be endeavoured to
be cleared to vulgar underſtandings, as things not to be i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>poſed
without a clear conviction, for writing is more advantagious in
that many times for want of boldneſſe, quickneſs of wit, ſtrength
of memory, diſtempered paſſions, or preſent aſſiſtance, the truth
hath been ſuſpended, and the contrary error retained, when by
writing ſuch defaults in nature by deliberation may be prevented,
<pb facs="tcp:103027:18"/>
and as for inforcing, it ought not to be for theſe reaſons, in that
all Intelects are not created of one ſize, all have not one and the
ſame outward means, not the ſame exerciſe, not the ſame impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
to hinder, not the ſame internall divine Aſſiſtance, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
in darkneſſe through negligence, prejudice, willfulneſſe. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
all are not by reaſon therof given up to ajudiciary<note n="*" place="margin">Upon which ground it were to be wiſhed the civill State firſt ſecured, liberty of conſcience in matters of faith may be no more bought and ſold either in England or Ireland. This I ſpeake not out of love to Popery, hatefull to God and good men, but out of love to this truth that gives Chriſt this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to deſtroy the man of ſin, by the word of his mouth, and brightneſſe of his glory, it is permiſſion then not a tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is deſired, as the beſt way alſo to a civill peace.</note> blindneſſe.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, that ſuch Miniſters that are imployed for the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Goſpel, out of ſome publike Stock, might have an
equall and conſiderable allowance, that ſo they may give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
wholly to the work of t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e miniſtry. Theſe and other things
ſeriouſly pondred and put in practice, it would I beleeve ſuddenly
put an end to all our differences, whether Civill or Eccleſiaſticall,
it being according to our Covenant, a government indeed the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
to the word of God, and the beſt Reformed Churches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all the faithfull by what nicknames ſoever diſtinguiſhed, ought
thereunto unanimouſly to accord; and as for all thoſe perſons
that hold Tenents deſtructive to known principles, or a common
profeſſion of faith, that in every thing ſhould be cleer not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
are not at firſt (in any Congregation to be admitted) or if cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
after by Excommunication caſt out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where they remain til
manifeſtation of repentance, (as Heathens and Publicans) which
yet ſtill had a propriety in what was theirs in outward things, but
if any ſuch perſons ſhal yet pertinaciouſly maintain ſuch opinions,
contrary to the light of nature, reaſon, and the plaine letter of the
Scripture, to the diſturbance of the publike peace, they are under
the power of the Magiſtrate to puniſh.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, theſe things being of ſo great importance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
for brevity ſake, I can but touch each particular here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.
Let us every one now in our ſeverall places and callings
lay aſide all envie and bitterneſs, ſuperfluity of naughtineſs,
that ſo through meekneſs and love, we may promote the good of
Church and State, ſo ſhall God be our King and dwell amongſt
us, and bleſſe us, ſo that we need not to fear if the whole earth
were gathered together againſt us, ſince he is an all-ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
to his people, as by good experience we have already found,
but if we ſtill go on perverſly, and oppoſe him in making factions
to carry on private Intereſts, againſt his peculiar Intereſt, which
is the good and wellfare of this Church and State, in the behalf of
his Saints, he will certainly break us to peeces, ſo as we ſhall be
<pb facs="tcp:103027:18"/>
a ſcorn and by word to Nations. O then that our governours
would act their part herein, for who knowes but they might bee
diſtinguiſhed and ſeparated thus unexpectedly from their brethren,
and exalted to the high place of judicature for ſuch a time, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and work as this, which if they ſhall not now as wiſe and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men improve, they and their houſes ſhall certainly periſh: when
yet deliverance ſhall come to Gods people ſome other way.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I wiſh alſo that all Royalliſts which hath ſeen the
hand of God lifted up againſt them and their King, not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all faire gloſſes on foule matters, would now ſit downe and
conſider theſe are the dayes of Chriſts exaltation in his Saints, to
whom belongeth, not only the Kingdome, but the greatneſſe of
the Kingdome, for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I deſire that all Levellers, which in moſt of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
hath been already ſatisfyed, that they would not now goe
about to deſtroy, what formerly they have indeavoured to<note n="*" place="margin">That is to ſay the Councel of State, and the Parliament, which if diſſol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved before ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of a new election, may be dangerous.</note> build;
but rather quietly ſit down and ſee what gradually God will doe
amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That all Presbyters that are ſo violent for a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as indeed one there ought to bee, would comply in this,
which is conceived to be neareſt to the Word of God, which in
many particulars agreeth with that by them held forth. And then</p>
            <p>Fifthly, By this, I ſuppoſe, our Brethren of Scotland, that cry
up the Covenant, as a thing not in any humane power to diſſolve,
will be ſatisfyed, ſince Sectaries, by them ſo ſpoken againſt, are
in the right way ſuppreſſed, yet is that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they cal through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
hereſie, the true way of worſhiping the God of our Fathers,</p>
            <p>But I wiſh they had alike performed the Convenant with us, the letter of
which is either conditionall in referrence to the King or other Delinquents,
or with reſtrictions, touching Reformation in the Church, &amp;c. beſides,
why not in man to diſſolve? Since that which is not in his lawfull power to
do: namely raſhly to mix ſacred things with prophane, muſt needs be in his
power upon more ſerious thoughts to undo, neither is there any condition to
make this Covenant perpetuall as I read in the fame. But ſurely Scotland
will no: through their ſence of the Covenant pick a quarrel, and ungratefully
invade their brethren in England, which if, the Lord who hath ſhowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
on our ſide, will againe I doubt nor decide the controverſie. Laſtly,
By ſuch Government the civill State will bee ſettled, Antichriſt deſtroyed,
prophane converted, the Gentiles fulneſſe accompliſhed, the Jewes through
emulation thereat reſtored, and ſo then Chriſts ſecond comming will bee
haſtened. Even ſo come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</p>
