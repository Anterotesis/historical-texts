            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mint-maſters of both Kingdoms to the preciſe obſervance

               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> ſoon after His happy Reſtauration, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed

Money, or Goldſmiths Work of Silver in either of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
thereafter.</p>
               <p>This Plate of Silver ſo framed, was divided in four equal parts,
whereof one was committed to be preſerved in the Theſaury of
<hi>England,</hi> another to the Mint-houſe at the <hi>Tower of London,</hi>

for the greater Security.</p>
               <p>The Standard for the Money and Silver-plate, then deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined

in <hi>England</hi> to be eleven ounces and two penny fine, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
thus, the pound is divided in 12 ounces, and every ounce
in 20 penny weight, of theſe 12 ounces, 11 integral parts and a
fraction, to wit 1/10 part of the 12<hi>th</hi> ounce muſt be pure Silver,
and the remnant part of the fraction being 9/10 parts, is allowed

The allowance of remedy for the fineneſs is 2 grains over, or

                  <head>Amendments fit to have been added as to

                  <p>1. That the common <hi>Scots</hi> Troys pound and ounce, which
are lighter than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by the difference of 4 penny Weight
and 9 grains, or 105 grains in the pound, and by 8 grains and
18 units <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the ounce, might both be brought to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Troys Weights of both Kingdoms, leſs than

                  <p>4. That the only exact check upon the Weight of current
Money ſhould be, that the Mint-maſter always deliver the
King's Coyn to the Merchant for his Bullion by weight, and no
otherways; and ſo the Officers of the Mint can never ſo much
as work upon the Remedy; Nor is the Warden and Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warden,
Weighing and Troning of every piece, a ſufficient
check, to keep the Money at the due Weight, as experience

                  <p>1. Why has there never tryal of our Money been made as to
the fineneſs, by the Pattern of that indented Plate, ſent to us
from His Majeſty for that purpoſe, nor any uſe made of theſe
Pales of Weights, fitted and brought hither to examine the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Weights of every ſeveral ſpecies? which ought to have
been done yearly at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>2. Wherefore is the Inſcription upon our Money, of <hi>Mag.
Brit. Franciae,</hi> &amp;c. always uſed upon King <hi>James</hi> the 6<hi>th,</hi> and
King <hi>Charles</hi> the 1. their Coyns now of late changed to <hi>Scotiae,
Angliae, Franciae,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
                  <p>3. Why is there not an accompt called for yearly of the
Bullion Imported, according to the form preſcribed in our Law,
or of the Money received for it, and of what quantity of Coyn
is ſtamped therefore.</p>
                  <p>4. How comes the two late Acts of Parliament concerning
Bullion, to differ ſo much? The firſt being, 1 <hi>Par. Ch.</hi> 2.
<hi>Act</hi> 37. Earl <hi>Middleton</hi> Commiſſioner, wherein the penury of
the Coyn of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is juſtly charged upon the ſmall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Bullion Imported? For remeid whereof, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the abuſe of taking current Money, or ſo much <hi>per</hi> ounce,
or any other thing in place of Bullion; It is ordained, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the antient cuſtom of this Kingdom, that the Merchants
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31744:4"/>
find good Caution, or give Pledges to deliver their due quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Bullion, anſwerable to the Commodities, which pays
the ſame in to the Officers of the Mint; which Officers are alſo
diſcharged to receive any ſatisfaction whatſomever from the
Merchant, (except only forraign Bullion) or to tranſact<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or
compone any manner of way for it, upon very penal Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
The other being, 2 <hi>Par. Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>Act</hi> 8 Duke <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale</hi>
Commiſſioner, whereby the former good Law, and all
the preceeding Laws for Importing of Bullion, are in a manner
Repealed; for by that <hi>Act,</hi> it is left to the option of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
to pay Bullion, or twelve pence <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the ounce
thereof in place of it ſelf; and the Officers of the Mint are left
to Import the Stock of Bullion themſelves, at their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
                  <p>5. Since that time the matter has been ſo mannaged, that
the Merchants are well pleaſed to be free of the vexatious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
upon the Eſſays and payments of their Bullion at the
Mint-houſe; and choice rather to pay the 12 pences for every
ounce, to redeem themſelves from the trouble, and loſs of their
time, albeit it be otherways to their prejudice.</p>
                  <p>6. The true and juſt advantage for ſupport to the charge of
Coynage, which the Officers of the Mint ought to exact, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Imported Bullion of pure Silver (or being baſer to
be conſidered by weight and reckoning) and the King's cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Money of Sterling fineneſs, is only 7 pence <hi>Engliſh</hi> upon
the ounce, which is the intrinſick value of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the two: But by the late Act of Parliament, if Bullion
were Imported, there is but 5 ſhillings and about a penny <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
to be payed for each ounce thereof, whereby the gain is
increaſed to 8 pence and ſome more; and now when only Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is received in place of Bullion, the profit ariſes to full 12
pence <hi>per</hi> ounce, beſides other advantages.</p>
                  <p>7. In the Parliament 1674. a Complaint was exhibite upon
the abuſes of the Mint, both as to the weight, fineneſs and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31744:5"/>
but the D. of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> then His Majeſties Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,
rejected it, and to palliat the matter, plauſibly ordered a
a Committee of Council to make Tryal of that affair, who, as
they were named, were either too great Friends to the Parties
concerned, or not at all verſed in ſuch matters, for they knew
not how to proceed, but did as the Officers of the Mint in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
them; ſo a ſuperficial Tryal was uſed, with more jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
than knowledge, and a Report made, approving all to the
Council; then a piece of Silver was ſent with great ſpeciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to His Majeſty, to be put to the Eſſay at <hi>London;</hi> which
piece, albeit it had the advantages of paſſing the Fire before it
came there, yet all the Tower was not found to be of Sterling
fineneſs: Nevertheleſs a Letter was procured from the King,
to Exoner, Indemnifie and thank the General and Officers of the
Mint, for their Fidelity and good Service in that Truſt, which
being publickly read in Council, was oppoſed by divers of the
Members, who objected the abuſes committed by the Officers of
the Mint, and offered demonſtratively to prove them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly;
But the effect of all was, the General, the Mint-maſter,
and the reſt were approven, and the movers of theſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſoon turned out of the Council, to terrifie others from uſing
the like freedom and faithfulneſs thereafter.</p>
                  <p>8. Many true Eſſays of all the ſeveral ſpecies of His Majeſties
Money, Coyned at the Mint-houſe in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> has been made
by particular perſons, both at the Tower, and at Goldſmiths-Hall
in <hi>London;</hi> but there was never one piece of them (ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before the year 1674) that proved to be of Sterling fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but all were baſe, leſs or more, and ſome to the degree
of 11 penny worſe; and as for the weight, the half-merk-pieces
were found in the Ballance to differ 6 grains one from another,
which 2 grains at moſt is the remedy allowed them; the truth
of this can be inſtructed by Teſtimonies in writ, under the
Hand and Subſcription of <hi>Peter Trovel,</hi> then Eſſay-maſter of
<hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:31744:5"/>
9. It's no wonder then that our Money be both ſcarce, baſe
and light, In reſpect 1. The Merchants brings no Bullion
home, whereby the Original Fountain from whence our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
ſhould flow, is not only drained, but even our own, and
the beſt of Forraign Coyns current with us, dayly exported;
and the baſeſt of Money from abroad, returned hither again in
lieu thereof, which of late is become a profitable Trade to the
undertakers. 2. If Bullion were Imported, yet when the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of the fineneſs is neglected, it will quickly corrupt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
the Native Coyn of the Kingdom. And 3. Seing there
is neither check nor control upon the Weight, as it ought to
be, by payment of the Bullion to the Importer, in the current
Money of this Realm, put in the Ballance weight for weights,
and no otherways, without which, the lightneſs paſſes undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                  <p>10. Theſe things conſidered, Why the Council ſhould have
raiſed the extrinſick value of all our own Coyn, to the rate of
five <hi>per cent,</hi> more than it was current for before, is much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired?
except it be pretended, that our Merk-pieces and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are carryed over to <hi>Holland,</hi> melted down there, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to us again in Cullen and Leg-dallars, which are a baſer ſpecies
of Money than our own, whereby they make good profit, but we
muſt pay for it at laſt.</p>
                  <p>11. The Emoluments ariſing to theſe imployed in the Mint,
(being ſo Lucrative as it is made of late) may be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by the ſudden increaſe of the Riches of the Officers entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
therein.</p>
                  <p>12. How unfit it is for any Member in the Theſaury, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for the Theſaurer Deput to be General of the Mint, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in this. That it is a ſpecial part of his Office, to call yearly
before the Exchequer, for an exact accompt of all Bullion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
and payed in to the Officers of the Mint: As alſo, how
and in what ſpecies the ſame is ſtamped by them for a conſtant
ſupply of the Stock of Coynage to the Nation; whereas now, as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31744:6"/>
the matter is ſtated, he is only to compt for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>13. The Officers of the Mint ought to be men honeſt and
faithful, free from the guilt of ſuſpition of the Crimes of Bribery
or Perjury, in reſpect the greateſt ſecurity demanded of them
for their Truſt, is their Oath <hi>De fideli.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. But if they pretend Warrands of Parliament and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
to juſtifie themſelves from the Charge of abuſing their
Truſt, it is not relevant, becauſe they always penned their own
Warrands, which were implicitly granted, and for which they
ought to be anſwerable.</p>
                  <p>Here is but a Compend of what might be repreſented, as to
the Silver-Mint: But the abuſes committed by the Copper-Money,
and the exorbitant advantages made by the Coyners
thereof, will appear far greater, and more grievous to the
Kingdom, when particular diſcovery is made of the ſame.</p>

it might import; and that no man was obliged to Depone, as
to his actings in any publick ſtation, or in relation to his Office.
And the Commiſſioners having conſidered the Repreſentation,
and grounds thereof, it did appear by the peruſal of the Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
as to the Copper Coyn, that they did only relate to
Six thouſand Stone, which was allowed by the Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Council, to be Coyned within the time contained in
the Warrands and Prorogations mentioned in the Exonerations,
and therefore was not an Exoneration, as to what more Copper
was Coyned, than the quantity contained in the Warrands, to
which they particularly relate: And as to the Diſcharge, in
relation to the fineneſs of the Silver Coyned from <hi>July</hi> 1664.
to <hi>December</hi> 1673. years. The Commiſſioners declared, they
would make no inquiry of the fineneſs of the Money Coyned
the time mentioned in the Diſcharge, further than to inform his
Majeſty, by what appears to the Commiſſioners, that the tryal
then made in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to have been very inſufficient, as to the
fineneſs. As likewiſe, there was no mention at all made in
that tryal, of the ſufficiency of the weight, which was als ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
as the fineneſs. And as to the Act of Indemnity, the
Commiſſioners were of the opinion, that this being a tryal and
inquiry for his Majeſties Information, the Act of Indemnity
could not hinder them to proceed in the inquiry, that they
might inform his Majeſty of the ſtate and condition of the Mint,
and of the abuſes committed by the Officers thereof, the Act
of Indemnity being only granted to theſe that had acted in, or
againſt the publick Government of the Kingdom, and not for
deeds of malverſation in any particular or peculiar ſtation, which
had no connexion with, or relation to the troubles and diſorders
in the Countrey, in matters of Government; For as the Act
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31744:9"/>
of Indemnity cannot be extended to Crimes committed by She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs,
Baillies, Commiſſars, their Deputs and Clerks; nor to
abuſes, malverſations, and breach of truſt committed by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers,
Collectors, his Majeſties Caſh-keepers, or any others
intrometters with his Majeſties Revenues, if they ſhall imbazle
the Kings Rents, and not make a full accompt, nor to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perſon in publick Office, not relating to the publick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Kingdom; ſo neither can it be extended to
crimes and abuſes committed by the Officers of the Mint: For
albeit theſe may be accounted publick Offices in ſome reſpect,
yet they are but privat ſtations in reſpect of the Offices that
concerns the publick Government of the Kingdom. As alſo,
the Act of Indemnity bears an exception of all privat
Crimes, and ſuch-like as never uſed to be comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
general Acts of Indemnity. And it appears by the late Act
of Indemnity paſt in the Parliament in the year 1662. That
all Crimes not relating to the late troubles, are excepted; and
particularly the Accompts of all ſuch perſons as have intromet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with any of his Majeſties Revenues, and all other publick
Money, for which they had no other Warrand or Aſſignment,
for their own privat uſe, and for which they had not duely
compted, and received Diſcharges thereof, from ſuch as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have authority for the time, to do the ſamen, and all
other former Acts of Indemnity made by his Majeſties Royal
Predeceſſors, are only in relation to the publick troubles that
hath been in the Countrey, but not at all to any Crimes or
malverſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ions that hath been committed by the Kings Officers,
in their private ſtations, not relating to the publick adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Government, or to the troubles and diſorders of the
Countrey, and therefore the ſaid Act ought not to be extended
to the abuſes and malverſations committed by the Officers of the
Mint, far leſs to debar and preclude his Majeſty from tryal and
inquiry; that his Majeſty being informed thereof, may give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for better regulating of the Mint, and remeeding theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31744:10"/>
in time coming. And as to that pretence alledged by the
Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi> That he could not be oblieged to Depone upon
any thing relating to the Mint, becauſe he does not know how
far it does reach, or what it might import; the Commiſſioners were
of the Opinion, that this being a matter of Tryal and Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
he ought to give Information upon Oath, concerning things
relating to the Mint and Coynage, that was committed to his
Truſt, as the other Officers of the Mint had already done,
and whatever might be the import thereof, he was only deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to give his Oath upon theſe particulars relating to himſelf,
if he was truly innocent, and had not malverſed in his Truſt,
which is no more but a purgatory Oath, that he might purge
himſelf of theſe Abuſes and Malverſations, which by publick
Fame, and other Evidences, were preſumed againſt him, and
which was moſt conſonant and agreeable to the common Law,
and the practiſe of other Nations, and
the Laws and Practique of this Kingdom
<note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 14. Statute Wilhel. cap. 4. Stat. David 2. cap. 1. num. 6. Statute David 2.</note> both in Church and State, in the like caſes,
eſpecially where the ſamen is done for His
Majeſties Information; As to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
upon which he was deſired to
give Information upon Oath, Relating
to the other Officers of the Mint, he was only deſired to Depone,
upon the beſt of his knowledge, which was no more but an
Oath of Credulity, which no man in reaſon ought to refuſe;
and which is appointed by an expreſs Act of
Parliament,<note n="v" place="margin">Acted. Seſſ. 2d. Par. 2d. Ch. 2d.</note> That all Perſons ſhould De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
and Depone upon Oath, their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of any Crimes againſt the Publick
Laws, under very ſevere puniſhment; eſpecially ſeing all the
reſt of the Officers of the Mint, did freely Depone upon all
theſe particulars, (except the Lord Juſtice-Clerk, conjunct
General, who was here preſent) only the Lord <hi>Hatton</hi> makes
uſe of the Act of Indemnity, and refuſes to Depone. And as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31744:10"/>
to that pretence, That he was not obliged to Depone in any
thing relating to his Office, it was frivolous; for as every man
in Publick Truſt, is obliged to give his Oath, That he ſhall
Faithfully diſcharge his Truſt, at the entry to his Office; So
likewiſe ought he to give his Oath upon any thing relating to
his Office at any time thereafter, when ever he is required by
his Majeſty, or any having Commiſſion for that effect: And if
it were otherwayes, that a perſon in Publick Office ſhould not
be obliged to Depone concerning his actings in that Office;
then any man in Publick Office, might commit the greateſt
Abuſes, Malverſations, Injuſtice, Oppreſſions, and all other
hainous Crimes without control, providing he could do it pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly,
that it could not be otherways proven, but by his own
Oath; and that would invite men in Publick Truſt, to commit
all Acts of Malverſation and Injuſtice imaginable, if they were
not obliged to Depone upon their Actings in that Office, and
purge themſelves of any Crimes that may be laid to their charge.
For theſe Reaſons, and in obedience to His Majeſties Royal
Commands, by His Commiſſion; The Commiſſioners having
proceeded to the Tryal and Inquiry, and conſidered the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
of the Maſter and other Officers and Servants of the
Mint, and the Books, Papers, and other Evidences adduced,
It did appear; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That albeit His Majeſty and His Royal
Predeceſſors, Have always had a ſpecial care to provide Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for increaſing and maintaining of the Stock of Coynage in
the Kingdom; and that it is expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by Act of Parliament<note n="c" place="margin">Act 8. Seſs. 1. Par. 2. Ch. 2.</note> That the
Goods and Merchandiſe imported by the

of the Mint, in place of Bullion, there has been but a ſmall
quantity of Bullion Imported by them; and in place thereof,
great quantities of the Money current in the Kingdom, has been
melted down, to the great prejudice of the Leidges, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair

And likewiſe the Generals and Maſter of the Mint, have divided
amongſt themſelves, the benefit of the twelve ſhilling Scots,
payed in to the Mint by the Merchants, and ſo have failed in
their Truſt, to advance their own privat gain: As alſo. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
out of his Princely care for the good of his Subjects, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
of the Money in the Kingdom, and for advancing his
own Revenue, ariſing by the Mint, did allow a certain ſum year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a ſtock for buying in of Bullion from time to time, which
might have been exchanged ten or twelve times in the year, as
was in uſe formerly to be done; yet notwithſtanding that Stock
of Money has not been at all Imployed, by which the Country
has been extreamly prejudged, and the King defrauded of the
benefit that would have ariſen thereby, if the Bullion had been
imported and exchanged; as it ought to have been according to
His Majeſties appointment, and the time that ſhould have been
ſo profitably imployed in Coyning of Bullion, has been miſpent
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31744:11"/>
in Coyning great quantities of Copper-money, to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the Liedges at home, and to the hurt of Trade and
Commerce abroad; and albeit that ſtock of Money was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in manner as was appointed; yet the Generals and the
Maſter did exact yearly from the King, the intereſt thereof, as
if it had been imployed. <hi>Secundo,</hi> His Majeſty, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of His Royal Predeceſſors, having deſigned, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the Union, Trade and Commerce between the
two Kingdoms, that the Money Coyned in
both ſhould be of alike weight and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<note n="e" place="margin">Cap. 38. &amp; 46 Stat. David 2d, Act 23. Par. 1. Ja. 1. Act 54. Par. 4. Ja 4th.</note> And for that effect, in the year 1662.
cauſed frame an indented Silver Standart
Plate of Sterling fineneſs, and ſecured with
His Majeſties Seals, a part whereof was ſent
hither to be keeped as the Rule whereby to
make Eſſays of the fineneſs of the Silver, in all time coming.
Nevertheleſs, it appears, That all the Money of this Kingdom,
ſince that time, has been deſignedly Minted far below the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of that Standard Plate; Neither has there ever any uſe
been made thereof, ſince it came hither, and as for the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in fineneſs, (only allowed in caſes of Caſuality, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways)
the Officers have combined, not only to work upon,
but even below them, and by paction to divide the profits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing
from thence, amongſt themſelves, when indeed they
were obliged to compt to His Majeſties Theſaury for every ſuch
Grain of Remedy in fineneſs, wrought upon, under the true
eſtabliſhed Standard: By this it is evident, That the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
who ſhould chiefly have been concerned for the King's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
has malverſed in their Offices, that the King has been
defrauded of a conſiderable ſum, which would have thence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to him, and that the Maſter and Wardens have concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to perſiſt in debaſing the fineneſs of the Money of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for their own advantages: And albeit it be contrair to
Law, and the Nature of all Mints, that any Silver Money
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31744:12"/>
ſhould paſs the King's Irons, without an Eſſay thereof firſt
taken, that it may be found of fineneſs deliverable: Yet it
appears by the Books of Meltings, and Printings, and ſeveral
Depoſitions, that a great part of the Coyn of this Kingdom, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pretence of Silver, called Chizle, Heads, Sweeps and
Scrapes, has been melted, and Printed, without the preſence
or knowledge of the Eſſay-maſter, or any Eſſay thereof taken,
which furniſhed opportunity to the Officers to Coyn at what
rate they pleaſed: And as His Majeſty, at the time foreſaid,
eſtabliſhed the fineneſs of His Coyn, in manner mentioned; ſo
did He with no leſs conſideration, determine the true weight
thereof, and for that end cauſed adjuſt four Piles of Weights,
fitted for the Denominations uſual in both Kingdoms, two
whereof were ſent hither, and the other two keeped at the
Tower of <hi>London,</hi> all exactly marked for their ſecurity, and
ordained to be the common Rule for the Silver Weight of both
Kingdoms: Nevertheleſs it appears, that one of theſe Pyles
being the proper Weights of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the like being reſerved
in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> after it came hither was keeped up by
the Generals, without giving order to make uſe thereof, for
ſome years, until the Maſter in the year 1680, apprehending
he might be queſtioned for uſing the Dean of Gilds Weights of
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> when the King's Weights were in the Mint-houſe,
Did of himſelf, without order, adjuſt his own Weights by that
new Pyle, and cauſed the Work men to work accordingly;
But the Generals not pleaſed therewith, commanded him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
up both theſe new Pyles that came from <hi>London,</hi> and the
old Weights he had rectified thereby, to the Wardens to be ſet
aſide, and no more uſed, and cauſed make a new Set of Weights
for his greater gain, to be adjuſted at the ſight of <hi>David Mait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
their Deput, according to the Dean of Gilds Weights of
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which are far different from the New Pyle of
Weights ſent hither by His Majeſty for the common Rule of
Weight: Neither did they exhibit the King's Warrand for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31744:12"/>
that <hi>Scots</hi> Pile of Weights, and making uſe thereof to
the Maſter, before the year 1682. as appears by the Double of
the Warrand produced, and Atteſted by the Lord Juſtice-Clerk,
one of the Generals: And thus they uſed, and changed
the Weights at their pleaſure, contrair to His Majeſties Order;
The common Law, and the Laws and Acts
of Parliament of this Kingdom,<note n="f" place="margin">Act 114. Par. 7. Ja. 5. Act 2. Par. 19. Ja. 6.</note> By which

with for the King's uſe;</hi> and as to the Remedies of Weight
which are allowed only as the other Remedies of fineneſs, in
caſes of caſual Accidents and no otherwiſe; The Wardens
have ſo far transgreſſed, that they conſtantly Troned the Pieces
according to the Remedies under the juſt weight, and by this
means, deſignedly rendred the King's Money to be light, as
they had by the like Artifice debaſed it in its fineneſs, whereby
the King was fruſtrat of the Profits which ſhould accreſce to him
by the Grains of remedies of Weights under the juſt proportion,
for which the Officers were obliged to count in Exchequer,
but ſhared the Profits thereof amongſt themſelves, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
were alſo abuſed in delivering their Bullion at the Mint-houſe,
where they were forced always to give it by the Dean
of Gild's Weights of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which are heavier than the
Scots Troy weight, by two Unces and a half every Stone weight,
whereby they were diſcouraged to import the ſame; They have

done by the Law,<note n="g" place="margin">Act. 249. Par. 15. Ja. <hi>the</hi> 6<hi>th.</hi>
                  </note> before the Act of Parliament
in the year 1669: As alſo the pieces of
Coyn reſerved in the Pixe, ought to have been
keeped whole, whereby ſome Trial even that way might have
been had of the juſt weight; but it has been a corrupt Cuſtom
to cut theſe peices, that no means might be left to cognoſce up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Silver, whether it be weighty or light. <hi>Tertio,</hi> By the
Laws and Acts of Parliament of this Kingdom, the
Coyners of black Money without warrand, are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with Death<note n="h" place="margin">Act 18. Par. 3<hi>d.</hi> Ja. 3<hi>d.</hi>
                  </note> And albeit His Majeſtie,
ſince his happy reſtitution, was pleaſed to allow Six
Thouſand Stone of Copper to be Coyned, at two ſeveral li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
times; Yet notwithſtanding, it appears by the Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Wardens, the Accounts and other Evidences ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
that there has been Twentie Nine Thouſand and ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Stone Coyned, whereas there was only ſix Thouſand Stone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;
So that there was twenty three Thouſand and ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Stone of black Money coyned more than was allowed by
the Warrands, which is an infinite Prejudice to the Kingdom:
And whereas the Generals ſhould have ſtopped the further
coyning of Copper-Money, ſo ſoon as the quantity allowed by
His Majeſty to be coyned at every Journey was exhauſted;
Yet notwithſtanding, the Generals did allow, and ordain the
Officers to go on in the coyning of more Copper-Money after it
was made known to them by the Maſter, that the quantity of
Copper allowed by His Majeſty to be Coyned was exhauſted,
and they alſo received the half of the Profits ariſing from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perplus
that was coyned more than was allowed by His Majeſty.
<hi>Quarto.</hi> The Coyn of this Kingdom being lately cryed up, and
there being a conſiderable quantitie of Bullion lying in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
and Maſters hands; The whole Profit of the Exaltation
being Five <hi>per cent.</hi> which did belong to the King; It appears
that the Generals did acclaime the Benefit of the one half of the
Exaltation from the Maſters as a perquiſit due to them, albeit it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31744:13"/>
truely belongs to the King, and which did amount to a very
conſiderable Sum. <hi>Quinto,</hi> Albeit by the Common Law, and
ſeveral Laws and Acts of Parliament of this Kingdom: It is
ſtatute, that if any Judge or Miniſter of the Law, take Buds or
Bribes, they ſhall loſe their Honour, Fame, and Dignity; and
their moveable Goods to be confiscat, &amp; deprived of their Offices,
and puniſhed in their perſons at his Majeſties
Will:<note n="i" place="margin">Cap. 22. Statut Rob. 1. Cap. 25. Stat. Wilhel. Act 104 Par. 7. Ja. 5. Act 93. Par. 6. Ja. 6.</note> Yet notwithſtanding, the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi>
one of the Generals did in the year 1679 (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then Theſaurer Deput, and one of the
Commiſſioners of His Majeſties Theſaurie
and Exchequer) as appears from what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned
by the Maſter, by Writs and other preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
preſumptions, take from the Maſter of the
Mint the Sum of ſix hundred pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi>
to procure allowance and payment of the ballance of his moſt
unjuſt and exorbitant Accompts from the Exchequer preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the year 1674, relating to the Mint and Coyn, ſtating
the King Debitor to him in Fourtie four Thouſand pounds <hi>Scots,</hi>
which he as General of His Majeſties Mint, was obliged to
comptrol, having ſpecial Truſt and a Sallarie from His Majeſty
for that effect; By which Accompts, it likeways appears,
that the Lord <hi>Hatton</hi> as General, received payment of three
years Sallarie, from the year 1660, to the year 1664; Albeit
there was no Money coyned preceeding that time, beſide an
hundred and fifty Guinies of Gold given to the Duke of <hi>Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi>
and fifty pounds Sterling to <hi>John Kirkwood</hi> his Servant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that ſame accompt, as the Maſter has Deponed: And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the General did again moſt groſly exact his Sallarie for
the ſame years out of His Majeſties Exciſe, and ſo did get
double payment of his Sallarie for the ſame years, albeit in
reaſon there was none due, In reſpect there was
no Coynage or Overſeeing the Mint for theſe years.
<pb facs="tcp:31744:14"/>
                  <hi>Sexto,</hi> Albeit by the Common Law, and ſeveral Laws and
Acts of Parliament of this Kingdom, it is Statute, <hi>That if any
Officer be negligent and culpable in the execution of his Office, he
is to be puniſhed in his perſon according to the
quality of his Crime, at the Kings Will,</hi>

albeit the Generals by their Gifts and Offices
were appointed to Comptroll the other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Mint, and had power to hold
Courts, and to puniſh Delinquents; and
notwithſtanding they did know that the
Counter-Warden, who is Check to the
Warden, did not attend his Office, and that the Under-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Mint were negligent in keeping of Compt-Books,
Regiſters of the Coynage, and many other things relating to
their Offices, and that they had committed many abuſes and
done many deeds of Malverſation, yet the Generals of the Mint
did not hold Courts to puniſh them, but were Sharers with them
in the benefit ariſing by their Abuſes and Malverſations: And
the better to palliat the Abuſes that they might not be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and that it might not be known what Profit and Advantage
the Generals and other Officers of the Mint had made all this
time paſt, the Generals did take up all the Compt-Books, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters,
and other Papers belonging to the Mint from the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Officers,
which were all Abſtracted, except two Leafs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the laſt Copper-Journal, which had been torn out of
a Book, and were delivered to the Commiſſioners by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Warden.
<hi>Septimo,</hi> Albeit by the Common Law, and Laws
of all Nations, the eliciting and extorting of Bonds and Sums of
Money, eſpecially by a ſuperior Officer from theſe in Office
under him, is manifeſt and groſs Oppreſſion, and ſeverely Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable,
yet notwithſtanding the Generals of the Mint did vex
and threaten <hi>John Falconer</hi> the late Warden, to call him before
His Majeſties Privy Council, unleſs he would grant a Bond to
<hi>Al. Maitland</hi> Counter-Warden for the Sum of Twelve Thouſand
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31744:14"/>
Merks upon the account of the third of the Remedies that were
alledged to be due to him ſince his entry to his Office, who never
attended the ſame, which Remedies did truely belong to the
King; yet notwithſtanding the Warden was neceſſitat to grant
Bond for Eleven Thouſand Merks, and grant a Diſcharge of a
Thouſand Merks that was due to him of his Fees; and albeit
the Bond was taken in <hi>Alexander Maitland</hi>'s name, yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to have been to the Generals behove, they having cauſed

where he was detained while he was neceſſitat to Compone and
Tranſact the ſame with the Generals for the Sum of Seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Merks, which was payed, and imployed for their uſe and
behove. It is not eaſie to make an exact Accompt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
ariſing to the Generals, Maſters, and other Officers of the
Mint from theſe Abuſes, which certainly will amount to vaſt
Sums. But to conclude far within bounds, it appears by an
Accompt given in under <hi>David Maitland</hi>'s Hands, Deput and
Truſtee for the Generals, that Twelve thouſand four hundred
and fourty three Stone of Copper did paſs the Irons in the laſt
Journal, the printed value thereof accompted by them amounts
to Two hundred ninety four thouſand four hundred and fifty five
Pounds <hi>Scots,</hi> and compting the Stone of Copper at a Merk the
Pound (which was more than they truely payed for that Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>in cumulo,</hi>) amounts to one hundred and twenty eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pound, ſo that there remains of free Profit to the Officers
in the Mint, one hundred ſixty ſix thouſand four hundred and
fifty five Pounds <hi>Scots</hi> Money, whereof the one half was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
aſſumed by the Generals Remedies, and all for he would
not allow any Defalcation to the Workmen or Wardens, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by an Accompt given in, all Written with the General's
own Hand; and the firſt Journal conſiſting of Seventeen thouſand
Stone, will by the rule of Proportion afford of free Gain, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
twenty ſix thouſand three hundred &amp; ſeventy eight Pounds,
ſo that the free Gain of both the Copper-Journals amounts to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31744:15"/>
Three hundred and ninety two thouſand eight hundred thirty
three Pounds, whereof there being only due to the Officers
of the Mint, by His Majeſties Gift, the Profit ariſing from Six
thouſand Stone, which is about the fift part of the free Profit they
have gotten; So that they are juſtly due to the King of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
that they have gotten of the ſaid Copper-Coyn, Three
hundred and fourteen thouſand Pounds <hi>Scots,</hi> which in <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Money, is Twenty ſix thouſand one hundred and ſixty ſix
Pounds thirteen Shillings four pence; But there being much
more Coyned out of the ſtone of Copper the firſt journal, than
was coyned out of the Stone of Copper the ſecond Journal, as
is clear by their own Depoſitions, the Profit muſt be yet a great
deal more, and the Profit ariſing to the Generals and Maſters
of the Mint, from the Bullion weight and fineneſs of the Coyn,
and Exaltation-money can hardly be well known; but it appears
by a Claime given in by the Generals to the maſter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they crave the half of the Benefit of the twelve ſhilling
for the ounce of Bullion not payed in by the Merchants
<hi>in ſpecie,</hi> that ſhould have been employed for the buying
of Bullion, the whole Bullion of the Kingdom payed in
Twelve Shilling for the Ounce, being an Hundred and fifty
Stone yearly, at Five Pound Ten Shilling Eight Pennies <hi>Scots</hi>
upon the Pound, beſide the Kings Twelfth part for the ſaid
one Hundred and Fifty Stone, will amount yearly to the Sum of
Thirteen thouſand two hundred and eighty Pounds <hi>Scots,</hi> which
from <hi>Candlemaſs</hi> 1670, conform to the Act of Parliament, by
which Merchants were allowed to pay in to the Mint Twelve
Shilling in place of every Ounce of Bullion, being Twelve years
and a half, amounts to the Sum of an Hundred and Sixty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Profit ariſing by the difference of
the Coyn from the indented Standart-Plate doth thus appear,
the <hi>Scots</hi> Coyn being often Two Grains leſs than Eleven Dinnier
Fine, which being Four Grains leſs than the indented Sandart-Plate,
(they uſually working upon the Remedies of Fineneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:31744:15"/>
which with the Remedies of Weights,) will amount to an
Hundred Pound <hi>Sterling</hi> yearly, which for the ſpace of Sixteen
years by-paſt, will amount to the Sum of Nineteen Thouſand
Two Hundred Pounds, and the Profit ariſing by the Exaltation-Money,
being Three Shilling Two Pennies upon the Ounce,
which is Forty Pound Ten Shilling upon the Stone upon two
hundred Stone that is Coyned yearly, which for an year and a
half by-paſt, will amount to Twelve thouſand Pound, and the
Profit of Two hundred Stone lying uncoyned in the Mint the
time of the Exaltation, by that ſame rule will amount to Eight
thouſand Pound, and the Profit ariſing from the King's Stock
of Twenty thouſand Merks allowed yearly for buying of Bullion,
might be Coyned and Exchanged at leaſt ten times in a year,
being Two thouſand two hundred ſeventy three Pound yearly
for theſe Twenty one years by-paſt, ſince the King's happy
Reſtitution, will amount to the Sum of Forty ſeven thouſand
ſeven hundred ſeventy three Pounds <hi>Scots</hi> Money, and the
double Payment of the Generals Sallaries for the ſpace of three
years preceeding the year 1664, which was unjuſtly exacted,
is Four thouſand and nine hundred Pounds, and the yearly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
ariſing by the Bullion payed in to the Generals and Maſter
of the Mint by the Merchants, and not Coyned in due time,
(ſeing it appears by the Books, that there was always 200
Stone of Bullion in their hands, and not Coyned) for the ſpace
of 16 years, ever ſince the year 1666. will amount to the Sum
of an hundred and twenty eighth thouſand pounds, which Sums
in all will amount to the Sum of ſix hundred and ninety nine
thouſand eight hundred and ſeventy three pounds <hi>Scots,</hi> which in
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Money is, fifty eight thouſand three hundred twenty
two pounds fifteen ſhillings, and which is beſide the profit of
the Money Coyned without Eſſay, which cannot be known, it
being oft-times worſe than the Standart, which likewiſe will
amount to a great Sum; All which profits, albeit they belong
to the King, yet they have been retained by the Generals, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31744:16"/>
the Maſter, and imployed for their own privat uſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
there being ſome Information made by the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi>
that he was willing to declare and give an Account of all things
relating to the Mint; And the Commiſſioners having ſent two
of their own number to him, to know if he would yet give a full and
ingenuous declaration of things relating to the Mint; he abſolutely
refuſed, unleſs Firſt, he was allowed to ſee all the Depoſitions
of the other Officers and Evidences adduced, which being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
contrair to Law and Form; The Commiſſioners were of the
Opinion, that it could not be granted, but declared to him, if he
would give a full and ingenuous Accompt of all things relating to
the Mint, he ſhould then ſee all the other Officers Depoſitions
and other Evidences adduced before Report were made to His
Majeſty, which he refuſed; And as to the Trial of the Fineneſs
of the Money coyned in His Majeſties Mint, the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
humbly repreſents to His Majeſty, that the practice former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſed in the Mint, in order to a Trial of the Fineneſs of the
Money coyned, was that at every Journal there was a part cut
out of an whole peice of Coyn reſerved in the Pixe, and the
peices of ſeveral Journals being all melted together in one Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,
was to be tried by the Standart; By which Trial, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
may be groſly abuſed, and ſuch a Trial is altogether elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory,
for the peice of Silver that made up the Lignat, being
taken out of the Coyn of ſeveral Journals; The Officers of the
Mint might coyn one ſmal Journal of utter fine Silver, which is
Twentie two Grains above the Standart, and one other great
Journal of Twentie two Grains below the Standart; The eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay
peice of each Journal being of equal quantitie, and both
thoſe peices being melted into one Lignat, it is evident that the
Lignat will be of equal fineneſs with the Standart; and there
being perhaps ten times as much coyned in the Journal which
is below the Standart as was coyned in the Journal which was
above the Standart; there will be nine parts of eleven of the
Money coyned that will be twentie two Grains below the
<pb facs="tcp:31744:16"/>
Standart; So that albeit the Lignat be of equal fineneſs with
the Standart, yet nine parts of eleven of all the Money coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Kingdom may be below the Standart; and probably
by that manner of Trial, the King has formerly been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that the Money of this Kingdom was of exact fineneſs
conform to the Standart, whereas by this manner of Trial, there
is no ſecurity that the Money coyned in this Kingdom is of equal
fineneſs with the Standart, and this is no Trial at all as to the
weight, which ought to be rectified, and a certain way of Trial
appointed, that the Money coyned be not debaſed neither in
Weight nor Fineneſs: As alſo the Commiſſioners conſidering,
how uncertain it were for them to make an exact Trial of the
Silver Pieces reſerved in the Pixe, whereby they might exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Journals coyned ſince the laſt Eſſay was taken, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the ſcarcity of Eſſay-Maſters, whom they can truſt in ſo
important a matter, have tranſmitted a competent number of
theſe Peices taken out of the Pixe in preſence of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
two Wardens, and Eſſay-Maſter of the Mint, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
under the Seals of the ſaids two Wardens and Eſſay-Maſter,
to the Effect, Trial may be made by ſuch as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſhal judge fit; As alſo humbly repreſents to His Majeſty,
that the former methods and practice of the Mint of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
how theſe Peices have been reſerved for Trial in manner
above-mentioned, hath not been ſo exact, but that the Officers
of the Mint may Coyn at their pleaſure, and that the Fault
cannot be diſcovered by the Pixe: And therefore, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
in humble Obedience to His Majeſties Royal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
makes Report to His Sacred Majeſty of the Particulars
above-mentioned, which was ſufficiently verified and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them in manner foreſaid, And humbly remits the ſame to
His Majeſties ſerious Conſideration, to do therein as His Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Majeſty ſhal think fit.</p>

               <p>WHereas we mentioned in the cloſe of our laſt Report,
that the Method uſed here for Tryal of the fineneſs of
the ſeveral Journals, by putting pieces of every Journal in the
Pix Box, which pieces were to be melted into a Lignot, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31744:21"/>
Judgment given of the whole Coynage, according to that Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
was not only unſecure, but illuſory. Now on ſome Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
made, in preſence of a Committee of our Number by the
King's Goldſmith and Eſſay-maſter of the Mint, It is found, That
albeit both the Officers of the Mint did confeſs, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters
do expreſly bear, That ſome Journals have been of ten
Deniers and twenty two Grains, others of eleven, and others
of eleven and two Grains, and the pieces of theſe Journals, which
were put in the Pix, had the report of the Eſſay-maſter wrapt
about every piece, conform to the Regiſters, and their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions;
Yet the foreſaid Committee, the Goldſmith, and the
Goldſmiths Eſſay-maſter, together with the Maſter of the Mint
and Wardens, Have Declared, by their Subſcribed Report, that
the pieces of theſe very Journals, are finer than the Report in
which they are wrapt, or which is contained in their Regiſters
or Confeſſions, ſome by 5, ſome by 6, ſome by 9, and ſome by
10 Grains, which muſt neceſſarly evince, that either the Eſſay-Maſter
is ignorant, or that other pieces than what he Eſſayed,
may be conveyed into the Pix; and conſequently that a Tryal
made thereby, is altogether unſure, and the rather that by their
own Regiſters, it appears that no Money came in to the Mint,
neither in Bullion or Lignot, near to the ſaid Fineneſs.</p>
