            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Impartial Reader,</salute>

            <p>AS I here present to thy View and Serious Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, Our Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the Attempts of an Enemy: So I judge it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, at least briefly, to give thee some Account, some Reasons for my so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I am sensible, that Business and Action tread so close upon the Heels of Leisure with very many, that tho' this may incline, yet that may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the bestowing time to read Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, either tedious in their Length, or in their Nature. If this partake of both these, I can assure thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> with respect to its Length; it hath so hapned not through any abounding Leisure that I had, to swell this, but from a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to follow the <hi>Snake</hi> through his

Windings, or (to speak in his Phrase) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: Thereby to obviate his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which were of any seeming force; and how far that is done, thy Judgment is (for thy self) to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: Of this I shall only say, that as on the one hand, I have endeavour'd to avoid prolixity, so on the other, I have endeavour'd to use such, and so many words as might sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Matters spoken to.</p>
            <p>If in this endeavour I have prov'd something short or defective in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, or have sometime used, not the most proper, and apt Expressions to the purpose intended; I hope the impartial <hi>Reader</hi> will from the Bulk, Scope and general Tendency of what I have said, find cause to conclude that the fault is only in that, and not in the meaning: And that this is always sound, if that be not always so; this being our Duty, that so far as it relates to Art being only an accomplishment, is, tho' a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency


<pb facs="tcp:63041:3"/>
to them that have it, yet a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon none: Which as I do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to be my Talent, so neither will it I hope be strictly exacted of me.</p>
            <p>But as to the Nature or Kind of this Tract, that was wholly out of my Power; for Controversial it must be, and that is not always pleasant to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reader: And what may yet serve to add to that Ground of Dislike is, that the Chain or Thread of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course being frequently broken, by Quotations from the Adversary, and other occasions; there often may be an uncertain or uneven Stile. Yet I hope the <hi>Reader</hi> will not be hereby prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against the Truth delivered, but accept that, tho' meanly drest: This in general for the Book I here present. And now I may add some few things with respect to that, to which this is the Answer, <hi>viz. The Snake in the Grass:</hi> Which Title imples a Lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Practice, not imputable to us, since the things Charged are mostly

from Books that are Publick to all, and made so with Design that they might be more generally look'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to than they are; so that Lurking is not our Way, but his Practice; which is yet more manifest, in that the pretended Relations of Fact which he gives to support the Title, <hi>Snake in the Grass,</hi> are by their Falshood, true Evidences that this Title is his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p>But as Naturalists observe, Things Venomous do often carry with them their own Antidote; so it is by this <hi>Snake.</hi> In which the Antidote is near the Poyson, and the Remedy near the Disease. His Disingenuity is the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, its Counterballance is his Self-contradiction, and apparent Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which are such as may be seen by little Observation. For what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Contradiction can there be, than after having Ridicul'd, Aspers'd and Prophanely Treated our Belief of <hi>the Sufficiency of the Light within,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving


<pb facs="tcp:63041:5"/>
endeavour'd to represent it as Inconsistent and Impossible, by falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Arguments in several of his <hi>Sections</hi>? Yet after all this to come and say, and acknowledge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> as much as we do; and to persuade his <hi>Reader</hi> that it is his belief. Thus p. 39. he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to represent <hi>wicked Men and Devils</hi> to be as <hi>Infallibly</hi> guided as those who are <hi>guided</hi> by the <hi>Light of Christ in Men,</hi> which we say is <hi>Suffiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> to guide Men in the way of true Obedience to God: And in p. 60. he hath endeavour'd to represent this our Belief of the <hi>Suffitiency of the Light within,</hi> as that which <hi>does totally root up and destroy all Church Government and Order:</hi> And p. 167. he saith, <hi>Outward Preaching must be wholly inconsistent</hi> with this Suffitiency of the Light within.</p>
            <p>And now in Opposition and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to all this, and much more of this sort, scattered throughout the whole Book; he seems in p. 319. to

               <pb facs="tcp:63041:7"/>
be as fully persuaded of the Suffitien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Light within <hi>as any Sober</hi> Quaker (as he expresses it) and there says of this <hi>Light within,</hi> or <hi>Inspiration</hi> (for he makes them Synonimous) <hi>It is the Cause of all the Good that is in us, and we are directed to it, to follow and be guided by it; and are assured that it will lead us to all Truth that is requisite and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for our Eternal Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this he delivers, not as his own Sentiment only, but also as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which if it be, it will concern him to prove for himself and them, that this Inspiration which is suffitient to lead to all Truth requisite and necessary to Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, do not run into the Error of <hi>Origen, that the Devils shall be finally saved.</hi> That it do not <hi>totally root up and destroy all Church Government and Order.</hi> That it be not <hi>wholly Inconsistent</hi> with all <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Preaching:</hi> And with many other things which he hath said it is, as is before quoted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63041:7"/>But now more Particularly with respect to the Author of the <hi>Snake,</hi> he is disingenious, and a false Witness: And as a Clipper or Coiner is of no Credit, so he by perverting words spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and forging that for ours which never was, has sufficiently shewn what Credit is to be given to him. As for his Perversions, they are detected in every of the following Sections, and are so numerous, that to repeat them all, I must transcribe a great part of the Book into the Preface; wherefore I shall only take notice of one, and that is a Quotation which he has made in p. 81. out of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s <hi>Address,</hi> &amp;c. which he has notoriously perverted as I have shewn, Sect. V. p. 144, 145. And altho' the <hi>Snake</hi> hath, to excuse this, made an Advertisement, p. 346, 347, 348. yet he hath not clear'd himself of it, in that by a most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perversion he saith, p. 347. It <hi>lies still against Mr.</hi> Penn, <hi>and the other Foxonian Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63041:8"/>But besides Perversions of this Sort, his Curtailing Quotations, his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and Placing of Words and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, so that they might speak his Sense, not ours, is most notorious; and such as does at once destroy both the Charity of a Christian, and the Honour of a Man.</p>
            <p>Thus, making a Quotation from <hi>G. F</hi>'s <hi>Answer to the</hi> Westmerland <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi>; he pretends to take these words, <hi>You will own Our Writings</hi>; when in that place as I have shewn p. 83. the words are, <hi>You will own Them</hi>; so that the words <hi>Our Writings</hi> are his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>Thus, also he makes a Quotation from <hi>Edw. Burroughs</hi>'s Works, p. 862. <hi>Every True Member of the Church,</hi> here he gives a Dash — and then goes on, and leaves out these words which next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>hath its particular Measure of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit of Christ,</hi> &amp;c. as I have shewn in p. 93. and thus he hath done by <hi>G. Whitehead, W. Penn, T. Ellwood,


<pb facs="tcp:63041:8"/>
F. Howgill</hi> and others, whose Writings he mentions, which I have detected as I have met with them.</p>
            <p>And besides this his base Practice of Clipping our Words, and Coining, and passing upon his <hi>Reader</hi> his own words for ours, in pretended Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are herein detected. He also in Relations of Fact hath been equally injurious to Truth and Us.</p>
            <p>Thus in p. 148. He pretends to give an account of the Practice of one of our <hi>Schools,</hi> to tell what they do, and what they do not read; and says, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Chapter out of the Bible, that is Beastly Ware with them, Dust, and Death, and Serpents Meat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet this is false, as I have shewn by Certificates, under the hands of Persons, who well know the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of that School; and have testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, p. 225, 226, 227. That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are in that School daily read by the Scholars; and that there hath not been the least appearance of

Slight or Disesteem shew'd to them, either by the Master or any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the said School. And to what I have thus prov'd notoriously false, he had the Face to call upon the <hi>Publick to take some care in it</hi>; which if himself had done, he could not have told that Untruth.</p>
            <p>Thus in p. 110. He does in the last degree of Confidence say, <hi>We never heard of any Censure they have pass'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those many much grosser Contempts of Scripture, which daily are found among them, particularly of</hi> Mary Tucker, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When on the contrary, his general Slander [<hi>Contempts of Scripture, which are daily found among them,</hi> &amp;c.] is no other than a general Falshood, and the particular Story I have shewn, p. 171, 172. to be as falsly cast on us. For that there was Censure past upon <hi>Mary Tucker,</hi> for her gross Contempt of the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> both by her then Master (for it is now near 40 Years since) <hi>W. Reyman:</hi> And also by <hi>Edw.


<pb facs="tcp:63041:9"/>
Burroughs,</hi> and other of our Friends, who did then deny her for that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And of this he might easily have heard, who did so well know the place of <hi>W. Reyman</hi>'s abode.</p>
            <p>But the meanness of his Soul, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that of his Fortune; to supply his Teeth he turns Broker or Pedlar to Renegades, and <hi>licks up their Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> (to use his own Phrase) only that he may have the Pleasure of throwing it at us, having added to its Filthiness, from his own foul Mouth. Thus, by a strange Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction he can receive Information from <hi>T. C.</hi> against <hi>J. Naylor,</hi> who yet hath professed so much respect to that deceased, as to conclude to be buried by him, which shews, that while they are lashing of <hi>J. N</hi>'s Memory, or the faults of such as have been long since deny'd by us; it's only with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign that they might reach our Backs. This is the Aim and great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, in order to which, the Charges


<pb facs="tcp:63041:10"/>
which we have heretofore Answer'd over and over, are now new vamp'd and chang'd by this <hi>Snake,</hi> in a fresh Dress, and given forth as a new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, which tho' it be a plain proof of his Disingenuity; yet is there <hi>little</hi> New in it, for that Charges of these sorts have been made by our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, in their Books Printed against us, as well during the Days of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as since. And though there hath been hardly any in their Writings against us, but have shewn themselves to have some Rancour and Enmity: Yet I think none have gone the length of this <hi>Snake</hi> herein, as well in his Prophane Jesting, and playing the Buffoon on the Subject of <hi>Religion</hi>; some Instances of which I have Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, p. 19, 20. whereby he hath shewn himself fitter for a Stage-Play, than a serious Controversie; as in the management of it he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd nothing more than a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting Spirit, by ill and false Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,


<pb facs="tcp:63041:10"/>
endeavouring to expose us for our Christian <hi>Principles,</hi> while himself, for his own <hi>Principle,</hi> or rather <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> is <hi>Incognito.</hi> I say <hi>Humour,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was formerly as much the other way, towards the late King, even to <hi>Rudeness</hi> and <hi>Sedition,</hi> as he hath since manifested himself to be against the <hi>Present Government.</hi> Insomuch that if we fetch his Parallel from Scripture, it must be <hi>Ishmael,</hi> both in Scoffing, and having his Hand against every Man; by which his ill Practices, and Un-Christian Attempts and Designs, he hath given true Evidence and Reason to conclude concerning him, in the Words of the Prophet <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.20. <hi>But the wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot rest, whose Waters cast up mire and dirt.</hi>

               <hi>Reader,</hi> I shall not be so tedious in the <hi>Preface,</hi> as here to touch upon the several kinds of Ills he hath done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, they being somewhat spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to in the <hi>Introduction.</hi> What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains


<pb facs="tcp:63041:11"/>
is, That I account it, in some sort, an Act of <hi>Supererogation,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider him at all, after the <hi>Answer</hi> which hath been already given by <hi>G. W.</hi> to the first Edition, and what hath been occasionally Answer'd in former times: The Substance of his whole Book being no other than a Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of former Calumnies from seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Adversaries; which as he has col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, or epitomiz'd, into one Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume; so if thou herein finds fit Collective Answer, it may in some degree, ease thee of the trouble of an exact and distinct Inquiry into all our particular Answers. If herein it be serviceable, in that the Calumnies of the Adversary are wip'd away, his Falsities refuted, and Truth set in it's Native Light; so far God shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be Glorify'd, and both my trouble in Writing, and thine in Reading of it, will be answer'd</p>

               <head>INTRODUCTION. Wherein also the Preface and Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the <hi>Snake</hi> are Consider'd and Reply'd to.</head>
               <p>AGainst the Venome of the <hi>Snake,</hi> as it at first appeared, an <hi>Antidote</hi> has been already given, in an Answer under that Title, by <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> to the First Edition of the <hi>Snake in the Grass:</hi> Of which Answer, the crafty Sophister, having gotten notice, hastned a Second Edition of the <hi>Snake,</hi> so different from the First, that it might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63041:13"/>
seem a New Book, than a New Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of an Old One. For besides the Additions which he made, he alter'd the Frame and Contexture of it, by choping and changing the Parts, and melting (as his Phrase is) a Preface of above 350 Pages (and bigger than the Book it self) into the Body of the Book, which (as himself says) in his Account of the Second Edition, renders it in a manner <hi>a New Work</hi>; and he calls it <hi>a pulling down the whole, and rearing it in a new Form.</hi> Thus the <hi>Snake</hi> cast its Skin, chang'd both Colour and Shape in the several Subsequent Editions: By which Artifice, the Answer, which was designed and adapted to the First Edition, was render'd less Serviceable and Useful. The Reader, not knowing, by the Pages referr'd to in the <hi>Antidote,</hi> where to find in the later Editions, the Matter treated of. As this, together with the Adversary's Allegations in his latter Editions, that in the Answer to his first, his Quotations were not disproved, was the Ground or Motive to this Second Answer: So also the Reasons why this Answer came not sooner forth, were partly, that we might see in what Shape this <hi>Proteus,</hi> who has transform'd so often, would at length settle, that we might not be again obliged <hi>Actum Agere:</hi> And partly, that we might have had his Reply to <hi>G.W</hi>'s <hi>Antidote,</hi> which is his Third Edition, p. 358, and 366. He hath as good as promised, that That also


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63041:13"/>
might have been considered. But since our Adversary has thought fit to suspend, if not wholly to throw off, his pretended <hi>Intention,</hi> of giving a particular Reply to the <hi>Antidote:</hi> I was not willing longer to delay this Answer, to the Third and Last Edition of the <hi>Snake.</hi> And do here acquaint such Readers, who have the Second Edition of the <hi>Snake,</hi> that though the Pages differ, so that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences by them do not agree, yet the <hi>Sections</hi> in both the Second and Third <hi>Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> standing in the same Order, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same Titles; and this Answer being adapted to each <hi>Section</hi> mostly <hi>separatim,</hi> it will not be very difficult for the Reader here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to find the Matter referr'd to in the Second Edition of the <hi>Snake</hi> also.</p>
               <p>Thus having given some short Account, both of the Reasons why this Answer was delay'd till now, and why written now: It will be necessary to proceed to the Work; in which, that I may not omit any thing in the <hi>Snake,</hi> deserving notice, I shall begin with his Preface.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Snake,</hi> that he might not miss any occasion of shewing the World the Squint Opinion he has of us, is pleased to link us in his Preface with one <hi>Antonia Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignon,</hi> of whose Principles he pretends to


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63041:14"/>
give some Account, and that she perfectly agrees with us, <hi>Pref. p.</hi> 11. even in those things wherein himself says she hath writ against us; and takes up a great part of 44 Pages, of which his Preface consists, to shew some Instances of those <hi>Wild, Heretical and Barbarous</hi> Notions, which in <hi>Pref. p.</hi> 4. he says <hi>Antonia</hi> holds, and which he in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bestows upon us, thereby to prepossess his Reader: Not unlike the Fellow, who to shew his Squint and Blasphemous Opinion of the Apocalyps, bound up St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Aesop</hi>'s <hi>Fables</hi> in one Volume. But as St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Revelations</hi> had another Origin than the Imaginary <hi>Fables</hi> of <hi>Aesop:</hi> So the Revelations of the same Holy Spirit at this day do vastly differ from all Imaginary Flights, from all <hi>Heretical, Wild and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Notions</hi>; and does give Solid Reasons of that Faith it begets in us, and which we are ready to give to the Sober Inquirer. As for <hi>Bourignon,</hi> her Errors concerns not us (if she be what the <hi>Snake</hi> says) she appearing an Enemy, as well as he, by having writ against us; not but that there is some reason to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he wrongs her from the certainty we have of his often and greatly abusing us. Pref. p. 11, 12. <hi>The great design of the Devil is, and has always been, to beat down the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and outward Ordinances,</hi> &amp;c. When the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> decry'd the abrogated Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and outward Ordinances, did he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63041:14"/>
carry on the design of the Devil? From the Rise of Popery, all along the Apostacy, to the time of the Reformation beginning, did the Devil labour to beat down the Priesthood, and outward Ordinances, or to keep them up?</p>
                  <p>Ib. <hi>Knowing that Religion must needs fall with them.</hi> What Religion must that be? This shews the Religion the <hi>Snake</hi> contends for, is built upon the Priesthood, and outward Ordinances, else it could not necessarily fall with them.

The Author of that Treason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Piece, in answer to Dr. <hi>King,</hi> now Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> can say <hi>You</hi> to One, can call Men <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Master</hi> (who are not so) can pull off his Hat, and Bow; yet has given a fair Specimen of his design to dissolve the Relation of King and People, by running down the present Government.

                  <p>This Assertion of the Snake is not allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, but litterally a Lye; for we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the satisfaction made by Christ to his Father, but we do deny that groundless and dangerous Notion of <hi>his having paid,</hi> and his Father exacted, that strict and rigorous Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, by undergoing the self-same Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and Pains that the Damned suffer in Hell.</p>

                  <p>Herein the Snake shews his unity with those Blasphemous Opposers of Christ, and also gives a Testimony for us, that in begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and increase, we are like the Primitive Times of increasing Christianity: Which, tho' it is beyond the common Rule of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet it is certainly true, that by the things which are not, God will bring to nought things that are: And the mean and low, who keep so, in his Fear, them he will exalt; and them who <hi>seek first the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righteousness of it,</hi> shall not fail to have all convenient things added; for being Lord of Heaven, he is the same over Earth, and disposes it at his pleasure.

                  <p>Thus Indefinitely and without distinction he brands <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> yet in the same Page allows it to be <hi>Divine,</hi> admits the greatest flights and extasies of it. And says, <hi>The Higher the Better.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus he fights against himself, by own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and denying the same thing: And not less in the Marks he gives, to know that <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm,</hi> which he calls Divine, from that which he calls Diabolical.</p>
                  <p>The first (<hi>Pref.</hi> p. 323.) is, that Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm, or those Inspirations (for he makes them Synonymous) which are Divine, <hi>fill us with Humility, and withal a great Charity for others; being more apt to have a good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them, than of our Selves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Reader I will shew thee, that the <hi>Snake,</hi> our Adversary, is free from this first Mark of Divine Inspiration: For as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as Hatred is to Love, as Cruelty is to Mercy so is his Disdainful and Scornful, Insulting and Scoffing (which throughout his Book ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears) contrary to the Humility and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which the holy Spirit teacheth.</p>
                  <p>And it is in Disdain and Scorn where this Adversary, <hi>p.</hi> 16. speaking of <hi>G. F.</hi> says, it <hi>was a bewildring of his poor Vnderstanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in <hi>p.</hi> 17. speaking of <hi>G. F.</hi> he says, he had <hi>an immoderate degree of Dulness and lack of Vnderstanding, as could hardly befall any thing in Humane Shape.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in <hi>p.</hi> 150. speaking of <hi>G. F.</hi> he says, <hi>But George Magus owned no other Holy Ghost,


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63041:18"/>
than what was within himself, of which he was the Possessor and Owner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 42, 43. Speaking to <hi>G. W.</hi> he says, Scoffingly and Insultingly, <hi>George hold up thy Face and look like a Man! Come, be brisk, and tell me by yea and by nay.</hi> Ibid. <hi>Alas poor George! Is the Infallible Quakers dwindled down to a meer Gypsie? — Ah! George! What a blessed Spirit wouldst thou have thought Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These few instances, may shew how far the <hi>Snake</hi> is from that Humility and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which himself makes the first and proper Mark of Divine Enthusiasm or Inspiration. <hi>Charity</hi> (he says, <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 35.) <hi>believeth all things that are good, or can be well construed of another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But himself is so far from this Charity, that he misconstrues all things against us, with set purpose to abuse us. When he says (<hi>Pref.</hi> p. 34.) <hi>Hence We</hi> (himself and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) <hi>dispise others, and are apt to censure them even unto Hell</hi>; he says true to the Shame of himself and them: But when he adds, <hi>The Quakers have damn'd all but themselves, he says false,</hi> and that it may appear he hath falsly charged us; pray Reader consider the following Quotation taken from one of our Ancient Friends, <hi>Isaac Penington</hi>; in his Treatise, Entituled, <hi>An Answer to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Objection against the</hi> Quakers, <hi>that they condemn all but themselves</hi>; which was writ


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63041:18"/>
early, and reprinted with his Works, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1680. where, <hi>p.</hi> 310. of the first part of his Works, He thus speaks,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Protestant Churches (as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in way of distinction from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) the blessed Martyrs, who suffered for the Testimony of a pure Conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and all the Worthies of the Lord, in their several Generations, who fought against the Scarlet Whore, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, in their Testimony against Her, and are not disowned by us, but dearly owned and honoured therein.</q>
He continues in giving Instances both of persons and things, as <hi>Luther, Hus, Brute,</hi> and <hi>Fox,</hi> with whom we agree in these things; as against deriving a Ministry from <hi>Rome,</hi> and maintaining it by Tithes, and denying Swearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <q>And then adds, p. 311. But all things were not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered at once. The Times were then dark, and the Light small; yet they being Faithful, according to what was discovered, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the Lord's Eyes; and what through Ignorance they err'd in, the Lord winked at, and overlooked; being pleased with the Sincerity and Simplicity of Heart, which he had stirred up in them towards himself.</q>
Thus he, as who please may read, with more to the same purpose.</p>
                  <p>Now, pray <hi>Reader</hi> consider, whether this be Damning all but our selves, or whether it be not of that Charity, which the <hi>Snake</hi> hath


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63041:19"/>
made one Mark of Divine Inspiration. And more Instances of this sort I could heap, but that I aim to satisfie not cloy thee; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come to the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Second sure Mark, and which is a Mark of Diabolical Inspiration; and that is <hi>Pref. p.</hi> 35. <hi>Heresie Instill'd, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Truth of the Gospel.</hi> Which, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to us, is begging the Question. And the Charge is the same from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and from other Dissenters to her also: So that this his Sure Mark, does, by such begging the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, as surely hit himself as others. And therefore I shall let this Mark rest, till I come to the Instances, which he shall give, of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies we hold, contrary to the Truth of the Gospel; and may then have opportunity to shew, that the <hi>Snake</hi> is with the <hi>Papist,</hi> as ready to bestow the name <hi>Heretick,</hi> as I have shewn him to be Uncharitable, Proud and Disdainful.</p>
                  <p>I come now to his third and last Mark, <hi>Pref. p.</hi> 36. <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Schism</hi>: upon which our Adversary mentions that of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> reproved by the the Holy Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. where he says, <hi>To speak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, to understand all Mysteries,</hi> &amp;c. To which the <hi>Snake</hi> adds, <hi>Pref. p.</hi> 37. <hi>All this would signifie nothing to us, if we keep not in the Vnity of the Body, which is the Church.</hi> Pref. p. 38. <hi>And be not content with our Station, as Members, tho' never so Eminent, as an Eye or a Hand, without making a Schism in the Body,


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63041:19"/>
by withdrawing our due Subjection to the Head; our Spiritual Governors, who are the Principles of Vnity in the Body.</hi> Pref. p. 39. <hi>And now Reader, stay and admire! That if even Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Gifts were not a sufficient Pretence for any to advance himself above his Bishop, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from under his Government.</hi> And the <hi>Snake</hi> gives us a Reason, why this strict Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection must hold; <hi>Pref. p.</hi> 41. Because, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the Church are better amended, by living in the Communion of the Church; and there-by Exhorting, Admonishing, and Shewing Good Example to Reclaim.</hi> Thus the <hi>Snake.</hi> And <hi>Reader,</hi> Let me now shew thee how, in all this, he hath combated the Reformation, and thrown down the Church-Services, as Schismatical, which in <hi>Sect</hi> 22. he calls <hi>Divine Enthusiasm.</hi> That I may shew this: It hath been acknowledged by Members of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in Dispute with those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome, That there is Possibility of Salvation in the Church of</hi> Rome: <hi>She being truly a Church, though Corrupt.</hi> Now, if so, according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Snake,</hi> the first Reformers from Popery, <hi>how Eminent so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> nay, if endued with <hi>Miraculous Gifts,</hi> had not sufficient Pretence to advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>Above their Bishop,</hi> who being their <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Governour and Head,</hi> they did owe a due Subjection to him. And this the <hi>Snake</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to enforce, <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 40. <hi>That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Wickedness of the Priests and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63041:20"/>
of the Jews. Yet the Holy Prophets sent from God, set not up opposite Altars, to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of those wicked Priests, nor invaded their Office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Readers,</hi> who are in Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> See your Advocate is gone to <hi>Rome</hi> in his Preface; and to his Power hath struk at the Root of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, not only here in <hi>England,</hi> but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Europe.</hi> By which Key we may open his meaning in <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 42. where he would be understood to have a <hi>Flaming Charity for the good of the Body, and the Vnity of the Church.</hi> And now for a Man that has in such large Characters Apologized for <hi>Rome,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to weaken the Reformation, in the nullity of those Arguments, on which it is partly built, to be so much in Passion, as in Page 189. he is, with <hi>Josiah Coale,</hi> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing in a piece of his (what he calls) <hi>A Sensless, but bitter Libel, against the Church of England</hi>; written by <hi>A. S.</hi> a <hi>Papist,</hi> is very odd; it shews his Disposition to be very Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, by the Unsettledness of his Reason. But hitherto I have only apply'd his Doctrine to the Reformation: It's true, it fits not there, but there may be some Excuse, in that he might in hast, not think of squaring his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by that Rule. But then, let's Examine his Doctrine by his own Practice, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under his Daily Observation (or else he is very forgetful) it is not so likely to run Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63041:20"/>
to that: Yet such is this Man's blindness, That, <hi>Reader,</hi> what he objects against us, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and all other Dissenters from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for Instances of Schism, are directly within the Line of his Practice: For this doughty Champion, who with so much Confidence in Page 336. does <hi>Demand Reparation in the Name of the Church of England,</hi> did yet withdraw himself from his acknowledged due Subjection to his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Head and Guide, his <hi>Bishop</hi>; in not acknowledging of the present Government, and has been more apt to Censure others than himself, and to Divide than Heal; which in <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 43. he saith, <hi>We ought not.</hi> Hence his Momus-like Disposition in <hi>Ireland:</hi> And Hence the Occasion of the Warrant for his Apprehension, while endeavouring to escape to <hi>France,</hi> when at War with us; in which Practices I doubt not but he is disowned by that Church, as that Church must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be disowned by those, who, tho' in Corners, set up private Altars against her: Thus in Examination, His private Practices run Counter to his publick Pretences, which is a Mark of Hypocrisie, to which more may be spoken anon. But besides all this, <hi>If Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in a Church are best mended, by living in the Communion of it, and there, by Exhorting, Admonishing, and Shewing Good Examples.</hi> Does the Church of <hi>England</hi> give Liberty so to do, to those that continue in her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63041:21"/>
If not, what is this but to sham and deceive the unwary <hi>Reader.</hi> But we are rather to take the account of his disposition towards us, by the Character which he makes of 30 or 40 different Sects (as he calls all Dissenters) <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 43. that they are <hi>like the Spawn of the Viper.</hi> And I cannot think they, or he, would like the Exhortation and Admonition of such <hi>Spawn.</hi>

                     <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 44. He advises, to <hi>be willing chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to submit our selves to our Superiours both in Church and State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here he would again impose upon the <hi>Reader,</hi> as if himself did both; when in truth neither, which if he did, it might be hoped (in Charity) he would be more a Christian, and a better Subject.</p>

                  <head>The Introduction considered.</head>
                  <p>HAving dispatched the Preface, before I reply to the Book, I shall here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to thee <hi>Reader,</hi> the Profaneness, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie and Injustice of this our Adversary, in some few collected Instances; that I may not postpone thy inquiry to a distinct survey of the whole.</p>
                  <p>And first for his Profaneness: He doth, in a stile not Grave or Serious; but Light, Airy, Deriding and Scoffing, treat of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters most Grave and Serious; at least herein equalling, if not outdoing the <hi>Stage</hi>: Hereby


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63041:21"/>
stirring up Levity in the Wild and Wanton, and keeping the <hi>Reader</hi> from a Sober and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Consideration of things; rather than make it his endeavour, to convince Gain-sayers, satisfie the Scrupulous, reduce the Erronious, propagate the Gospel, or to bring Converts or Honour to the Church he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be of: And it is not to be imagined, that Persons of solid Judgment, Sobriety and a serious Sense of Religion, should endure, much less be taken, with an attempt, running counter to these purposes: Of this sort is his whole 23 Sect. where, in most Prophane Manner, he redicules the Operations of the holy Spirit, calling it, <hi>p.</hi> 330. <hi>a mad Joy</hi>; and <hi>p.</hi> 336. <hi>Enthusiastick Madness.</hi> And of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> says, <hi>p.</hi> 330. he was a <hi>Liberal Cursing Prophet — a Journey-man Shooe-maker, the Ground and Occasion of whose Enthusiasm, was Despair,</hi> p. 331. <hi>So Ignorant,</hi> p. 335. <hi>that he knew not before, but God dwelt in a Church, as Man does in a House, so as to be locked up, and to be no where else when he is there.</hi> And that <hi>George Magus</hi> (as he is pleased to call him) <hi>owned no other holy Ghost than what was within himself, of which he was the possessor and owner,</hi> p. 150.</p>
                  <p>And speaking to <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> p. 42, 43. he does in scoffing Mood bid him, by <hi>yea</hi> and by <hi>nay,</hi> hold up his Face, be Brisk and look like a Man. This with abundance more scatter'd throughout the whole Book.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:63041:22"/>He says <hi>p.</hi> 6. he is <hi>forced to now and then, in answer to such sensless Arguments and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, as deserve no otherwise to be confuted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And on this account it is, that of Dissenters in general; he can afford no better Character or Simile, than that they are like the <hi>Spawn of the Viper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, sober <hi>Reader,</hi> pray consider, Do we meet with such Instructions for Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in the Example and Precept of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? The Examples and Precepts of his holy Apostles? Or, in the Example and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of of such, who in a true sense of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, have declared the end of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, were to reclaim and reduce the Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and convince Gain-sayers? Is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? <hi>Reader,</hi> that supposing me in Error and Gain-saying; I should think a Man so profanely Scoffing, should have any real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the Salvation of my Soul, so as to be reduced by him: Or, if I be not in Error, that he can have any consciencious Concern for my preservation: Nor will the example of <hi>Elijah</hi> do him any service here; he by a warrantable Irony, did confute the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God-head, which hath Eyes and sees not, Ears and hears not; thereby to reclaim the Idol-worshippers. But we, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> nor any other Dissenters in <hi>England,</hi> that I know of, do, or ever did, acknowledge any other God, than that one Almighty Being, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Things, and Jesus Christ his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63041:22"/>
Son, and the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, who is one God, blessed for ever. This hath been so often declared, that the <hi>Snake</hi> could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it; wherefore he is the more Inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of his Hypocrisie, p. 2. <hi>I have</hi> (says he) <hi>great Charity for the Generality of the Ignorant sort of them; some of whom I know to be very Honest and Well-meaning Men, and Devout in their Way.—I do freely own, that I have a real Kindness and good Wishes for every one of the</hi> Quakers, <hi>that I have hitherto been acquainted with; and I never received any sort of Disobligation from any of them, in my whole Life.</hi> And yet treats the <hi>Quakers</hi> with all the marks of Bitterness, Baseness, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Disdain, and with all the marks of open Enmity, that can be shewn in the most Scurrilous manner, insomuch that he implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denies <hi>One</hi> Dram of the Spirit of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity to be in all the <hi>Quakers,</hi> p. 182. and in p. 177. to <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> he says, <hi>Come</hi> George, <hi>we are near an end, and we know not if ever we shall meet again; tell me in the</hi> Plain, <hi>Down-right Honesty and Simplicity of the Light within.</hi> See <hi>Reader,</hi> not only the Prophaneness, but the Hypocisie of Pretended Kindness and Good Wishes, and the base Returns, for no Disobligation. Page 202. the Picture of the <hi>Quaker Spirit,</hi> he says, he feels, sees and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates, by the very Conviction of his Sense.


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63041:23"/>
Then what grand Hypocrisie must it be, to pretend, as he doth, that he hath real Kindness and good Wishes for such, whose Spirit he abominates? I have shewn before, from his Profane and Scornful Treatment of us, that he cannot wish well to our Souls; and himself declares, he abominates our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; which being both absent, what would his kindness to our Bodies be? Why there is sufficient Ground to believe, that his kindness to them is much what the cruel Emperor's was to the <hi>Romans,</hi> when he wished them all but one Neck; and then their dispatch would be speedy. And to shew that it is not meer Conjecture, I now proceed:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To his Injustice, which is manifest, not only in Wresting our Writings, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting our Plain Meanings therein, and that knowingly and wilfully, since they have been explained by our selves; but also by false Quoting our Books, sometimes by packing Sentences, which stand at distance, close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as one continued Quotation; or else only with the distinction of a Break, without any regard to his breaking off the Sense of the Writer: Of which, in my way through his Book, I shall shew abundance of Instances. Add to this his Injustice, in urging against us our Adversaries false Charges; some upon bare hear-say, and often out of Books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten against us by open Enemies, and that without taking notice of our Answers; which


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63041:23"/>
is equally Unjust: As to have urged the Writings of <hi>Celsus, Porphyry,</hi> or other Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, against the Primitive Christians, or the Writings of the Romanists against the Protestants, as <hi>Eckius</hi> against <hi>Luther, Harding</hi> againg <hi>Juel,</hi> &amp;c. without any regard had to their Answers: Which, whosoever should do, might have the name of a Bold and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but not Wise or Honest Man: Yet such is this <hi>Snake</hi>'s Practice, and that he might not come short in any thing, wherein he can be Injurious, he hath purposely mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stated our Principles, that thereby he might make himself an Advantage to fasten upon us (what in him lies) such Absurd, Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, and Impious Consequences, as he pleases. Of this sort, I shall have frequent proof to shew thee <hi>Reader,</hi> and now go on to the Book.</p>
                  <p>Page 1. <hi>The Controversie with the Quaker Dissenters has not been pursued by the Church of</hi> England, <hi>with the like Zeal and Pains, as those against the Presbyterians, Independants, and other Dissenters, because the Quakers were not so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.—But their Numbers (increased by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neglected) are become Formidable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not my business here to inquire what the <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Pains</hi> of the Church has been against other Dissenters; it shall suffice me, briefly as I may, to shew how warm her <hi>Zeal,</hi> and how great her <hi>Pains</hi> towards us: Tho' I here declare, it is not pleasant to me, afresh, to object the Unchristian Treatment,


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63041:24"/>
                     <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Pains,</hi> wherewith very many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Church have <hi>pursued</hi> us; and I would rather have let it slept in Oblivion, than called to mind that Harsh Treatment; had it not been necessary to remember it, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it, for Confutation, to the false Pretences of one, who pretends to personate her Cause, wipe his Mouth, say what Harm have we done, and to tell the World a most Egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lye, how the <hi>Quakers</hi> have been <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,</hi> and thereby <hi>Increased.</hi> For Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, I say, I shall briefly Hint to the Sober <hi>Reader,</hi> that we have not come behind our Neighbours in Sufferings, in the several Capacities of <hi>Name, Person,</hi> and <hi>Estate,</hi> and give some short Specimen of each. And first for Sufferings in <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Fame:</hi> The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Books written against us, even from the very first, are Witnesses: For the Priesthood in many places, in the Days of our Infancy, did, not only write against us themselves, but these incouraged their Flocks, whereby there frequently came forth many Books against us; insomuch that to the Year 1660. if occasion did require, I could produce a Catalogue of many Hundreds, which is no mean Beadroll of Adversaries. And while Pens were thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd against us, Lying Tongues were not idle for Report and Fame, spoke of us in blackest Characters, from the Envious and the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, which yet hath often been of advantage; for when some in Curiosity have been inclin'd


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63041:24"/>
to see for themselves, what Monsters of Men they must needs be, of whom such ill Fame and Report did go; and have seen and found that Fame and Report false, they have been inclined to love what that was designed to have made them to hate: Nay, so general hath our Suffering in this sort been, I may say, That we have been <hi>every where spoken against.</hi> Hence it appears, that great <hi>Zeal</hi> and much <hi>Pains</hi> hath been taken to blast our Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which <hi>Increased,</hi> not by <hi>being Neglected.</hi> I shall now as briefly speak of that <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Pains,</hi> which hath been imployed against our Persons, and that in both the Branches of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>; for in both these, the Fist of Wickedness hath smote us: Many of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have died by hard and cruel Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and some by harder, and more cruel Blows; the Blood of many hath been spilt, even at our Religious Meetings, and in the Streets: Nay, such hath been the <hi>Zeal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,</hi> that by Military Force they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to <hi>Dragoon</hi> some of us to Church; which, whether learn'd from <hi>France,</hi> or taught them, it may do well to consider. And what Personal Violence could not do, hath been attempted to be done, by crowding us into Prisons, Holes and Dungeons, Suing some to Premunires and Banishment. And when all this <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Pains</hi> hath proved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, they have not <hi>Neglected</hi> to employ them both upon our Estates, that if by any


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63041:25"/>
means our <hi>Increase</hi> might be prevented: And here many Branches of Pecuniary Penalties were Inflicted, some for going to our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, some for Preaching, some for the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-House, some for not going to their Meetings, 20 l. <hi>per Mensem,</hi> Sequestrations of whole Estates, and such like: Upon all which Pretences, many Dismal and Unchristian Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zures have been made, whereby abundance have been Impoverished, and many Ruined in their Estates. Thus, <hi>Reader,</hi> Desolation hath ecchoed in all our Quarters, and possibly had taken place, had it not been prevented by the Lord, and of one or other of these Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities many Thousands of us have tasted, for our Consciencious Dissent; and that not once or twice only: No, we were not so <hi>Neglected,</hi> but were <hi>Pursued</hi> a long Series of time.</p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>Reader,</hi> our Enemies, if we were not <hi>Considerable,</hi> have made very <hi>Considerable</hi> Havock of us: And had it not been, that the safe Retreat of the Faithful, was the Power of the Lord, who covered our Heads in the Day of Battle, we must have fainted and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len long ago: But Praised be his Name, saith my Soul, in a Thankful Remembrance of that Day, The Lord did afford the Comforts of his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> which was both Strength and Encouragement to us, and did Support and give us Boldness to meet and bear what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it pleased him, to permit Men to do against us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:63041:25"/>By these short Hints, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou wilt plainly see, that our Adversary stumbles at the Threshould, makes his entrance like <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> with a Lye; in that there are not any People in <hi>England,</hi> distinguish'd by a Name, against whom more Furious (hardly the like) <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Pains</hi> hath been imployed, than against us; of which I have been unwillingly Obliged, by his Lye, to give the foregoing Account.</p>
                  <p>Page 2. <hi>It is wholly for the Love of Souls, that I have entred into this Contoversie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not likely: Nay, it is not possible, that it can be a true Christian <hi>Love to Souls,</hi> for their Preservation from Error: Or if in Error, for their Reduction and Restoration; that will deceive with Lyes, those he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to preserve, and abuse by the like, those whom he pretends to Reduce. There can be no Lying for God's sake, nor bringing of Men to his Kingdom, by that which fits them for the Devil, who was a Lyar from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>Ib. p. 2. <hi>I name many of their Principal Leaders, because I have great Charity for the Generality of the Ignorant sort of them; some of whom I know to be very Honest and Well-meaning Men, and Devout in their Way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That he names some, who for Charity and and Good Works, have been Eminent among us, is very true; the far greater part of whom are at rest from their Labours, having died


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63041:26"/>
in the Lord: And the Lot of such often is to be abused, as now by this feigned Charitable Man, who, while he says of the Generality of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they are <hi>Ignorant,</hi> is also forc'd to acknowledge, that they are <hi>Honest and Well-meaning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> how Hypocritical is this his pretended Charity, or his Assertion, which I have already notic'd, p. 23. foregoing? There he says, Our <hi>Numbers are Formidable:</hi> But here the Generality, <hi>are Ignorant, but Honest and Well-meaning.</hi> What Terror! What Frights! can be justly grounded on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing Numbers of <hi>Ignorant, but Honest and Well-meaning Men:</hi> From such as these, there is no guilded Hypocrisie (as in the <hi>Snake</hi>) to be feared, no Dishonesty, or Ill-Meaning to be expected.</p>
                  <p>Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>And therefore it is Chiefly for the sake of these, that I detect the Errors of their Leaders and Ministers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It cannot be Chiefly for the sake of these; for those this Adversary calls <hi>Leaders and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi> were more known to the Generality of <hi>Quakers,</hi> in their Lives, Conversations, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Writings, than to the <hi>Snake.</hi> The Generality of the <hi>Quakers</hi> looked, and do look on them, and their Actions, with a <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Honest,</hi> not an <hi>Evil</hi> Eye; do deservedly Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret in <hi>well-meaning</hi> all those. Now none of these the <hi>Snake</hi> can be supposed to do; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, he knew not their Lives, Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63041:26"/>
and Doctrines, tho' their Writings he may; but not bringing <hi>Honesty and Well-meaning</hi> with him, which he does acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the Generality of the <hi>Quakers</hi> have; he hath belied them in all these, and if he hath any Degree of Reason left, he could not hope to impose upon the Generality of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> contrary to their certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>Ibid. p. 2. <hi>Though they are generally thought the most Ignorant and Contemptible Sect amongst all our Dissenters: — Yet since I have perused their Books, and convers'd with some of them, I have much alter'd my Opinion, as to that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Opinion is indeed alter'd very soon; for in the forgoing Paragraph, the <hi>Generality of the Quakers,</hi> he said, were <hi>Ignorant,</hi> but <hi>Honest and Well-meaning:</hi> But that Opinion being gone, let us see what his next Opinion will be.</p>
                  <p>Ibid. p. 2. <hi>I find them to inherit the Hypocrisie, as well as Heresie of the Arrians and Socinians, who were the most subtile and hardest to be detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any of the Christian Hereticks. And the Quakers do defend themselves with the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, and even add to their Arts, as you shall see.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou see'st our Adversary will have us to have added to the Arts of the most Subtile <hi>Hereticks</hi>; and yet in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to this, he says, Page 32. that the <hi>Long and Intricate Mazes of the Romanists, in


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63041:27"/>
their pretences to Infallibility, requires no little Skill, to be able to follow them through their various Subterfuges.</hi> And then adds, <hi>But the Simplicity of our</hi> Quakers <hi>has deprived them of every one of these Helps.</hi> Great is the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, as well as Contradiction, of this Man; who one while will Represent us the most subtile in distinction, and hardest to be detected of all <hi>Hereticks</hi>; another while, so simple, as to be deprived of all the helps that others have: And yet as simple, as in pag. 32. he says we are, in pag, 3. he says, <hi>We speak Sense and English—have in a great measure reform'd from the Errors of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Quakers.</p>
                  <p>Thus, as his Mood, Humor and Occasion Changes, we are with him, either Subtile, or Simple, speak Sense, or Non-sense, Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to the hight, or in some measure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd: But after all, the <hi>Ipse Dixit</hi> of an Enemy, is neither good Argument nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, as will hereafter appear in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the several Heads of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 3. <hi>Many of them have really gone off from that hight of Blasphemy and Madness, which was professed among them at their first setting up, in the Year</hi> 1650. <hi>and so continued till after the Restauration,</hi> Anno. 1660.</p>
                  <p>What the <hi>Snake</hi> doth acknowledge is at present Sober and Christian in us, is really no other, than what he calls at our first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up, the hight of Blasphemy and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63041:27"/>
for the colourable Pretences of these, are only the spurious Brood of his own ill-forming Fancy, and as bad joyning Fingers, which have been imploy'd in Mangling the Books of our Friends (in his phraise) not unlike <hi>Rats and Moths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 3. <hi>Therefore they endeavour, all they can, to make it appear that their Doctrine was Vniform from the beginning, and that there has been no alteration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that endeavour has not been in vain, it having been often made so to appear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 4. <hi>I would perswade them, openly and above-bord to Renounce</hi> George Fox, <hi>and their first Reformers, and all their Blasphemous and Heretical Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before this be done, two things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> to examine whether what our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary calls <hi>Blasphemy</hi> and <hi>Heresie</hi> be so or not, and then to know what he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us to; for the first, hard names are no Proof: For, <hi>in the Way which some called Heresie,</hi> the Apostle did Worship God, and our Saviour himself, The <hi>Green Tree</hi> was call'd a <hi>Blasphemer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the <hi>Last,</hi> it's not Good or Safe to be at all, much less easily perswaded to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake <hi>Truth</hi> for <hi>Lying Vanities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 5. <hi>And I must say it, they give the same Proof for their extraordinary Inspirations, as the Quakers do, that is, none at all, but their own confident averring of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

This Proof the Quakers also give, and that with reason for the publick Spirit of God, privately working in the Hearts of Men, is only able to give those, in whom it does so Work, evidences of its proper effects: The Apostle is positive to the same purpose, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The things of God knoweth no Man, but by the Spirit of God.</hi> And all Inspiration of the holy Spirit, will, I doubt not, be owned to be some <hi>things</hi> of God; and of these, no Man can make a right Judgment, but by the Spirit of God: Which, who want, it is no wonder that by such this be call'd, as by the <hi>Snake, no Proof, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident averring of it:</hi> Though, I doubt not but the Sober <hi>Reader</hi> will have another sense of this Matter.</p>

               <head>SECT. I. Our Principle of the Light of Christ in Men, shewn to be Scriptural, and our Books herein agreeable thereto.</head>
               <p>THE Light preached and testified to, by us ever since we were a People, is no other than <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> the Son of the Father's Love, who, in due time was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> dwelt on the Earth, and was in all things like unto Us, Sin only excepted: Who was Crucify'd under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> died, was buried, and rose again the third Day, and ascended into Heaven. This <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> while he dwelt on Earth, preached himself the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Way</hi> to the Father; and speaking of himself to his Disciples, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. said, <hi>He Dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</hi> And of this <hi>Jesus Christ, John</hi> Testifies, <hi>He was the Word in the Beginning with God</hi>; and that this <hi>Word was God,</hi> and that in <hi>him is Life, and that Life the Light of Men</hi>; and that <hi>this Light Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> John 1.1, 4, 9. This is that Glorious Truth testified unto by us: which is not Notion; except to those only, who have barely an Historical Knowledge hereof: For to those that do reverently attend its discoveries, it is no more Notion, but a Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt Truth. With this Testimony it was, that it pleased God to send forth his Servant <hi>George Fox,</hi> who tho' despised, mean, and unlearned in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of Men; was of God made an Apostle in this Age, and hath been instrumental in his hand,


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63041:31"/>
for the directing of Thousands to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in Men. Upon which <hi>Light,</hi> as Men come to attend, it will fully teach them their Duty to God, and enable them to perform it; it will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to them a System of Principles truly Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, with more certainty than Council or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod can, not taught by it; for he is indeed a <hi>Wonderful Counsellor.</hi> And this not in Notion, not meerly Historical, No! But in Practice according to their Obedience to it. It will first, fully and truly (beyond any Casuist) shew unto Man what is his Sin; and if Man dispise not this Discovery, but close with it, it will beget in him a loathing of his Sin, and then procede, to work in him a repentance from Dead Works, which if unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will go on to sanctify him: and when Man by this Light, Spirit or Grace is sanctified, it will then witness to his Spirit, that he is justified. So will Man truly come to be redeemed. This in short, is the substance of what hath been by us declared concerning this Divine Light, Christ in Men, and which is not more than is witnessed of it in the Holy Scriptures; in the words whereof our Friends have frequently given their belief in this, as in other Articles; and that with good reason, for the Spirit of God in his Church in this Age, can well agree with the Language of the same Spirit, in, and to the Churches in the former Ages. And here I may fitly observe, that too nice expressing, and minute particularizing of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith; has been frequently one ground of <hi>Heresie,</hi> and <hi>Schism,</hi> and occasioned great distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the World: and indeed it's no wonder; that when Men forsake that teaching Grace which brings Salvation, they should set up that Earthly Wisdom, which, in matters of Faith, breeds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>

               <p>Ibid. p. 10. <hi>However I would ask them this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, Whether a man may leave that Light, without knowing that he does so? If he may, then all the Quakers have left it, for ought they know; If he cannot, then all who leave it, do it maliciously. I ask again, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Man can Sin, while he follows the Light? If he can, then that Light may lead him wrong, and so is not infallible. But if he cannot sin while he follows this Light; and cannot leave this Light without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it (as in the first Quaere) then there can be no Sin of Ignorance. Which is contrary to the Law, for there Expiations were appointed for Sins of Ignorance. And it is likewise contrary to the Gospel; for Christ tells us of those who know not their Master's Will.</hi> They know not what they do, <hi>said he of those who Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd him</hi> (Luke 23.34.) The time shall come (<hi>said he to his Apostles</hi> John 16.2.) that whosoever kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you, shall think that he doth God service. <hi>And it is said</hi> 2 Thess. 2.11. That they should believe a Lye. <hi>Christ has foretold</hi> (Mat. 6.32.) That the Light which is in some Men <hi>(that is what they take to be Light)</hi> is Darkness. <hi>And if they be so mistaken,</hi> how great is that Darkness? <hi>But there can be no such mistake as our Saviour supposes, if the Light within be infallible.</hi>—Ibid. p. 11. <hi>St.</hi> Peter

                  <hi>says to the Jews who Crucify'd Christ,</hi> I wot that through Ignorance ye did it, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.17. <hi>and St.</hi> Paul <hi>says,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. That had they known it, they would not have crucify'd the Lord of Glory.</p>

                  <hi>Reader,</hi> I have been thus large in my quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, that our Adversary might not object, that I had left out the difficult part of his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, or Arguments arising from them; but chiefly and principally, that in a matter, of so great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I might shew the great evidence of truth, and necessity there is, That man should certainly know his Duty; and knowing of it, should cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and powerfully (if he disobey not) be assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the performance of it. Wherefore to the first Question I say, Man cannot leave the Light of Christ in him, without knowing that he does so; and therefore all that do leave it are self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd. That this is true, does appear as follows: First, Our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. hath promised, that his <hi>Light should reprove the World of Sin,</hi> &amp;c. And the Apostle testifies of this Light, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.13. <hi>But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the Light; for whatsoever doth make manifest is Light.</hi> Hence it appears, that Jesus Christ by his Light does reprove for sin striving with Men, by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it unto them; and during the Day of their Visitation, by reproofs and discoveries, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for Man, to withstand and leave the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs and discoveries of this Light of Christ, without knowing that he does so. And if any Man does continue to withstand this his Day of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation, in the reproofs and discoveries of this Light, it must of necessity once come to pass as to the Jews, that it will <hi>be hid from their eyes</hi>; and in this final impenitency, they will according to Isa. 5.20. <hi>call good, evil; and evil, good</hi>; and of such the Apostle testifies, Ephes. 4.18. <hi>They are


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63041:34"/>
strangers from the life of God, through the Ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their hearts.</hi> And that 2 Thess. 2.11. <hi>They are given over to strong Delusion, to believe a lye; because they received not the Love of the Truth that they should be saved.</hi> But they were not given over to strong Delusion till they had refused the <hi>Truth,</hi> and they could not refuse <hi>the Love of it</hi> unknowingly.</p>
               <p>To the Second Quaere, <hi>Whether a Man may sin while he follows the Light?</hi> It may be safely answer'd, no! Because it is affirmed by the Apostle, Ephes. 5.9. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit (or Light) is in all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, righteousness and truth.</hi> And the Christians were advised to <hi>walk in the Light, that they might become Children of it.</hi> And if they are Children of it, they must of necessity bring forth the fruits of it, for that it is sufficient, to make Men able so to do, these Scriptures, among many others, testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.21, 22. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. And as what is said herein, is agreeable to the Gospel, so it is not contrary to the Law. Because, as the Apostle testifies, Acts 17.30. <hi>In the times of Ignorance God winked: But now he willeth all men eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where to repent.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. Tho' under <hi>the Law, which made nothing perfect,</hi> there were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifices for the Sins of Ignorance; yet now, there needeth not, for as much, as by the Gospel, the bringing in of a better hope made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For, the several Texts, urged by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, as <hi>Luke</hi> 23.24. where Christ speaking of those who crucified him, saith, <hi>They know not what they do.</hi> It is no wonder they should be so stupid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blind, when we consider the Testimony of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> concerning them, Acts 7.51. <hi>Ye always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted the Holy Ghost.</hi> And in <hi>John</hi> 16.2. where Christ foretels his Disciples, <hi>the time shall come, that whosoever killeth you, shall think they do God

service.</hi> But the <hi>Snake</hi> has left out the reason of that Ignorance, which in the next verse, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour says, is, <hi>Because they have not known my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor me.</hi> The like curtailing of the Text the <hi>Snake</hi> hath practised, with that of 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.11. where he only quotes the words, <hi>They should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lye</hi>; but left out the reason of it, which the Apostle says, was, <hi>because they received not the love of the Truth.</hi> The <hi>Snake</hi>'s Perversion of that Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.13. is very remarkable, where he quotes, <hi>That the Light which is in some Men is Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> When our Saviour said no such thing: But is here shewing of us, How that by Sin and Evil, Man becomes Darkned, and that a continuance herein leads into great Darkness; and thus words it. <hi>If thine Eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of Darkness; wherefore if the Light that is in thee, be Darkness, how great is that Darkness?</hi> The Eye is the Organ for Light: That being blinded, the whole Body is in Darkness; so in the Mind, with this addition of unhappiness, that in this Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they think they see, and therefore <hi>call good evil, and evil good.</hi> But our Saviour hath no where taught, That tho' Men should fervently, humbly and sincerely pray for the Gifts of his Grace, Light, or Spirit, that it will still be so much a Guess, so much in uncertainty, as to be possible for these, so sincerely seeking; To take the Devil for God, and his wicked Spirit, and his bad Acts for the Holy Spirit, and Innocent Life of Jesus Christ. No! It is a most abhorred imputation upon the Doctrine of our Saviour, either to suppose it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to it self, or that he who according to Mat. 28.18. <hi>Has all power in Heaven and Earth given to him,</hi> should yet be so short in his Power, or in his Good Will, that he hath not afforded to Man, a most certain and infallible Guide to that Glory,


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63041:35"/>
to which he calls him. But further, If herein, Man can without a Crime be ignorant or disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, The whole tenour of the Gospel is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, the New Covenant (<hi>Joel</hi> 2.29.) is of no force; and we may with the Apostle in another case conclude, 1 Cor. 15.14. <hi>Preaching is vain, and Faith is vain.</hi> For if the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is not an Infallible Guide to Salvation, Men are in utmost uncertainty, of what concerns them most nearly, <hi>viz.</hi> the Salvation of their Souls; and are herein more at a Guess, than they would care to be in the state of their Healths, or the titles of their Estates. But now if for <hi>Guide</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> (for it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Men should herein be <hi>certain</hi>) he will turn us to the <hi>Holy Scriptures, Traditions, Councils, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Ordinances.</hi> We shall find all of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, (even by Men of that Church this <hi>Snake</hi> says he is of) such as are not void of uncertainty, for that through ignorance, iniquity and false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, all these have been abused. So that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of absolute necessity, for all that would have an Infallible Guide to Salvation, to attend the guidings of the Spirit of God, which only can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly <hi>witness</hi> to their Spirits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Ibid. p. 11. <hi>He</hi> (G. Fox) <hi>repeats the Professor's objection against him in these words. The Apostle</hi> Paul <hi>thought to do many things against the Church, and thought he ought to do so, and the Light within did not inform his Conscience.</hi>

                     <hi>Great Mystery. p.</hi> 224.</note> and was not that within him that prickt him. The <hi>Snake</hi> crys out against this Answer, <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 11. saying, <hi>it is manifest perverting of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>; when indeed the Answer is sound, and true, as appears by the verse immediately following, Acts 9.6. <hi>And he trembling, and astonished, said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> — Which shews his inward sense of Mind. But the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. is large in the account, of the Work of his Regeneration, and he does <hi>acknowledge he was alive without the Law once: But when the Commandment came, Sin revived, and I died.</hi> Which plainly shews, the Command was inward; and it was hard for <hi>Paul</hi> to kick against this <hi>Command,</hi> which did thus <hi>slay him</hi>; as in the 11th verse. Our Adversary does acknowledge, that the <hi>Pricks,</hi> there, are to be understood the Power of Christ. And this Power it was, Acts 2.37. <hi>That prickt them at the heart,</hi> who were witnesses of the sheddings abroad of the Spirit at the time of Pentecost. And of this Power <hi>David</hi> speaks, Psal. 73.21. <hi>Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</hi> Whence, thus in short, <hi>Paul,</hi> a zealous Man, and a Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,

is by the Power of Christ let see, that he was opposing his Power in his Saints, by such Persecution. At this in the Apostle's language, <hi>Sin revived,</hi> i. e. the sense of it, whereby he saw his guiltiness, and then he died; from any further Life in it. And whether this be not a heart work, all experienced <hi>Readers</hi> may judge.</p>

               <p>I Shall here, consider and reply, to his Second and Third Sections together, the Charge being the same, and the distinction unnecessary: For in his mode of speaking, a <hi>Sameness of Person and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> imply an <hi>Equality</hi>; concerning which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I procede to the Quotations in the <hi>Snake,</hi> I shall observe to thee, Friendly <hi>Reader</hi>; That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the beginning of the foregoing Section, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a brief but real and true account of our Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural Belief concerning <hi>The Light of Christ in Men.</hi> Shewing that the Soul of Man, being subjected thereunto; he may by the guidance and assistance thereof, (without it he cannot) attain unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: I say, having shewn thus much, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our belief herein; it is impossible, that we, so believing, as we do, should make our Souls (to use his phrase) of the <hi>same Person and Substance with God,</hi> or <hi>Aspire to an Equality with him.</hi> Our Friends, according to Holy Writ, have frequently said and writ, and may safely; That those, who by <hi>walking in the Light, are become Children of it:</hi> are such for whom our Saviour Jesus Christ did pray to his Father, John 17.21, 22, 23. <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee: That they also may be one in us; That they may be one, even as we are one. I in them, and thou in

me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know, that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</hi> This <hi>Oneness</hi> in the Holy Spirit, our Friends have pressed, and contended for; in Opposition to the hurtful belief that had too much prevailed upon Men; of an imagined Distance of God from Man at this Day: and that Man, was now no more to expect the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Holy Spirit, without which, our Saviour hath testified, Mat. 11.27. <hi>And no Man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any Man the Father but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</hi> This testimony of Jesus Christ, with many more to the same purpose, do shew the certainty of Revelation, as in many others, the absolute necessity of it is shewn. <hi>First,</hi> By our Saviour, who saith, John 12.50. <hi>And I know that this Commandment is Life Everlasting</hi> —and the Apostle 2 Cor. 13.5. — <hi>Know ye not your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you except you be Reprobates?</hi> And for our acknowledging to, and witnessing of the truth of these Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, declared in Holy Writ, have we met with great opposition, and misrepresentation, of which, <hi>Reader,</hi> there follows now divers instances in these Sections of the <hi>Snake's,</hi> which he thus begins, <hi>p.</hi> 13.
<q>Thou sayest (says <hi>G. Fox</hi> to his Opponet, <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 247.) Christ doth not dwell in them <hi>Personally.</hi> Doth not Christ dwell in his Saints, as he is in the <hi>Person</hi> of the Father, the <hi>Substance</hi>?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> This our Adversary gives for a quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>G. Fox</hi> his <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> and that we might see, at what he carps, he puts it in Large Black Characters, which yet are not blacker than his Envy and Injustice; which will appear thus. <hi>First,</hi> In that he hath left out the Priests Words,


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63041:37"/>
which are unsound and unscriptural. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that he hath left out the beginning and end of <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Answer. For thy more certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which, I subjoin, first the Priest's Words, and then <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Answer.</p>
               <p>Priest. <hi>The Scriptures are the Word, except y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>u dare to deny Christ is God. Let the Word of God (meaning the Scripture) dwell in you richly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>G. Fox</hi> thus Answers.
<q>So he makes the Scripture Christ, and God: and he doth not say, <hi>Let Christ dwell in you</hi>; but means the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and God dwells in you: The Apostle saith, <hi>Let Christ Dwell in your hearts by faith</hi>; and God will dwell in you: But thou sayst, Christ doth not dwell in Them Personally. Doth not Christ dwell in his Saints, as he is in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Father, the Substance? And are they not of his Flesh, and of his Bone?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou mayst see, that the plain meaning, and drift of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s words, are to assert and maintain, that <hi>Spiritual Oneness</hi> of which I have been speaking and shewing, that Christ prayed, that his Followers might witness; and not to make the Soul of <hi>the same Person and Substance</hi> with God, as the <hi>Snake</hi> suggests. But to proceed; We have found the <hi>Snake</hi> biting off the Beginning and End of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s words in the former Quotation; in the next place we shall find him false quoting him. But here he is pleased to give the Priest's words truly as they stand, <hi>p.</hi> 13. thus, <hi>There is a kind of infiniteness in the Soul, but it cannot be infiniteness in it self.</hi> Against this <hi>G. Fox</hi> disputes, <hi>And no kind of infiniteness will serve his turn, but infiniteness in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which is the Infiniteness of God alone: For he only has Infinity in himself, as not being given by any other.</hi> Thus the <hi>Snake's</hi> Remark, and now his Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:63041:38"/>
                  <hi>Is not the Soul (says</hi> G. Fox) <hi>without Beginning? Hath this a Beginning or Ending? And is it not infinite in it self, and more than all the World?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the <hi>Snake</hi> gives for a Quotation from <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 90. when, as by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will appear, they are only Sentences, standing at considerable distance in that Book, and packt together in his: and being so packt, by him, are urged to prove what <hi>G. Fox</hi> never said. The place in <hi>Great Mystery</hi> is thus,
<q>Is not the Soul without Beginning, coming from God, returning unto God again, who hath it in his hand? Which hand goes against him that does evil, which throws down that which wars against it: And Christ the Power of God, the Bishop of the Soul, which brings it up into God, which came out from him. Hath this (<hi>viz.</hi> the Power, he means) a Beginning or Ending? And is not this (<hi>viz.</hi> the Power, as before) infinite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> it self, and more than all the World?</q>
Thus <hi>G. Fox,</hi> the meaning of whose words is no other than thus; Christ the Power of God, and Bishop of the Soul, who can only bring the Soul into acceptance with God, is infinite in his Power, and greater than all the World; which plain sense of the place is vastly different from the perversion of this Nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Quotation in <hi>p.</hi> 14. He makes from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 91. and gives it thus, <hi>Christ brings the Soul up into God, from whence it came, whereby they come to be one Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This like the Last, is miserably false quoted: The place in <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> standing thus;
<q>So every one being turned to the Light, which Christ the Second <hi>Adam</hi> hath enlightned them withal, they shall see, Christ the Bishop of their Souls, the Power of God, which is immortal, and


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63041:38"/>
brings the Immortal Soul in, to the Immortal God. Christ the Sanctification, who sanctifies their Bodies and Spirits, and brings the Soul up into, from whence it came, whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one Soul.</q>
Thus <hi>G. Fox,</hi> who herein is very plain, shewing how the Work of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is began and carried on, till the Soul arrive at that Spiritual Marriage-Union, and Oneness; for which our Saviour prayed, that the Saints might witness.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Quotation, p. 14. is from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 229. Thus, <hi>Who are come up into the Bishop Christ, are one Soul.</hi> To which he goes on, and adds, tho' cut off by this <hi>Snake, They know the hand of God which the Soul lives in.</hi> And it is doubtless very true, for whosoever, through obedience to the Holy Spirit, comes to be one in Christ, do certainly know his Power, by which that Work is wrought, and in which they live.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake's</hi> next Quotation in <hi>p.</hi> 14. is from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 273. thus, <hi>It is not horrid Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to say, the Soul is a part of God, for it came out of him; and that which came out of him, is of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this the <hi>Snake</hi> says, Fox <hi>does not say, that the Soul came from God, that is, God Created it: But that it came of God, as a part of God, his Substance, Person and Essence.</hi> But it is very false, for <hi>G. Fox</hi> does not so say, nor does his words import more than that it is created by God; and the Last words, which next follow, and which the <hi>Snake</hi> hath bit off, do shew as much: For <hi>G. Fox</hi> saith, <hi>it rejoyceth in him</hi>; and so certainly every regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Soul does.</p>
               <p>But for further proof that <hi>G. Fox</hi> did not mean more, or other, than that the Soul was created, and that such was his belief, see in the same Book, <hi>p.</hi> 337. where speaking of the Soul, his words are


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63041:39"/>
these;
<q>God breathed into Man the Breath of Life, and he became a living Soul, who hath all Souls in his hand, and the Soul is Immortal; and Christ the Bishop of it is Immortal, and God hath it in his hand, which goeth against him that doth evil, whose hand is Immortal: But Man transgressing the Command of God, the Soul lies in Death: So Christ is the Bishop of the Souls, and they that come to know Christ, their Souls rejoice in God their Saviour, <hi>Luke.</hi> 1.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>G. Fox</hi> hath very fully and expresly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Judgment in words unexceptionable to the Cavils of the <hi>Snake,</hi> and contrary to his false insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations: Now in that I have brought another Quotation in the same Book, to put out of doubt <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s meaning in the former: I have herein used a rule which the <hi>Snake</hi> lays down, p. 195. viz. <hi>To hear</hi> G. Fox <hi>explain himself in other places of the same Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Quotation, p. 14. is from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 100. where he hath only taken these words (which I take to be wrong printed) of a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.
<q>Is not this of God's Being; <hi>when in the Book it self it is thus?</hi> And is not that which came out from God, which God hath in his hand, taken up into God again, which Christ the Power of God is the Bishop of, is not this <hi>(Divine Life of the Soul)</hi> of God's being?</q>
By the context of which words, it is plain <hi>G. Fox</hi> means no more than as is above observed from p. 337.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Quotation, p. 14. is from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 248. Whence the <hi>Snake</hi> does, but not fully give the Priest's words, which in that Book are these.</p>
               <p>Priest. <hi>It is a false thing to say Christ's Person is in Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which the following answer (at which the <hi>Snake</hi> cavils) is made by <hi>G. Fox,</hi> which is as much


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63041:39"/>
as to say,
<q>None are of his Flesh, or of his Bone, nor eat it, nor had his Substance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From which words, I think, nothing is plainer, than that the Answer is Scriptural, and the sense of it Spiritual, as see <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.30, 32. <hi>John</hi> 6.63.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Quotation in p. 14. is from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 207. in which he hath not given the Priest's Words, nor but part of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; but I shall give both for the greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Truth.</p>
               <p>Priest. <hi>God hath a Christ distinct from all other beings whatsoever, whether they be Spirits or Bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. Fox.</hi>
                  <q>God's Christ is not distinct from his Saints, nor their Bodies; for he is within them, nor distinct from their Spirits, for their Spirits wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness him: <hi>And God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself,</hi> who is the head of every Creature; and there is not any Creature, but it's manifest in his sight; and he is in the Saints, and they eat his Flesh, and sit with him in heavenly places.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This, <hi>Reader,</hi> is so plain Scripture; that it would raise an inquiry, how envy it self cloaked with pretences to Christianity, should carp at it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Quotation, p. 14. is from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 88. Christ is the Elect. The <hi>Reader</hi> may easily suppose <hi>G. Fox</hi> said more; but the <hi>Snake</hi> thinking, from these, to draw some unsound sense left the rest behind him: In which he being abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly mistaken, I shall not trouble the <hi>Reader</hi> with a larger Quotation, but only observe, that the Evangelical Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> 42.1. saith of Christ, <hi>Behold my Servant, whom I uphold, mine Elect in whom my Soul delighteth.</hi> And the Holy Apostle speaking of Christ, saith, 1 Pet. 2.6. <hi>Wherefore it is contained in the Scripture, behold I lay in</hi> Zion, <hi>a Chief Corner Stone Elect and Precious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:63041:40"/>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Quotation in p. 14. is from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 310.
<q>That they who are of the Faith, are the Flesh of Christ, the Flesh of him who suffered.</q>
                  <hi>Here he has false quoted G. Fox</hi>'s <hi>words, which are these.</hi>
                  <q>No Man knows (<hi>that is savingly</hi>) the seed <hi>(Christ)</hi> that was offered, the Sacrifice of the whole World, but as he knows it within, through the Faith; and who are of the Faith, they are of <hi>Abraham:</hi> They are of the Flesh of Christ, the Flesh of him that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</q>
The Apostle says as much, and says true, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30.</p>
               <p>I have now done with all the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his second Section; in which, <hi>Reader,</hi> I doubt not but thou wilt observe the great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of the <hi>Snake</hi> in several kinds; as first in false quoting <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s words, which is a practice so base, that it is impossible it can consist with a fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of being herein concerned in Love to the Souls of those he would pretend to preserve or reduce. No, it is a practice directly opposite to all pretences of Humane Justice; and it cannot be less, but rather more, to pretend to do it for God's sake. Next, his Injustice is not less, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the sense and meaning of the places, which he truly quotes; by cavilling at, and giving ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, quite contrary to the plain sense of the Writer. For it is very plain, that the whole scope of all the Passages hitherto quoted, are such as have relation to the Spiritual <hi>Vnion,</hi> and <hi>Oneness</hi> of Christ with his People. Which both Christ himself, and his Holy Apostles have very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held forth to us by Similies, which fall under the notice of sense; that thereby mankind, might more readily come to apprehend them: Thus Christ said, <hi>I am the Vine, I am the Door, and except ye eat my Flesh, and drink my Blood,</hi> &amp;c. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63041:40"/>
we are of his Flesh, and of his Bone, with abundance more such like expressions; which, if in a litteral sense were to be expounded: Such expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition would be plain perversion, and against it our Saviour hath given a Caution; <hi>The words that I speak, they are Spirit, and they are life,</hi> John 6.63.</p>
               <p>Snake p. 15. <hi>I will tell you before I go, Mr.</hi> Penn's <hi>excuse for</hi> G. Fox <hi>in all these particulars. He lays it upon</hi> George<hi>'s extream Ignorance.</hi> For Proof of this the <hi>Snake</hi> quotes <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s invalidity of <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, p. 353. where <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s words are only these, <hi>He</hi> (G. F.) <hi>observes no nicety of expression in his Writings, and it is therefore disingenuously done of any to make this ill use of his plain and vulgar phrases.</hi> See, <hi>Reader,</hi> how apt this Man is to tell lies; for <hi>W. Penn</hi> lays it not on (nor does not say it was) his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Innorance: But <hi>W. Penn</hi> lays the fault upon <hi>J. Faldo's</hi> extream disingenuity, as I now do upon the <hi>Snake</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>Snake, p. 15. <hi>An indifferent Man would rather have said</hi> Ne Sutor ultra crepidam —<hi>That this</hi> Fox <hi>should rather have kept to his original Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here, <hi>Reader,</hi> see this Man's contempt, by a Profane Jest, upon the meanness of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. What would he have said to <hi>Amos</hi> the Herdsman, <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Fishermen, and the rest of those Holy Men, whose mechanick Occupations were no hinderance to the High Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Church, to which God called them: It is not unlikely, that from men Spirited as this <hi>Snake,</hi> their Entertainment was, <hi>Ne Sutor, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this need not trouble us, since we find that <hi>G. Fox,</hi> where he speaks of the Soul (as in the places before severally quoted) doth speak so distinctly of it, as that he neither declares it to be God or Christ; nor doth he confound the Being of Man, with the Infinite Being of his Creator, as is falsly


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63041:41"/>
charged by this Adversary. <hi>G. Fox</hi> hath frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said to this purpose, (and it is very true) that the Spirit of Man is illuminated with a divine Light from God, through the mediation of Jesus Christ: But he hath never said, that the Spirit of Man was God. No, he could not so say: but by wilful perversion, this Adversary (as some former ones) perverts as well as mis-quotes him, and will not have him to mean as his words plainly speak: For when he speaks of the Soul of Man, both with respect to its original Life, as breathed from God; and degenerated through disobedience, and also with respect to his spiritual Restoration, by the Power and Spirit of his Creator, and hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon shewn; how that the Soul through disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the Power that Created it, became estran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and at enmity to it; and that this enmity and wall of Separation could not be broken down, and the Soul brought into the Love and Favour of God, but by Christ, who in Holy Writ is declared the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and Shepherd. Our Adversaries have then often perverted his words, and would have them to mean, (which they cannot) That the <hi>Infinite Essence</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> (with other the like terms) of the Life of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Christ,</hi> were the Soul of Man. But these perversions are our Adversaries, and as of <hi>G. Fox:</hi> So of all owned by us, it never was believed by us, that the Soul of Man was the <hi>same Person and Substance with God,</hi> as is most falsly charged by this <hi>Snake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to the <hi>Snake</hi>'s third Section, Of the Quakers <hi>aspiring,</hi> &amp;c. which he says, p. 17. <hi>is in effect proved already</hi>; but yet he bestows nine pages upon it, of which great part is taken up in Quotations, which I shall consider in their order.</p>
               <p>The first in p. 17. is from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 282.
<q>For Christ (says he) makes no distinction in his


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63041:41"/>
words, but saith, <hi>Be ye perfect as your Heavenly Father is</hi> — And as he is, so are we; and that which is perfect, as he is perfect, is in equality the same.</q>
In this Quotation, that the <hi>Snake</hi> might bring the parts of it together, as near as well he could, he hath made a break for another Text, which <hi>G. Fox</hi> used, <hi>viz. And be ye merciful as he is.</hi> And after all his carping, it is the Doctrine preached by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and mostly in his words, <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.36. and the last Scripture <hi>G. Fox</hi> there mentions does shew, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17. To which he might have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded those other Texts, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.6.3.3.7. where we are exhorted, <hi>to walk, even as he walked, to purify our selves even as he is pure, and to be righteous as he is righteous.</hi> Which exhortations it is impossible to witness fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; otherwise than by the Assistance of the Holy Spirit, which as <hi>G. Fox</hi> saith, is in equality with God. And the Expressions being Scriptural, it need not trouble us that he is angry: Nor do we, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did we understand these expressions in Holy Writ above-mentioned, otherwise than to relate to the Operations of the Holy Spirit in men. For we never imagined that ever any Man or Woman can be, <hi>even as God is,</hi> or <hi>even as Christ is, quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> God and Christ.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snakes</hi> next Quotation, p. 17. is from Saul<hi>'s Errand to</hi> Damascus, p. 8. <hi>He that hath the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that raised up Jesus from the Dead is equal with God.</hi> Which is (as declared by <hi>G. F.</hi> at his Trial, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after mentioned) to the purpose before, for when Men are guided by the Holy Spirit, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly guided by God: For the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one God, and therefore equal, and <hi>that which is equal,</hi> as <hi>G. Fox</hi> often expresses it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Quotation, p. 18. is from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 248.
<q>All that have the Son and Holy Ghost, have that which is Equal in Power and Glory with the Father.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:63041:42"/>This Quotation, <hi>Reader,</hi> is another instance of the great insincerity of this adversary, in that he hath placed the words here, as spoken and asserted by <hi>G. Fox</hi> (which yet are sound and true) but they were not otherwise than thus. The <hi>Priest</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni'd the Revelation of Christ in Man, otherwise than by Adoption, and his (<hi>Christ</hi>'s) Equality with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: in answer to this <hi>G. Fox</hi> mentions that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in the Assemblies Catechism, <hi>The Holy Ghost and Son are equal in Substance, Power and Glory with the Father</hi>; and then thus queries (not asserts, tho' it be true) <hi>what? Then all that have, &amp;c.</hi> See the Readiness of this Man to misrepresent things.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Step, p. 18. is, to whom he floutingly calls the Renowned <hi>Francis Howgil, who he says is yet more express in this Blasphemy, if more can be.</hi> His quotation from <hi>F. Howgil,</hi> p. 232. of his Works is,
<q>The first thing thy dark Mind stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at (<hi>says he to his Opponent</hi> Edward Dodd) is that some have said, they that have the Spirit of God, are equal with God. He that hath <hi>(i. e. obeyeth)</hi> the Spirit of God, is <hi>in</hi> that <hi>(Holy Ghost)</hi> which is equal with God.</q>
The same says the Scriptures, and the same says the Catechism, as I have just now noted; but <hi>F. Howgil</hi> goes on.
<q>He that is joined to the Lord, is one Spirit; there is unity, and the unity stands in equality it self; there is equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Nature, tho' not in Stature.</q>
And now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the <hi>Snake</hi> can say against it, it is agreeable to those several Texts of Scripture, quoted p. 49, 50. foregoing, and also to many others, tho' a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery to Men, not regenerated.
<q>And therefore <hi>F. Howgil</hi> goes on, and <hi>bids learn</hi> what these things mean, the Understanding and the Learned will know what I say, and this is neither damnable nor blasphemous, but on the contrary, it's sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and precious to them that believe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:63041:42"/>The next, <hi>Reader,</hi> is another Instance of the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Injustice, in urging against us, a Book writ by one <hi>R. Gordon,</hi> an open Enemy, taking no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice at all of any Answer of ours, in which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice I have already detected him in p. 48. fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going and shall have occasion hereafter, and therefore shall not say more of it here, nor take notice at present of the passages he urges from that Book, which yet the sober and unprejudic'd Reader cannot call a leaping over it, because not urged upon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Authority.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Quotation, in p. 18. is from <hi>Saul</hi>'s Errand, p. 7, 8. <hi>Jesus Christ, the Mystery passed before: The same Spirit now, takes upon it the same Seed, where it is manifested.</hi> What pray? is this more than to say, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, to day, and for ever; and is sound and true? For they who obey his words, do know of his Doctrine, and they do experience him, to be the same he ever was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Snake</hi> p. 19. <hi>Having thus shewn the Quotations of the Quakers, out of their printed Books. I will now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove my Charge in Legal Form against them, by Evidence upon Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having hitherto detected the <hi>Snake</hi> in false quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our Books, and perverting the plain Sense and Meaning of them; so as it is obvious to the intelligent <hi>Reader.</hi> I shall now examine and detect his <hi>Legal Form,</hi> but first will shew what it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Snake</hi> p. 19. <hi>Which you will find in a Book printed</hi> 1653. <hi>Entituled,</hi> A Brief Relation of the Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Northern Quakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here, <hi>Reader,</hi> Is the <hi>Snake</hi>'s <hi>Legal Form</hi>; A Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, writ by professed Adversaries; (like the <hi>Snake</hi>) which pretends to give an account of two or three Trials of <hi>G. Fox</hi> and <hi>J. Nayler</hi> for Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63041:43"/>
and what is in this related, the <hi>Snake</hi> says is <hi>proved</hi> by evidence upon Oath. When indeed it is only a great Argument of the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Ignorance or Malice (I rather think the last) to call a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Pamphlet a Legal Form. A Charge of Fact done many years past, and brought to Trial in Courts of Justice, cannot be said to be prov'd in <hi>Legal Form,</hi> if the Conviction of the accused cannot be proved by the Records of the Court. Which I defy the <hi>Snake</hi> to produce. Nay he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, because the Parties were discharged from their Accusations, the Evidence proving insufficient against them.</p>
               <p>And now for the <hi>Snake,</hi> (in his own Language) <hi>Boldly and Impudently</hi> to give the Lye to the Judge of the Assize: or other Magistrates before whom these Charges of Blasphemy were brought against <hi>G. Fox</hi> and <hi>J. Nayler,</hi> and to say it was proved, when it was not, argues Impudence towards the Magistrates, but Villany towards the memory of the Accused: For had it been proved, they must have been convict, and have suffered the demerits of Blasphemy: And all this would have been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on record. But besides this, one grand and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lye of the <hi>Snake</hi>'s, <hi>viz. That the Charge was proved</hi>; there is in <hi>His Legal Form</hi> many other Lyes, which I shall detect as I come at them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Snake</hi> p. 19, 20. <hi>There</hi> (the <hi>Snake</hi> directs to that Lying Pamphlet) p. 2, and 3. <hi>You have an account how</hi> G. Fox <hi>did avow himself over and over to be equal with God: being asked by Dr.</hi> Marshal, <hi>in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Mr.</hi> Sawro, <hi>Col.</hi> Tell <hi>and Col.</hi> West, <hi>Justices of the Peace in the County of</hi> Lancaster, <hi>at a Private Sessions in the Town of</hi> Lancaster, <hi>whether or no he was equal with God, as before that time he had been heard to affirm? His Answer was this, I am equal with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:63041:43"/>Pray, <hi>Reader,</hi> observe, had this been true, that <hi>G. Fox</hi> had so answered as the <hi>Snake</hi> says he did in the presence of three Justices, what need was there for <hi>Marshal</hi> and <hi>Altam</hi> to swear it against him? since the Justices, if they had heard it themselves, might have convicted him thereof upon their own personal hearing, without other evidence. Or how likely is it that Col. <hi>West</hi> and <hi>Tho. Tell,</hi> both Justices upon the Bench at this Tryal should sign a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> (which both of them did) for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittal: if either of them had heard him say the words charged? Or how could he have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged for want of another Evidence, when his Adversaries might have brought in the three Justices against him, had it been true, that they had heard him themselves? But besides there are two Lyes in this Paragraph; the first is, There was not any Justice of the Peace, or Colonel named <hi>Tell.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>G. Fox</hi> did not answer that he was equal with God. But thus it was; There were Eight several Charges against him; the fourth of which was, <hi>that he had said he was equal with God</hi>; which, being asked in Court, He made the following answer. <hi>G. Fox,</hi> That was not so spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by me: <hi>But he that sanctifieth, and he that is sanctified, is all of one,</hi> Heb. 2.11. It is God and Christ that sanctifieth; and the Saints are all one in the Father and the Son, <hi>They are of his Bone, and of his Flesh,</hi> Ephes. 5.30. And the Father and the Son are one, <hi>and they are the Sons of God,</hi> Gal. 4.6. <hi>And as they that are joyned to the Lord are one Spirit, so they that are joyned to an Harlot, are one Flesh,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.16, 17. This the Scriptures witnesseth, and I witness. This Answer is Scriptural, and is directly opposite to what he was then charged with, as it also is to what the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Pamphleteer, says he did then answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:63041:44"/>
                  <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 20. <hi>This Blasphemy hath been attested up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath, by the aforesaid Dr.</hi> Marshal, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, <hi>School Master at</hi> Lancaster, <hi>before the Justices at the last Sessions held at</hi> Appleby, <hi>the</hi> 8<hi>th of</hi> Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 1652. <hi>and before Judge</hi> Puleston <hi>at the last As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sizes held at</hi> Lancaster, <hi>the</hi> 18<hi>th of</hi> March 1652.</p>
               <p>This is false in both the parts of it. For <hi>G. Fox</hi> had not any Tryal at any Sessions in <hi>Appleby,</hi> in the year 52. Nor had he any Tryal before Judge <hi>Puleston,</hi> or any other Judge, at any Assize held in <hi>Lancaster,</hi> in the year 1652. These notorious Lyes I charge upon the <hi>Snake,</hi> let him clear himself if he can. But for the <hi>Readers</hi> satisfaction and information, I shall briefly say, <hi>G. Fox</hi> was at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in <hi>Lancaster,</hi> in the year 1652. (at which time was upon the Bench, with others, as Justices of the Peace, <hi>Tho. Tell</hi> and <hi>Will. West</hi>) called to answer to Eight Articles of Blasphemy, <hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, by Three Witnesses, <hi>viz. Altam</hi> (but <hi>Marshal</hi> did not swear) <hi>Birkett</hi> and <hi>Attkinson,</hi> (this last a young Lad) which Charge the Evidence did swear was gathered by them, from words spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by him at a Meeting some time before. But when to the several particulars, they were by the Bench severally interrogated, they were confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; insomuch, that <hi>Birkett</hi> said, <hi>he could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer directly; but the other could say it.</hi> To which the Bench reply'd, Have you charged the Prisoner upon your Oath, and now say, <hi>He can say it?</hi> It seems you did not hear these words spoken your self. To this Confusion of the Evidence, was also added the Testimonies of many People, who had been at that Meeting where the words were charged to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and did then declare in the open Sessions, that no such words as those charged were then spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by <hi>G. Fox.</hi> Besides all this, <hi>G. Fox</hi> did then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self go through all the several Eight Articles of

his Charge, and shewed his Scriptural Belief, in opposition to the Blasphemies they had sworn. By which means the matter issued thus; a <hi>Superse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> was granted against a Writ which had gone out for his apprehending, tho' he was not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended upon it, but came voluntarily to this Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to answer his Enemies false Charges.</p>
               <p>Besides this, <hi>G. Fox</hi> had no Tryal at <hi>Appleby</hi> or <hi>Lancaster,</hi> nor at any Assize at all in <hi>Lancaster.</hi> in 1652. Thus, <hi>Reader,</hi> the <hi>Snake</hi>'s <hi>Legal Form</hi> is false, both in matter and form: and himself by these his Lyes, must be scandalous, much below the dignity of a Pleni-Potent, which by a ridiculous assurance he arrogates; when in p. 336. He pretends <hi>to demand reparation in the Name of the Church of</hi> England: By what Name must he be now impleaded, whose <hi>Legal Form</hi> has only served to shew that he is Truly proved a Lyar? But the <hi>Snake</hi> has not yet done with his <hi>Legal Form, Ibid.</hi> p. 20. p. 3. (He refers to the Brief Relation.) <hi>It is likewise witnessed, That</hi> James Naylor <hi>affirmed, That he was as Holy, Just and Good, as God himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, it was so witnessed, but falsly; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>James Naylor</hi> was conven'd at <hi>Appleby</hi> Sessions in <hi>January</hi> 1652. The Evidence proving insufficient, he was acquitted, and did by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers he gave to the Questions, put to him by the Bench, in matters of Religion, shew himself nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Blasphemer, or Heretick, as was charged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 21. <hi>These Monstrous Blasphemies occasioned a Petition from the Gentlemen of that County, to the then Council of State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Forbear Lying, It was not monstrous Blasphemy, but monstrous Disappointment did occasion that Petition. For when <hi>G. Fox</hi> and <hi>J.

Naylor:</hi> And of these <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning Gentlemen,</hi> there were of the Priesthood much about the number mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.21.

And this is done in that Book, in terms so express and plain, as leaves no room for doubt, unless to such whom nothing will satisfie. For to each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Objection, he gives a distinct Answer; and that in Scriptures quoted for that purpose. But this same Adversary seems to be dissatisfied with such Answer; as no doubt he would have been with that of our Saviour to the Captious <hi>Jews, Mark</hi> 11.33. and 12.17. and with many others of the like kind, which he may be pleased to say, are not in <hi>terms sufficiently express and plain.</hi>

                  <hi>turned from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan to the Power of God:</hi> To which Power of God, as they did attend and grow up in, they were the Living Seals of his Ministry.

               <p>In this one Quotation, here is a twofold falshood: First Forgery, next false Quoting. For the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery it is this; These first words [But the rest of the World] are not <hi>G.

That the falshood and injustice of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary may appear clearly to the impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I here subjoin the place as it is in the page quoted.
<q>The Spirit of God (in the Apostles) being witnessed, it opens the Scriptures, is the Key, lets to see what hath been since the days of the Apostles, and rul'd, and reign'd, and had the Dominion: The Wolf in Sheeps Clothing, which have deceived the Nations, such as have led the World, and brought them all upon heaps, and have never heard the Voice of God, and have published it to the Nation in Print, nor the voice of Christ, and have not the same Infallible Spirit as the Apostles had, and no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation nor Inspiration as they had.</q>
Thus far <hi>G. Fox,</hi> whose words are sound: For first it is certain, that the Spirit of God does not only


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63041:52"/>
open the Scriptures. But will also discover the Devourer, and Wolf. This discovering Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, our Saviour hath testified is in his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in that; <hi>A Stranger they will not follow.</hi> And it is as certain, that Men guided by this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Spirit, have often brought heaps of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. And lastly, I take it for granted, That such who publish to the Nation, that they have never heard the Voice of God, nor Christ, have not the Holy Spirit, nor its immediate teachings; and it is no wonder, they have it not, for God hath said, that <hi>his Spirit should not always strive with Man</hi>; and he who resisteth the Day of small things, and through the Crowds of Temptations and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, will not hearken nor hear, the fault is his own.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 30. Quoted from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 321. <hi>Revelation is now witnessed in our days, as it was in the Apostles, but not amongst you, who have inwardly ravened from the Spirit of God, which have Apostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed from the Apostles.—And so you be in the Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Devilish, that expects not that now, which was in the Days of the Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Quotation which the <hi>Snake</hi> hath jumbled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, only with the small distinction of a break, Is, as it lies in the Book, <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> two Answers, to things severally asserted, by a Priest <hi>(Josias Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker)</hi> at <hi>Bransprith Castle, Durham.</hi> The first part of the Quotation, to the Break, is part of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Answer to this following Assertion of the Priest's. <hi>Immediate Revelation, or Inspiration is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in these days.</hi> To this false Assertion, the words of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> quoted above by the <hi>Snake,</hi> are a proper Answer; because as <hi>G. Fox,</hi> in the same Answer shews, (tho' left out by the <hi>Snake</hi>) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Saviour's words; <hi>None knows the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63041:53"/>
save the Son; and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</hi> which Doctrine, whosoever shall deny, are most certainly ravened from the Spirit of God, and Apostatized from the Apostles.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Priest, <hi>Dorker,</hi> did affirm it <hi>to be needless, and also Diabolical (that is to say De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velish) to expect any such thing now.</hi> To this, the Latter part of the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Quotation, is also part of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Answer; which Answer is true: As for [Diabolical and Devilish] they are the Priest's own words, and were fittly by retorsion, given to the Priest. And it is a great indication, that Men are in that Spirit themselves, which is Devilish; when they call Good, Evil; and Evil, Good: and tell the World that that is needless, or not to be expected now, which is the Covenant of the <hi>New Testament.</hi> And here, <hi>Reader,</hi> is another Mark of that foul Hypocrisie and Envy which is in this our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary; who pretends to quote the Offices and Services of the <hi>Church of England</hi> for proof, that <hi>Inspiration</hi> is believed and prayed for, and which he would have taken as an Argument, that himself does so believe and pray: Yet here he is angry with <hi>G. Fox</hi> for telling the Priests that they were ravened from the Spirit of God, even then, when they told the People, Inspiration was not now to be expected. How will the <hi>Snake</hi> winde this into any agreement?</p>
               <p>Himself says, Inspiration is to be expected and prayed for. The Priests whom <hi>G. Fox</hi> answered, said, It is not to be expected, nor prayed for: Nay, they said more, that it is Diabolical to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it now. See, <hi>Reader,</hi> the Confusion of these Our Adversaries, of former and later times. Who, no doubt, pretended to be true, both now and then, tho' quite contrary now, to what they were then. But if the Doctrine be true now, how comes <hi>G. Fox</hi>


                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:63041:53"/>
to be blame-worthy for asserting it then, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them then, that such who denyed it, were ravened from the Spirit of God. And after all the Daubing Hypocrisie of this <hi>Snake,</hi> let him shew if he can, that such who deny this Doctrine (which is essential to Salvation) do not thereby shew themselves ravened, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Ibid. p. 30. Quoted from p. 30. of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the <hi>Westmoreland Petition. If ever you own the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles, you will own our Writings, which are given forth by the same Spirit and Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Liberty which this Adversary takes to himself, is very great; sometimes supplying to our words what he is pleased to think they want, as at other times, to bite and curtail them. And to shew thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> what Supplements he gives to our words; take the place as it is in <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Answer, <hi>&amp;c. If ever you own the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles, you will own them, which are given forth by the same Spirit and Power.</hi> And it is very true; for whosoever shall write from the movings of the Spirit, and grace of God upon his heart, tho' in the least manifestation thereof, them Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, so written, cannot fail of being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in their Degree: By all, who through the Spirit of God, are led to own the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles. And the Reason is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every Member, partakes of the same Spirit, by which the whole Body and Church (of Christ) is kept living. And it is impossible for the Holy Spirit, in one Member, to contradict the same Spirit in the rest of the Body. Thus, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou may plainly see, that that Sinless Perfection, maintained in our Books, which the <hi>Snake</hi> carps at, misrepresents, and wilfully lyes against, is no other than the Perfection of the Holy Spirit, and which


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63041:54"/>
is no further Ours, than we walk in obedience to that Spirit; by Obedience to which, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle hath testified, 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>That by escaping the Corruption that is in the World through Lust, we may be made partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi> It were a foul and false imputation upon this Doctrine of the Apostles, to suggest that he hereby advised the true Believers to pretend to any such equality of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that of God; who in his Wisdom and Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is Infinite. God hath promised to his People, <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16. And all who do witness this Holy In-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God, must of necessity say, and confess, that he is able to give a perfect Deliverance and Freedom from Sin. But have not, nor cannot say, That they are <hi>God,</hi> or they are <hi>Christ,</hi> because of the In-dwelling of the Holy Spirit; never did any of us so say, as falsly suggested by the <hi>Snake,</hi> which in reply to the foregoing quotations, doth (I think) evidently appear.

That this may appear more plain to the Sober Reader, I will shew the vast difference between us and them herein. The Papists, how much soever they differ among themselves, in placing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in their Church; as whether in the <hi>Pope,</hi> and in him Simply, or in him in <hi>Cathedra,</hi> or with his Conclave, or him in General Counsel, or in such Counsel without him, or in the Church diffusive, yet they do all agree herein; that this Infallibility is possessed by Original Grant, made by Jesus Christ, to one, or other, or all of them, in the Person of the Holy Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> and doth descend by Ordination in a continual Succession not alienable. This, I doubt not, will be allow'd to be the declar'd sentiments of some of that People in this point; and which do abundantly differ from what hath been always professed by us herein, which in Brief, is to the following purpose, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:63041:55"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We have constantly said, that the Holy Spirit of God is Infallible, and that through the Mediation and Intercession of our Lord Jesus Christ, a Manifestation of this Infallible Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is given <hi>to every Man to profit with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have constantly said, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is obedient to the Convictions and Leadings of this Infallible Holy Spirit, as they are tendred to their Souls, during the day of their Visitation, shall thereby be Infallibly lead, <hi>into all Truth,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation, both in Principle and in Practice; for it doth not only Teach sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, but also teacheth to deny all ungodliness, and hath no fellowship with the <hi>Vnfruitful Works of Darkness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We have constantly said, that of such, as through their <hi>working together with the Grace of God</hi>; are thereby become <hi>Strong in the Lord</hi>: Of these I say, As Christ doth now Prepare, Fit, Furnish and Qualify, with, and by his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; those whom he makes Choise of to send forth and imploy in the work of the Ministry: So they who are so sent forth, have (or may have, if they diligently attend to the Voice of this Infallible Holy Spirit speaking in them) a certain Infallible Knowledge and Assurance of the Truth of what they so deliver: And they who hear, have (or may have, if they duly attend to that measure or manifestation of this Infallible Holy Spirit which they have received) a like certain Infallible Knowledge and Assurance of the Truth of what they hear: But, tho' they who so minister, and they who so hear, have, or may have, this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Assistance; Yet, this Assistance continues no longer with any, than they to whom it is so given, do continue faithful to it; and herein is one remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able difference between the Law and the Gospel;


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63041:56"/>
the Law, in its Offices, went by Succession to the several Ages of the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and was not alienable from them, but fulfill'd and so ended by Christ: Thus, the Office of the Priesthood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended in that Tribe in which it was appointed at the giving of the Law, so that in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Office, they had the benefit of the promises made to the Priesthood at that time, tho' some of them were wicked Men, an Instance whereof, is, <hi>John</hi> 11.51. in <hi>Caiphas,</hi> of whom it is there said, <hi>He spake not of himself, but being High Priest that Year he prophesied.</hi> But in the Gospel Dispensation it is not so, the Gifts of the Holy Spirit not being limited either to Person or Office in the Church; nor can Man witness any Union with it, or infallible Assistance from it, but through obedience to, and perseverance both in the Principles which it teacheth, and that Holiness of Life which it leads into: This, thus briefly stated, will plainly and truly shew the Inquiring Reader, the great difference between us and the <hi>Romanists</hi> in this great Article of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 32. <hi>But the Simplicity of our Quakers, has deprived them of every one of these helps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Quakers as I have now shewn, have no need of those helps; because their <hi>Simplicity</hi> is Godly Sincerity; which, had the <hi>Snake</hi> had, he would not have bely'd us as he does in the following words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 32. <hi>For as they place Infallibility in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry single Quaker, so they confine it not to matters of Faith, but extend it to all Persons and Things. To know all Mens Hearts, and all things in the World; by their Inward Light, without being told by any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:63041:56"/>Which are Abominable Lyes and Slanders, as will be further manifested in detecting his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions and other Abuses of those quotations, which he makes from our Friends Books, to prove this Assertion. Under the second head the <hi>Snake</hi> makes divers quotations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 33. he quotes from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> this Objection of the Priest's: <hi>That is another Error of the Quakers, that say, he who is not Infallible in his Judgment, when he gives Counsel and Advice, is no Minister of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake,</hi> has fairly, as above, put the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, but hath falsly quoted <hi>G. F</hi>'s Answer, which is truly thus, <hi>Now he that is not Infallible in his Counsel, and Judgment and Advice, is not he in Error? And are not the Ministers of Christ, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Spirit? And is not that out of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which is Infallible in Counsel and Judgment? And are they Ministers of Christ that are fallible? And is not the Power, the Gospel, Infallible?</hi> — Which is briefly thus,
<q>The Ministers of Christ, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string from the Gospel the Power of God, which is Infallible, are in such their Ministry In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible:</q>
This, every Eye not blinded with Prejudice and Envy, may by the context perceive to be the sense of the place.</p>
               <p>But this Adversary hath here given a fair mark of his Prejudice and Envy, in that he would rather false quote <hi>G. F</hi>'s words, by leaving out sentences in the middle of the Quotation, than by setting it fairly down, let it speak for it self: Which practice of the <hi>Snake</hi> is base and cowardly, as well as unchristian.</p>
               <p>He hath posted himself, Knight Errant like, to <hi>Demand Reparation in the name of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: And from this assumed Post, he descends to call <hi>G. F. Valpoon,</hi> one <hi>of poor Vnderstanding,</hi> &amp;c.


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63041:57"/>
yet meanly and in very poor Manner, false quotes his Books, that he may be sure of a Triumph; plainly enough intimating, that <hi>G. F</hi>'s words are sound till he has mangled them; and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing restored, do plainly shew that the Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of which <hi>G. F.</hi> speaks, is that of the Holy Spirit, from which Holy Spirit, so far as any do Minister, so far and no farther, are they Infallible in their Ministry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 33. quoted from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 89. <hi>They can discern who are Saints, who are Devils, and who Apostates, without speaking ever a word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' the <hi>Snake</hi> injuriously stop here, <hi>G. F.</hi> goes on, and in his next words shews, who they be that can do so, <hi>They that be in the Power and the Life of Truth.</hi> Which does very plainly shew, that <hi>G. F.</hi> did not attribute this Knowledge or Discerning to the Quakers or any Man; but to the Power and Life of Truth where it is manifested.</p>
               <p>And if the <hi>Snake</hi> will take upon him, in his own name, or others, to deny, and disown, that any of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have the word of God, or Christ, in their Hearts; or will say that Christ is not Eternal, Infallible and Able to Judge of Persons or things, which is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that he opposes; let him do it in plain terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 33. quoted from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 96. <hi>Thou not being Infallible, thou art not in the Spirit, and so art not a Minister, and art not able to Judge of Powers that is not Infallible, nor Magistrates, nor Kingdoms nor Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here (as I have just now observed) the <hi>Snake</hi> breaks off too soon, having purposely left out the very next following words, which are these, <hi>For who is in the Infallible Spirit, is in the Spirit that Christ was in,</hi> &amp;c. which words do very fully shew wherein the Infallibility of the true Ministry does


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63041:57"/>
stand. And do as fully shew the injustice of this Adversary in the curtailing of them.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 34. Quoted from p. 7. of <hi>E. B</hi>'s Preface to <hi>Great Mystery.</hi> The <hi>Snake</hi> says, That <hi>E. B.</hi> says this <hi>Infallible Spirit</hi> was given to every one, and then thus quotes him. <hi>To us</hi> (says he) <hi>every one of us in particular — And this Light gave us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Truth and Error, and between every false and right way, and it perfectly discover'd to us the true state of all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake,</hi> in this Quotation, has treacherously abused and mangled <hi>E. B</hi>'s Words, and perverted his Sense; I will desire the Reader's patience to read what I have transcribed from <hi>E. B.</hi> his clear sense, and true Gospel Doctrine, will, I hope, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the pains thou shalt be at in doing it. And for the detection of the <hi>Snake</hi> in this his nibling practice, I will distinguish what he has taken, as above, in a different Character.</p>
               <p>Pref. p. 7. of <hi>Great Mystery. First,</hi>
                  <q>The Lord brought us, by his Power and Wisdom, and the Word by which all Things were made, to know, and understand, and see perfectly, that God had given <hi>to us, every one of us in particular,</hi> a Light from himself, shining in our Hearts and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which Light, Christ his Son, the Saviour of the World, had lighted every Man, and all Mankind withal; which Light in us, we found sufficient to reprove us, and convince us of every evil Deed, Word and Thought; and by it, in us, we come to know Good from Evil, Right from Wrong; and whatsoever is of God, and according to him, from what is of the Devil; and what is contrary to God, in Motion, Word and Work: <hi>And this Light, gave us to discern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Truth and Error, between every False and Right Way; and it perfectly discovered to us, the true state


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63041:58"/>
of all things:</hi> And we thereby came to know Man, what he was in his Creation before Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and how he was deceived and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Devil; and his estate in Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and in Disobedience: And how he is drove and banished from the presence of the Lord; and the Sorrow and Anguish which he is in, and to undergo: And also by the Light in us we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly came to know the way of Restauration, and the means to be restored; and the state of Man being come out of Transgression, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored. These things, to us, were revealed by the Light within us, which Christ had given us, and Lightned us withal. What Man was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Transgression, and what he is in Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and what he is being redeemed out of Transgression; and also the Light which shined in every one of us, as to it, our Minds became turned, and our Hearts inclined; the perfect estate of the Church we came to know; Her estate before the Apostles days, and in the Apostles days, and since the days of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: And her present state we found to be, as a Woman who had once been clothed with the Sun, and the Moon under her Feet, who brought forth him that was to rule the Nations; but She was fled into the Wilderness, and there sitting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate in her place, that was prepared of God, for such a season; which season, in the very end thereof, when the time of her sojourning was towards a full end, then were we brought forth. If any have an Ear, they may hear: So that all these things concerning Man, and concerning the Times and Seasons, and the changing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of Times, and all things that pertain to Salvation, Redemption and Eternal Life, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Man to know; ALL THIS WAS discover'd,


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63041:58"/>
revealed, and made known to us, by the Light that was in us, which Christ had lighted us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</q>
Thus <hi>E. B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Quotation, is from <hi>E. B</hi>'s Works, p. 862. and his quotation is thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every true Member of the Church, — hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and infallibility of Judgment, and discerning who are out of the Truth, and in the way of Error, and are Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this as in the last, he hath abusively mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>E. B</hi>'s words, which are these,
<q>
                     <hi>Every true Member of the true Church,</hi> hath its particular Measure of the Infallible Spirit of Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is certainly persuaded of the way of Truth in which he walks, and knows and believes the Infallibility of the Truth he professes, and is certain and secure of the way of his Peace and Assurance in God, which he hath received and believed; and hath also <hi>certainty and infallibility of Judgment, and discerning who are out of the Truth, and in the way of Error, and are Hereticks.</hi> Such are infallibly known and discerned by the Spirit of God, in the true Church of Christ.</q>
               </p>
               <p>See here, <hi>Reader,</hi> the great perversion of words, sound as can be deliver'd, and which I dare the <hi>Snake</hi> to deny if he can; for if he does, he must of necessity thro' away all that Enthusiasm to which he says the Church, in her Offices, does pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 34. Quoted from <hi>E. B</hi>'s Works, p. 861, 862. <hi>So both the Law-makers, and the Judges of the Law, must be infallible in Knowledge and Judgment in this case of Heresie; otherwise the Law made for that purpose, and the Judgment given by that Law, are both false and unjust, and not according to God, and his Truth; but are to be justly Judged and Condemn'd of the Lord God in his day and season.</hi> This the


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63041:59"/>
                  <hi>Snake says dissolves our Laws, Damns the Law-makers, and infers necessarily the</hi> Quakers <hi>Opinion of their own Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Charge let the <hi>Snake</hi> himself answer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no his refusing Swearing Obedience to the Present Government, dissolves the Law which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it of him, Damns the Makers of that Law, and does infer an Opinion of his own Infallibility.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 35. Quoted from <hi>E. B</hi>'s Works, p. 198. where I have look'd for the words quoted by the <hi>Snake,</hi> but find no such; if he be mistaken in the page, when that is rectified, it may be answered.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 35. Quoted from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 107. <hi>Thou sayst that the Holiest Man is not able to give an Infallible Character of another Man: Hast thou not in this discovered thy self to be no Minister of Christ, or of the Spirit, who cannot give an Infallible Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of another Man, how canst thou minister to his Condition? How canst thou see them that be turned from the Darkness, and that be in the Darkness, and distinguish the one from the other, and an Holy Man from an Vnholy Man, that canst not give an Infallible Character of any Man's Estate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 36. Quoted from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 94. <hi>Have you given your selves a Name of a Church of Christ, and is there not a Spirit of Discerning among you? have you not manifested there, that you are Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted from the Church of Christ, the Apostles were of, and how can you minister or teach People, if ye do not discern their estates, how they stand before God, how can you commend your selves to every Man's Conscience in God's sight? How can ye present the Souls of Men to God, and see not their states how they are in his Sight? How came ye to have fellowship in the Spirit? How can you, or any, minister to the state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that people be in, and see where they are, and doth not see how they stand in God's sight?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:63041:59"/>From these two long Quotations, he draws two Inferences or Conclusions, which I will briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, and then reply to them
<q>Here the <hi>Quakers</hi> have excluded all from the Church of Christ, from having any fellowship in the Spirit, who have not this Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit of Discerning every Man's Heart.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Secodly,
<q>It is evident, they did not discern <hi>Keith</hi> and <hi>Bugg,</hi> whom for many years they own'd as true <hi>Quakers,</hi> thought them principal Pillars, whom now they vilifie as Apostates. Therefore by their own Argument, all the <hi>Quakers</hi> are Harlotted from the Church of Christ, have no fellowship in the Spirit, because none of them had this Spirit of Discerning.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To the first, <hi>That all are excluded,</hi> &amp;c. Every Member of the Church of Christ, must necessarily have a measure of the Spirit of Christ, else <hi>they are none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. And this Spirit of Christ, the Holy Ghost, as in its fulness, it is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; so every, even the least measure or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of it, is Infallible.</p>
               <p>To the second, This Infallible Holy Spirit being of the <hi>THREE in the Godhead,</hi> searcheth the Heart, and trieth the Reins, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10. But tho' this Holy Spirit, can discover unto one, the Heart and Thoughts of another, as of <hi>Ananias</hi> to <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 5. Yet as that is not usual, so neither is it necessary, nor is it that, which we pretend to, nor hath <hi>G. Fox,</hi> in the fore-quoted places pretended to it. But that which <hi>G. Fox</hi> means, and which we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, is, That such who minister in, and by that Holy Spirit, which hath an Infallible Discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Hearts and States of all the Persons mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to. This Holy Spirit doth direct the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry accordingly, that it may be suitable to the states of the Auditory: Which they who pretend not to be led, guided, and assisted by that Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Holy Spirit in their Ministry, cannot pretend


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63041:60"/>
to. And as to his Objections, that the Quakers did not discern <hi>G. Keith, F. Bugg,</hi> and other <hi>wicked Apostates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a time when those Men (I in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity think) were truly Quakers, as they pretended, and to have discerned them Apostates, before they were such, had not been true discerning.</p>
               <p>There was a time when <hi>Demas</hi> walked with <hi>Paul,</hi> was owned by <hi>Paul</hi> to be a Fellow-Labourer with him in the Gospel, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.4. There was a time when through the Love of the World, he forsook the Apostles, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. so I may say of these, and others, there was a time when they walked with us; and now is the time, when through the Love of the World, and other things, they are departed and fallen from that Unity and Fellowship they once had with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 37. quoted from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 105. <hi>We, says he (the Pope) and you (the Protestants, whom he calls Professors) are apostatized from the Infallible Spirit that the Apostles was in, in which we are come — For who witness these conditions that they were in, that gave forth the Scriptures, they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Infallibility, an Infallible Spirit, which is now possessed and witnessed among those called Quakers, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Highest for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall first detect the <hi>Snake</hi>'s base practice of mangling this, as other places, by setting down <hi>G. F</hi>'s words as they lie in that Book, and then shew plainly their Scriptural meaning. The first, <hi>viz.</hi> the Quotation,
<q>And we say, the Pope is not Infallible neither, though he be your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Ancient: Yet we say, <hi>he and you are Apostatized from the Infallible Spirit that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles was in, in which we are come,</hi> with which ye are seen and judged; so not to have the Spirit of Christ Jesus, not to have the Spirit of the


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63041:60"/>
Prophets and Apostles, not to be led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, into all Truth; not to be in the Spirit, not to speak as ye are moved of the Holy Ghost. But to be such as ravened from the Spirit of God inwardly, and have gotten the Sheeps Cloathing, ye and the Pope, and so have devoured Nations for this many hundred years, so have all been like ravening Wolves: <hi>For who witness these conditions that they were in that gave forth the Scriptures, they witness Infallibility, an Infallible Spirit, which is now possessed and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed among those called</hi> Quakers, <hi>Glory to the Highest for ever.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This the <hi>Snake</hi> says, <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 37. <hi>Is Dreadfully Astonishing,</hi> but gives no reason why it is so: but that his practice is <hi>astonishing,</hi> there are several reasons to prove it. <hi>First,</hi> In so basely picking and mangling Books, that they may thereby be suborned to speak, what the Writer never intended. Next, In his wilful perverting, the plain and known sense, which they carry, and which their Writers had. And upon Sober Inquiry what in this can be <hi>astonishing</hi>? That the Pope is not Infallible, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the <hi>Snake</hi> will allow: And that the Spirit of Truth doth see and judge, such who apostatize from it; the Scriptures teach: And if the <hi>Snake</hi> doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it <hi>astonishing,</hi> that the <hi>Quakers</hi> should possess and witness, according to Holy Writ, the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy and Infallible Spirit of Christ, he shews his Ignorance therein; tho' all who are truly sensible of these manifestations, can in deep Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Soul give Glory to the Highest. Yet to him, must be applied that of <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.5. For it is a Work that God hath wrought in this day, whether he will believe it or not. Hitherto, <hi>Reader,</hi> pray Observe, that tho' the <hi>Snake,</hi> as quoted, p. 88. foregoing hath said, <hi>we placed Infallibility in every single</hi> Quaker,

                  <hi>confine it not to Faith, but extend it to all Persons and Things in the World by their inward Light.</hi> Yet the Charge is notoriously false, and that the colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pretence which he had for this his false as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, was owing to his own false quoting, curtail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and mangling of our Books, of which I have shewn eminent instances, since that assertion of his in p. 88. And that our Books in the instances produced, speak according to Scripture, I shall leave with the Impartial Reader to Judge; only adding, that the Forms of Speech, <hi>Try all things, Teach all things, Know all things,</hi> and <hi>Judge all things,</hi> which are frequently found in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot without great perversion be applied otherwise, than to that <hi>Trying, Teaching, Knowing and Judging,</hi> which are the proper effects of the Operations of the Holy Spirit in the Hearts of all that are obedient to it: And that, in order first, to their own Salvation, and then to the Service of God in his Church: In this sense <hi>G. F. E. B.</hi> and others have used these Forms of Speech; in this sense the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> testifies of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> our Saviour, John 4.25. <hi>He will teach us all things.</hi> In this sense our Saviour promised, John 14.26. <hi>That the Holy Ghost should teach us all things.</hi> In this sense <hi>John,</hi> the Beloved Disciple, testifies of the Believers, 1 John 2.20. <hi>Ye know all things.</hi> And in this sense the Apostle testifies of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Man, 1 Cor. 2.10. <hi>He judgeth all things.</hi> And in this sense the Beloved Disciple, 1 John 4.1. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth <hi>to try the Spirits whether they be of God.</hi> Now these forms of Speech, in these, and many more places, <hi>all things,</hi> are truly as <hi>E. B.</hi> p. 137. fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going hath said,
<q>All things that pertain to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Redemption and Eternal Life, needful for Man to know, all this was discovered, revealed and made known to us by the Light which was in us, which Christ had Lighted us withal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:63041:61"/>Ibid. p. 37. <hi>But I was much more surprized to find the otherwise Ingenious Mr.</hi> Penn, <hi>laugh at his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for not being Infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is no surprise to find the disingenious <hi>Snake,</hi> both to laugh Scornfully, Lye and Flatter, because he acknowledges not, for his Guide, the Holy and Infallible Spirit of God. But that <hi>W. P.</hi> laughs not, as is falsly said, we will now see.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 37. W. P. <hi>in a sheet of his, Entituled</hi> A Winding Sheet for Controversie ended, <hi>catches up</hi> Hen. Hedworth <hi>for saying he had been mistaken in the good Opinion he had before of Mr.</hi> Penn<hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conscience.</hi>
                  <q>How can he chuse (says Mr. <hi>Penn,</hi> who denys Infallibility?) But if mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before, why not in the <hi>Quakers</hi> now? And so <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> being fallible.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Judgment and Conscience, in respect of Matters Spiritual, in Articles of Faith, can only be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and knowingly judged of, by the Spirit of God; and what Man soever shall judge of these things, without the assistance thereof, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be mistaken, for the reason which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle has given, 1 Cor. 2.11. — <hi>For the things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> And if <hi>Hen. Hedworth</hi> did, by Opinion, not the assistance of the Spirit of God, judge of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Judgment and Conscience, no marvel if he were mistaken; and if by the same medium he would Judge of the Quakers; he was equally lyable to be also mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in them, and so <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> in all his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Guessings about Spiritual Things; and so must this <hi>Snake</hi> also.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 38. Quoted from p. 3. Sect. 2. of <hi>W. P's Winding Sheet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He vindicates what</hi> G. F. <hi>had asserted of the</hi> Quakers <hi>Infallibility; for having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated these words of</hi> G. F. <hi>(which were put as an Objection against him.)</hi>
                  <q>How can ye be Ministers


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63041:62"/>
of the Spirit, and not be infallible? And how can they but delude the People, who are not infallible?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>He makes this reply <hi>I Answer</hi> (says he) G. F's <hi>words stand immoveable for ever:</hi> And he gives this strange reason to support himself and <hi>G. F.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>For, says he,</hi>
                  <q>He that is a Minister of the Spirit is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly so; and in that Ministry is Infallible, otherwise the Spirit's Ministry is Fallible.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have here been large in transcribing the whole Quotation, that the Reader may see, whether the Wild Consequences which the <hi>Snake</hi> does falsly suggest, can naturally follow from the Doctrine aforesaid: His Consequences are these.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 38. <hi>That if any Man who is Lighted by the Sun, stumble, or miss his way, the fault is in the Sun, which shewed him a false Light; what else can be the meaning of that saying?</hi>
                  <q>If a Minister be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, then the Ministry of the Spirit is falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To make God himself Fallible, rather than we should be Infallible.</hi> O wretched, false and perverse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of this <hi>Snake!</hi> But truly and easily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, is this Consequence.</p>
               <p>If a Man, who is Lighted by the Sun, stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or miss his way, the fault is not in the Sun that shewed him a true Light, but the fault is in his neglecting of it. And according to this, the meaning of that saying,
<q>If a Minister of the (here the <hi>Snake</hi> has basely and falsly left out the word) [Spirit] be not infallible, then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits Ministry is Fallible.</q>
The meaning is this, God, the Holy Spirit is Infallible, and those whom he qualifies, fits and prepares for his Ministry; such are Infallibly assisted to be Ministers of the Spirit. But if any, who have been so assisted, depart from the assistance of the Holy Spirit,


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63041:62"/>
such, in their Ministry, are not Infallible, tho' the Spirit is.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 38. Quoted from <hi>Winding Sheet,</hi> p. 4. Sect. 3. <hi>He roundly checks his Opponent,</hi> H. Hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, <hi>saying, I bestowed</hi> 32 <hi>pages to prove</hi> G. F's <hi>Spirit to be Infallible; for that belongs simply to God alone, and then those that are Led by it, which was my Question; in which sense he is, and all such persons are Infallible, as he himself confesseth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here, says the <hi>Snake,</hi> H. Hedworth <hi>is made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible too.</hi> But that is false, for the words are plain, that those that are Led by the Holy Spirit, are infallibly Led. By this <hi>G. F.</hi> might be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Led; by this, any other, may be infallibly Led. This <hi>Hen. Hedworth</hi> hath confessed; this is what <hi>W. P.</hi> saith; but he could not say, <hi>H. H.</hi> was infallible: Because he had quoted him in p. 37. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of infallibility.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 39. <hi>Nay, the Devil himself is infallible at this rate, for he has his Knowledge, as well as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God; Knowledge is Light: And if that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which comes from God be infallible, then while the Devil follows that Light, or Knowledge, he must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible: And if this be all the Infallibility which the</hi> Quakers <hi>ascribe to themselves, it distinguishes them not from Wicked Men, or Devils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Profane perversion! The Almighty God by his Almighty <hi>Fiat,</hi> did create the several Species of Beings and Creatures, and furnished each, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order in which he placed them: To Angels and Men he gives Knowledge and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in their several Degrees; by which, they might answer the end of their Creation. But some Angels, and all Men, have fallen, yet have not thereby lost all that Knowledge, which by the Degree of their Beings they had. But in their fallen estate employ what Knowledge they have,


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63041:63"/>
to other purposes, than those for which it was given: Hence <hi>the Devil goes about seeking whom he may Devour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. And the Devil did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Knowledge, when in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.5, 8. he tempted our Saviour: And did know, that had our Saviour worshipped him, he had been conquered. Yet the Devil was not herein infallible. Nay, <hi>the Devils believe and tremble,</hi> from the Knowledge which they have of the Eternal God, and their own Eternal Damnation. How profane? <hi>Reader,</hi> must it be, to suppose that this their Knowledge makes them infallible; that is, guided by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God: Which none can be, unless obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to it. But the Infallibility which does di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish us from <hi>Wicked Men and Devils,</hi> and which, we say, is possessed by us: Is no other than this, That whereas all Men are fallen short of God's Glory, and are by Nature Children of Wrath. Man cannot be restored out of this estate, but by the benefits of the Propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ outwardly slain; by which Sacrifice our High-Priest, who was touched with the feeling of our Infirmities, hath put Man into a capacity of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting his Mediation: And in order to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, hath given to every one a manifestation of the Infallible Holy Spirit, in which he did the Will of the Father: To this manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, such as are obedient, are infallibly led in all things that concern Salvation, Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and Eternal Life, which neither <hi>Devils nor Wicked Men</hi> can be, because disobedient to it. See, <hi>Reader,</hi> how much the Jugler, this <hi>Snake</hi> plays, in endeavouring to obtrude, under a shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, a most dangerous notion, and directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Revealed Religion; which doth agree, that the Light and Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is able, as our Saviour


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63041:63"/>
saith, <hi>to lead into all Truth.</hi> And that to this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, <hi>Wicked Men and Devils</hi> are disobedient; yet still have such degrees of Knowledge, which are the proper Distinction of their Being.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 39. <hi>Sometimes it makes them as Infallible as the Apostles, nay, as Christ himself. But at other times, when they are pressed, they bring down this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility to mean nothing in the World that does distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them from other Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is utterly false, no <hi>Quaker</hi> hath said he was as Infallible as <hi>the Apostles, or Christ himself.</hi> I demand an Instance. But without pressing, we have often said, that a Manifestation of the Light, and Infallible Spirit, or Grace, is 1 Cor. 12.7. <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to every Man to profit withal,</hi> without distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. That which makes the Distinction is Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it, By this it was <hi>Paul</hi> could say 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>By the Grace of God I am what I am</hi>; and by the same Grace we say we are what we are.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 40. <hi>But this will no more prove it to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, or sufficient of it self to bring us to Heaven, than it will follow, that Man cannot die, because God breathed into him the Breath of Life, or that he is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, because his strength comes from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Holy Spirit is Infallible, and sufficient, for the purposes, for which God hath given to Men, manifestations of it, is very certain; from the testimony of God himself, 2 Cor. 12.9. <hi>My Grace is sufficient for thee.</hi> But it follows not from this, that Man cannot Die, or that he is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, because his Life and Strength came from God. God hath been pleased to give to Men such Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Powers, as are agreeable to the Nature of their Humane Being: And these Natural Powers being employed according to that Great Law of Order in which we stand in the Creation, we may act in them our appointed time. But the Principles of


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63041:64"/>
our Humane Being, being finite, their power to act, is the same, and must come to an end. With Spirits, It is otherwise, They are more simple and uncompounded Beings, therefore of eternal Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And the God of the Spirits of all Flesh, in Infinite Compassion; (when Man had forfeited his Title to Happiness) to us, that this Eternal Duration might be in happiness, gave the Son of his Love, that we who were afar off, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to himself, which cannot be; but as the Spirit of Man which hath rebelled, and been in Disobedience, comes, by the Operation of the Spirit of God upon it, to be restored into obedience to its Guidings: Which if he will be in the day of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation; That Grace and Truth, which comes by Jesus Christ, will sufficiently and infallibly lead him into Reconciliation with God; from whom, through disobedience, he was fallen. And this, is not as the <hi>Snake</hi> says, p. 41. <hi>Derogatory to the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction paid by Christ for our Sins.</hi> But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary places the true value upon it. It being that, by which we are put into a capacity of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and not by any power of our own. And when the Apostle bids, Phil. 2.12. <hi>To work out our own Salvation:</hi> We never understood it otherwise, than by the assistance of that Grace which comes by Jesus Christ to Men, during the day of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 41. <hi>That does not make the Light within the efficient cause of our Salvation, or give it any Title to Infallibility, more than</hi> vers. 13. of the 4th Chap. <hi>in the same Epistle, can entitle us to Omnipotence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause St.</hi> Paul <hi>says there, "I can do all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Christ in his Spiritual Appearance, the Light within, is the Efficient cause of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I need not give a greater proof than this same 13th <hi>vers.</hi> which the <hi>Snake</hi> has quoted: For


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63041:64"/>
there the Apostle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. says, <hi>I can do all things through Christ, which strengthneth me</hi>; that is, all things relating to his Ministry, as an Apostle; or his Duty, as a Christian.</p>
               <p>I come now to the <hi>Snake</hi>'s 4th Head of Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is little more than Profane and Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Banter, after the first Paragraph, p. 41. <hi>But if any could pretend to Infallibilty, — They will be found to have the best title to whom the</hi> Quakers <hi>would most unwillingly grant it:</hi> For it is written, Prov. 16.10.
<q>A Divine Sentence is in the Lip of the King, and his Mouth transgresseth not in Judgment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Why then does the <hi>Snake</hi> deny that best Title, and not obey that Divine Sentence, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the present Government? Why would he flee the Judgment of a Mouth, which transgresseth not in Judgment? By fleeing and denying, he loudly proclaims his unwillingness to grant it. But as for us, we do not <hi>unwillingly,</hi> but readily grant, That God is ready to supply Kings with Wisdom and Justice, suitable to their High Station, for the good of themselves, and those they govern, if they in humility will receive it. But as with God, there is no respect of persons; so we do as readily grant, That God by his Spirit does as infallibly teach the Governed, in their private capacities, all that is necessary to their Salvation, if they will but attend and learn.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 42. <hi>Do you think that the</hi> Quakers <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is limited to speaking only? They can make an Infallible Judgment of Men's Hearts, and tell who are Saints, and who are Devils, by very winks and glances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the first glance, and so throughout, this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a very Lye, for no <hi>Quaker</hi> hath so said. But we do say, that such who be in the Power


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63041:65"/>
and Life of Truth, can discern between <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Devils</hi>; for all true Spiritual Discerning is in the Holy Spirit. Not, but that there often are exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour marks of inward wickedness. Hence Gen. 4.5. <hi>When Cain was very wroth, his Countenance fell.</hi> Hence <hi>David</hi> saith, Psal. 10.4. <hi>The wicked, through the pride of his Countenance, will not seek after God.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> chap. 3.9. <hi>The shew of their Countenance doth witness against them:</hi> and in the 16th <hi>vers.</hi> the Lord numbers up, among the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior marks of inward wickedness, <hi>wanton Eyes, mincing and tinkling with their Feet.</hi> Yet these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior infallible marks, as they have been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God himself, is, in the language of this Profane Adversary, p. 43. <hi>Dwindled down to a meer Gypsie, a paultry Fortune-teller, to nothing but a little skill in Physiognomy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> Is it possible, for one who so profanely ridicules, both the Inward Discerning, and the Outward Marks of Secret Iniquity, to advance the great end of good Life and Conversation? No, such ridiculing is in direct opposition to them, and is distructive to Exemplary Modesty; how great soever his pretence may be of love to Souls.</p>
               <p>I come now to his Fifth Head of Distinction, of divers Stories of particular Failings, which he brings, in opposition to that Infallibility I have so largely spoken of; which Plea (the <hi>Snake</hi> says, p. 48.) <hi>leads us naturally into this sort of Redargution.</hi> Though here, as before, he is altogether out. For tho', to give <hi>a Man a Fall, is, it's true, a plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, that he is not Almighty.</hi> Yet when Man does fall, it is no plain Conviction, that he could not have stood by an Almighty assistance. We have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver placed Infallibility in Persons, otherwise, than by the assistance of the Holy Spirit; to which, if Men are obedient, it will infallibly guide them to


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63041:65"/>
Heaven; and so safely protect them, that, as our Saviour saith, John 10.29. <hi>No Man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand.</hi> But when Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Grace of God: They may, as <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> when he had lost his Strength, Judg. 16.20. say, <hi>I will go out as at other times, and shake my self. And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him.</hi> But their weakness will soon discover they are gone from their Guide. Thus it was with the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and thus with all those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whose failings, the Holy Spirit has recorded in the Scriptures, when they departed from the Lord, they left their Strength and fell, some very fouly. Yet what less than Blasphemy is it to say, That the Holy Spirit, had they been obedient, could not have preserved them; as well as there are Instances, it did restore several of them? And it is no breach of the Oath of God, made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his Seed; nor any argument of the Shortness of his Arm (as the Prophet's phrase is) <hi>That they are become a Desolation,</hi> because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused <hi>to hear and obey.</hi> And should it, which God forbid, come to pass, that the Defection of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> from the guidings of the Holy Spirit should be as general; as is now, that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who sometime were the People of God. Yet the Holy Spirit of Christ were not at all the less infallible, or sufficient in it self to be the Author of Salvation to all that do obey it.</p>
               <p>His first Story, <hi>p.</hi> 44. is of one <hi>Christopher At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinson,</hi> who he calls in ridicule, <hi>p.</hi> 43. a <hi>Precious Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> in <hi>p.</hi> 44. a <hi>Bright Lamp,</hi> with other such marks of Scorn; insulting over his Miscarriage in the Lust of the Flesh: And this Story the <hi>Snake</hi> makes a twofold use of, one to reproach the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Person who fell, and the other to reproach the Principle and Practices of those,


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63041:66"/>
with whom the fallen Person had walked: To both I shall say somewhat, To the first, I know of no good use which can be made of raking in the Crimes of the Deceased, unless for Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Living: But then, their Crimes are not to be dressed in the Scornful Garb of a <hi>merry Andrew:</hi> Because, tho' that may raise more <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> yet it can raise no <hi>Reformation,</hi> on such as are guilty, or be any means of Preservation to those that are not yet so. And therefore we find that the Holy Spirit in recording the failings of <hi>Noah, Lot, Moses, David, Solomon, Peter,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hath done it in Language proper to these purposes. And there is not a truer mark of a mean and base, as well as an unchristian Spirit in a Man, than only for the Glory of Insult, and Liberty of Ridiculing, to call back to the minds of the Living, the Crimes of the Dead. To the Second, it can be no fault in the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, that Men are disobedient to it; nor is it any argument that the Infallible Spirit of God does not preserve any, because I, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may fall, but it is certain the Holy Spirit will teach, and will preserve, all who will keep in Subjection and Obedience to it, and they who do so keep, have a Godly Jealousie and Care, that the Practice of those who make Profession of the Guidings of the Holy Spirit be according to it, in all the Fruits of it; and accordingly, <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Huberthorn,</hi> and some others who were then at <hi>Norwich,</hi> did wait for the Counsel of God, that in his Wisdom they might search out this evil, which <hi>C. A.</hi> had wrought, and by their dealing with him, did bring him so to a sense of his Naughtiness, that he did confess it and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it. And further, that it might not be supposed, that such Naughtiness was tolerated


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63041:66"/>
and allowed by a Society professing Christianity, it was communicated to the Publick, that the guilty Person might bear his own Iniquity, and the Holy Truth he had made profession of be cleared. The like Laudable Practice, tho' call'd by the <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 45. <hi>A not regarding the Sacredness of the Seal of Confession</hi>; was practised by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Nathan</hi> towards King <hi>David,</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul</hi> towards his Brother in the Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and also by others recorded in Holy Writ, and yet the Holy Spirit is not at all the less In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
               <p>

               <p>This Charge and Story, upon nameless Persons, is, <hi>Reader,</hi> another Instance of the Injustice of this Adversary, in that he hath taken it out of a Book written against us, and Printed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1673. and which was answered in the same Year, as the <hi>Snake</hi> well knows, and hath not been since reply'd to; and what is an aggravation of the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Injustice herein, is that in the Answer to it, there is a Certificate under the hands of <hi>John Bolton</hi> and <hi>Sam.

               <p>That Women, as well as Men, may forsake the Guidings of the Spirit of God, and run into Wickedness, is very true, but that any who have

               <p n="6">VI. <hi>But we may make a little more bold with the Mens Infallibility. And I will not go to mean Ones. The Great</hi> James Naylor <hi>was brought upon his knees before their Church, where</hi> G.

               <p>Of this Adversaries Boldness and Scoffing we have great Proof, but of his Honesty and Truth we have none; of his Lyes here is also fresh Proof: For it never was the Practice of any Church or Meeting of ours, to bring any Transgressor upon their knees; nor did <hi>G.

We neither have, nor own, in our Assemblies any Headship of Man or Men; the only Head of them being Christ Jesus, who dignifies whom he pleases, with fit qualifications, by his Holy Spirit, for the Service of his Church; and they that continue faithful in their Gifts, such we with the Apostle esteem worthy of double Honour.</p>
               <p>But now, as to <hi>James Naylor,</hi> of whom the <hi>Snake</hi> often makes mention: I shall here at once speak concerning him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. N.</hi> was a Man who had been highly favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of God with a good degree of Grace, which was sufficient for him, had he kept to its teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: For, while he did so, he was exemplary in Godliness and great Humility, was <hi>Powerful in Word and Doctrine</hi>; and thereby Instrumental in


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63041:68"/>
the hand of God, for turning many <hi>from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to Light, and from the Power of Satan to the Power of God.</hi> But he, Poor Man! <hi>Became exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above Measure, through the abundance of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> And in that Exaltation, did depart from the Grace and Holy Spirit of God, which had been his sufficient Teacher: Then blindness came over him, and he did suffer himself to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of above what he ought: Here he slipt and fell, but not Irrecoverably: For, it did please God, of his Infinite Mercy, in the Day of his Affliction, to give him a sight and sense of his outgoings and fall, and also a place of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And he did with the Prodigal, <hi>weep bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly,</hi> and humbled himself for his Transgression; and he besought God, with true Contrition of Soul, to pardon his offences through Jesus Christ: God, I firmly believe, forgave him, for he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons the truly Penitent: His People received him with great Joy, for that he who had gone astray from God, was now returned to the Father's House, and for that, he who had separated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from them through his Iniquity, was now through Repentance and Forsaking of it, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Unity of the Faith, and their Holy Fellowship in the Gospel of Christ. And I do hereby testify, that I do esteem it a particular mark of God's owning his People, in bringing back into Unity with them, a Man who had so dangerously fallen, as did <hi>James Naylor.</hi> And here let none Insult, but take heed, least they also in the hour of their Temptation do fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: Nor let any boastingly say, <hi>Where is your God?</hi> Or Blasphemously suppose his Grace is not sufficient for Men in Temptation, because the <hi>tempted</hi> may go from, and neglect, the teachings of it: <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> as their Transgressions

This Offence, I confess, which hath been sorrow of heart, that the Enemy of Man's Peace in Christ should get this Advantage in the Night of my Trial, to stir up Wrath and Offences in the Creation of God; a thing, the simplicity of my Heart did not intend, the Lord knows; who, in his endless Love, hath given me Power over it to condemn it; and also that Letter which was sent me to <hi>Exeter</hi> by <hi>John Stranger,</hi> when I was in Prison, with these words, <hi>Thy Name shall be no more</hi> James Naylor, <hi>but</hi> Jesus. This I judge to be written from the Imaginations, and a Fear stroke me when I first saw it, and so I put it in my Pocket (close) not intending any should see it; which they finding on me, spread it abroad, which the simplicity of my Heart never occasioned: So this I deny also, that the Name of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> is

received instead of <hi>James Naylor,</hi> or after the Flesh, for the Name is to the Seed to all Generations; and he that hath the Son, hath the Name which is Life and Power, the Salvation and the Unction, into the which Name all the Children of Light are Baptized. So the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> I confess before Men, but not according to Men; which Name to me hath been a Strong Tower in the Night, and in the Day. And this is the Name of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> which, I confess, the Son and the Lamb, in the Seed where he speaks in Male or Female; but who hath not this in himself, hath not Life; neither can have by Idolizing my Person, or the Person of any Flesh, but in whom the Heir is born, and hath spoken, or doth speak; there he must not be denied the Mouth to spake by, who is Head over all, and in all his own, God blessed for ever.</p>
                           <p>And all those Ranting Wild Spirits, which then gathered about me in that time of Darkness; and all their Wild Actions, and Wicked Words against the Honour of God, and his pure Spirit and People: I deny the Spirit, the Power and the Works there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and as far as I gave advantage, through want of Judgment, for that Evil Spirit, in any to arise, I take shame to my self justly; having formerly had Power over that Spirit, in Judgment and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, where-ever it was; which Darkness came over me through want of Watchfulness and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Pure Eye of God, and diligently minding the Reproof of Life, which condemns the Adulterous Spirit: So the Adversary got ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, who ceases not <hi>to seek to devour</hi>; and being taken Captive from the True Light, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Night <hi>where none can work,</hi> as a wandring Bird fit for the prey: And if the Lord of all my Mercies had not rescued me, <hi>I had perished,</hi> for I was as one appointed to Death and Destruction,

                              <hi>and there was none could deliver me.</hi> And this, I confess, that God may be justified in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and magnified in his Mercies without end; who did not forsake his Captive in the Night, even when his Spirit was daily provoked and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but hath brought me forth to give Glory to his Name for ever: And it is in my Heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to God, and before Men, my Folly and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in that day: Yet was there many things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med against me in that day to take away my Life, and bring Scandal upon the Truth, of which I am not Guilty at all, as that accusation, as if I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Adultery with some of those Women, who came with us from <hi>Exeter</hi> Prison, and also those who were with me at <hi>Bristol,</hi> the Night before I suffered there; of both which Accusations I am clear before God, who kept me at that day both in Thought and Deed, as to all Women, as a little Child, God is my Record; and this I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Particular, (hearing of some who still cease not to reproach therewith God's Truth and People) that the Mouth of Enmity might be shut from evil speaking, though this touch not my Conscience.</p>
                           <p>And that Report, as though I had raised <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kas Erbury</hi> from the Dead, carnally; this I deny also, and condemn that Testimony to be out of the Truth; tho' that Power that quickens the Dead, I deny not, which is <hi>the Word of Eternal Life.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And this I give forth, that it may go as far, as the Offence against the Spirit of Truth hath gone abroad, that all Burthens may be taken off with the Truth, and the Truth cleared thereby, and the True Light, and all that walk therein, and the Deeds of Darkness be condemned; and that all that are in Darkness may not Act in the Night, but


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63041:70"/>
stay upon God, who walks in the Light, who with the Workers of Iniquity hath not fellowship; which had I done, when first Darkness came upon me, and not been led by others, I had not run against the Rock to be broken, which so long had born me, and of whom I had so largely drank and of which I now drink in measure; to whom be the glory of all, and to him must every Tongue confess, as Judge and Saviour, God over all, blessed for ever.</p>
                           <p>And this further is given me to say, to every particular Person to whom this Writing shall come, Whatever is thy Condition, walk in the Light, which lets thee see it; there is thy Counsel, and thy strength to be received; to stay thee and recover thee: Art thou tempted to Sin? Abide in that which lets thee see it; that there thou mayst come to feed on the Right Body, not on the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation; for if thou mind the Temptation, it will overcome thee; but in the Light is Salvation: Or having Sinned, art thou tempted to despair, or to destroy thy self? mind not the Temptation, for it's Death that Sin hath brought forth; feed not on it, nor mind it, least thou eat Condemnation, for that's the Wrong Body.</p>
                           <p>The Body of Christ is felt in the Light, in which is Life from Death, Grace and Truth to Feed on; which will overcome for thee, being followed: but if thou follow the Temptation, Fear and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation will swallow thee up: If there appear to thee Voices, Visions, and Revelations, feed not thereon, but abide in the Light, and feel the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ; and there wilt thou receive Faith, and Power to judge of every appearance, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the Good to hold fast and obey, and the False to resist. Art thou in Darkness? mind it not, for if thou do, it will fill thee more; but stand still and


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63041:71"/>
Act not, and wait in patience till Light arise out of Darkness to lead thee: Art thou wounded in Conscience? feed not there, but abide in the Light, which leads to the Grace and Truth which teaches to deny, and put off the Weight, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the Cause, and brings Saving Health to Light: Yea, this I say to thee in the Name of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that tho' thou has made thy Grave as deep as the nethermost Hell, or were thy Afflictions as great as <hi>Job</hi>'s, and thy Darkness as the Depths of the Sea; yet if thou wilt not run to vain helps, as I have done, but stay upon the Lord till he give thee sight by his word (which commands Light to shine out of Darkness) from thence will he bring thee forth; thy Eye shall guide thee, and thou shalt praise his Name, as I do this day, glory for evermore; and this word is nigh thee, which must give thee <hi>Light, tho' Darkness Comprehends it not.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And hast thou Gifts, Revelations, Knowledge, Wisdom, or whatever thou mayst read on in the Scriptures of Truth, and do not abide in the Light, and feed on the Body of Christ, whence the Gift springs, but feed on the Gift, thou mayst be up for a while in thine own sight, but certainly thou wilt wither and die to God, and Darkness will come upon thee, and thy Food will turn to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation in the Sight of God.</p>
                           <p>And this I have learned in the Deep, and in Secret, when I was alone; and now declare open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Day of thy Mercy, <hi>Glory to the Highest for evermore,</hi> who hath thus far set me free to praise his Righteousness and his Mercy; and to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Invisible Pure God, over all, be fear, obedience and glory evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>I suppose truly, much in the same degree, for that it is a Judgment upon us, to have naughty Persons under our Profession; and that it is not a Judgment upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to have at least as many in her Communion, may be <hi>boldly and impudently</hi> (as the <hi>Snake</hi> says <hi>p.</hi> 16.)

                  <hi>averred,</hi> but not proved, and as he cannot prove it a Judgment, so I have already proved it no Error in Principle of Us, because I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly shewn that the Grace of God is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the purposes for which God hath given it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Salvation of Man.</hi>

And if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet be deceived</hi> (Ezek. 14.9.) <hi>I the Lord have deceived that Prophet.</hi> And it was the <hi>Lord</hi> who put a <hi>Lying Spirit</hi> into the <hi>Mouths</hi> of <hi>Ahab's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> 1 Kings 22.23. Now whether it be <hi>such a Spirit</hi> or not, which is in the Mouths of the <hi>Quaker Prophets,</hi> we have a plain rule whereby to know, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.2, 22. <hi>the Prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my Name, which I have not commanded him to speak. — even that Prophet shall Dye. And if thou say in thine Heart, How shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? When a Prophet speaketh in the Name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass; that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the Prophet hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him.</hi> Here is a plain touch-stone, which <hi>cannot be mistaken,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the <hi>Snake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Snake</hi> is much mistaken in applying this touch-stone, for the first text, <hi>viz.</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.11. He has done by that, as he does by our Books, cut off the Conclusion: For, the Apostle does there give the reason why they were <hi>given over to strong Delusion, because they received not the Love of the Truth, that they should be Saved.</hi> And for the other texts, it is not to be concluded from them, that every Prophesie spoken in the Name of God, is therefore false, because not fulfilled in the terms pronounced; for then should those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies,

And accordingly, God hath (as is recorded in Holy Writ) often repented himself of the Evil he hath threatned, and in great Mercy and Compassion, upon Sinners relenting, hath lengthned out their day of Visitation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 50. <hi>And the case of the Quakers is so hard, that if we can prove but one false Prophet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, the Infallibility of all, and every one, must be a Deceit, because — the Infallibility is asserted to belong to every one of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Festína Lentè,</hi> may be a useful Caution to one that makes such hasty and false Conclusions. The Infallibility <hi>of all and every one,</hi> is the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and if every one that make profession of it, should fall from it, and turn from the Grace of God, into Wantonness or Delusion; yet the Holy Spirit would be no Deceit. I will give that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Instance of the two Prophets, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. where both of them had true Prophesies; yet by giving way to Error, both fell, the first, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. lost his Life: And of the last it's said, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>He lyed.</hi> Yet it cannot be but falsly and wickedly concluded, that because the Prophesy of one of them was false, and the other thereby led into Error; therefore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible certainty of all, and every one, of the Prophesies of the Prophets, in the Old and New


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63041:73"/>
Testament, was a Deceit: Nay, from hence Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ does not conclude against, but confirm the Prophesies of them two Prophets, which they delivered in their Obedience to God. This brings me to his 8th Head of Distinction of Prophesies, which he says are false.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>But here, in this place, let me give two or three instances, to shew their false and wicked pretence to Infallibility. And I will not travel far for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: But I will be as merciful in exposing them as I can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will see the Instances before I make the like Conclusion. The first instance is of (as he calls him) a <hi>Quaker Glover</hi> in <hi>Cheapside.</hi> The <hi>Snake</hi> did tell us he would not travel far for an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This is some small hint that he Sculks about the City: But if in his next, he will be more particular as to his place, there is a Poor Man, formerly the King's Messenger, would gladly speak with him; but at present to return to the <hi>Mercy</hi> of the <hi>Snake</hi> in <hi>Exposing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercy</hi> when properly spoken, I know what it means; but when it proceeds from an Adversary so Profane, Unjust and Hypocritical, as is this <hi>Snake,</hi> it cannot have fewer <hi>alias's</hi> added to it, than hath his proper name, it may be <hi>alias</hi> this, or <hi>alias</hi> that, but that it is not <hi>Mercy</hi> in the true Signification of the word, will in a few words be seen.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> calls it <hi>Mercy</hi> in that he spares names; but that it is no such thing may be seen by this, he calls one <hi>p.</hi> 51. <hi>Prophet John,</hi> and there was no such Person of that name; and the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why he forbore others, was, because he might err as much in them: But, be all this as it may, the Relation and Story is false, and to shew that his Mercy is rejected, the <hi>Quaker

               <p>Reader, I have transcribed this out of <hi>G. W</hi>'s <hi>Antidote,</hi> which he wrote in Answer to the first Edition of the <hi>Snake,</hi> that I might not want an Answer to a Story pompously, tho' falsly, set out in 3 or 4 Pages.</p>
               <p>His second Story of Prophesies, is, p. 54. of <hi>Solomon Eccles, who</hi> (he says) <hi>did denounce, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> John Story, <hi>that he should Dye within one Year, and that he meant it of a natural Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake,</hi> who Glories in the miscariages of them that fall, does apply this to the whole Body, tho' it can be with no more Justice, or Strength of Argument, so apply'd, than the Lye of that Prophet, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.18. which he spake in the name of the Lord, can be apply'd to all the Faithful Prophets, in the Messages which from the Lord they did in faithfulness deliver. But further, <hi>S. E.</hi> did himself find his words his

Burden; and did under his own hand condemn that Hastiness, Anger and Darkness of Spirit, in which he does confess he spake those words; and it is not unlikely, but the <hi>Snake</hi> hath either seen or heard so much, and if he hath either, it is a manifest Lye in him, to lay that to the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> which they then did deny, and which also the Person offending, did truly and justly take to himself.</p>

<q>As I was sitting waiting on the Lord, on the 29th instant these things rose in my Heart, that I should acknowledge my Offence to all the Brethren in <hi>London,</hi> and thereabouts, and <hi>Bristol,</hi> and to all the Brethren <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> that had been witnesses against the Spirit of Separation; and am to let you know that it doth truly Repent me, and sorely Grieve me, that you that do bear a faithful Testimony for God, should have any Prophesie thrown at you, which I spoke to <hi>John Story</hi> in an angry Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: I do therefore acknowledge, as I have signified in my last Paper, about two Years ago, that I have had little rest Day nor Night, at times, ever since I spoke these words to <hi>John Story [That it was the word of the Lord that he should dye that Year</hi>] which were mine own words, and soon became my Burden, and were spoken in the Dark, and Darkness was upon my Spirit, and so under a strong Temptation, which I was suffered to fall into, I not stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Counsel of God; for which I bore God's Indignation: But I soon saw I should have gone to him in a meek Spirit, to beseech him to be reconcil'd to his Brethren.

               <p>His Third Instance is, p. 55. <hi>A Prophecy of W.</hi> Penn<hi>'s against one</hi> Tho.

               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 55. <hi>Now</hi> Tho. Hicks <hi>did go down to the Grave in Peace, and no Visible Example of God's Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was shewn upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And (which the <hi>Snake</hi> has not mentioned) <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi> did desist, and did not (as I have heard) (as the <hi>Snake</hi> falsly says he did. p. 56.) <hi>remain to his Death an Opposer of the</hi> Quakers, which was the terms of the Denunciation. So that the <hi>Quakers</hi> may be true Prophets still.</p>
               <p>His Fourth and last Instance here, is, of whom in Scorn, he calls (the Great) <hi>Edw. Burroughs,</hi> p. 57. quoted from p. 540, 535, 536, 537. of his Works, the words he quotes are these, and stand in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>The time is come, their Church</hi> (meaning <hi>Rome) cannot stand long. And as sure as the Lord lives, so shall it come to pass.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here, the <hi>Snake,</hi> is himself to some purpose, having in as deceitful and false manner, as well can be, represented the words of <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> in the pages quoted. I will give thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Instances, from the several pages quoted by the the <hi>Snake.</hi> The first page he here quotes it 540. where the <hi>Snake</hi> says he advises the Army to carry <hi>their Arms to the Gates of</hi> Rome. But minds not, that he there tells the Army,
<q>That might be a work honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63041:75"/>
in its day and season. And that there is a Victory more honourable, to wit the Victory over Sin and Death, and the Devil in your selves, and that you are to mind.</q>
And at the bottom of p. 535. (speaking of the Romish Church.)
<q>But their Weapons are Carnal and Devilish, and by Murders, Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tyrannies, they do defend themselves; and when these things are broken down, <hi>then their Church cannot stand long.</hi>
                  </q>
(He continues, p. 536.)
<q>
                     <hi>And as sure as the Lord lives, so shall it come to pass,</hi> a Generation shall accomplish it, and in the Generation of the Righteous it shall be finished. And in p. 537. <hi>E. B.</hi> saith thus, Whether the Lord will revenge the grievous blood-guiltiness that lies upon them, by himself, without an Instrument, or whether by you <hi>(speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Army)</hi> or others as an Instrument. Whether this way, or another, that God will do it, I determine not. But this I know, that <hi>the time is not long,</hi> that he will one way or other avenge and revenge the Blood of the Just upon the Murderers Head.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By all this, <hi>Reader,</hi> it abundantly appears, that <hi>E. B.</hi> doth not assign Time or Means, by, or in which it shall be accomplished, and so much any Good Man may warrantably speak concerning the finishing, and putting an end to those Carnal and Devilish <hi>Church-Weapons,</hi> of Murder, Oppression and Tyranny. Which, tho' this Adversary would hug, yet thanks be to God, they are out of his power. So that this Prophecy (if the <hi>Snake</hi> will have it one) must doubtless, in its season, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished.</p>
               <p>I come now to his Ninth Head of Distinction, which is little else, than one vehement Invective against the Authority of the Reformation. I will briefly consider its parts, p. 58. <hi>Extraordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63041:76"/>
are not to be credited, unless vouched by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, which God always sent to attest his Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Commissions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inspirations of the Prophets, <hi>Joel, Amos, Obediah, Micha,</hi> and others mentioned in the Old Testament, and of <hi>Agabus, Acts</hi> 21.11. were all of them <hi>Extraordinary Inspirations.</hi> But I find no Miracles, that these their Extraordinary Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were vouched by. <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, the Greatest Prophet, born of a Woman, his Mission was very <hi>extraordinary,</hi> yet not attested by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. Now let us see where the Doctrine of the <hi>Snake</hi> will lead us: Why, he says, <hi>Extraordinary Inspirations are not to be credited, unless vouched by Miracles.</hi> These Inspirations I have now spoken of, are not to us so vouched, are they therefore not to be credited? This will break an Article of the <hi>Snake</hi>'s pretended Faith, and make imperfect the Scriptures, which he says are a <hi>perfect Rule of Faith and Manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 58. <hi>Let us take this one mark more, to judge when such Inspirations are from God, or from the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes we will. <hi>Those from the Devil generally tend to Schism and Rebellion; as in that of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>and the Ten Tribes, who broke off from the Priesthood of</hi> Aaron, <hi>as well as from the House of</hi> David; <hi>and set up opposite Altars to that at</hi> Jerusalem.</p>
               <p>This does deserve to be mark'd, in that, it,</p>
               <p>First gives the Lie to the Scriptures, and then kicks against the Reformation. It gives the Lie to the Scripture, for that God by his Prophet <hi>Shemiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 11.4. when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> would have fought against <hi>Israel,</hi> that he might have brought the Kingdom from <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to himself; and that they were ready to fight, they were of God forbid; and the reason God by his Prophet gives, is; <hi>For


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63041:76"/>
this thing is done of me.</hi> But the <hi>Snake</hi> says it's done of the Devil. Thus much for the Kingdom now for the Priestood.</p>
               <p>That they broke off from the Priesthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and set up opposite Altars, is a mark applicable at this day, or, to what purpose does the <hi>Snake</hi> make it? And say that separation from the Priesthood at this day, is <hi>from the Devil.</hi> And now if the <hi>Snake</hi> please, let him prove how many of these separations which have been made within three hundred years from the Priesthood of the Roman Pontiff, have been made by the Devil? and let him not forget the Reformation in <hi>England.</hi> But of this kind of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing we have more.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 58. <hi>But as they paid all Dutiful Obedience to their persecuting Kings, and suffered Martyrdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them without Resistance: So did they always keep in the Communion of those same Priests, whom they had provoked and reproved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That Dutiful Obedience was paid by the Holy Prophets to persecuting Kings in their Days; and hath been paid by us, to persecuting Kings in our Days, is very true. But as for the Doctrine of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,</hi> if that be it the <hi>Snake</hi> quarrels at, he may find Opponents enough in the Communion of that Church he pretends Membership in; as he also may have the Voice of the <hi>Church of England</hi> against him, Justifying themselves, in that they did not keep the Communion of the Roman Priesthood, but did set up a <hi>Separate Communion</hi> and <hi>Opposite Altars.</hi> See, <hi>Reader,</hi> this <hi>Doughty Champion</hi> (as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends) for the <hi>Church of England,</hi> under the false pretences of esteeming, and valuing her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, does in truth and reality, as much as in him lies, scandalize the Reformation; by putting upon it very gross imputations, as if it were <hi>from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> But worse yet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:63041:77"/>Ibid. p. 59. <hi>And when our Saviour himself came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, he did not separate from the publick Worship, and Communion of the Jewish Church.— And to shew that the receiving of Christianity it self was no exemption from paying all Obedience to them, he commands his own Disciples, as well as the Multitude, to pay them all manner of Obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Saviour is declar'd, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>the end of the Law.</hi> Then he must of necessity be the end of that Worship and Communion which was grounded on the Law: And that the receiving of Christianity was an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Obedience, in that Worship and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> is positive, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. for Christianity was not to be blended with Judaisims. And when our Saviour said, Matt. 23.3. <hi>Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they bid you observe, that observe and do.</hi> He did not thereby continue the observance of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law, beyond the date of the Sealing his own Testament with his Blood: For if he had, then all who are not in Communion with the <hi>Jews</hi> at this Day are Schismaticks; and which is worse, the <hi>Snake</hi> says, it is from the Devil.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 59. <hi>And the Apostles, after our Saviour, frequented the Jewish Temple,</hi> Luke 24.53. <hi>And ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served their hours of Publick Worship,</hi> Acts 3.1.</p>
               <p>This Adversary would here falsly and Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically insinuate, as if the Apostles hereby joined in Communion with the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was against the whole Scope of their Commission. The Business of the Apostles in the Temple, and wheresoever else their Lots were, was to preach up Faith and Salvation through Repentance, in and by that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus whom the <hi>Jews</hi> had Crucified: For this purpose they went to the Jewish Temple; and no wonder they went at the hour of Prayer, because then they might find the People together: That this was the Reason, why they went at the hour of Prayer,

is fully seen by the Sermon of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3.12. to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 60. <hi>But the Quaker-notion of the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and their pretence to Infallibility, as consequential to it, does totally root up and destroy all Church Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Order: For if the Light within be God, it must be self-sufficient, and not to need the Rules and Directions of any other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apostles, it's allowed, were infallibly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by the Holy Ghost, God in them; yet this was so far from rooting up and destroying all Church Government, that they by the Directions of the Holy Spirit did give Rules and Directions for Discipline in the Churches, where they laboured to bring the People to be partakers, with them, of the same Promise, which was, <hi>Christ in them, the hope of Glory.</hi>

               <p>Ibid. p. 60. <hi>Vpon this Ground the</hi> Quakers <hi>broke off from the Church, and refused to be under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any outward Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis false, the <hi>Quakers</hi> broke not off upon this Ground, but rather to carry on that Reformation which the <hi>Church of England</hi> began here, when she broke off from <hi>Rome.</hi> Neither did the <hi>Quakers</hi> ever refuse <hi>to be under the Government of any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Authority</hi>; for we always, for Conscience sake, have been Obedient to Authority, by actively do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what in Conscience we could, or by passively suffering for what in Conscience we could not do. Let the <hi>Snake</hi> say so much for himself, if he can, and prove it.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 60. <hi>And thus they stood several years, in the Infancy of their State, till they began to grow numerous and rich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis false, we never were, even when first a People, without Government and Discipline, such as might answer the good end of the Gospel of


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63041:78"/>
Christ. But that there may be occasion, as the Community enlarges, to add some points of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, for the same good end for which the first were appointed, Holy Writ does sufficiently justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. — The Disciples, while in their <hi>Infancy,</hi> had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Acts 2.44. and 4.32. <hi>All things common,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, particular Churches, made Contributions for the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When they grew more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, the Question of the Circumcision began to trouble the Churches, in <hi>Syria, Antioch and Cilecia,</hi> concerning which the Apostles sent a Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> Acts 15.25. And in after times as the Churches and their Necessities did increase, the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. and 10.25, 27. did yet enlarge the Borders of that Discipline, which was before setled: And to other Churches according to their Necessities; such was their prescribed Discipline. Thus at first, while the Professors of Christianity were few, there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities were so too; but as their Numbers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, so did their Necessities; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Overseers of the Church did provide ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, that they might in all things adorn the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> Tit. 2.10. who is a God of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And as the fullest state of their Discipline was no contradiction, to their few first Precepts, so neither was a contradiction, to the infallible <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> Tit. 11.12. to the Guidings whereof, the end of their Preaching was to bring People. I come now to his Tenth and Last Head of Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Concerning that Church Government which is among the</hi> Quakers.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 61. <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>pretence to Infallibility, has been disproved</hi>; First, <hi>In particular Instances of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their Prophets.</hi> — Secondly, <hi>In whole Floods and Parties; for</hi> F. Bugg <hi>and many others have come openly off from their Communion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:63041:78"/>The particular Instances, which the <hi>Snake</hi> hath brought, have been above sufficiently disproved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either falsly or insufficiently by him pretended. But had they been all, such as the <hi>Snake</hi> hath pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet then they cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> not have answered his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to overthrow the Infallibility of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; as is also largely before declared.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That whole Floods and Parties have left us, F. Bugg</hi> is, with the <hi>Snake,</hi> an Instance; and indeed a particular, single, weak one. But had the Floods and Parties been much greater, than ever yet any were, that did Apostatize and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slide from us: They may indeed be Instances of such Backsliders, as those mentioned 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. but no Argument that the Holy Spirit of God is not Infallible; for as by the power of that, in times past, these backsliders were in some degree washed; so had they continued under its Guidings, it would have made them altogether clean. Whereas, by deserting it, they are returned to wallow in the Mire again. This Through Disobedience hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to many in the Primitive times. Nay, so general was the Defection and Backsliding of that People, that the Holy Spirit expresseth it by <hi>the Church going into the Wilderness:</hi> For Darkness and Apostacy did overspread all Lands.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 62. <hi>Now if their above-told pretences to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility do hold, then it will follow, that these their former Opinions, which the Separatists now condemn, were true Then, and false Now. Nay, that they are both true and false, even now; because some</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>do hold them to be true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A fine Conclusion! and spakes thus much. If the Declared Claim of the <hi>Church of England</hi> to Loyalty do hold, then it will follow, that that Declared Claim which the <hi>Snake,</hi> and other such Separates now condemn, was true <hi>then,</hi> and false


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63041:79"/>
                  <hi>now.</hi> Nay, that it is both true and false even <hi>now</hi>; because that Church doth still declare that Claim. Thus, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou seest the folly of this <hi>Snake</hi>'s reasoning; and it cannot be otherwise, when Men shall attempt to prove, by the precarious and evil practice of Particulars, the Unsoundness of Principles; Good Principles do always abide the same, whatsoever the Practice of their Professors may be. Thus the Grace and Spirit of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues Infallible, let whosoever will backslide from it, and Loyalty continues to be Loyalty still, if the <hi>Snake</hi> never practice it.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 62, 63. <hi>But if</hi> Keith <hi>and</hi> Bugg <hi>were true</hi> Quakers, <hi>then true</hi> Quakers <hi>are not Infallible: And then</hi> G. Fox, &amp;c. <hi>(who said they were Infallible) were led by the Spirit of Delusion, and not the Spirit of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Keith</hi> and <hi>Bugg,</hi> with whosoever else that can be nam'd, that have Apostatized: While they were led by the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> were by that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly led, and it was no Delusion to affirm so much of them or others, while in their obedience to that Infallible Guide. But <hi>G. Fox,</hi> &amp;c. did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver say, that any were, or could be Infallibly led, but by the Holy Spirit: Therefore <hi>G. F.</hi> &amp;c. were not herein led by the <hi>Spirit of Delusion,</hi> but by the <hi>Spirit of Truth.</hi>

               <p>Ibid. p. 63. <hi>The Infallibility of the private Spirit, or of each particular</hi> Quaker, <hi>is now damned by their Church; and their Infallibility is now reduced by them, — to that of their Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis a notorious Falshood, that ever Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was by us placed in the private Spirit of any, or every <hi>Quaker,</hi> as it is by this <hi>Snake</hi> asserted, or that it is now reduced to the Church.

or particularly working in the Hearts of Men.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 64. <hi>All I am concerned for at present, is, that their Churches have censured these Separatists, and given Judgment against the Light within parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Persons; which was the Original Pretence, and only Infallible Guide of the first</hi> Quakers. <hi>And upon this only ground, they exclaim'd against any Church, assuming Authority over any Man's private Spirit, or his Light within, as Anti-christian and Diabolical, and gave this as the reason of their Separation from the Church of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>One, but not the <hi>only,</hi> reason and ground of some that separated from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> might possibly be Her Hierarchy and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or assumed Authority over Conscience; as she in her turn, made it part of the reason for her Separation from <hi>Rome,</hi> as see <hi>Apologia Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae Anglicanae,</hi> printed 1617. But that bond of Union and spiritual Fellowship, which united us to be a People, was, First and Principally, The Light of Jesus Christ shining into our Hearts, whereby through obedience, we had and have Unity with all, who in any measure are turned to it, and walk in it; and by this Union of Spirit, we were gathered into one Body of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Fellowship and Society, in matters of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Discipline; and being so gathered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to particular Assemblies or Churches (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to place) at unity: The Authority which these our Assemblies do claim towards them that do so declare themselves Members, and who do believe and profess the same Doctrines and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Faith, and are so distinguish'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated, is grounded in this: That every such Member is gathered as above, and not by any external constraint or outward respect, but only


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63041:80"/>
by the real force of Truth upon their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. And of such as do profess to be so ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into Unity and Fellowship with us: If any shall Innovate in Doctrine and Discipline, and make Defection from the Spirit of Love, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that Belief and Profession, which by the force of Truth, and Convictions of God's Grace on their Hearts, they did make and declare at their coming into Unity and Fellowship with us: Such, the Church or Assembly hath Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Separated from the Body; because by this their Innovation and Defection, they have dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that bond of Union, by which they became Members; and when censure is denounced against these who are thus separated; It cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted or esteemed, <hi>A giving Judgment against the Light within particular Persons:</hi> Because the Light of Jesus Christ is not contrary to it self; and if by the inshinings of that, it was, that they through obedience came into Fellowship, and did profess and declare to believe as above; it does necessarily follow, that their Innovation and Defection must proceed from being darken'd and decay'd from that Life of Righteousness in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which was the first Principle of true Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And when we have declared <hi>against any Church assuming Authority</hi> towards any Man, and that Light of Grace which is in him; it hath been because such Church hath assumed that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without that previous bond of Union which is above declared.</p>
               <p>Having thus briefly, but truly, stated the Ground and Nature of that Government which is among us, and the reason of our refusing Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment not so constituted; it will serve to dispatch all the Objections of the <hi>Snake</hi> upon this head with greater speed.</p>

               <p>From <hi>p.</hi> 64. to 68. The <hi>Snake</hi> is wholly imploy'd on <hi>G.

               <p>
                  <hi>Snake</hi> p. 67. <hi>Here is a many forked and involved Infallibility, one Meeting Justifying, another Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> G.

               </p>
               <p>That particular Persons may make Defection from the Guidings of the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> and may Apostatize from that Union and Fellowship which they had once with the Friends of it: I have


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63041:81"/>
already largly shewn, and what particulars may do; Assemblies made up of such particulars, may also do: <hi>Floods and Parties</hi> (as the <hi>Snake</hi> expresses it) may Apostatize as well as particulars; nay, a whole Community may Apostatize, and yet the Infallibility of the Guide, of any one particular Person, who continues Faithful and Obedient to the Holy Spirit, remains firm and sure. Thus 1 Cor. 10.4. The Apostle testifies of the Jews, <hi>They all Drank the same spiritual Drink, for they Drank of that Spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.</hi> Now this Rock could have as Infallibly preserved, the whole Tribes of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> from <hi>Egypt,</hi> thro' the Wilderness to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Land, had they been Obedient to it, as it did <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi> who were the only two of all the Thousands that left <hi>Egypt,</hi> and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in.</p>
               <p>But further, that Assemblies or Churches may Apostatize and Backslide, the Holy Spirit is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Warrant, by the particular reproofs or cautions it gives to the seven <hi>Asiatick</hi> Churches, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. and 3. And sure the <hi>Snake</hi> will not be so hardy as to say, that the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was able only to give Reproof and Caution suitable to their wants and defects, but not to have preserved them blameless, and to have guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them Infallibly in that way he appointed them to go.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 68. <hi>Besides this first proof in</hi> Pensilvania, <hi>there is yet another more express and positive, called,</hi> The Barbadoes Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> —</p>

               <p>Ibid. p. 69, 70. <hi>I was told by one present at the Quaker Meeting at</hi> Ratcliff, <hi>on Sunday the</hi> 17<hi>th of</hi> February, 1694/5;. <hi>That Mr.</hi> Penn <hi>having Preached, and after</hi> G.

                  <q>In the Name of the Lord, I pronounce him an Apostate, over the Head of him.</q>
                  <hi>Vpon which occasion I have these few Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions to ask.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Whether this was a Sentence from Mr.</hi> Penn <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or from their Church?</hi> —</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether by an Ordinary Commission of Succession to Christ and the Apostles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether by an Extraordinary Commission such as the Prophets and the Apostles had? —</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the first, <hi>W. Penn</hi> being in Unity with the Church, declared this, of one who had broken Unity by making defection from that term of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which in time passed, he had declared he was by the Light of Christ in him, led to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> All who are kept living by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, in that bond of Union which that did at first lead into, such have ordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63041:82"/>
therefrom to testifie against Apostates. And this not by such falsly pretended Succession, as the Papal Chair, or others may pretend to from the Apostles: But by succeeding, in a measure of that same Light and Holy Spirit which they were in.</p>
               <p>To the Last, <hi>W. Penn,</hi> tho' then knowing <hi>G. K.</hi> to have broken Union, as is before expressed; he might at that time, in the Openings of the Spirit of Truth, have a larger and fuller Sight of his Apostacy, and so a Warrant to Declare it. And for this there needed no new Credentials, <hi>viz.</hi> Miracles, it being no more than what hath been confirmed by those the Apostles wrought.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 72. <hi>But for the present, I only apply it to the point of their Church Authority over the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in particular Persons, their original and great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Light within particular Persons, is as much our Characteristick now as ever; and we have no Church Authority over it, or repugnant to it, and that in the case of <hi>G. K.</hi> no such Authority was used, Consider the following Lines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. Keith</hi> hath often Printed and Declared, that he did believe and profess the same Doctrines and Principles of Faith with us; and that he was led so to do, only by the Light of Jesus Christ shining into his Heart. Through, and by which Light he did profess to have true union and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with us, and accordingly he so was deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and distinguished.</p>
               <p>Now the Light of Jesus Christ, is not contrary to it self, and if by the inshinings thereof, and his obedience to it, it was, that <hi>G. K.</hi> did profess as above. Then it naturally follows, <hi>G. K</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, to the contrary of what he hath so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, cannot proceed from that Light of Jesus Christ, from which the above profession of Unity and Fellowship did.</p>

Story,</hi> &amp;c. and others, who have innovated and made defection as these did, whose Works being bad; the issue is the same with what <hi>Gamaliel</hi> shews, Acts 5.28. <hi>They are come to naught.</hi> And therefore after all the Boast which the <hi>Snake</hi> makes about Separation and Faction: We may, concerning all of them, now declining, and towards their end, hope and have ground to believe, that as many as are yet in a Spirit of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, in whom are any true desires towards God for his guidance in the Truth, such he will restore to the Fold they have strayed from. And he will scatter them whose end is not his Honour; agreeable to what the Psalmist said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Wicked, Psal. 37.36. <hi>He is gone, I sought him, but he could not be found.</hi> And of as many as keep in their first Love, <hi>E.

               <p>'Tis false, the Meeting in <hi>Harp-Lane</hi> is dropt.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 75. <hi>There is yet a Fourth Church of the</hi> Quakers — <hi>It is true, they are disowned by all the rest, but as much disowning them.</hi> We have the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Authority for it, that they are none of us: But however, consider them a little further, and see to whom they do belong.</p>
               <p>P. 76, 77. The <hi>Snake</hi> Relates (how truly, I know not) a great many bad Tenets they hold, and bad Actions that they do: He says <hi>They Dance as well as Pray by the Spirit.</hi> Their Ringleader whom he calls <hi>Tho. Case,</hi> he says <hi>Preached in a Surplice.</hi>


                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:63041:83"/>
By the Principles I could not tell to what Church this <hi>Case</hi> belong'd; but for the Surplice we know what Church uses it.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 78. <hi>And I can name one, who reasoning with one of these concerning the outward Christ (Oh horror to repeat it!) he bid that Christ kiss his</hi> —</p>
               <p>And if so, what relation hath that to us? For the <hi>Snake</hi> had said just before, that we disown them, and they disown us; so that he might as well have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, (for any relation it has to us) <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostates Blaspemies against Christ, and insinuated, <hi>Snake</hi> like, that they were owned by us.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 78. <hi>And it was not behind this, which a</hi> Quaker Preacher, <hi>now in</hi> London, <hi>said to one, (I can produce) who was endeavouring to persuade him that Christ was now a Man, the Preacher replied,</hi> The Man Christ, a F—rt.</p>
               <p>The villany of this expression is indeed, not much behind his last. For I do deny, that any Preacher, own'd among us, hath at any time so spoken; and Dare the <hi>Snake</hi> to prove to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary if he can. We have now another Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how fairly made, the Reader shall see.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 79. Quoted from <hi>Brief Examination, and State of Liberty Spiritual,</hi> Printed 1681. p. 11. <hi>He tells those</hi> Quakers <hi>who stuck to their own Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, rather than the Orders of</hi> G. Fox, <hi>and his Church.</hi>
                  <q>And this I affirm (says he) from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that I have received of God, that the Enemy is at work to scatter the Minds of Friends, by that loose plea, <hi>What hast thou to do with me? leave me to my freedom, and to the Grace of God in my self, and the like.</hi> —</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Snake</hi> makes a break, leaving out three Lines, and then continues a long Quotation. The <hi>Snake</hi> says, that <hi>W. P.</hi> speaks this, <hi>to those</hi> Quakers <hi>who stuck to their own Light within.</hi> Now whether


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63041:84"/>
he did or not, pray, <hi>Reader,</hi> by the following Lines, which the <hi>Snake</hi> left out at the Break, as I have before hinted, thou mayst observe; they are thus — <hi>And the like; but this proposition and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, as now understood and alledged, is a deviation from, and a perversion of the ancient Principle of Truth.</hi> Thus, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou sees, what <hi>W. P.</hi> objects to them was, that they <hi>did not stick to their own Light within,</hi> but were in that Plea, and explanation of it, deviated from the Ancient Principle of Truth, which in time past they professed. So that the Judgment was not <hi>against the Light within,</hi> but against <hi>the deviation and perversion.</hi> This is great injustice <hi>Reader,</hi> I doubt not thou wilt grant thus to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail a Man's words: but if greater may be, here is an instance for thee. The <hi>Snake</hi> by a horrid perversion, quotes <hi>W. P</hi>'s words to the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary purpose to which he uses them.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 81. <hi>But what if these</hi> Quakers, <hi>whose Light within, should allow them to take off their Hat, or Bow,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>appeared by all other circumstances to be Good, Honest and Conscientious Men? That would not do</hi>; For Mr. <hi>Penn in his address to Protestants,</hi> p. 245. says,
<q>Holy Living is become no Test among us, unless against the Liver. The Tree was once known by its Fruits, 'tis not so now; the better the Liver, the more Dangerous, unless, if not a Conformist.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This, <hi>Reader,</hi> is the Quotation, and the perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is this, If he be not a Conformist in these things, to pull off the Hat and Bow, Holy Living is no Test; nor is the Tree Known by its Fruits. A sense as remote from <hi>W. P</hi>'s Mind as any thing can be: And what shews it plainer, is the place it self, as it lies in that Book; where having numbred up six several causes of persecution; he proceeds.
<q>The Seventh and Last Cause I shall now assign


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63041:84"/>
for persecution is this, <hi>That</hi> Holy Living is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no Test among us, unless against the Liver. The Tree was once known by its Fruit, but now it is not so: The better Liver the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, if not a Conformist: This has made way for Persecution. There was a time when Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue was venerable, and Good Men admired; that's derided, and Opinion carries it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake,</hi> was in the wrong Box (considering how much he is used to play) when he brought to remembrance by his perversion, this Quotation. For the Persecution here spoken of, was that mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the <hi>Church of England</hi>; and the Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then required, was to her self, the Test, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and was not a Holy Life; for <hi>Virtue was then deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and Opinion carried it.</hi> It is one of her Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes; and if this rebellious Son, had not herein been to her, what <hi>Ham,</hi> was to his Father <hi>Noah,</hi> it might at this time have been covered for me.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 82. <hi>But have they not worldly Coertion here? Yes, beyond what the</hi> Church of England, <hi>or any other Church have in their Power. For they being mostly a trading People, and chiefly among themselves, whoever is disowned — By their Church, does,</hi> Ipso facto, <hi>lose his Trade among them; and there is not one of an hundred of them, but must be thereby broke and undone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have not any <hi>Worldly Coertion,</hi> either to whip Men into the Temple, or keep them there; for, as is shewn, p. 135, 136, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All who are truly Members of our Body, and are in true Fellowship with us, were gathered so to be; not by <hi>Worldly Coertion,</hi> or outward respect; but only by the real force of Truth upon their Understanding, and the Convictions of God's Grace upon their Hearts: and we disown not any (in their fallings away) who have not first thus pretended. But the <hi>Church


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63041:85"/>
of England,</hi> much <hi>beyond</hi> this, hath (lately) claim'd Power over all the Subjects of the Realm, by whipping some into the Temple, and some for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out; and by her pretended Spiritual Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication hath deprived many, who never were of her Communion, of their Civil Benefits: For one Excommunicate, might not be an Executor, receive a Legacy, or sue for his Just Debts. In fine, it deprived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him of his Property, and put him out of the King's Protection. Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> see whether this <hi>Worldly Coertion</hi> be not beyond our Power, as we know it to be beyond our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and liking. For whoever is disowned by us, for practices contrary to the Terms of their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Fellowship, is not thereby broke and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done in his outward estate, (which the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication above hath sometimes threatned) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our disowning of Backsliders, and Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists does only extend to testifie against such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Practices; and it is the Duty of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Community so to do: And I herein charge the <hi>Snake</hi> with a Lie, till he can prove <hi>Fifty in one Hundred,</hi> who have been <hi>broke and undone</hi> in their Trade, by such our Testimonies.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 83. <hi>The surest method for a Young Man to step into an Abounding Trade, and a Rich Wife, is to set up first for a Preacher — of which many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples daily occur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' the <hi>Snake</hi> (in his own Language p. 16.) does <hi>boldly and impudently</hi> aver this, yet no such Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples do daily occur, because we own not any for true Preachers, who do so set up themselves: But who are thereunto <hi>inwardly moved of the Holy Ghost:</hi> And this Call the <hi>Snake</hi> would have us think he owns, it being a previous Question to Ordination, as himself says, p. 316.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This remaining Topick, will, on examination, like the rest, be turned Topsie Turvy: for why should a real mistake be more prevalent, to make a Man relinquish the guidings of the Spirit of Truth, which is able and ready, infallibly to guide him in all that concerns his Salvation, Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Eternal Life? Then the <hi>Snake</hi>'s false Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion of Heretical Opinions, which, he says, we hold: Which if it were true, were a better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against Infallibility, than the most Childish blunder that can be.</p>
               <p>He quotes <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Christian Quaker,</hi> p. 104. repeated by <hi>Tho. Elwood,</hi> in his <hi>Truth Defended,</hi> p. 167.

               <head>SECT. VI. Concerning the Authority of the Holy Scriptures.</head>
               <p>WE have always testified according to 2 Tim. 3.16. <hi>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness.</hi> And the reason of this is, because according to 2 Pet. 1.21. <hi>The Prophecy came not in old time by the will of Man, but Holy Men of God, spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi> And therefore it is, that we have constantly directed Men to the Holy Spirit for the true understanding of them; by the movings where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were at first written. For as they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a true declaration of the things of God, so they are not to be truly understood, but by the Spirit of God. How much the contrary of this can be prov'd by this <hi>Snake,</hi> I shall now examine.</p>
               <p>Snake p. 85. <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>notion of the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (as before explained) must necessarily out off our dependance upon the Holy Scriptures, as a Rule either of Faith or Manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Light within, Christ in us,</hi> as before I have explained; as it is not contrary to the Scriptures: So it does not cut them off from being useful, as before declared, <hi>viz.</hi> for Doctrine, Reproof, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For tho' the Holy Spirit is as infallible now as ever, and it is the same Holy Spirit, (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the Hearts of Men at this day) by which the Holy Men did write the Scriptures; yet the manifestations thereof to them, being in greater


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63041:87"/>
degree, we justly give them the priority; this with respect to the Writings, of any faithful Servant of Christ at this day. But with respect to the Holy Spirit, that being (as I have just now said) as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble now as ever; it must of necessity also follow, that whosoever, through obedience, follows the guidings of it, must have as sure (because the same) rule as the Prophets and Apostles had. And this is no more contradictory, than the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Talents, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. In which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour shews the different proportions of Trust of the same Treasure: And the one Talent had it been imployed in the same way which the five were, it would as certainly have gained Profit. Thus they who, through obedience, improve their Talent, and are in the Apostles Phrase, 2 Cor. 6.1. <hi>Workers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Christ,</hi> they shall witness a growth in his Grace; and who do so grow, have the same <hi>sure rule</hi> of the Holy Spirit to read and understand the Scriptures by, even the same <hi>sure rule</hi> which the Prophets and Apostles had when they writ them. Hence it is, that he that hath and obeys the least measure of this <hi>sure Rule,</hi> the Holy Spirit in himself, will easily and readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and consent to the further Degrees of the revealed Will of the Holy Spirit recorded in the Scriptures of Truth.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 85, 86. <hi>But because the Scriptures are often brought in crontradiction to the</hi> Quaker-Light, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have made it their business to depreciate and undervalue them; nay, sometimes to run them down as hurtful and pernicious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Light of Jesus Christ, which we profess, cannot be in contradiction to the Holy Scripture; and therefore when so brought, it hath been by such, who, as our Saviour saith, Matt. 22.29. <hi>Do err not knowing the Scriptures, nor the Power of


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63041:88"/>
God.</hi> Nor did we ever <hi>depreciate, undervalue or run them down.</hi> The Charge is false, as will more manifestly appear by the instances he brings.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 86. <hi>To make them false in many things, that we may believe them, or trust to them in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. To make their Authority Doubtful, by dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Pen-Men, and raising all the evil Suggestions that can be against them. The Quakers Refuge, Printed</hi> 1673. p. 17. <hi>States this as truly owned by the</hi> Quakers.</p>
               <p>The Book, <hi>Quakers Refuge,</hi> does not State this as owned by us; that the Scriptures are false in any thing; Nor does it raise evil Suggestions, nor dispute the <hi>Pen-Men</hi> of them: That there have been very many Questions raised concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and the Pen-Men of some Books or Epistles; the many Treatises on them Subjects are sufficient Evidence: But it not being profitable here to remember them, I pass them by in Silence. Now several of these Questions, the Author of <hi>The Quakers Refuge,</hi> numbers up, and concludes (p. 17.) <hi>It is not the Subject of my Argument at this time.</hi> But that which he therein declares to be the Subject of his Argument, is, <hi>The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Holy Spirit in Judging or Discerning the Mind of God in the Holy Scriptures.</hi> This he saith, <hi>Is as truly stated as owned by us</hi>; and he declares it to be <hi>the concern</hi> therein <hi>under most Serious Consideration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, Reader, is the true import of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's words; which the <hi>Snake</hi> hath as Injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously perverted, as before I have detected him, p. 144, 145. perverting <hi>W. P</hi>'s words, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he will get, is much the same; because, I must hereupon shew thee, Reader, that what seems to be the occasion of the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Cavil and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, is, because we assert the Authority of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> in <hi>Judging or Discerning the Mind of


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63041:88"/>
God in the Holy Scriptures:</hi> Which Truth, as it obtains upon the minds of Men, will rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them to wait for the sensible experience thereof in themselves, than to depend implicitly upon the guest Opinions of any, who deny the possibility of such certain guide at this day.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 87. <hi>Whitehead says that there were some Priests in the North, in and before the Year</hi> 1653. <hi>when those Books (which</hi> Bugg <hi>quoted) were Printed, who were thus Ignorant: And that this was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for those expressions in the Quaker Books. First, this had been no reason for these Barbarous Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if it had been so: But, Secondly, I will joyn Issue with</hi> G. W. <hi>upon it, that there never were such Priests in the North, or any where else, that were so Ignorant. No</hi> George! <hi>This is an Arrant Lye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt; did any Man ever think or say, that the very material Paper, and Ink, and Letters, wou'd endure for ever?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there were in the North, &amp;c. Priests Scandalously Ignorant herein, I will presently shew; and if they were reproved herein, in such manner as they might account contemptuous. The Expressions are not therefore Barbarous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause so called by the <hi>Snake</hi>; as I may also shew from Authority of Holy Writ, and the Practice of (them esteem'd by the <hi>Snake</hi>) the Fathers, as (that expressions which seem contemptuous, are not therefore so, being in their end directed to rectify the evil Practices of Men) related by <hi>John Daille.</hi> To the First, <hi>viz.</hi> the Authority of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, we know that the <hi>Sacrifices, Oblations</hi> and <hi>Offerings,</hi> mentioned in the Levetical Law, had a Divine Sanction; and the promise annexed, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Ye shall therefore keep my Statutes and Judgments, which if a Man do, he shall live in them, I am the Lord.</hi> These tho' they had the Promise

of this Life, yet the Jews thro' their Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, made these their Sacrifices not delightful to the Lord; their Oblations were Vain, and their Incense an Abomination, and New Moons and appointed Feasts his Soul hated, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.11, 13, 14. And by their continuance in Disobedience, while in performance of the Letter of the Ceremonial Law; the same Prophet, 66.3. tells them from the Lord, <hi>He that killeth an Ox, is as if he slew a Man; he that Sacrificeth a Lamb, as if he cut off a Dogs neck; and he that burneth Incense, as if he bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an Idol.</hi> These in the Judgment of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, must be very <hi>Barbarous Expressions of these Ordinances, and which there was no reason for,</hi> tho' the People were departed from that true use, to which they were at first appointed. Tho' this be an abundant Testimony, that through Mens misuse of things, appointed by God to a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate purpose, he hath been pleased to shew and declare his dis-esteem of them: Yet I shall (not to confirm this Testimony, for it needs it not) but for the Readers Satisfaction, also shew the Practice of the Fathers herein, as testified by <hi>John Daille,</hi> in his <hi>Right use of the Fathers,</hi> first Book, p. 194.
<q>Whilst they beat down one Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, they seem to run into the contrary Error: In like manner, as those who would streighten a crooked Plant, are wont to bow it as much the contrary way, that so having been worked out of its former bent, it may at length rest in a middle posture.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now if our Friends have formerly met with those in the Priesthood, whose crooked expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did need streightning, they are not to be wondred at, or condemned in their Christian en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for that end.</p>

                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:63041:89"/>And whether there were such or not, I will now joyn Issue with the <hi>Snake</hi> and shew, from a much narrower compass than the extents of the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Challenge, which is, <hi>That there never were in any place such Priests.</hi>

               <p>Now, Reader, upon the Issue joyned, in this little space, whether appears the <hi>Arrant Lyar? G. Whitehead</hi> in saying, <hi>There were in the North</hi> (where most of these did live) <hi>Priests, who had so affirmed of the Letter of the Scriptures,</hi> or the <hi>Snake</hi> in saying; <hi>That neither there nor any where else were such Priests?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it cannot be allowed, I suppose, That the <hi>Written</hi> Word and <hi>Letter</hi> of the Scripture, as above affirmed, is either <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Power</hi> of


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:63041:90"/>
God, or the <hi>Iudge</hi> of the World, or <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> or the <hi>Sword</hi> of the Spirit: These and the like crooked Expressions, of some in the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, it was the necessary work of our Friends, to oppose and straiten, according to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Holy Writ; not that we then did, or now do, charge all the Men with whom these so affirming have held fellowship, to have the same Sentiments, tho' this be the Practice of the <hi>Snake</hi> against us, notwithstanding his distinction in the Title page of his Libel.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 88. <hi>How comes it, that since they are such bitter Enemies to the Letter, they yet make a Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of saying Thee and Thou instead of You, in the Singular, because these were old English words in the first Translations?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not ask <hi>How comes it?</hi> That envy and prejudice is Blind and Ignorant. We are not <hi>bitter Enemies</hi> to the Letters, of which the Books of Scripture are composed: No, Sober Reader, that which we have opposed (and for our so doing, have the Authority of the Scriptures) is, that Men should only from them, gather some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the dealings of God with the Holy Men in past Ages, and from their Declarations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (nay sometimes contrary to them) make to themselves Creeds, and herein Copy after those, to whom our Saviour says, <hi>Ye search the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, in them ye think to have Eternal Life, but ye will not come unto me, that ye may have Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This we have opposed, and directed Men to the Spirit of God in them, to which as they are obedient, they will find it to open the Scriptures to them, and give comfort in the reading of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:63041:90"/>
                  <hi>Thee and Thou instead of You in the Singular,</hi> are as well Modern English Words as Old, from the Essential difference that there is, between the Signification of <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Many</hi>; and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it is (according to the best Information I can get) that there is hardly any Nation, whose Language does not differently express that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Signification: And that which engages us, Conscientiously to this Practice, is, not that they are <hi>Old English Words,</hi> but that the same Holy Spirit in us at this day, leads to that same Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Language, which it did lead the Servants of God into in former Ages: And in all Ages of the World it hath been the Language of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit to Man. And accordingly, before our day, at the beginning of the Reformation, <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and others, whose Language was not Old or Modern English, did reprove that Vanity of Mind, which did practice and acccept the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 88. <hi>Is there any Immorality or Iniquity in these Letters,</hi> Y. o. u. <hi>more than in</hi> T. h. o. u?</p>
               <p>Foolish Question! Which may serve to please and tickle the Wanton: But, Sober Reader, I doubt not, thou wilt perceive the Vanity of the Querist.</p>
               <p>The Alphabet, which with us, according to its various joynings, does serve to express the thoughts of our Minds, cannot have <hi>Immorality</hi> or <hi>Iniquity</hi> in the Letters. Yet whosoever in evil Mind, by joyning them, does express words, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Blasphemous, Profane, Hypocritical, Unjust, as this <hi>Snake,</hi> or any other way bad, in their Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; of these, Men do pronounce according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And thus it is, if any to shun the Cross of our Lord Jesus, tho' in this small matter of the plain Language, and to please the vain Mind,


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63041:91"/>
contrary to the Convictions of the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> in themselves, shall say, <hi>You</hi> instead of <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou,</hi> such will find that disobedience their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>In p. 89, 90. <hi>Snake</hi> has gathered many instances from <hi>G.

F</hi>'s Answer to <hi>Christopher Wade, Great Mystery,</hi> p. 246. <hi>They (the Scriptures) are not the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this soon vanishes, for upon Examination of <hi>Christopher Wade</hi>'s words, they seem to imply, as if he affirmed of the Scriptures, that they were the Eternal and In-dwelling Word of God, and therefore, and thereupon, <hi>G. Fox</hi> opposed him, and asserted <hi>Christ to be the Word of God,</hi> p. 247. <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> which is true, and from him the Eternal <hi>Word</hi>; the Servants of God have often said to the People, <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord.</hi> And the meaning of it both in the Prophets and since, is only this, Hear from the Eternal Word a Declaration of his Will.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 91. <hi>They knew that the Holy Scriptures could not be discarded openly and above-board, nor all at once: That the World has been long in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of them, and of a just Veneration of them; and therefore would not part with them, nor accept of any</hi> Fox<hi>'s Inspirations instead of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the World hath been long in the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Books of Scriptures we well know, but for want of being in possession of the Holy Spi-the Power of God, they have erred not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, and therefore could not have a just Value or Esteem for them: And God who knoweth the Sincerity of our Hearts, he knoweth that our earnest Endeavour since a People, hath been to direct to the Holy Spirit to which, as the


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63041:91"/>
World comes to be obedient, it will certainly raise in them a just value and esteem for the Scriptures, and a love and desire to be conversant in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; by which, through Faith, they may receive comfort, as we can abundantly testifie we have found: And therefore the Insinuation is false and envious, that we have ever sought, either openly or secretly <hi>to discard them,</hi> or to set up the Inspirations of any <hi>instead of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 91. <hi>They have taken upon them, not only to abrogate the most express Ordinances of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel — But to set up and institute new ones, as Womens Preachings (directly contrary to</hi> 1 Cor. 16.35.) <hi>and the Prelacy of the Womens Meetings, an Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on never heard of in the World, till</hi> G. F. <hi>Cobled it out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis false, that we have abrogated any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Divine Institution. And it is also false, that we have <hi>set up</hi> and <hi>instituted</hi> new ones. For under the Law, and in the Apostles days, there were Women Prophetesses, and Fellow-helpers in the Gospel. As for the <hi>Prelacy</hi> of Womens Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, we know of no such thing; but for the good ends of looking after the Poor, and seeing after such things as are Comely, Decent and of Good Report, do they meet, as the Holy Women in ancient times did. And as it is no discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us, so it will not be of weight with the Sober Reader, that this practice is <hi>profanely</hi> said by the <hi>Snake,</hi> to be <hi>Cobled</hi> out by <hi>G. Fox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 92. <hi>The Scripture remains of no Authority with them; because, if, what the Scripture command be a-new required by their Spirit, they are bound to obey it, because required by their Spirit. But if the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture command the thing, they are (by their Principles) not bound to obey it, unless it is required by their Spirit a-new.</hi>

This is what <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> had formerly said, and which <hi>W. Penn</hi> repeats and maintains, though very falsly quoted by the <hi>Snake,</hi> who injuriously quotes <hi>W.

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>W. P</hi>'s words, as they lye in the Book and Page quoted, are thus.
<q>From our asserting, that what was a Commandment to any Servant of God in Old Times, is not so to us, because so to them; that is, such as Going to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as Going Naked, Going to the King's Chappel, as <hi>Moses, Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Amos</hi> did; as also those Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Types, Shadows and Figures appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a season, and to pass off.

                  <q>It is not a little his endeavour, unrighteously to infer, that those, Moral, Perpetual, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Holy Precepts <hi>(here</hi> W. P. <hi>mentions the Laws of the First Table)</hi> are not binding upon us—<hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Ibid. p. 94. <hi>Thus it being Objected to</hi> G. F. <hi>that one of his</hi> Quakers <hi>had pretended to an Immediate Call from

Heaven to commit Theft, Robbery and Sacriledge, in taking out of the Church an Hour-glass,</hi> &amp;c.—</p>
               <p>It is false, it was not objected, that any <hi>Quaker</hi> did commit <hi>Theft</hi> or <hi>Robbery,</hi> or <hi>Sacriledge.</hi> Nor does it appear by the Priest's words, that the Hour-Glass was taken away.

F</hi>'s answer is to the same purpose: So that herein the <hi>Snake</hi> is egregiously abusive by perverting both the words of the Priest and <hi>G.

               <p>Not unless it be prov'd by the Holy Scriptures, that Episcopacy, at this day, be in the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Government which the Apostles were in.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 95. <hi>It is true indeed, the Church cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,—without Government. But it is as true, that the</hi> Quakers <hi>pretence to the private Light in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Persons, as a principle, over-ruling Scripture, and all outward Ordinances, is Inconsistent to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either in Church or State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is false, that we have ever pretended, that the Particular Manifestation of the Light of Christ in any of us, did <hi>over-rule the Scriptures or Ordinances.</hi> There cannot be Contradiction in the Spirit of God: By the movings whereof it was, that the Scriptures were given forth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.

as the Light and Spirit of Christ is thus agreeable to it self: So it is well consistent with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the State, in that it leads all that obey it, to be loving and peaceable, not Seditious or Tumultuous. It leads to give <hi>Caesar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, and unto God, the things that are God's. This it hath taught us to be our Duty, and our Practice hath been agreeable; of which the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are our witnesses. And it is not less consistent with <hi>the Government in the Church,</hi> when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Church hath its beginning and foundation from it, as described, p. 135, 136. foregoing. But it cannot be consistent with <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Church,</hi> when the Church is not govern'd by the Spirit of him, whom she says is her Spiritual Head.</p>

               <p>The Holy Spirit of God, which by the coming of Jesus Christ, is given to Men, is the Principle that we profess, and is the most effectual Security that can be, against wickedness and violence of all sorts; because where that is obeyed, it will finish Transgression, and make an end of Sin. Now did the Zealots among the <hi>Jews</hi> go upon the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple?

               <p>Ibid. p. 101. <hi>They know very well, that the giving of vile and contemptible Names to any Writing, can be for no other end, but to render the Contents of such Writing — contemptible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> then, render the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Ceremonial Law contemptible, when (as I have shewn p. 154.) he compared the <hi>Jews</hi> Sacrifices, to slaying a Man, and cutting off a Dogs Neck, and their burning of Incense to Blessing an Idol.</p>

               <p>The Reason why, in the Yearly Meeting Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, Slight and Contemptible Names and Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, concerning either Mens or Womens Meetings, or the Testimonies given forth by the Spirit and Power of God, through faithful Friends, or such whom the Lord hath made Elders in the service of the Church are blamed; is, because they do strike at the Spirit and Power of God, by which those things were appointed; and are designed, by them that use them, to bring those Things, Persons and Services into Contempt. But no Expressions have been used by us, concerning the Doctrines, or Holy Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contained in Holy Scriptures, to that end, or with that intent. But whatever has been said of the Scriptures, that is by our Adversaries thought mean,


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63041:94"/>
has been only intended to reprove and bring back to the Spiritual use of 'em, those that have almost deify'd the Letter.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 104. <hi>But in all their Preachings and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings before</hi> 1660. <hi>where-ever they had occasion to name the Holy Scriptures, they seldom or never gave them that Epithet of Holy or Sacred</hi> —</p>
               <p>Both before, and since the Year, 1660. Our Friends have frequently given, as Distinctive Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets, denoting the true and just Value and Esteem due to the Scriptures as the <hi>Snake</hi> can do: And if in his, or other our Adversaries occasions to name them, it is Emphasis sufficient to say, (as he and they most frequently have done) <hi>The Scriptures</hi>; why is it not so in us? Do our Adversaries do greater Honour to them, when they falsly say, we undervalue <hi>the Seriptures,</hi> than we do when we say we do Highly Value <hi>The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi> Hath not the word <hi>The</hi> as great an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis from our Mouths or Pens as from theirs? I think it has. But if the word <hi>The</hi> hath either no Emphasis, or not sufficient; then the <hi>Snake,</hi> as well as all former Adversaries, doth seldom either give them any, or sufficient Emphasis: Because they have most frequently only said <hi>the Scriptures.</hi> But further, Our Friends have frequently said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 1660. <hi>The Scriptures of Truth, The Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> &amp;c. of which, (for I spare not time to turn over Books for this purpose) there occurs at present <hi>R.

                  <q>That he prefer'd the Scriptures, before the Friends Books;</q>
                  <hi>which accusation,</hi> John Chandler <hi>did not deny, — but being reprov'd for it by the Meeting — said</hi> — "The People urg'd him to it. —<hi>One Principal Reason they gave for preference of their own Books to the Scriptures, was,</hi>
                  <q>That tho' the People had had the Scriptures many years, yet they had not Converted so many to the Truth, as Their Books had done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is a strange degree of Assurance, which this <hi>Snake</hi> frequently shews, in boldly and falsly aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that in Gross, and in the Lump, of which he can give no Proof; thus in p. 62, 63, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> foregoing, I have shewn the nullity of that Charge of his, which he says was prov'd in <hi>Legal Form,</hi> &amp;c. against <hi>G. F.</hi> and others: And that both He and They accused, were discharged, because the Matter was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as the <hi>Snake</hi> falsly hath alledged, of which see more in the place refer'd to. And now here with like false Assurance, he says, upon the Credit of Eye and Ear Witness (such as himself) that the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> gave a Judicial <hi>Determination and Solemn Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> against the Scriptures. Yet shews not, what this Determination and Judgment was. Which if there had been any such thing, no doubt but his Witness would have obtained a Copy of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination and Judgment, so Judicially and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly made and given, as well as have preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any of the Reasons on which that Judgment


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:63041:96"/>
was grounded. But of this so necessary a thing, as a Copy of that Judgment is, We have not one Syllable; the true Reason of which is, because there was no Original from whence to take it. But then why the <hi>Snake</hi> should baulk at that, and not forge a whole Paper; and give it the name of an Original, as well as forge the Title, <hi>viz. Judicial Determination</hi> and <hi>Solemn Judgment,</hi> or as well, as he hath forged that Slanderous and False Charge, in a matter of this same nature against <hi>R.

               <p>But after all, I also have <hi>Eye and Ear Witnesses</hi> to produce in opposition to his <hi>Eye and Ear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> who do say, That that Meeting, wherein the Difference between <hi>T.

               <p>Ibid. p. 108, 109. Edward Burroughs, p. 47. <hi>of his Works, determines clearly, that the Scriptures are not now of any Authority at all to us at this Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether this be <hi>E. B</hi>'s Determination, or the <hi>Snake</hi>'s, pray Reader consider the following true Quotation from p. 47. of <hi>E. B</hi>'s Works.
<q>That is no Command from God to me, what he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to another, neither did any of the Saints which we read of in Scripture, act by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:63041:96"/>
which was to another, not having the Command to themselves. I Challenge to find an Example for it? They obeyed every one their own Commands: One was sent to Baptize and to Preach the Gospel: Another was sent not to Baptize but to Preach the Gospel; and thou <hi>J. Turner,</hi> or any other who goes to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as you call it, by Imitation from the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without, which was Commands to others, in your own Wills and Time; your Sacrifice is not accepted, but is an Abomination to the Lord; for you go without the moving of the Spirit, in your own Wills and Strength, which God Hates.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Quotation the <hi>Snake</hi> hath pickt in two or three places, leaving out the particular Instances and Examples, and put it together, that so it might answer what he hath boldly and falsly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted as above of <hi>E. B.</hi> as before p. 160. I have detected him in the same manner, upon this point, abusing of <hi>W. Penn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Reader, pray consider the <hi>Snake</hi> says, <hi>E. B.</hi> has determined the Scriptures to <hi>be of no Authority to us at this Day</hi>; because he saith, the particular Commands from God to the Apostles, are not sufficient warrant for us to do the same things, which they were so particularly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do: But to do the work of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, we must know the movings of the Holy Ghost to call us to it.</p>
               <p>And now I will shew thee, that if this be <hi>to determine clearly that the Scriptures are not of any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority at all to us at this Day.</hi> Then according to the <hi>Snake</hi>'s words, the Church of <hi>England</hi> have <hi>clearly so determined.</hi> For he shewing what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm she owns, p. 316. speaking of their Church Offices, saith, <hi>This is the first Question demanded by


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:63041:97"/>
the Bishop from those who are to be ordained:</hi>
                  <q>Do you trust that you are inwardly mov'd by the Holy Ghost, to take upon you this Office? — Do you think that you are truly called accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Will of the Lord Jesus Christ?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here is according the <hi>Snake</hi>'s perversion, a clear Determination against the Scripture; for if the Commands from God to the Apostles, were sufficient not for themselves only, but for all succeeding times, to call them to the Work of the Ministry; what occasion is there for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop to ask, or any to know, whether they are thereunto <hi>inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost?</hi> Or that they thereunto <hi>are truely called according unto the Will of Jesus Christ?</hi> To do thus, can it be faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in us? and do we thereby deny the Scriptures, and yet the Church of <hi>England</hi> not thereby deny them?</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 110. <hi>And therefore it was no strange thing to hear</hi> G. W. <hi>in his</hi> Serious Apology, p. 49. <hi>Prefer not only their own Writings, but their</hi> Ex Tempore <hi>Preachments, and even all whatsoever they speak, upon any account, to the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would raise some Admiration in a Man, to find one (in his words, p. 16.) thus <hi>Boldly</hi> and <hi>Impudently</hi> asserting so notorious a Lye, as the experience of all that knows us must know this to be; <hi>Not only Writings and</hi> Ex Tempore <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but all whatsoever we say on any account, are preferred to the Scriptures.</hi> So that according to the <hi>Snake,</hi> what is spoken in Common Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the transacting our Civil Affairs, and Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Life, is thus prefer'd.</p>
               <p>Reader, I cannot here omit, by a serious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to thy self, on the great Injustice and False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of this Adversary: And if thou art one, who by Conversation with us, or our Books,


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63041:97"/>
hast any knowledge of us, thou dost know the Charge of this Adversary is false: And I do tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, that our Value and Esteem for the Books of the Old and New Testament, is much greater than for any other Book exstant in the World; and this <hi>G. W.</hi> doth freely own, and hath declared as much. So also in this particular, I will shew his falshood and perversion of <hi>G. W</hi>'s words in the place quoted, which the <hi>Snake</hi> has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously curtail'd.</p>
               <p>They are these,
<q>That which was spoken from the Spirit of Truth in any, is of as great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as the Scriptures, or Chapters are; and greater (intending as received, and proceeding immediately from that Spirit, and spoken in the sense thereof) as Christ's words were of greater Authority, when he spake, than the <hi>Pharisees</hi> reading the <hi>Letter,</hi> and they (in whom that Spirit speaketh not) — and their speaking we deny.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So that according to <hi>G. W</hi>'s words, that speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or reading of the Scriptures, which is deny'd to be of Authority; is, when spoken or read by such, in whom that Spirit speaketh not that gave forth the Scriptures, and we have good Authority for this; for thus our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.24. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> when they spoke and repeated the Law, mentioned <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 25.5. and thus he also denyed the Devil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.6. when the Devil repeated the Prophesy of the Psalmist, 91.11. and thus also he deny'd the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> of which are divers Instances.</p>

B.</hi> (as <hi>W. Reyman</hi> does testify) was one; which by the way, Reader, is another Evidence that <hi>E. B.</hi> had the Scripture in great Authority and Esteem. As it is also no small mark of the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Injustice, to relate a Lye, and say, that no Censure was passed upon this <hi>Mary Tucker,</hi> when he might have been informed to the contrary by <hi>W.

               <p>And in this <hi>Section</hi> I shall shew, that what is by this Adversary, called, <hi>The Quakers Idolatry,</hi> is not so, but only owing to his perversion, for as Truth leads to give <hi>Honour to whom Honour is due.</hi> So it also leads to account of no Man above what we ought.</p>

               <p>I shall first here detect the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Evil Practice in mangling this Quotation, by giving it as it is in the page quoted, and afterwards speak to the Doctrine of it.</p>
               <p>To the first. The Priest (<hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Opponent) had said, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>scorns to creep into Houses,</hi> (meaning when persecuted.)</p>

<q>This doth not agree with the rest of his Company, who say they do Creep into Houses. The <hi>Quakers</hi> are in the Power of God, and in the Authority of the Lamb, and into Houses creep not, but are upon the Throne; but you that be in the Form that Deny the Power, creep into Houses.</q>

For they whom Jesus Christ hath wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their Sins, in his own Blood, are by him made <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> unto God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. and to them, it is their Father's good pleasure to give the Kingdom, (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.32.) which is not of this World. And for those last words, said by the <hi>Snake,</hi> to be omitted; and instead of <hi>which,</hi> he says are added, [<hi>I set my Name</hi>;] what room or place was there for all that to come after his Name was set? which the <hi>Snake</hi> hath given and omitted with a —</p>

This will best appear by giving the Quotation with the Marginal Scriptures, from the page quoted by the <hi>Snake,</hi> and is as follows.</p>
               <p>P. 15.

               <p>Now from <hi>G.

Which as they lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally did do, so (by a usual allusion) the People fulfilling this Prophecy, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.8. will, through the Assistance of God's Grace (their Weapons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spiritual, not Carnal) go on in the Warfare of the Gospel-Day.</p>

               <p>

               <p>Now who would not take this to be, either all that <hi>G. F.</hi> had here spoken, or else the words last delivered? But, <hi>Reader,</hi> it is neither of these, for <hi>G. F.</hi> is subscribed at the bottom of several lines more than these the <hi>Snake</hi> hath given; and are continued by <hi>G. F.</hi> thus. <hi>The Earthly Name, the Earthly Man knows, and he is afraid of Reproach, and cannot bear it upon the Earthly Name; he that overcometh hath the New Name, and knoweth it.</hi>—</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> what is this but the sense of those Scriptures? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. and 3.12. which whether this Adversary did not know, or had wilfully omitted to consider, are yet sufficient to shew the falsity of his Charge of our <hi>Idolatry</hi> herein.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Quotations are from an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries Book, which was answered.</p>
               <p>Yet such is his Injustice, that he takes no notice of the Answer, but objects, as if they had not been reply'd to; wherefore it deserves not to be taken notice of, till he shall have reply'd to that Answer, and disprov'd it. And any Man may, with equal Justice, quote the Books of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, to prove the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Schismatical, Heretical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without taking notice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers written to them Charges. But whether such practice would be reasonable or not; not only the Agrieved Party, but all impartial Men can readily determine. One of these Quotations is from part of a Letter, writ by <hi>Josiah Cole,</hi> to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and which had been formerly objected against by <hi>John Faldo,</hi> and other Adversaries; to which Objections


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63041:101"/>
                  <hi>W. P.</hi> did Answer, in two several Books, one Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Judas and the Jews,</hi> the other Entituled, <hi>The Invalidity of</hi> J. Faldo<hi>'s Vindication.</hi> Of the first of these Books, the <hi>Snake</hi> takes so much notice, (p. 115.) as to say, that <hi>W. P.</hi> does in p. 44. Excuse and Justifie <hi>Josiah Cole</hi> in that Letter; but has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken no pains to refute the Arguments, nor any notice at all of the Book last named, in which <hi>W. P.</hi> does justifie it; but only, Serpent-like would deceive his Reader, by giving the Words in old Black English Letters; as if that was Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sufficient to shew, that the sense of the Words were Black and Idolatrous. But that they are not, I shall, <hi>Reader,</hi> entreat thy patience to weigh and consider the five following Paragraphs, which are the words of that Letter, together with <hi>W. P</hi>'s Defence and Explanation of them, as they are in his Book, <hi>Invalidity,</hi> &amp;c. p. 354, 355.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That he should call <hi>G. Fox, the Father of many Nations</hi>; but what is this more than to say, that Men of several Nations have been begat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ through him? Thus Paul <hi>was a Father to the</hi> Romans, Corinthians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.15. <hi>For though ye have ten thousand Instructors, yet ye have not many Fathers; for in Christ have I begotten you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That his Life hath reached through his Children to the Isles afar off, to the begetting of many again unto a lively Hope.</hi> But what of all this? The Life of God is one in all; <hi>Paul</hi> lived by the Life of Christ, and so did <hi>Peter</hi>; Paul <hi>was present in Spirit, though absent in Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.3, 4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That Generations to come should call him blessed:</hi> But is not the Memory of the Just blessed? <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.7. and did not God by <hi>Isaiah</hi> promise concerning <hi>Israel, I will make thee an Eternal Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and the Joy of many Generations?</hi> Isai. 60.57. This belongs to <hi>G. Fox, J. Cole,</hi> and every <hi>Child


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63041:102"/>
of God</hi>; yea, and <hi>J. Faldo</hi> too, if he were so good as he should be.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That his Being and Habitation was in the Power of the Highest:</hi> And so it should be; for that is the Habitation of every Child of God; for others dwell in the Power of the World. In short, we are exhorted to stand fast in the Power of Godliness; and we read that it was the End of the Evangelical Ministry <hi>to turn People from the Power of Satan unto the Power of God,</hi> which is the Power of the Highest.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>That he Ruled and Governed in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi> This is but what <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to do in the Church of Christ, as both his Epistles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us at large; <hi>Every Elder, Overseer or Pastor in the Church of Christ is bound to do so</hi>; If <hi>J. F.</hi> can prove he doth otherwise, he may then charge him with uncomely walking, but not <hi>J. Cole</hi> with Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy for saying, <hi>that a good Man governs in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Instance are some pieces of a Letter, p. 115. which he says, was writ by <hi>John Audland</hi>; these I shall dismiss at present, because at the end of his Libel, he pretends to give it entire, <hi>Spelt and Pointed according to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:</hi> And I rather chuse to consider what he calls the entire Letter, than these parts of it; and therefore proceed to his next Instance, p. 116. which is a Quotation from a Sheet, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>The Quakers Challenge,</hi> p. 6. wherein the <hi>Snake</hi> says, Solomon Eccles <hi>says these words of</hi> G. Fox.
<q>It was said of Christ, that he was in the World, and the World was made by him; and the Word knew him not:</q>
                  <q>So it may be said of this true Prophet <hi>(George Fox)</hi> whom <hi>John</hi> said he was not.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:63041:102"/>Here the <hi>Snake</hi> takes some pains to wrest, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and misconstrue these words of <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> contrary to a Sober Explanation given of them by <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> in his Book <hi>Serious Search,</hi> p. 58. But has knowingly omitted to accept, or refute <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Eccles</hi> his own explanation of them words: Contrary to what he hath in the like case, p. 195. said concerning <hi>G. F.</hi> viz. <hi>You will best know his meaning from himself.</hi> Which, if true, why did not this <hi>Snake,</hi> either accept or refute <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> his meaning, which is given from himself, and mentioned in p. 59. of <hi>Serious Search,</hi> above-named; and also in p. 75. of <hi>Judas and the Jews,</hi> likewise before-named; and which for the Readers satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I here subjoin?
<q>I did not say, Nor did I ever believe, that the World was made by <hi>G. F.</hi> but by Christ, who was in the World, and the World knew him not:</q>
So that I say, it may be said of <hi>G. F.</hi> the World knows him not, though he be in the World, as was said of Christ, <hi>He was in the World, though not of the World, and the World knew him not:</hi> And he said of his Followers, <hi>Ye are not of the world, as I am not of the world,</hi> and <hi>I have chosen you out of the world,</hi> John 17.16. and 15.19.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> what Faith or Honesty can we expect to find in an Adversary, who with deep Hypocrisie and Injustice, shall thus wilfully pass over, and not accept, or refute a Man's own explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his words? What is become of his <hi>Great Charity, Real Kindness</hi> and <hi>Good Wishes</hi>; which in p. 2. he pretended to have? We may safely conclude they have no more reality than the Tears of a Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile, which Naturalists speak of.</p>
               <p>We come now to Hearsay Stories, p. 117, 118. wherein he says, He hath <hi>it from Eye-witnesses, who have seen them fall down to him, and saying to him,</hi>
                  <q>Thou art the Son of the Ever-living God, the


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:63041:103"/>
King of <hi>Israel,</hi> all Nations shall worship thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—</q>
                  <hi>And kneeling to his Wife</hi> Margaret, <hi>gave her an</hi> Ora pro Nobis <hi>in these words.</hi>
                  <q>O thou my Heavenly Mother, Pray to my Heavenly Father for me.</q>
                  <hi>These Adorations were common to</hi> G. F. <hi>and that Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Valpoon took it Gravely without any Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do here charge the <hi>Snake</hi> with a Notorious Lie, in saying that <hi>G. Fox</hi> did <hi>with Delectation</hi> ever accept of any <hi>Adoration</hi>; or to be stiled <hi>King of Israel,</hi> &amp;c. or that his Wife accepted of any such <hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> as above; or that it was given by any in true unity with us.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 118. <hi>At another time, a She Preacher arose,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this Story, thus boldly asserted, the <hi>Snake</hi> offers no proof; and I do deny, that any <hi>She Preacher</hi> (as the <hi>Snake</hi> floutingly speaks,) owned by us, did so accost <hi>G. F.</hi> in any Publick Meeting of ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 119. <hi>Let me here only observe what an uncouth and preposterous piece of Humility it is to deny the Title or Civility of Master or the Hat, while, at the same time they worship one another with Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>

               <p>Let me, <hi>Reader,</hi> here only observe the Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Falshood of this Adversary, in urging for Truth, false and hearsay Stories against us, and at the same time decry, as <hi>preposterous and uncouth,</hi> the Precept of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.8.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Instance (p. 120.) is a Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a peice Entituled, <hi>The Guilty Clergy-man Vnvail'd,</hi> writ by <hi>Thomas Speed,</hi> and Printed 1657. from which he picks these two Lines in p. 17.

We own their Distinction, in all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it, recorded in Holy Writ; and have a thousand times declared our sincere Belief in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, the Creator of all things, and in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ his Eternal Son, by whom all things were made, and in the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son. Yet this, because it is not given in the Terms of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> or the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> has been unreasonably refused as insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. This refusal were the less strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, were it not in Persons who pretend the Scriptures to be their only <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> &amp;c.


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63041:104"/>
But as it is the refusal of such Persons, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a violent contradiction in them, to damn as Heretical, an Article of Faith deliver'd in the very words of that Rule. But be their Fault, in this matter, what it will, we are not therefore to be moved from believing, That the Holy Spirit, by which it was dictated, (as is acknowledged) did, and does, know all the weaknesses of men, and the Designs of Satan; and has accordingly fenced the Article from his Subtilty, and explained it to our Capacities. And I take it to be a great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of the former contradiction in this Adversary, (and our other Opposers herein) that they would upon less Evidence of Truth, and a Determination not Infallible, (which they will not affirm, either that of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> or the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Council to be) infallibly press their Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifications made to the Article.</p>
               <p>That such Practices are wrong, all <hi>Parties</hi> in their turns, as their several Interests and Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have pressed them; have declared, and many excellent Arguments by divers Men, have been urged against it: I shall content my self only with some part of what <hi>Jeremy Taylor,</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Connor</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> hath said on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in that excellent Treatise of his, Intituled, <hi>Liberty of Prophecying,</hi> p. 47.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For it is (says he) most considerable, that altho' in reason, every clause in the <hi>Creed</hi> should be clear, and so inopportune and unapt to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Interpretation, that there might be no place left for several Senses, or Variety of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions: Yet, when they thought fit to insert some Mysteries into the Creed (<hi>that called the Apostles</hi>) which in Scripture were expressed in so Mysterious Words, that the last and most explicit sense would still be latent; yet they


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63041:105"/>
who (if ever any did) understood all the Senses and Secrets of it; thought it not fit to use any <hi>Words</hi> but the <hi>Words of Scripture,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the Articles of <hi>Christ descending into Hell, and sitting at the right Hand of God</hi>; to shew us, that those Creeds are best which keep the very words of Scripture; and that Faith is best, which hath greatest Simplicity; and that it is better in all cases humbly to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, than curiously to inquire and prey into the Mystery hid under the Cloud, and to Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard our Faith, by improving our Knowledge: If the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers had done so too, possibly the Church would not have repented it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And indeed the experience the Church had afterwards, shew'd that the Bishops and Priests were not satisfied in all circumstances, nor the Schism (of <hi>Arius</hi>) appeased, nor the Persons agreed, nor the Cannons accepted, nor the Article understood, nor any thing right: But when they were over-born with Authority, which Authority when the Scales turned, did the same Service and Promotion to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he, and as I doubt not but the Truth and Reason of his words, will weigh with the Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader; so his Character of Bishop, ought to be of some weight with the <hi>Snake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Snake</hi> p. 121. <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>and</hi> Socinians <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Three, but deny a Trinity; which is to confess the same thing in</hi> English, <hi>and to deny it in</hi> Latin: <hi>For</hi> Trinitas <hi>is only Latin for Three. But the meaning is, they would not have the Three in Heaven, to be Three Persons. Though they cannot make sense of what Three they are, if not Three Persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:63041:105"/>What the <hi>Socinians</hi> acknowledge, is not my business to inquire: But for our selves, We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the <hi>Three</hi> mentioned in Holy Writ, which bear Record in Heaven; and we need not the Pedantry of the <hi>Snake</hi> to Translate the word into Latin. And the sence we make of the <hi>Three</hi> so bearing Record, is the same which is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Holy Ghost; and when the <hi>Snake</hi> shall shew, that the Holy Ghost hath declared them <hi>Three Persons,</hi> We will not fail so to express them.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 121, 122. <hi>And the</hi> Quakers, <hi>who own the Divinity of Christ, are under greater difficulties than the</hi> Socinians <hi>who deny the Divinity of Christ. For if Christ be God, and that there is but one Person in the Godhead, it must necessarily follow, that God the Father was Incarnate and dyed: And that Christ was his own Father, to whom he prayed upon the Cross.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We own Christ, both as Eternal God, and as the Son of <hi>Mary</hi>; yet are under no such difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as the <hi>Snake</hi> doth falsly suggest: For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not express the Godhead, by the word [Person] having no such Example in Scripture; and our Belief being according to that, and expressed in the words of it, <hi>It must necessarily follow,</hi> that the <hi>Snake</hi> does account the Declaration of Holy Writ in this Article to have <hi>many Absurdities:</hi> Of which, let him clear himself if he can, as also of inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Polytheism,</hi> which his words do seem to favour.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 122. G. F. <hi>opposes</hi> Christopher Wade, <hi>for saying,</hi>
                  <q>That the Holy Ghost was a Person, and that there was a Trinity of three Persons before Christ was Born.</q>
                  <hi>It seems by this they do not acknowledge that there were Three in Heaven before Christ was Born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:63041:106"/>It does not only seem, but plainly appear, that this <hi>Snake</hi> is a Notorious Lyar: Holy Writ says, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are three that bear Record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> It does not express them, either by the word, <hi>Trinity</hi> or <hi>Persons</hi>; does it therefore seem, that Holy Writ <hi>does not acknowledge that there were three in Heaven before Christ was Born:</hi> Or that <hi>the Three in Heaven</hi> (as the <hi>Snake</hi> Blasphemously does suggest) <hi>must be Three Creatures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What <hi>G. F.</hi> opposed in <hi>Christopher Wade</hi> (in this Case) was the Unscripturalness of his Language, which will best appear from <hi>G. F</hi>'s one Words, not curtaild as in the <hi>Snake</hi>; they are these, <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 246.
<q>Thou knowest not him that is in the Father, and the Father in him, Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Father before the World began: And the Scriptures doth not tell people of a <hi>Trinity</hi> nor Three <hi>Persons,</hi> but the Common-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Mass-Book speak of Three <hi>Persons,</hi> brought in by thy Father the Pope: And the Father, Son and Holy Spirit was always one.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 122, 123. The <hi>Snake</hi> shews (as himself says) what <hi>Muggleton</hi> did hold, in that Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Whimsy of the Deputy-ship of <hi>Elijah,</hi> &amp;c. and says of it: <hi>It terrifies my very Soul while I repeat such dreadful and sensless Blasphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I am well assured that this <hi>Snake</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der greater Terror of Soul, when seized by the King's Messenger at <hi>Lidd</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi> For, <hi>To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat such dreadful and senslless Blasphemy.</hi> He had no Necessity, was under no Constraint, but that it pleased him to think, that he might slant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly throw it at us, tho' both him and it we do utterly deny. But it was not in his Power to avoid being seized by the Messenger, though he afterwards found it in his Power to run away from him. (Of which in its proper place.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:63041:106"/>Ibid. p. 123. <hi>How far the</hi> Quakers <hi>differ from</hi> Muggleton, <hi>in what is here told (excepting the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty-ship of</hi> Elijah) <hi>will appear by their allowing no distinction between the Father and the Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an Abominable falshood, <hi>G.

Fox</hi> did oppose: What the Priest did affirm, was this, as given in <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 293.
<q>The Father is a Distinct <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable</hi> Being from the Son, and the Son a Distinct <hi>Incommunicable</hi> Being from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Holy Ghost a Distinct <hi>Incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable</hi> Being from the Son.</q>
               </p>
               <p>See Reader, had not <hi>G. Fox</hi> reason to oppose this <hi>Polytheistical</hi> Doctrine, of Separation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; which plainly makes a Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate of the Deity; and thereby destroys not only the Simplicity, but the Foundation of Faith. And this will happen, so long as Men will <hi>Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their Faith to improve their Knowledge</hi>: And curiously inquire into what will still remain a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery; and not be content with such Declaration of it, as we are Infallibly assured (in Holy Writ) is according to the Mind of God, and sufficient for the necessities of Men.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, there needs not an <hi>Ingenious Stickler</hi> to shew what <hi>G. F.</hi> did oppose, but there wants an <hi>Ingenious Stickler</hi> (unless the <hi>Snake</hi> think himself so) to reconcile the Priests words which I have above quoted, to the Holy Scripture, which he pretends to be his rule, for at present they are as contrary to it, as Light to Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:63041:107"/>I am not so much surprised to find this <hi>Snake</hi> p. 124. saying of <hi>George Fox. He was a very Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful beginner of a Religion, and could neither be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated nor distinguished from a Tool, which Knaves do work with, call'd a F—l.</hi> As to find him so cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously clipping the word <hi>Fool:</hi> Because it is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Modesty and Caution than he uses towards him in other places, where he calls him, <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon, George Magus,</hi> and says he was <hi>one of poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and had an Immoderate degree of Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> But after all this, his Serpentine Modesty; or rather (as himself expresses it, p. 198) <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hateful Eubullition of Soul, George Fox</hi> did herein justly and warrantably oppose that Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Incommunication in the Deity, which the Priest did as above contend for.</p>
               <p>But again, he is angry with <hi>G. F.</hi> in <hi>Great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi> p. 246. <hi>Where</hi> (the <hi>Snake</hi> says) <hi>he disputes against</hi> Christopher Wade <hi>for saying,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But he is so far from replying to <hi>G. F</hi>'s answer to <hi>Christopher Wade,</hi> that he gives but three words of it, tho' the answer does consist of more than so many lines and is as follows.</p>

               <head>SECT. IX. Concerning our Belief of the Divinity and Incarnation of Christ.</head>
               <p>ACcording to what has been already spoken in the foregoing <hi>Sections,</hi> occasionally, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Divinity and Incarnation of Christ. I do here, of set purpose, declare it as a Truth, which now is, and always hath been (since we were a People) believed and declared by us: That <hi>The Word which was in the Beginning with God, by which all things were made</hi>; did, in the fulness of time, according to the appointment of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, take Flesh, and was born of the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and that, in that Body of Flesh, <hi>The Fulness of the Godhead dwelt Bodily.</hi> Thus in the largness of the Expression, and sense of Scripture, we do tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sincerely own, according to <hi>John</hi> 1.14. That <hi>The Word was made Flesh,</hi> &amp;c. dwelt on the Earth, and took on him, not <hi>the Nature of Angels</hi>; not any Aerial or Fantastical Body: But the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi>; and this he did, for the same reason and behoof, mentioned by the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoveth him to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a Merciful and Faithful High-Priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the People. For in that he himself hath


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:63041:108"/>
suffered, being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</hi> For which Infinite Love of Jesus Christ, in being both the Saviour and Reconciler of Men to God, through himself, we sincerely say with the Apostle, Heb. 3.3. <hi>For this Man was count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy of more Glory than Moses, in as much as he who hath builded the House, hath more Honour than the House.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, These and all other Testimonies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Holy Writ, testifying to the Manhood, as well as the Divinity of Jesus Christ, we do, and always did sincerely own: So that should our Books, in which is treated directly on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and abundantly more largely and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than here it can be, be collected. They would make many Volumes. Yet such hath been, and is the Inveterate Malice of our Enemies, that our Writings (no more than our Words) must not mean, what we so often and solemnly have declared we do mean by them. But what our Adversaries will have them to mean, that so they may not seem to want proofs for these their false and envious Charges. What now remains for us to do? But still to persevere in our True and Scriptural Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and to repeat our Testimonies of it to the envious Objections of Enemies, and for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Sober Enquirer. And this, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou wilt find, in reply to the false and envious Suggestions and Perversions of the <hi>Snake</hi> herein, in this Section.</p>

                  <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 125. <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>Heresie in this is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the</hi> Socinians; <hi>they say, Christ took Flesh, but no otherwise, as they explain it, than as Angels as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed Bodies; or as he, Christ (or the Word) did Inspire, or Dwell in Prophets, or Holy Men of old,</hi> &amp;c. —</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:63041:108"/>What the <hi>Socinians</hi> hold herein, I neither know, nor is it my business to now enquire: But this I know, that we do believe that Christ the Word took Flesh, but not as Angels assumed Bodies. His Body which he took of the Virgin, was really, truly and properly Flesh; and had the gradual and natural Growth of Mankind, from Infancy, to Childhood, to the State of a Young Man, and so to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Perfect Man; and being Perfect Man, did Dwell, Eat, Drink, and Converse with his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and with the Multitude; did Preach, did work Miracles, was Tempted, did Hunger and Thirst, was crucified, and did Rise again, and Ascend into Glory. Thus did never Angels as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume Bodies: Those Ministring Spirits, when they have assumed Bodies; it hath been upon particular and short, but special occasions, at once appearing, without the gradual degrees of natural Growth, or subject to the Infirmities and Accidents of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bodies; and it could not be otherwise, they being only Aerial, and not truly Flesh and Blood, as was that Body of Jesus the Son of the Living God.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 125. <hi>But they deny any proper Incarnation of Christ, that is, that he was made Flesh, or that he and Jesus was one Person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis false, we own that He (the Word) was made Flesh, properly Incarnate, and was in the <hi>form of a Servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 125. <hi>Yet they allow Jesus to be called Christ, from the dwelling of Christ in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if the <hi>Snake</hi> will not allow so much, he contradicts the Apostle, who saith of Jesus Christ, <hi>With him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead Bodily,</hi> Col. 2 9.</p>

               <p>Jesus Christ, when he ascended up on High, he led Captivity Captive, and did give Gifts unto Men; the Gifts of his Holy Spirit, of which the Apostle hath testified, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.7. <hi>But unto every one of us is given Grace according to the Measure of the Gift of Christ.</hi> Thus much we have often declared, and that truly: But it is falsly said, and charged, that we take the <hi>Name of Christ to our selves</hi>; or say, <hi>it belongs to us,</hi> in any other manner than in these and other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures is mentioned. We say, that Christ by his Ascension into Glory, hath given the Gift of his Spirit to Men, to which as they are obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, they will witness the Power of the Spirit of Christ in them, to bring every thought into subjection; and when through the assistance of this Spirit, they thus have got the Victory over their own Corruptions and Lusts, they will truly say, it is no more <hi>I, but Christ in me:</hi> Yet the name Christ cannot hereby be supposed to belong <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o such, nor was it ever said by any of us, that it did belong to us, in such manner as to Jesus; for to him it belongs by Origination, to us only by participation through him: For, he by partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Nature, made thereby Mankind par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Spirit (I say this, with respect to the generality of the Gospel Dispensation, for there were many particular Persons, not within the Covenant of the Law, in the time of the Law, who had manifestations of the Spirit of Christ) and in no other sense have we ever taken the name of Christ to our selves.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 125. <hi>They say that Christ did raise up the Body if Jesus from the Dead; but they say not,

that Christ did carry it up with him into Heaven.</hi>

               <p>What then, do we say he did with it? Why, that the <hi>Snake</hi> shews not, and good reason there is for this his Silence: But Reader, I will tell thee, that we do say and believe, according to <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9. <hi>When he had spoken these things, while they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, he was taken up, and a Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When we say there is no other Christ than what is within us, we say true, because Christ, as God, cannot be divided, and the Measure or Manifestation of the Spirit of Christ in us, is not another, but a Manifestation of the fame Christ, which did in fulness and Bodily dwell in the Man Jesus: But when the <hi>Snake</hi> says, we allow him no <hi>Humane Body</hi> (if he means Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) he says false, as I have before shewn, and as is very often testified in many of our Books.</p>

                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:63041:110"/>It is, Reader, horrid Injustice in this <hi>Snake,</hi> so fouly to pick and pervert a Man's words, as he here does <hi>G.

<q>It is a Scripture of the Devil's making, to apprehend this Crucify'd Christ within.</q>

                  <hi>G. F.</hi>
                  <q>Now, I say, if there be any other Christ but he that was Crucify'd, within, he is the false Christ: And the Scripture holds forth this, and the Devil never made it; but he and his Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers are against it. And he that hath not this Christ that was Risen and Crucify'd, within, is a Reprobate, tho' Reprobates and Devils may make a talk of him without.</q>
Thus <hi>G.

<q>That the Apostle declares of

Christ, that he is the Head of the Church; and are of his Flesh and Bone, and sit with him in Heavenly Places; and Christ saith they must eat his Flesh, and he is in them.</q>

<q>They that profess a Christ without them, have a Christ without them and another Christ within them, here is two.

What plainer can be spoken, to shew, that is the same, and not another Christ who suffered at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and thereby ended the Law, and is now by his Spirit in the Hearts of his People?</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 126. Robert Gourdon <hi>was the first among them, that I find, who taught the Orthodox Faith in this Point of the Divinity of Jesus.</hi>

               <p>Whether owned or not the <hi>Snake</hi> finds not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he seeks amiss; and I am sure he did not seek right, when he pretended to find <hi>R.

               <p>And from this <hi>R. Gourdon,</hi> the <hi>Snake,</hi> according to his usual Injustice, transcribes in p. 127, 128, 129. divers false and abusive charges, but takes no notice of the Validity or Invalidity of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers

                  </gap> hither, tho' all worthy of notice; wherefore I shall only transcribe the first and seventh Heads or parts of Discourse, which are as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:63041:111"/>P. 104. <hi>First,</hi>
                  <q>We do confess, that tho' the Eternal Power, Life and Light, which inhabited that Holy Person which was born at <hi>Nazareth, (Bethlehem</hi> it should be) was, and is chiefly and eminently the Saviour; <hi>For there is no Saviour besides me, saith God,</hi> Hos. 13.4. Yet, that <hi>it was instrumentally a Saviour,</hi> as prepared and chosen for the Work which Christ had then to do in it, which was actually to the Salvation of Some, and intentionally to the Salvation of the whole World then, and in Ages to come; suitable to that Scripture, <hi>Lo, in the Volume of the Book it is written, I come to do thy will, (O God) a Body hast thou prepared me,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 10.</q>
               </p>
               <p>P. 107. <hi>Seventh,</hi>
                  <q>But there is yet a further Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that accrueth by the Blood of Christ, viz. <hi>That Christ is a propitiation, and redemption to such as have Faith in it.</hi> For tho' I still place the stress, of <hi>particular</hi> Benefit, upon the Light, Life and Spirit revealed and witnessed in every particular; Yet in that general Appearance, there was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Benefit, justly to be attributed unto the Blood of that very Body of Christ, to wit, <hi>that it did propitiate.</hi> For however it might draw stupendious Judgments upon the Heads of those who were Authors of that Dismal <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and died impenitent; yet doubtless it thus far turn'd to very great account, <hi>in that it was a most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Offering in the sight of the Lord, and drew God's Love the more eminently to mankind,</hi> at least, <hi>such as should believe in his Name,</hi> as his solemn Prayer to his Father, at his leaving the World, given us by his beloved Disciple, doth plainly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</q>
Thus <hi>W. P.</hi> Wherein I take it to be as plain as can be, that he does declare and confess, that the true Christ was Man: And when he speaks of the Spirit of Christ in its appearance in


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:63041:112"/>
Man, under the Name or Epithet, [Principle] he sufficiently shews, that he intends more thereby than any <hi>Moral Virtue.</hi> For in p. 100. speaking of the Spirit of God under this Epithet of Inward <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> he saith,
<q>And as in Wicked Men, God's Holy Light and Spirit, or that Principle which is so called, hath been deeply wounded, yea, as one slain; so in Good Men that have had a sense of the Worlds Abominations hath it also born many Burdens and Weights; for the Light and Life is one in all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> what clearer Testimony can there be, that <hi>W. P.</hi> does under the name <hi>Principle,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Holy Spirit of God, and not any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Virtue, as the <hi>Snake</hi> would basely and falsly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate? And for this his manner of expressing the Holy Spirit, there are plenty of Examples in the Scriptures of Truth; where under the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of Wisdom, <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaking of Christ, and his Dispensation in the Gospel-times Chap. 33.6. saith, <hi>Wisdom shall be the stability of thy times.</hi> And our Saviour saith, Mat. 11.19. <hi>Wisdom is justified of her Children.</hi> And the Evangelist, speaking of the growth of the Child Jesus, saith, Luke 2.40. <hi>And the Child grew and waxed strong in Spirit, filled with Wisdom,</hi> &amp;c. These with abundance more of like import, the observing Reader may easily find in Holy Writ.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 131. The <hi>Snake</hi> makes a Quotation from <hi>W. P</hi>'s part of <hi>Serious Apology,</hi> &amp;c. p. 146. <hi>But that the outward Person, which suffered, was properly the Son of God, we utterly deny.</hi> And perversely would draw <hi>W. P</hi>'s words to say, or mean, that the Body which Christ assum'd, was <hi>but as a Cloak, or a Vail, like the Body in which Angels appear for a time, and throw them off again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:63041:112"/>Against this false and unjust Imputation, I shall first give <hi>W. P</hi>'s words in the page quoted, from whence the impartial Reader may be able to take <hi>W. P</hi>'s meaning from himself, and then observe somewhat upon the <hi>Snake</hi>'s perversion. To the first, <hi>Jenner (W. P</hi>'s Opponent) had said, <hi>We deny that Person (the Son of God) that died at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>to be our Redeemer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which <hi>W. P.</hi> replys.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Which most horrid Imputation, has been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd more (I believe) than a Thousand times, that is, that he that laid down his Life, and suffer'd his Body to be crucify'd by the <hi>Jews,</hi> without the Gates of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is Christ the only Son of the Most High God: But that the outward Person, which suffer'd, was properly the Son of God, we utterly deny, and it is a perfect contradiction to their own Principles:</q>
                  <q>
                     <hi>A Body hast thou prepared me,</hi> said the Son, then the Son was not the Body, <hi>though the Body was the Son's.</hi>
                  </q>
This brings him more under the charge of making him but a meer Man, than us, <hi>who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be one with the Father, and of a Nature Eternal and Immortal; for he was glorified with the Father before the World began.</hi> Thus <hi>W. Penn,</hi> whose plain meaning is no other than that the <hi>Outward Person,</hi> that Body which our Lord did take of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> was not <hi>properly</hi> the Son of God by Eternal Generation, and was not Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Father before the World began: He is here distinguishing between the Divinity and Manhood of our Saviour, and that according to Scripture. The Divinity was from Everlasting, the Manhood not so, that was taken up in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of time appointed by God; born of <hi>Mary,</hi> nourished and encreased in Stature, Strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to Nature's Law and Course. This Body,


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:63041:113"/>
Christ laid it down for the Sins of the World, he did thereby consecrate for us a new and living way, <hi>Through the Vail, that is to say, his Flesh,</hi> Heb. 10.20. and here the Flesh or Body of Christ is called a Vail; by allusion to the Vail, mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 26.33. which did divide between <hi>the Holy Place, and the Most Holy,</hi> and this the Apostle shews, Heb. 9.24. <hi>For Christ is not entred into the Holy Places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it self, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</hi> And in this sense, and no other, have we ever used the words Vail or Garment, in this case, and not as is falsly alledged by the <hi>Snake,</hi> to signifie a Body, Ibid. p. 130. <hi>in which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels appear for a time, and throw them off again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner the <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 131. curtails and perverts a Quotation from a Book of ours Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>some Principles,</hi> &amp;c. from which he quotes, p. 126. thus, <hi>The Scriptures do expresly distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ, and the Garment which he wore — And we can never call the Bodily Garment, Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Scriptures do so expresly distinguish: Of which Instances are given; why did the <hi>Snake</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously make a Break in the Quotation, instead of giving those instances? For upon the Authority of Holy Writ it is that we do thus distinguish; and if our Distinction be bad, or weak, he should have given us a better Exposition of the Scriptures, therein brought for that purpose. That he may not omit it in his next, I here give some of the Instances from that Book, wherein the Scriptures do expresly so distinguish.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 131. I come now to a Quotation made from <hi>Isaac Pennington,</hi> in his Question to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, p. 25. which the <hi>Snake</hi> does not only break to pieces, but also to the several pieces, joins some words of his own; that they may (like his Brethen


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:63041:113"/>
of the Inquisition) by them be forced to sound as he would have them. It is in the manner following; <hi>Isaac Pennington,</hi> p. 25.
<q>
                     <hi>Denies that it was the</hi> Flesh and Blood of the Veil — of the outward Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nature</q>
                  <hi>(as he calls the Body of Christ) by which we are cleansed, for, says he,</hi>
                  <q>Can outward Blood cleanse the Conscience?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Snake</hi> gives it, and makes nonsense of it; for by the Pieces of the Quotation, as he has placed them, he says, that <hi>I. P.</hi> calls the <hi>Body of Christ,</hi> the Flesh and Blood, the Vail of the Flesh and Blood, or the Outward and Earthly Nature: Thus making the Body a Vail to it self.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Reader,</hi> I will shew thee from the Book it self, that <hi>I. P.</hi> is neither Nonsensical in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, nor Heretical in his Meaning, but Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural and Orthodox, p. 25. q. 18.
<q>Seeing the Apostle speaks of purifying the Heavenly things themselves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.23. It would seriously be enquired into, and the Lord waited on to know, what nature these Sacrifices must be of, which cleanse the Heavenly things? whether they must not of necessity be Heavenly? If so, then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it the Flesh and Blood of the Vail, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 10.20.) or the Flesh and Blood within the Vail? <hi>(John</hi> 6.53.) Whether was it, the Flesh and Blood of the Outward Earthly Nature (first <hi>quoted</hi>) or the Flesh and Blood of the Inward Spiritual Nature? (last quoted.) Whether was it the Flesh and Blood which Christ took of the first <hi>Adam</hi>'s Nature, or the Flesh and Blood of the second <hi>Adam</hi>'s Nature?</q>
Thus he, and is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sound, according to the Doctrine of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who saith, John 6.53. — <hi>Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you.</hi> Of this many of his Disciples said, John 6.60. <hi>This is an hard saying.</hi> And therefore


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:63041:114"/>
our Saviour expounds it to their weakness, <hi>v.</hi> 63. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the Flesh profiteth nothing; the words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit and they are Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all which, this is the Sum of <hi>I. P</hi>'s Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p>The Soul of Man is of Heavenly Extraction, which being fallen through Sin, is not to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therefrom, but by the Spirit of Christ, which is shed on Mankind, and univer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>lly tender'd to them by Jesus Christ, having offer'd up as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Sacrifice, his Body, and <hi>through the Vail, that is to say his Flesh,</hi> hath opened to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (in the Apostle's phrase) <hi>A New and Living Way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 131. The <hi>Snake</hi> makes a Quotation from <hi>C. Atkinson</hi>'s <hi>Sword of the Lord drawn,</hi> p. 5. <hi>Your Imagined God beyond the Stars, and your Carnal Christ, is utterly denied. —To say this Christ is God and Man in one Person, is a Lie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Snake</hi> hath made a false Quotation, that it might not fail to answer his purpose; which yet when set in its true Light, speaks quite otherwise, it standing thus in that Book.
<q>Your imagined God beyond the Stars, and your carnal Christ, <hi>which you would make appear through your Heathenish Philosophy,</hi> is utterly denied and testified against by the Light which comes from Christ.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if the <hi>Snake</hi>'s God and Christ, can only be made appear through <hi>Heathenish Philosophy,</hi> this he says, <hi>is utterly deny'd:</hi> And it is certainly true that the Light which comes from Christ, does utterly deny all Vain and Carnal Imaginations.</p>
               <p>The words from the break are a position of his Opponents, to which he does not barely reply:
<q>It is a Lye (but adds) He is not divided from


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:63041:114"/>
what he was before the Foundations of the Hills were laid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 131. quoted from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 250. <hi>The Devil was in thee</hi> (says <hi>G. F.</hi> to his Adversary, <hi>Christopher Wade) Thou sayest thou art saved by Christ without thee, and so hast recorded thy self to be a Reprobate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 132. From <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 183. <hi>Such as have Christ in them, they have the Righteousness it self without Imputation, the end of Imputation, the Righteousness of God it self, Christ Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Snake</hi> first picks up bits to make Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and then packs them on heaps, that by this his false and confused jumbling of things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they might speak his own mind, not the mind of the Writer. As to the first, where he brings in <hi>G. F.</hi> saying to <hi>Christopher Wade, The Devil was in thee,</hi> &amp;c. It was, because he had given Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of it (as this <hi>Snake</hi> has done) by stuffing (as <hi>G. F.</hi> says) his Book with Lies. And tho' the <hi>Snake</hi> may think it is no complement, yet I can tell him, it is Truth in much plainness, and agreeable to the Sentence of the Lip of Truth; to the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he told them, <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil,</hi> John 8.44. <hi>and the lusts of your Father ye will do,</hi> &amp;c. So that where we find Murderous and Lying Works, it shews them to be of the Devil.</p>
               <p>As to the latter part of the first Quotation, <hi>Thou say'st, thou art saved by Christ without thee,</hi> &amp;c. It does plainly contradict the Doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and upon the Authority of that, <hi>G. F.</hi> or any other may safely declare, that such who know not Jesus Christ in them are Reprobates; and if <hi>Chr. Wade</hi> declared himself such, <hi>G. F.</hi> was no more to blame, than any other may be, if the <hi>Snake</hi> now do the same. To the last Quotation, from p. 183<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is near all of it Scripture; for Christ is declared,

                  <hi>the Righteousness of God,</hi> and is the end of Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all that believe; which, as <hi>G. F.</hi> there says, <hi>Is owned, and this Imputation is within; for he that believes is born of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 132. Quoted from <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Errand,</hi> p. 14. <hi>Christ</hi> (says he, that is, The Light within) <hi>is the Substance of all Figures, and his Flesh is a Figure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To shew the Reader this more clearly, it being not long, I will give it intire, as in that Book, from whence the Reader may judge of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy of the place, and the Malicious Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis of the <hi>Snake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was a Query propounded to <hi>G. Fox:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether Christ in the Flesh be a Figure or not; and if a Figure, how, and in what?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which he answers,
<q>Christ is the Substance of all Figures, his Flesh is a Figure; for every one passeth through the same way as he did, who comes to know Christ in the Flesh: <hi>There must be a Suffering with him, before there be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing with him.</hi> Christ is an Example for all to walk after; and if thou knowest what an Example is, thou would'st know what a Figure is, to come up to the same fulness.</q>
Thus <hi>G. F.</hi> and is according to these, and other Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 13.15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 132. The <hi>Snake</hi> in like manner, minces the words of <hi>E. B.</hi> only quoting from p. 149. (of his Works) <hi>The very Christ of God is within us</hi>; leaving out what follows, <hi>We dare not deny him, and we are Members of his Body, and of his Flesh, and of his Bone,</hi> as the <hi>Ephesians</hi> were, (Eph. 5.30.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 132. He does pick from <hi>Isaac Penington</hi>'s <hi>Question to the Professors,</hi> p. 27. <hi>Doth not the name</hi> Christ <hi>belong to the whole Body, and to every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Body, as well as to the Head?</hi> And has left


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:63041:115"/>
out what follows, which are the Scripture Proofs,
<q>Are they not all one, yea all one in the Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; was not this the great desire of his Heart to his Father? <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 23. That they all might be one, even as the Father and Christ are one. And so being one in the same Spirit (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. (one in the same Life, one in the same Divine Nature, even partakers of God's Holiness) Christ is not ashamed to call them Brethren, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10.) nor is the Apostle ashamed to give them the Name of Christ, together with him, <hi>&amp;c. (Heb.</hi> 2.11.)</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> from a few words by him pickt from this Quotation, very arrogantly pretends to say, <hi>They</hi> (the Quakers) <hi>think, that the name</hi> Christ <hi>does belong to every one of them, not only more than to that Body, but as well as to it, while it was upon the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what freedom soever the <hi>Snake</hi> has used to misrepresent <hi>I. P</hi>'s words, which as above quoted, say no such thing; yet it is intollerable, that he should carry his Iniquity so far, as to bely our very Thoughts, and to tell the World, that <hi>They</hi> (the Quakers) <hi>think,</hi> &amp;c. what no <hi>Quaker</hi> did ever <hi>think.</hi> In fine the Sum of <hi>I. P</hi>'s words is only thus, in the words of the Beloved Disciple, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. <hi>But the Anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you; and ye need not that any Man teach you, but as the same Anointing teacheth you all things, and is Truth, and is no Lie; and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</hi> Thus Christ <hi>the Anointed,</hi> Isa. 61.1. Luke 4.18. gives the <hi>Anointing</hi> of his Spirit for a Guide to his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 132. The <hi>Snake</hi> quotes from <hi>Great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi> p. 88. <hi>Christ is the Elect.</hi> And falsly glosses upon it in this manner, <hi>Thus Christ is the Elect, and


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:63041:116"/>
Elect are Christ's: They make them convertible Terms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> speaking of Christ, saith, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.1.
<q>Behold my Servant, whom I uphold, mine <hi>Elect,</hi> in whom my Soul delighteth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—</q>
And also the Holy Apostle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. —

                  </q>
And we do say, He (Christ) was from Eternity, the <hi>Elect</hi> and Chosen of God, by and through whom all who are made partakers of Eternal Salvation, must be <hi>Elected</hi> and <hi>Chosen:</hi> Yet the Terms are not convertible, Christ is the <hi>Elect</hi> Head of the Church; all who are obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his Spirit of Grace are <hi>Elect</hi> Members. This is agreeable to a Cloud of Scripture Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; for the present take these following, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 132. Quoted from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 207. A Priest had said, <hi>That God hath a Christ Distinct from all things whatsoever.</hi> To which <hi>G. F.</hi> replys, <hi>God's Christ is not distinct from his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, I have in the last <hi>Section</hi> shewn thee, what kind of distinction <hi>G. F</hi>'s Opponents plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and what he opposed, <hi>viz.</hi> Separation and Incommunication: And surely those terms, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi> and <hi>Incommunicable,</hi> are not fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Deity; nor yet his Dwelling in Man, and in such sense Christ is not Distinct, that is, <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from his Servants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 133. <hi>They say a Man may tell a Lye so often, that he may come to believe it himself at Last.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this, the <hi>Snake</hi> may likely be an Instance.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 133. <hi>Who that had not his Head turn'd with such Enthusiastical Delusion, could have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that</hi> G. F. <hi>could not understand the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or Distinction, betwixt Christ and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self!


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63041:116"/>
And that Men of sense should lick up his Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who that had not his Heart turned with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Envy, and thereby his Eyes blinded, cou'd have failed to see, that <hi>G. F.</hi> does, according to Scripture, understand the <hi>difference</hi> between Christ and himself? But the Positions of the <hi>Priests</hi> were concerning not the <hi>Difference,</hi> but the <hi>Separation</hi> of Christ: What else can the Sense be of this Position of the Priest (<hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 293. <hi>The Father is a distinct Incommunicable Being from the Son, and the Son a distinct Incommunicable Being from the Father, and the Holy Ghost a distinct Incommunicable Being from the Son?</hi> And if thus Distinct or Incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to each other, it's not to be expected the Deity should be less Distinct and Incommunicable to Men: And against this false and Anti-scriptural Doctrine it is <hi>G. F.</hi> hath declared, as is before shewn. And this is the <hi>Spittle the Snake licks up and defends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 133. <hi>And I have shewn several Instances,</hi> Sect. 8. <hi>where</hi> G. F. <hi>does assume the Stile and Names of Christ to himself; and that others do allow them to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have in all those several Instances in <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. shewn that the <hi>Snake</hi> hath bely'd <hi>G. F.</hi> and others, for that he hath not assumed them, nor others allowed them to him, as suggested by the <hi>Snake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 133, 134. <hi>All which is excused by Mr.</hi> Penn, <hi>in the</hi> 11<hi>th Chapter of the</hi> Invalidity of John Faldo, &amp;c. <hi>in such a wonderful manner, as will leave no Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy or Idolatry in the world, without a very fair pretence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W. P.</hi> shews in that Book, that the Charges of our Enemies then were false (as are now those of the <hi>Snake</hi>) and rescues the words of some of our Friends therein, from their Perversion, as some others of them herein now are. He speaks Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:63041:117"/>
and Reason, and shews we are agreeable to both; and uses no <hi>fair pretences</hi> to excuse, but so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Orthodox Truths to shew and explain, that we are neither Blasphemous nor Idolatrous, as may be seen, p. 266. of that Book <hi>Invalidity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 134. <hi>These are the words of a great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of the Quakers,</hi> Edw. Burroughs, p. 273. of his Works.
<q>The Sufferings of the People of God <hi>(Quakers)</hi> in this Age, is greater Suffering, and more unjust, than in the days of Christ, or of the Apostles.—What was done to Christ, or the Apostles, was chiefly done by a Law, and in great part by the due Execution of a Law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> here, as is usual with him, hath from several places pickt these words, and jumbled them together, that they might look as he would have them; but as they stand in <hi>E. B.</hi> it plainly shews, that his Comparison lies not to the Persons Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or to the greatness of the Suffering in it self considered; but only with respect to the several pretences of those who were the Persecutors; and <hi>E. B.</hi> does thereupon shew, that the Persecutors in those times, and also in the times of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> had the colour of unjust Laws; but the Persecutors of his time had not (in divers instances for which they did Persecute) the Shadow of any Law at all, such as for not pulling off the Hat, for using the plain Language, and such like.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> next, takes up three or four pages upon a Quotation from <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> which no <hi>Quaker</hi> did ever <hi>approve,</hi> much less justifie, as hath been formerly observed by <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> to <hi>G. Keith</hi>; and therefore is of no weight here. And although he would (p. 139.) fasten it upon <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> by nibling at his words, in that piece of his, Entituled, <hi>The Light and Life of Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> p. 58. where he (<hi>G. W.</hi>) says, that <hi>S. E.</hi> did


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:63041:117"/>
speak of the Blood of Christ, as <hi>more Excellent, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and Holy, than is able to be utter'd,</hi> &amp;c. He adds, <hi>Which might have satisfied any spiritual and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byassed Mind,</hi> I say, tho' he would insinuate from these words, that <hi>G. W.</hi> does not disown <hi>this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> of <hi>S. Eccles</hi>; yet <hi>G.W.</hi> does in plain Words deny it, which yet this Adversary, <hi>Snake</hi>-like, hath omitted to deliver. His words are these, <hi>(Light and Life,</hi> &amp;c. p. 59.) <hi>I do not make</hi> S. E's <hi>Expression therein</hi> (especially as construed by our Adversaries) <hi>an Article of our Faith.</hi> And <hi>G. W.</hi> for himself does there declare, <hi>He did own the Blood shed to be more than the Blood of another Saint.</hi> Thus saith not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>G. W.</hi> but thus also say the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who at all times (since a People) have readily declared their true and scriptural Sense of it. But with respect to <hi>S. E</hi>'s words, having first inform'd my <hi>Reader,</hi> that no <hi>Quaker</hi> did ever approve, much less justifie them, and therefore surely not make them an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Faith (either of which, if the <hi>Snake</hi> can prove, he is required to do it) I say, having first acquainted my <hi>Reader</hi> thus much, it will not I hope be expounded, a defending of them words of <hi>S. E</hi>'s, if I do briefly shew; that had this <hi>Snake</hi> had in himself any of that <hi>great Charity for others, which</hi> (he says, p. 10.) <hi>is more apt to have a good opinion of others, than of our selves</hi>; and which he makes one of the Marks of Divine Enthusiasm, or Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. He would have looked to see whether <hi>S. E</hi>'s words would not have born <hi>Sano sensu,</hi> some honest and innocent Construction, and accordingly have judged; rather than put a bad Construction on words, which if not safely exprest, were, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever so intended. That <hi>S. E.</hi> did so safely and scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally intend them, is I think plain, in that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
<q>He had no light esteem of the Blood of Christ it self, as it was made by Christ a part of


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:63041:118"/>
that blessed Offering for Man; and that what he spake of that part of the Blood, which was let out by the Spear, (and which is that the <hi>Snake</hi> now makes his advantage of) was with respect to the Soldiers Act, and the time of doing it, which was after his Death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So that I think it may in truth appear,
<q>That <hi>that upon which</hi> Solomon Eccles <hi>did ground the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference he put between the Blood of Christ,</hi> in one respect; and in another, was, that in the one, it was a voluntary Offering of Christ himself, in and by the Eternal Spirit, before his Death: In the other it was the forcible act of a Soldier af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was Dead, and the Sacrifice compleated.</q>
And this with much more our Friend <hi>Tho. Ellwood</hi> had heretofore said, (<hi>Truth Defended,</hi> p. 111, 112.) in reply to <hi>G. Keith,</hi> upon the same Charge; and which the <hi>Snake</hi> might have reply'd to, if he could, before he had renew'd it.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 140. <hi>They have evaded the most express Texts for Christ's Humanity, even that</hi> Gen. 3.15. <hi>his being the Seed of the Woman: They allegorize that too into a Spiritual Sense, quite away from the Letter; and to mean nothing else in the World, but their Light within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have not evaded any Text of Scripture for <hi>Christ's Humanity,</hi> therefore not that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. wherein he is testified of, as <hi>The Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> Nor have we <hi>allegoriz'd it into a Spiritual Sense,</hi> beyond the Authority of express Texts of Scripture, much less quite away from the Letter; but as we now do, so we, always since a People, have owned, that it did mean some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than the manifestation of the Spirit, or Light of Christ in Man. But the <hi>Snake</hi> for Proof of this Charge, makes a Quotation from <hi>W. P</hi>'s part of <hi>The Christi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n Quaker,</hi> p. 97, 98.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:63041:118"/>
                  <q>The Serpent (says he) is a Spirit: Now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can bruise the Head of the Serpent, but something that is [<hi>Internal and</hi>] (the <hi>Snake</hi> has left out) Spiritual as the Serpent is: But if that Body of Christ, were the <hi>Seed,</hi> then could he not bruise the Serpent's Head in all, because the Body of Christ is not so much as in any one? And consequently the Seed of the Promise, is an Holy [<hi>and Spiritual</hi>] (the <hi>Snake</hi> has left out) Principle of Light and Life [<hi>and Power</hi>] (the <hi>Snake</hi> has left out) that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Heart, bruiseth the Serpent's Head? And because the Seed, which cannot be that Body, is Christ, as testify the Scriptures; the Seed is one, and the Seed is Christ (and which the <hi>Snake</hi> has cut off, as not to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and Christ, God over all blessed for ever. We do conclude and that most truly, that Christ was, and is the Divine Word of Light and Life, that was in the beginning with God, and was and is God, over all blessed for ever.</q>
Thus <hi>W. P.</hi> From which the <hi>Snake</hi> says, p. 140. <hi>His consequence is, that the promised Seed was not any Person, but a Principle.</hi> Which consequence is falsly drawn by the <hi>Snake</hi> from <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s words, the consequence of them being more truly, that the <hi>Promised Seed,</hi> was not <hi>only</hi> that, but <hi>also</hi> a Principle, of Light, Life and Power, which I shall now further shew, as it is also declared by <hi>T. E. (Truth Defended,</hi> p. 113, 114.) that,
<q>The Scope and design of <hi>W. P.</hi> in those words, was to prove against his Opponents, that the Son of God, who in the fulness of time, took upon him a Body of Flesh, in which he suffered on the Cross, was, and was properly called, Christ, before he appeared in that outward Body; which his Opponents denied, not owning <hi>Christ


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:63041:119"/>
as Christ,</hi> to have any existence before that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which was Born of the Virgin, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining Christ to that Body. And because all acknowledge the <hi>Promised Seed</hi> to be Christ, <hi>W. P.</hi> used that as a <hi>Medium,</hi> to prove that Christ was before that outward Appearance. Now this affirming Christ to be the <hi>Seed,</hi> and that <hi>Seed</hi> to be Inward and Spiritual, is not a denial of Christ having a bodily existence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us; for he may have, and hath, a bodily existence without us, and yet may be, and is, spiritually within us: 'Tis true, he denied that that Body which Christ had from the Virgin, <hi>Strictly considered as such,</hi> was the Seed, and he gave divers reasons for it.</q>
And which are mentioned from p. 94. to p. 99. of his <hi>Christian Quaker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the consequence which the <hi>Snake</hi> hath falsly drawn from <hi>W. P</hi>'s words, <hi>viz. That the Seed is not a Person, but a Principle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He goes on p. 141. fighting against the Bugbear which himself hath conjured up, and declares it to be, <hi>A Supposition of so pernicious a nature, that it Vn-christians any who holds it: For the Faith of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is built upon that Man Jesus Christ, as The Seed Promised to bruise the Serpent's Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Supposition so far as respecting us the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> in particular, is false:
<q>For we believe the Manhood of Christ gloriously united with the Godhead, to be the <hi>Seed Promised,</hi> Gen. 3.15. and also, that that Seed being of a Divine and Spiritual Nature, did inwardly work against the Serpent, and did bruise his Head, and break his Strength and Power, in some measure, in the Holy Men and Women in all Generations (<hi>T. E. Truth Defended,</hi> p. 114.) and by this their inward experience of his Spirit


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:63041:119"/>
and Power, he was the object of their Faith, to be made manifest in God's due time:</q>
And he is now the object of the Faith of all true Christians; not only as born of the Virgin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but also as known and witnessed in his Inward and Spiritual Appearance in Man, to bruise the Serpent's Head, Power and Strength, which has had Dominion and Rule in Man: To this sense our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self does also explain the Spiritual Nature of the <hi>Seed,</hi> the Word of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.11.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 143. The <hi>Snake</hi> brings from <hi>Christian Quaker</hi> another Argument to the purpose fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going; which is this,
<q>One Outward thing cannot be the proper Figure or Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another, nor is it the way of Scripture so to Teach us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To which the <hi>Snake</hi> says, <hi>All the outward Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices under the Law, were Types or Figures of the Sacrifice of Christ, the Outward Christ upon the Cross,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The whole Legal Dispensation of the First Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, was a Figure of Christ, and of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation of the New Covenant, Grace and Truth, which came by him: But that it was not <hi>only</hi> a Type or Figure of Christ upon the Cross, I shall shew in several Instances. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent which <hi>Moses</hi> made, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.9. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our declares, <hi>John</hi> 3.14. that as that <hi>was lifted up in the Wilderness; so must the Son of Man be lifted up:</hi> And this, in a sense may be understood to have respect to our Saviour's being lifted up on the Cross; but not <hi>only</hi> that, for our Saviour car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Type further, and shews that it did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that Spiritual Obedience and Faith in him, which gives Eternal Life: For as the Sting of the Serpents in the Wilderness were cured by looking to the Brazen Serpent: So, by coming

through Faith and Obedience to look to Christ, the Sting of Sin and Death are taken away by him: Wherefore he saith, v. 20.21. <hi>For every one that doth Evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, lest his deeds should be reproved: But he that doth Truth, cometh to the Light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</hi> In like manner the Apostle, 1 Cor. 5.7. <hi>Christ our passover is crucified for us,</hi> may have respect to Paschal Land as Type, and to Christ crucified as typified; but not altogether that, for he carries it further, and shews, that whereas, vers. 1. <hi>It was reported there was Fornication among them:</hi> And vers. 6. <hi>That they gloried in what was not good:</hi> He adviseth them <hi>to purge out the old Leaven</hi>; and from the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Power from Christ received, he presseth them to keep the <hi>Feast, not with old Leaven, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Leaven of Malice and Wickedness; but with the unleavened Bread of Sincerity and Truth.</hi> The same Apostle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> 11.16, 17. <hi>Let no Man therefore judge you in Meat or in Drink, or in respect of an Holy-Day, or of the New Moon, or of the Sabbath Day, which are a Shaddow of things to come; but the Body is of Christ:</hi> And that they were Shadows of the Spiritual Appearance of Christ, whose Dispensation to Mankind was introduced by his outward Appearance, the Apostle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> shews, chap. 9. that the Service which <hi>stood in Meats and Drinks, and divers Washing and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinances, did not make perfect as pertaining to the Conscience; but was a Figure of good things to come, even the purging the Conscience from dead works, to serve the living God; by the spotless Offering of the Blood of Christ, through the Eternal Spirit.</hi> Thus, the benefit of that Offering cannot be witnessed by Man, but through the inward Operation of the Eternal Spirit, whereby the Conscience can be


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:63041:120"/>
purged from Dead Works. And thus the <hi>Scripture plainly teaches,</hi> That the Types and Shadows of the Law, and the Ministry of it are the Figure of the Covenant promised, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. which is also plentifully shewn by the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> throughout that admirable Epistle.</p>
               <p>And agreeable herewith is <hi>W. P.</hi> in the place last quoted by the <hi>Snake</hi>; for those words of his, <hi>One Outward thing cannot be the proper Figure or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of another,</hi> &amp;c. had relation to his forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, which the <hi>Snake</hi> hath cut off, and are these: <hi>As Abraham Outward and Natural, was the Great Father of the Iews, outward and natural, whose Seed God promised to bless with Earthly Blessings, as</hi> Canaan, <hi>&amp;c. And that they were figurative of the one Seed Christ, and such as he should beget into a lively hope through the Power of his Spiritual Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp;c. — Thus <hi>W. P.</hi> And as the <hi>Snake</hi> cannot deny, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was figurative of Christ, and that to his Seed, as they continued in his Faith, the Oath of God was to them, in that outward Covenant. So it must of necessity follow, that this <hi>Great Father</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Outward and Natural, doth not herein otherwise Typify Christ, than as Christ is the Spiritual Father of all the Nations of them that are saved, through Faith and Obedience in, and to his Spirit in their Hearts.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 143. <hi>They can, upon a pinch, subscribe the whole Creed, and yet not mean one word of it of God or Christ at all; that is, of any God or Christ without Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, is not this a fair mark of what kind, that <hi>great Charity and real kindness</hi> must be, which in p. 23. foregoing he pretends to have for the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of us? Or is it not rather a mark of that <hi>Flaming</hi> Charity which himself declares to have for the Church? But Charity and Truth are at an


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:63041:121"/>
equal distance from him, who can thus notoriously belie us, by charging such Dissimulation on us, as is his own practice. That we can subscribe, not upon a pinch, but heartily and readily, all the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Holy Writ, and the Articles of Faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained is True; but that we do not mean one of them Testimonies, of God or Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Men,</hi> is as great a falshood as the Devil can utter. And if Preaching, if Writing, if constant Profession in Words, together with Practice agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from a People, can be a sufficient evidence that they do so own and mean: I defy the <hi>Snake,</hi> with all his Confederacy, to give better and greater evidence, that they acknowledge any of the Truths therein contain'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> next repeats a Quotation from <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Errand,</hi> p. 8. which is answered before in p. 59. and another from the <hi>Sword of the Lord drawn,</hi> &amp;c. p. 5. which is also answered, p. 204. foregoing, and therefore need not be here repeated.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 145. The <hi>Snake,</hi> speaking of <hi>W. Smith</hi>'s Primmer, says, <hi>Here is an Admirable Cue given to Young Children, to prevent their ever receiving the least tincture of Christianity, that if they should at any time hear of a Christ in Heaven, they might immediately stop their Ears, and believe all who spoke of it, to be false Ministers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this <hi>Snake</hi> is a false Accuser, and has not <hi>the least tincture of Christian Charity:</hi> there needs lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more trouble to prove, than barely to give truly (which the <hi>Snake</hi> has not, but curtail'd) those Questions and Answers which are in p. 8, 9. of <hi>W. Smith</hi>'s Primmer, and which are as follows.</p>
               <p>Child. <hi>But do they, (Ministers) not all preach Christ in words?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Father.</hi> Yes, the false (Ministers) can speak of the Name of Christ as the true do, but they want his Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:63041:121"/>Child. <hi>But how may I then know which is true, and which is false, by their words; seeing words may be the same?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Father.</hi> Why, they that are false, preach Christ without, and bid People believe in him, as he is in Heaven above; but they that are true Ministers, they Preach Christ within, and direct People to wait to feel him in themselves, and so to believe in him, as he makes himself manifest in them; and this is true Doctrine that brings People to mind that principle of God in their own Consciences, which comes down from Heaven, and goes thither again; and such as are in the earthly wisdom, they do not know Heaven above.</p>
               <p>Child. <hi>This is a great Difference in their Doctrine, for one to preach Christ without, and another preacheth him within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Father.</hi> Yes, it doth make a great Difference, and hath no more fellowship together, than the <hi>East</hi> hath with the <hi>West.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>W. S.</hi> And this is so far from preventing <hi>the least tincture of Christianity,</hi> that it is a sound initiating Lesson for Children, it being no other than a plain and short Paraphrase of divers Texts of Scripture, and particularly of 2 Cor. 5.16, 17. <hi>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the Flesh: Yea, tho' we have known Christ after the Flesh, yet henceforth know we him so no more. Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature, old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.</hi> Col. 1.27. <hi>That God would make known what is the riches of the Glory of this Mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of Glory.</hi> In which places, according to the whole tenour of the Gospel-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, the Apostle labours to bring People to give up to the workings of the Spirit of Christ in them: Yet does not hereby slight or undervalue,


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:63041:122"/>
much less deny Christ in his appearance in the Flesh, nor the Office of his Mediatorship in Heaven; by whom it is, that the Gifts of the Holy Spirit are given to Men. And agreeable to this was the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and End of <hi>W. S.</hi> in that Primmer of his.</p>
               <p>But further, if we make but a small amendment of the word [only] to the second Answer, what will become of the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Cavil? and then read it thus. <hi>They that are false, preach Christ without, and bid People believe in him,</hi> only <hi>as he is in Heaven above,</hi> &amp;c.—</p>
               <p>It will be past his Cavil, and he ought not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for such an Elipsis, to have forfeited all his Pretended Charity, nor falsly to have declared it an <hi>admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cue, to prevent the least tincture of Christianity.</hi> I expect that this amendment may be opposed by him; and that he may urge that our Writings are by no means to be added to. But if it be so urged, I would then answer: The Church hath given abundant encouragement to supply Eliptick Defects by her Example, and Practice in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in which there are a thousand (I believe) Instances, of a word, or words added, with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (I would in Charity think) of more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the Mind of the Holy Ghost: And what is so familiarly done with Holy Writ, surely we may do with our Friends Books.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 145. The <hi>Snake</hi> makes a curtail'd quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from p. 17. of <hi>E. B</hi>'s Preface to <hi>G. F</hi>'s <hi>Great Mystery.</hi> thus, <hi>We differ in Doctrines and Principles, and the one thou must justifie, and the other thou must condemn, as being, the one clean contrary to the other in our Principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E. B.</hi> in this place was speaking of those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Principles, of the Priests, which were opposed in that Book, some of which I have mentioned p. 155. but not indefinitely of


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:63041:122"/>
all the Principles they did, or might hold; and that there was reason to oppose them, I question not but the impartial Reader will agree, not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, for that they are <hi>clean contrary</hi> to us, but for that they are so, to true Christian Doctrine. And of these, and such as these <hi>E. B.</hi> speaks thus, p. 17. <hi>ut supra,</hi>
                  <q>And besides, their Petitioning <hi>(which the Priests and others did)</hi> the Magistrates against us, and Preaching and Praying against us, and all the evil and wickedness, in Work, Word and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire brought forth against us from time to time. Yet here, sober Reader, thou hast a Catalogue, and whole number of Books printed and written against us, and abundance of their Doctrines ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered against us, and in opposition to us, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in this Volume, in a sum, with our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to them. And if thy Mind and Heart be single, thou mayst hereby understand, in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the difference in Doctrine between them and us, and compare each of them with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and see whether their Doctrines and Principles, laid down as the subject of their Books; or our Doctrines and Principles laid down in answer to theirs, be according to, and and agree with the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And if thou be impartial in this business, and single in this Search and Judgment; I doubt not but thou wilt, in a great measure, satisfie thy self, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved concerning their Priests and Professors in <hi>England,</hi> and us who are called <hi>Quakers.</hi> And when thou hast thus done, own and deny whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them or us, for thou mayst fully perceive we differ in Doctrines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> —</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Sober Reader, what just exception can there be to the tryal of Doctrines and Principles, where the Holy Scripture is assigned for the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, and such persuasion as the Lord shall give,


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:63041:123"/>
is to be Leader. But this is a Tryal the <hi>Snake</hi> dreads, because it wholly destroys Implicit Faith; and blind Obedience.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 146. <hi>And therefore this difference of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine betwixt the</hi> Quakers <hi>and us, which, they say, is as wide as from</hi> East <hi>to</hi> West, <hi>must be more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Light within,</hi> &amp;c. —</p>
               <p>Yes, so it is, it is concerning the <hi>Separation</hi> and <hi>Incommunication</hi> of the Deity mentioned, p. 189 foregoing. It is concerning <hi>the Holy Scriptures alone being the Object of Faith:</hi> It is concerning <hi>the Letter of the Scripture, being the Sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> It is concerning <hi>the Letter of the Scripture being God:</hi> It is concerning <hi>the Scriptures being the Power of God, and the Iudge by which all Men shall be judged.</hi> And in fine, it is concerning many other things mentioned in that Book <hi>Great Mystery</hi>; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of which I have refer'd to in their several pages, as I have met with them.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 146. <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>do positively determine their Light within, to be not a Secondary Agent, or sent from any other; but that it is it self the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> do indeed determine according to the Testimonies of our Saviour, and his Holy Apostles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20. <hi>John</hi> 14.17, 20. and 15.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 10, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. and 6.19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.4. That the Spirit of God is measurably given or manifested to Men; in order for the purifying their Consciences from Dead Works to serve the Living God. And if the <hi>Snake</hi> can, from Scripture, prove these, with all the other Texts, speaking of the Spirit of God in Man, are to be understood, of some <hi>Secondary Agent</hi>; or that the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is such, then his term may be allowed; till then, we rather choose to keep to the Language of Holy Writ; and


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:63041:123"/>
must own that the Holy Spirit of God, measura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly manifested to Men, is to every particular Man in himself, the only true Foundation and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Religion. And such who have not this Foundation, for their Religion, can do no more with respect to the things of God, than (as the Apostle says) <hi>make a fair shew in the Flesh.</hi> This is also plainly the sense of <hi>W. S</hi>'s Catechism, p. 57.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 147. <hi>Yet to make it exceeding plain that the Quakers do not believe that Christ has any other Body, or other Humanity, than that Spiritual, or Allegorical Body, or what ever they mean by it, which they say he has within them. In</hi> E. B<hi>'s works, p.</hi> 149. <hi>This Question is asked in these plain and peremptory terms,</hi> 
                  <q>Is that very Man, with that very Body, within you, yea or nay? <hi>And the Answer is as plain,</hi> The very Christ of God is within us, we dare not deny him.</q>
(And <hi>E. B.</hi> adds, which the <hi>Snake</hi> has cut off, as hath been before shewn) We are Members of his Body, of his Flesh, and of his Bone, as the <hi>Ephesians</hi> were (<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.13.)</p>
               <p>Now, I will grant the <hi>Snake</hi> that this Answer is not only plain, but also true, and dare him to deny it if he can, we having for Authority herein, not only <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. but a Cloud of Scripture Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies: But it is <hi>exceeding plain</hi> that the <hi>Snake</hi> tells a Lye, when he says that <hi>E. B.</hi> does in this Answer say, that the Manhood of Christ which Suffered and Dyed upon the Cross, was Buried, did gloriously Arise and Ascend into Heaven, where he hath now a bodily existence; is in that bodily existence within us? No, <hi>E. B.</hi> says, Christ was in us, as he was in the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that is, Spiritually, unless the <hi>Snake</hi> will have it to be <hi>exceeding plain,</hi> that the Holy Apostle does there mean by Body, Flesh and Bone, that which he


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63041:124"/>
took of the Virgin: And if he will so have it, it will be <hi>exceeding plain</hi> that he perverteth the Text, as much as he does <hi>E. B</hi>'s words.</p>
               <p>But further, Reader, as <hi>exceeding plain</hi> as the <hi>Snake</hi> does falsly say it is, that we deny the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily existence of Christ without us in Heaven: He confesses his Ignorance of our Belief, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to determine herein, whether it be, <hi>other Humanity than that Spiritual, or Allegorical, Body, or what ever they mean by it:</hi> Yet, for all this, his Cloudiness and Ignorance herein, he does <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plainly,</hi> and in most <hi>peremptory terms,</hi> bely and abuse us; for we do, and always have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and believed the bodily existence of Christ without us, as he ascended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet do also say, he is Spiritually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us. Of which is further spoken, p. 213. fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 147. <hi>They have of late brought</hi> G. F<hi>'s Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous</hi> Journal <hi>into the Publick Meeting-House at the</hi> Savoy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>G. F</hi>'s Journal is Blasphemous, remains to be proved, unless we will take for proof the <hi>Snake</hi>'s having (as he says p. 16.) <hi>Boldly and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently,</hi> as well as falsly, <hi>averred it,</hi> for better or truer he has not to give. That it was so late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to the <hi>Savoy</hi> Meeting-House, there is a very good reason; which is, that it was but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Printed.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 148. <hi>This is an Honour they never yet vouchsaf'd to the Holy Scriptures, which are not to be seen in their Meetings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a notorious Lye, for it is no greater <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> than is frequently vouchsaf'd (to use his terms) to the Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 148. <hi>And it was a bold effort in</hi> G. K. <hi>to bring a Bible into his Meeting at Turners-Hall, and


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:63041:124"/>
reckoned by his opposites as a sign of his turning back again to the Priests way of Worship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How <hi>bold</hi> G. K's <hi>effort</hi> was, in so doing, I shall leave the <hi>Snake</hi> and him to agree, but what was, and is to us, a sign of his Backsliding, is, his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much turned his back upon that Profession of the Light of Jesus Christ, which he hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore professed.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 148. <hi>In their Publick Schools, particularly that great one at</hi> Wansworth, <hi>near</hi> London, <hi>Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this</hi> G. Fox<hi>'s Journal are enjoyned to the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to be read every day; but never a Chapter out of the Bible, that is Beastly ware with them, Dust and Death, and Serpents Meat! The Publick ought to take some care of this in pity to their poor Souls. This I cautioned before in</hi> Satan Disrob'd, <hi>but repeat it here because it is material.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is indeed, <hi>Reader,</hi> very material, that a Man should with so hardened a forehead tell Lyes, and repeat them, and that with design, as himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, to make the <hi>Publick</hi> the Executioner to his wicked designs; and be himself thus the Trumpeter to Disturbance. I say this is very material, but that nothing <hi>material</hi> or true, is in what he hath said as above, I shall, <hi>Reader,</hi> prove I hope to thy Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>And first Generally, for our Publick Schools, which the <hi>Snake</hi> upon his own Authority, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Proof, hath so charged, I do as generally charge him with a Lye in that his Assertion, and my single denial is at least of equal Authority with his single charge, if he will name particulars, I shall also as in this his particular Instance, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it by Certificates under the hands of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (who are not <hi>Quakers</hi>) and who being near Neighbours, and in the School often, do full well

And if this our Adversary had not a natural propensity to tell Lyes, he could not thus err from Truth: For, hiding and sculk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as he generally does) in the City, he might with small pains have gone by Water to <hi>Wansworth,</hi> 5 Miles, or with less cost have sent a <hi>Penny-Post</hi> Letter to many Persons of that Town, who could have better inform'd him herein, if he had not been both Hypocritical and Unjust, in that he pretends care to our Souls, while he wilfully tells Lyes with purpose to destroy us. This his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice leads me to observe of him, that he is fitter, to all the purposes of Destruction and Hate, than to that one great purpose to which he falsly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, <hi>viz.</hi> to promote the <hi>Vnity of the Church.</hi>

But as it hath pleased God (who hath the Hearts of all Men in his hand) to incline the Government to give us some security against the evil practices of ill designing Men, by affording us a Toleration, in the matters of the Worship of


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:63041:126"/>
our God; so we are truly thankful to God and the Government herein; and are at no time backward to give an account of the Faith, which is in us, and our agreeable practice, however misrepresented by this Incendiary in Religion.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 148. <hi>I will end this Section with shewing that the Quakers have in their Blasphemies against the Divinity of Jesus, and Humanity of Christ, only lick'd up and improv'd the Ancient most Anti-christian He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I may fitly end this Section with shewing, that whatsoever the <hi>Marcionites, Manichees, Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians</hi> and <hi>Saturnians,</hi> might hold as to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity and Incarnation of Christ; yet we have always said, and believed, according to Scripture, that Jesus, so fore-named by the Angel, and born of the Virgin, in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Judea,</hi> was truly and properly Man, and in all respects (Sin only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) like unto us; and that in this Man Jesus, the Godhead dwelt Bodily, and that through the Power of the Godhead in him, he did open and consecrate a New and Living Way, for Men to Salvation, and Eternal Life, through the Veil, that is to say, his Flesh: And this Truth the Apostle does not deny, when he allegorizes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. The Spiritual Union and Fellowship of Christ with his Followers, under the terms of being Members of his <hi>Body, Flesh</hi> and <hi>Bones,</hi> and in a like acceptation, are very many other such expressions in Scripture to be understood, yet is it not thence to be concluded (unless falsly, as this <hi>Snake</hi> does) that they are Heretically agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>Cerdonites,</hi> the <hi>Eutychians</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicheans.</hi>

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:63041:126"/>
whom our Modern</hi> Socinians, <hi>and from them the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>do derive their Doctrine, did mightily underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the Scriptures.

And this the</hi> Quakers <hi>have done beyond any that went before them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> does, p. 336. <hi>Demand Reparation in the Name of the Church of England</hi>; insinuating his real or assumed Power; and if I should now do the like for, or in the name of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>; I may be as much to seek for Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from him, for this his abuse, as I am to seek for proof in this Charge. However, I do at least demand a proof, where ever the <hi>Quakers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to mend the Scriptures,</hi> or did <hi>boldly Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them,</hi> or did <hi>set up other Scriptures against those received?</hi> 'Tis no Proof of this Charge, to say (p. 150.) We <hi>have cannonized our own Writings</hi>: If that were true, <hi>it's</hi> no proof, but it is false: We may have said, and said truly, that Writings given forth from the movings of the Spirit of God in any, are given forth from the same Spirit which gave forth the Scriptures. But we have always readily offered and submitted our Words and Writings to the Testimony of the Holy Scripture, because, tho' the Spirit of God in his People, at this day, is the same Holy Spirit which was in the Holy Apostles, yet they had greater Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations of it: So that tho' it is both now and then the same in kind, the Degree of Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion differs. But to return, I do, as above, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand proof, where ever we have <hi>pretended to mend the Scriptures, or have boldly Adulterated them, or set up others against them?</hi> As, <hi>Euseb. Hist. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 28. <hi>Theod. Haerit. Fab. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5. do mention instances of some that did; and as he says, we <hi>have, beyond

any that ever went before us</hi>; yet gives not one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. The <hi>Snake</hi>'s <hi>Ipse Dixit</hi> is no Proof; and if he cannot give better, it will at least be a fresh Proof both of his Impudence and Lyes.</p>

               <head>SECT. X. Concerning the Satisfaction of Christ in Opposition to the false Charges of the <hi>Snake</hi> herein.</head>
               <p>IN the Section immediately foregoing, <hi>the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity and Incarnation of Christ,</hi> is largly treated of, and I have therein shewn, that we own and believe both, as declared fully and truly in the Holy Scriptures, and also that our Books, rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the perversions of this our Adversary, do speak according to that acknowledged <hi>Rule.</hi> It remains that in this, I now shew, that we have always owned, in like Scriptural sense; that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> in Life, Doctrine and Death, did ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil his Father's Will, and did offer up himself, a most Satisfactory Sacrifice, for the Sins of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; in opposition to the false Insinuations of the <hi>Snake</hi> herein, who says, p. 151. <hi>Herein the</hi> Quakers <hi>are direct</hi> Socinians, <hi>for they positively deny the Satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under which cloudy Charge, he insinuates as if we did deny, what the Scriptures do declare herein: Which is false, and he might with equal Sincerity have said, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>The Satisfaction.</hi> For to come nearer,


<pb n="231" facs="tcp:63041:127"/>
                  <hi>The Satisfaction</hi> which is <hi>positively</hi> denied by us, is as <hi>positively</hi> denied by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which is that rigid and strict Notion of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which some had Doctrinally, but unscripturally laid down in the terms following, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>That Man, having transgressed the Righteous Law of God, and so exposed to the Penalty of Eternal Wrath, it's altogether impossible for God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or forgive without a plenary Satisfaction; and that there was no other way, by which God could obtain Satisfaction, or save Men, than by inflicting the Penalty of Infinite Wrath and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance on Jesus Christ, the second Person in the Trinity, who, for Sins past, present, and to come, hath wholly born and paid it, to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Infinite Justice of his Father.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This, <hi>Reader,</hi> is <hi>the Satisfaction,</hi> or strict and rigid Notion of it which we do deny, and which <hi>W. P.</hi> as quoted by the <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 154. does <hi>totally exclude,</hi> as anon I shall have occasion more largely to shew. But that we do from hence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Satisfaction which Christ did make, and which the Father did accept, as mentioned and declared in Holy Writ, is very false. For we do believe, that as our Saviour does declare, <hi>John</hi> 10.18. <hi>No Man taketh it from me</hi> (speaking of his Life) <hi>but I lay it down of my self: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment received I of my Father.</hi> I say, we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that as Christ had this Commandment and Power from the Father, so by his pure, divine, free and voluntary Resignation, <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> Mat. 26.42. he did thereby endear the Father's Love unto him, as himself declares <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my Life.</hi> And this his free and unconstrained vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Offering of himself, as a Ransom for all,


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:63041:128"/>
did include his Agony on the Mount, and his Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny on the Cross, in fine: It includes all his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings both inward and outward, whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a compleat, perfect and satisfactory <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and as such was accepted of the Father. This briefly, but truly, and according to Scripture, is a short account of the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> which we <hi>do po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively</hi> own; as the former is an account of <hi>the Satisfaction</hi> which we <hi>do positively</hi> deny.</p>
               <p>But tho' we have in terms, often more largely, but to the purpose above, declared our Sentiments herein: Yet the <hi>Snake,</hi> that he may in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects imitate the grand Serpent and false Accuser, does with his usual assurance (speaking of this Doctrine) say, p. 151. <hi>Mr.</hi> Penn <hi>Blasphemes it, as both Irreligious and Irrational.</hi> But with his false Glossing, neither shews what the Doctrine of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is, nor wherein <hi>W. P.</hi> doth Blaspheme it.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Reader,</hi> for thy fuller Information herein, I shall acquaint thee (and that the rather, because <hi>W. P.</hi> is the only particular Person of our Friends, who the <hi>Snake</hi> in this Section does Hiss at) briefly, with the State of that Controversie, which will give at least some Light to thy Judging of it. About the Year 1670 or sooner (as we have been seldom without opposition, as now) there was a Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Adversaries, who writ many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us; and we then, as now, were not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to inform the Honest Inquirer, and reprove the Envious Slanderer, by making publick our Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Belief and Sentiments in those things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were misrepresented and abused, as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Books of ours, Printed about that time, will plentifully shew. Among other things, wherein we were then falsly accused, the Doctrine of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> was one: And the line, by which we were to be measured, was not the Scripture, but their


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63041:128"/>
own wrong Opinions of it, which I have already mentioned, p. 231. foregoing. This, among other things, gave occasion to them Books of <hi>W. P</hi>'s <hi>Reason against Railing, Sandy Foundation shaken</hi>; and the <hi>Serious Apology,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Innocency with its open Face.</hi> Of which Books the <hi>Snake</hi> does make so much use, as here and there to pick a Line or two; and what is more unjust? He heaps up 12 or more lines (p. 152.) without naming Book or Page, and that must represent <hi>W. P</hi>'s force (tho' not his, as there laid down) and against this the <hi>Snake</hi> levels his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, and Determines of the whole Books, and all the <hi>Quakers.</hi> p. 154. <hi>They exceed the Impudence of the very</hi> Socinians, <hi>in their bold Effrontry against this most Fundamental Doctrine of the Christian Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And notwithstanding a trifling excuse, which the <hi>Snake</hi> here makes, for his not proving his Charge, I see not how he can avoid being thought <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Impudent,</hi> so liberally to accuse, and then fob the Reader off, with saying,</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>My business at the present, being not to enter into the large Field of the Socinian Controversie, but to shew the much misled generality of the</hi> Quakers.</p>
               <p>Are they <hi>much misled,</hi> because of his false Charge? No, himself is therein much misled: But for proof against us, we may expect what he saith, Ibid. <hi>He hath wrote at large upon this Subject (which may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after see the Light.)</hi> So that till his Darkness come to Light, the Reader may, if he please, take our Adversary's word, that we are <hi>much misled,</hi> and <hi>exceed the Impudence,</hi> &amp;c.— I doubt not but to find a much more Impartial Judgment from my Sober Reader, to whom I now apply my self; and do acquaint him, That <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Sandy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> &amp;c. does in great part imploy himself against that rigid and unscriptural Doctrine of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, which I have set down, p. 231. foregoing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>


                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:63041:129"/>
Against which <hi>W. P.</hi> does in p. 14, &amp;c. cite at large, the Scriptures hereafter refer'd to, and shews the contrariety of this Doctrine to these Scriptures, and some absurdities which unavoidably follow thereupon. The Scriptures refer'd to are these, <hi>Exo.</hi> 34.6, 7. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, to 34. <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31, 32. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5, 18, 19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9. These dispatch'd. He further shews, from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son under three Heads, that this <hi>rigid Doctrine</hi> is not true, from distinct Arguments raised, that Jesus Christ did not give such <hi>rigid</hi> Satisfaction, either as God, or as Man, nor as God and Man. These, for brevity sake, I omit, and come to some of those <hi>Irreligious</hi> and <hi>Irrational</hi> Consequences which <hi>W. P.</hi> does shew, do arise from this their <hi>rigid</hi> Notion of Satisfaction, the 5th, 6th, 7th of which are these which follow, and by which, the <hi>Snake</hi> says <hi>W. P.</hi> Blasphemes the Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="5">5.
<q>It (<hi>the Doctrine in</hi> p. 231. ut supra) repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the Son more kind and compassionate than the Father: Whereas, if both be the same God, then either the Father is as Loving as the Son, or the Son as angry as the Father.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6.
<q>It robs God of the Gift of his Son for our Redemption (which the Scriptures attribute to the unmerited Love he had for the World) in affirming the Son purchased that Redemption from the Father, by the Gift of himself to God, as our compleat Satisfaction.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7.
<q>Since Christ could not pay what was not his own, it follows, that in the payment of his own, the case remains still equally grievous, since the debt is not hereby absolv'd or forgiven, but transfer'd only; and by consequence we are no better provided for Salvation than before, ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="235" facs="tcp:63041:129"/>
that now to the Son which was once owing to the Father.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These, <hi>Reader,</hi> are some of those Consequences which <hi>W. P.</hi> shews, do naturally follow that strange and <hi>rigid</hi> Notion, <hi>That it is altogether Impossible for God to remit or forgive without a plenary Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and that God</hi> could <hi>not, by any other way, obtain Satisfaction, or save Men, without inflicting the Penalty of infinite</hi> Wrath <hi>and</hi> Vengance <hi>on Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if the Consequences are Blasphemous, it is owning to the Doctrine; not <hi>W. P</hi>'s natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of them from it, any more than the Glass that is truly Cut and Ground can be in fault to reflect the Deformities that are set before it. But whether true or false, the <hi>Snake</hi> says, p. 151. <hi>His Arguments are the old Socinian Job-trot.</hi> But if, in the reverse, the <hi>Job-trotting</hi> proves the <hi>Non-jurors, W. P</hi>'s Arguments may be good still; and I think it will hardly pass for sufficient reason, that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are therefore bad, because either <hi>Socinian</hi> or <hi>Non-juror,</hi> may have used such like to other purposes. If this be so, then why not further, and reject all the true Articles, which they may believe, as well as the Arguments which they may use? And if the <hi>Snake</hi> is resolved to keep at this distance from us, and disbelieve an Article because we believe it, he must resolve to deny God, and Jesus Christ, and all hopes of Salvation by him: Together with all the Holy Doctrines which the Scriptures teach, and which we firmly Believe. But how shy soever he may be of us herein, yet himself is a notable <hi>Job-trotter</hi>; for that his Arguments, his Accusations, his Stories, and numerous Perversions, are no other than what have often, from Adversaries of many Names, been objected against us, and as often an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by us: Yet as false, and as often rebuffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,


<pb n="236" facs="tcp:63041:130"/>
as this <hi>Job-trot</hi> has been. The <hi>Snake</hi> hath licked it up, and improv'd it, as is commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, Lies do improve by carrying.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 153. <hi>But upon the Socinian and Quaker Scheme, one of God's Attributes must fight with, and conquer the other: And his Justice must quit the Field to his Mercy. This is great Nonsense, as well as Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and utterly inconsistent with the first Notions of a God.</hi>

               <p>'Tis true, that they who believe and say, that God's <hi>Attributes combate and conquer each other,</hi> do believe and say <hi>Nonsense</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> because all Jarr and Strife is utterly inconsistent with the Unity of his Being. But that the <hi>Quakers</hi> have ever so believed or said, is false; and does yet remain to be prov'd: Which it can never be; for we, as well as the <hi>Snake</hi> (p. 152.) do say, <hi>That God's Justice</hi> is greatly exalted, in that it did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and accept the full and compleat Satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Offering, which Christ did give of himself, to offended Divine Justice. And that God's Wisdom and Mercy is also greatly exalted, in finding out and affording that means. And we say also, That these are fulfilled <hi>Infinitely in the wonderful Oeconomy of our Salvation,</hi> in that compleat Satisfactory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: All this, and more to the like purpose, we believe, as well as the <hi>Snake.</hi> But the <hi>Snake,</hi> tho' with his false Glossings, he would represent <hi>W.

This shews the <hi>Snake</hi> did, by his own practice, make that Judgment, which he hath falsly given of us, p. 143. <hi>They</hi> (He it must now be read) <hi>can, upon a pinch, subscribe the whole Creed, and not mean one word of it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For the present, we have done with his Charge from <hi>Sandy Foundation shaken,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Snake</hi> next quotes p. 154. a passage from <hi>W.

               </p>

               <head>SECT. XI. Concerning the Resurrection of the Body.</head>
               <p>THIS Adversary, the <hi>Snake,</hi> after the example of some former Enemies, does charge us falsly with the denial hereof: And it is in some sort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable to me how they should make it a Charge upon us, to deny that, which is indeed, so firmly believed by us — and by which we are stayed, and supported under the Evils we meet, and the reproaches which we suffer: For were our hope in this life only, we might with the Apostle say, 1 Cor. 15.19. <hi>We are of all men most miserable.</hi> But we have Faith and Hope in Christ, in whom we have believed, that after having passed through this Vale of Tears, wherein we are encompassed with Perils of many sorts, from Apostates and other Adversaries; and are accounted Deceivers, yet True. We shall after this Life, receive, if we persevere in Faith, and Obedience, a resurrection to a Glorious Immortality, through Christ our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Thus (and often more largely) have we testified our belief of this Great Doctrine of the Christian Faith; but because we deny (as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scriptural) that the same Natural, Fleshly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy shall rise. Our Adversaries do thence unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously infer and conclude, that we deny the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body in any sense. And thus does the <hi>Snake,</hi> who, in this Section, does chiefly, (as in the last Section wholly) quarrel and pervert these Books of <hi>W. P</hi>'s <hi>Reason against Railing,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Invality of</hi> John Faldo<hi>'s Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. and so gross is he, in his perversion and abuse of


<pb n="240" facs="tcp:63041:132"/>
them, that he begins the very first line of this Section, with saying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 155. <hi>This (viz.</hi> the Resurrection) <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>do positively deny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, that this Charge is <hi>positively</hi> false, as made by the <hi>Snake,</hi> from the two Books before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will best appear, by transcribing from the Books themselves (not in Bits as this <hi>Snake</hi> has done) both the occasion, by which this Doctrine came to be spoken to, and also pretty largely the manner in which <hi>W. P.</hi> does, in them speak to it. And I doubt not Reader, but his Christian Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Scriptural Expression, therein, will be so much to thy satisfaction; that thou wilt find rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son therefrom, to conclude in opposition to the <hi>Snake,</hi> that we do <hi>positively</hi> own the Resurrection of the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To the occasion, on which it came to be spoken to, it was this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi> (an Adversary) had published a piece under the Title of <hi>Dialogues</hi>; wherein, upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Doctrines of the Christian Faith, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds Questions: And then brings in, under the names of <hi>Quakers,</hi> generally such Answers, as might answer his purpose, either to Refute, or Cavil at.</p>
               <p>In the 57th p. of his Dialogues, he propounds a Question, whether the <hi>same Carnal Body that Dies,</hi> shall rise again?</p>
               <p>In Answer to this Question, he brings in <hi>G. W.</hi> saying, "Is it not written, <hi>Thou Fool, that which thou sowest, is not the Body which shall be, but God gives a Body as pleaseth him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus (says <hi>T. Hicks) Whitehead</hi> reply'd, and <hi>G. Fox,</hi> the Younger, speaks to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:63041:132"/>
                  <q>Fools, that say this Body of Natural Flesh and Bones shall rise: I say, the Body which is sown, is not the Body which shall be.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I query</hi> (says <hi>T. H.) whether both these Persons, do not tacitly deny the resurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, Reader, was the occasion, on which <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Reason against Railing,</hi> &amp;c. speaks of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. I now come to the manner in which he speaks of it in that Book. But will first only observe to my Reader, that as in the Proverb, <hi>A Lye does not lose by Carrying:</hi> So the <hi>Snake</hi> has improv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>T. Hicks</hi>'s disingenuity. He was contented with querying, whether we did not <hi>tacitly</hi> deny the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. But the <hi>Snake,</hi> scorning to mumble doubtingly, says, we <hi>positively</hi> deny it, which, as above, and will also hereafter appear; is a <hi>positive</hi> falshood. But first I desire it may be observ'd, from the foregoing, that the Question was whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>same Carnal Body that Dyes, shall rise?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In answer to which with the Appendices of the Question, as laid down in the <hi>Dialogues, W.P.</hi> imploys eight pages of the Book <hi>Reason against Railing,</hi> &amp;c. and of all of them the <hi>Snake</hi> hath taken about so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lines, by which, according to his own words, p. 350. <hi>It was intended purely to have it say, that there was an Answer to such a Book,</hi> or rather to this part of that Book. But to shew that the <hi>Snake</hi> hath neither answered <hi>W. P.</hi> herein, nor that the <hi>Quakers</hi> do therein deny the Resurrection, take the following Quotation from that Book, p. 132, 133.
<q>Now that <hi>T. H.</hi> hath shewn himself at once disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and erroneous too; let it be observed, 1. That from our denial of the Resurrection of the same Natural, Fleshly Body, he absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infers and concludes <hi>our denial of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body in any sense</hi>;</q>
                  <q>Which is great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice


<pb n="242" facs="tcp:63041:133"/>
to any Adversary. 2. Let it be well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that <hi>he makes the Scripture it self to deny the Resurrection, and so Heterodox,</hi> by accounting <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>G. F.</hi> their Answers, in Scripture Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>to be a denial of the Resurrection:</hi> For if <hi>T. H.</hi> does not intend by his arguing, that the same Body that died, <hi>without any mutation</hi> shall rise again, what makes him to quarrel at the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>'s saying, <hi>Thou Fool, that which thou sowest is not the Body which shall be</hi>; and repute us Hereticks for believing him?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Certainly his <hi>gross</hi> belief of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> is inconsistent with Scripture, Reason, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of all Men, right in their Wits, in the point; Who can have the Confidence to call the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture his Rule, and yet contradict it so Egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, as when the Apostle tells us, <hi>It is not the same Body that is sown that shall be,</hi> to assert, <hi>that it is the same Body,</hi> and that, who says the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, denies the Resurrection of the Dead, and Eternal Recompence? In short, We do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Resurrection in order to Eternal Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and that every Seed shall have its own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and rest contented with what Body it shall please God to give us: But as we are not such <hi>Fools</hi> as curiously to enquire <hi>what:</hi> So must we ever deny the <hi>Gross</hi> conceits of <hi>T. H.</hi> and his Adherents concerning the Resurrction.— p. 134. But he <hi>(T. H.)</hi> thinks he is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason; <hi>For</hi> (says he) <hi>if the</hi> It <hi>in the Text be not the same Body, how can that be called a Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; for that supposeth the same?</hi> Dialog. p. 58.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I Answer, if a thing can yet be the same, and notwithstanding changed, for shame let us never make so much stir against the Doctrine of Trasubstantiation: For the absurdity of that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:63041:133"/>
Resurrection. — p. 135. Dialog. Ibid.</q>
                  <hi>And this Mortal shall put on Immortality, this Corruptible shall put on Incorruption,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.53.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I grant that this implies a Change, but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that it so much as intimates, that Men shall rise with those very <hi>Carnal</hi> Bodies that were buried. No, the Apostle not only tells us, that Body which is sown is not the Body that shall be, <hi>But that Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> vers. 50.— If <hi>T. Hicks</hi> should tell me no, it is meant that the Mortal Body should be changed into an Immortal Body, it follows that he is gone from the Letter of the Text into an Interpretation, as well as that it contradicts his absurd <hi>Identity</hi> or Sameness of Body. If so, it is as lawful for me (and more, if in the right) to construe it thus, p. 336.) <hi>That we, who are Mortals, respecting our Bodies, put off the Mortal Part, and put on instead thereof Immortality:</hi> Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to that weighty passage of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1.</q>
                  <hi>For we know, that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a Building of God, an House not made with hands, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the Heavens.</hi>
                  <q>Which as directly concludes the Change, not of <hi>Accidents,</hi> but <hi>Bodies,</hi> from an <hi>Earthly</hi> House or Tabernacle, to an <hi>Heavenly</hi> House or Building, as ever any thing can be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Men or Angels. — p. 137.</q>
The third place he brings, is out of the Epistle, <hi>Paul</hi> writ to the <hi>Philippians, He shall change our vile Bodies</hi>; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he says, <hi>This cannot be meant of a New Created Body, because such a Body cnnnot be said to be either Vile or Changed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But what makes this for his Conceit? Surely nothing. For if the <hi>Vile Body</hi> be changed, <hi>then it is not that Vile Body</hi>; therefore not the <hi>same</hi> Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Again, To say that Scripture can't be meant of


<pb n="244" facs="tcp:63041:134"/>
a New Created Body, because such one can't be said to be either Vile or Changed, makes much against him. For, 1. It is to say that the Body that shall be, is Vile, else what means his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Because such a Body cannot be said to be</hi> (not to have been) <hi>either Vile or Changed?</hi> 2. Tho' the Body that shall be, may not be said to be either Vile or Changed, yet it may be given of God in lieu of a Vile Body, and so the Vile Body changed for one that is Glorious. — But <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi> thinks, <hi>the Joys of Heaven imperfect else.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>P. 138.
<q>I answer, Is the Joy of the Ancients, now in Glory, imperfect? or are they in Heaven but by halves? If it be unequitable that the Body which hath suffered, should not partake of the Joys Coelestial: Is it not in measure unequal that the Soul should be rewarded so long before the Body?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Principle brings to the Mortality of the Soul, (held by many Baptists) or I am mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. But why must the Felicity of the Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon that of the Body? Is it not to make the Soul a kind of Widow, and so in a state of Mourning and Disconsolateness, to be without its beloved Body? Which State is but a better sort of Purgatory. See <hi>T. V.</hi> and <hi>T. D.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>What made the Apostle <hi>willing to be absent from the Body, that he might be present with the Lord?</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8, 9. If such a Dissolution brought Sadness instead of Joy, as our Adversaries in the point of the Resurrection suggest, if not boldly affirm? In short, If the Compleat Happiness of the Soul rests in a Reunion to a <hi>Carnal</hi> Body, for such it is sown? Then never cry out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Turks Alcoran,</hi> for such a Heaven, and the Joys of it suit admirably well with such a Resurrection. The Reasons I have to give


<pb n="245" facs="tcp:63041:134"/>
against this Barbarous Conceit, I thus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Because that the Scripture speaks of a Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and no Resurrection of that which is Dissolved, being Earthly, and unfit for a Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Paradice, and therefore hold forth <hi>a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, Eternal in the Heavens.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>P. 139. 2.
<q>If the Body be the same, it must have the same Nature, otherwise not the same Body: But if it have the <hi>same</hi> Nature, it will be corruptible still. Mortal Seeds bring forth Mortal Natures, not Immortal; neither can Mortal be Immortal, and yet the <hi>same</hi> Nature as before; for that Change made, tell me what remains of the Old Earthly Body? — P. 140. For our Parts, a <hi>Resurrection</hi> we believe, and of Bodies too, unto Eternal Life. What they shall not be, I have briefly said and prov'd: What they shall be we leave with God, who will give every one a Body as pleaseth him, and <hi>Thou Fool</hi> belongs to the unnecessary Medler.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>W. P.</hi> and also more large to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in the place refer'd to. From which it may appear, that, that which he compares to <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi> and <hi>the Turks Alcoran.</hi> Is that Gross Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of <hi>the Resurrection of the same Carnal Body,</hi> which is not Scriptural; and is exploded by Men eminent in the <hi>Church of England.</hi> Which tho' the <hi>Snake,</hi> with his usual assurance, peremptorily asserts, p. 156. <hi>No Christian ever held.</hi> Yet it does appear, that <hi>T. H.</hi> with others, (whom if the <hi>Snake</hi> will not acknowledge to be such, he must prove them otherwise) did so hold.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 156. <hi>Some of them</hi> (the Quakers) <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a perfectly New Body will be made for the Soul; but others, that the Soul it self is the Spiritual Body, which is mentioned</hi> 1 Cor. 15.44.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:63041:135"/>I do more than <hi>suppose,</hi> for I have prov'd the <hi>Snake</hi> a very false Relater of our <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Words</hi>; and if he will name who them, <hi>some,</hi> or <hi>others</hi> are, whose <hi>Suppositions</hi> he pretends to give; it is not unlikely but the <hi>Suppositions</hi> may prove to be his own.</p>

               <p>Ibid. p. 157. <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>owes Mr.</hi> Penn <hi>thanks for so very kind a Representation of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, as to make it stand upon a better foot than the Resurrection of the Body, which is an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of our Creed, and receiv'd by the Catholick Church in all ages.</hi>

                  </gap>ie <hi>W. P.</hi> For he alas, has only <hi>represented Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi> to be as easie in belief, as the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>the same Carnal Body which Dies</hi>; which I may safely say, <hi>no Christian</hi> ought to believe. But the <hi>Snake,</hi> as <hi>pro Aris &amp; Focis,</hi> has Combated the Reformation, opposed the Reasons and Arguments on which it is in part built, and has absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd the <hi>setting up opposite Altars,</hi> and affirm'd, that necessary Reformation had been best carried on by continuing in their Communion, as I have before shewn: for all which, and more to the same purpose, it may be <hi>supposed,</hi> the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome <hi>owes him</hi> many Thanks.</p>
               <p>But what thanks soever <hi>Rome</hi> may owe the <hi>Snake,</hi> it is very plain, <hi>W. P.</hi> owes him none, for charging


<pb n="247" facs="tcp:63041:135"/>
him indefinitely with representing the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body</hi> upon a worse foot than Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation. What <hi>W. P.</hi> did so represent, was the <hi>Resurrection of the same Carnal Body which Dies.</hi> Now if the <hi>Snake</hi> will please to tell us, that <hi>this is an Article in his Creed, and hath been received by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church in all Ages.</hi> It will be as easie to shew, that he says false with respect to the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as it will be to prove that himself believes falsly in the Article. As for the <hi>Resurrection of the Body,</hi> we, with the Catholick Church, do firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe it, and have always so declared; and have at all times been ready to testifie so much in the Language of Holy Writ.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 158. <hi>What does he think? Was not Christ's Body changed in his Transfiguration upon the Mount?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> hath just before told us, that <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation supposes a Change of Substance</hi>; upon which in my turn, I may ask, What does he think? Was Christ's Body so Changed upon the Mount?</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 159. <hi>The Grain must die, or else it will not fructifie or rise again. In this Death it loses some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as the Husks; but it retains the Substance which rises again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And let it be observed, by way of addition, to the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Agriculture, that the <hi>Substance,</hi> the full Grain in the Ear, is covered, when risen, with much such an Husk, the same for Nature with that which was lost in the Earth.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 160. <hi>Death is a great Change, yet if</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam <hi>dies, it is</hi> William, <hi>even the same</hi> William <hi>that Liv'd, who Died: And as sure it will be the same who shall rise again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Death is a great Change, is doubtless very true; but to bring the Question pretty near, if <hi>Charles</hi> dies, even the same <hi>Charles</hi> that lives, shall <hi>Charles,</hi> the same <hi>Charles</hi> of


<pb n="248" facs="tcp:63041:136"/>
Flesh, the same both for Substance and Husk rise again.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 160. <hi>But I am now to tell you a very strange thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet if it be true, its strangeness need not afright.</p>
               <p>Ibid. Mr. <hi>Penn does understand that long and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Description of the Resurrection of our Bodies, from the</hi> 35<hi>th verse of the</hi> 15<hi>th of the</hi> 1<hi>st Epistle to the</hi> Corinthians, only of the Spiritual State of the Soul in this Life.</p>
               <p>And if so, what then? Does <hi>W. Penn</hi> therefore deny the <hi>Resurrection of the Body,</hi> because he hath said, that the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.35. doth here speak of the <hi>Spiritual State of the Soul.</hi> If that be good Logick, then it concludes thus against the <hi>Snake,</hi> that he denies the Spiritual State of the Soul in this Life, because he declares the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.35. is to be understood of <hi>the Resurrection of our Bodies.</hi> And this Conclusion is very Natural, till the <hi>Snake</hi> can give a good Reason why <hi>W. P.</hi> hath not as much liberty, as himself, to expound 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.35. and that <hi>W. P</hi>'s Interpretation is against the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Place.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Reader,</hi> for thy more full satisfaction, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>W. P.</hi> as quoted by the <hi>Snake</hi> from that Book of his <hi>Invalidity,</hi> &amp;c. of which I have already given some small hint, p. 239. foregoing. I shall here briefly, first, speak to its occasion, and afterwards pretty largely transcribe <hi>W. P</hi>'s words, whereby thou wilt fully see, that he in this, as in <hi>Reason against Railing,</hi> &amp;c. does only deny that <hi>gross</hi> Conceit of the Resurrection of a <hi>Carnal</hi> Body, which was the Question.</p>
               <p>As to the first, the Occasion, it was this, <hi>J. F.</hi> published a Discourse, entituled, <hi>Quakerism no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> made up in great part of Quotations (as the <hi>Snake</hi> is, so that he has not the Glory of being


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:63041:136"/>
the first, tho' he may stand in Competition with him for falsity in them) out of our Books. This <hi>W. P.</hi> answer'd in a piece of his <hi>Quakerism a New Nick-Name for Old Christianity.</hi> And therein shews how grosly <hi>J. F.</hi> had mistaken our Principles, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted our Words in his Quotations: And finally confirms our true sense with the Authority of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>In Reply to this, <hi>J. Faldo</hi> published what he calls his <hi>Vindication</hi>; to which <hi>W.P.</hi> did Rejoin, under the Title of the <hi>Invalidity of</hi> J. F<hi>'s Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. which is the Book now in Question; from which the <hi>Snake</hi> does suggest <hi>W. P.</hi> to deny the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>For utter confutation of which, I entreat thy patience, <hi>Reader,</hi> to consider, what I shall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe from that Book, which will be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of what <hi>W. P.</hi> hath there said on this Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Invalidity,</hi> &amp;c. p. 368.
<q>We may guess how well he prov'd it in his Book, <hi>(the Resurrection of the Natural Body of Flesh and Bones)</hi> by the strength he hath imploy'd to maintain it in his Second. But let all Sober Men judge if this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply be pertinent to this part of my Answer; yet he promised he would answer my Arguments. For the Scripture is clear, <hi>That corruption shall not inherit incorruption, neither can Flesh and Blood inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.50.</q>
                  <q>Thus <hi>Annot. cert. Divin. Anno</hi> 1645. upon the place; And if he will know the <hi>true Resurrection,</hi> let him learn to understand this weighty passage;</q>
                  <hi>For we know, that if our Earthly House of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle were dissolved, we have a Building of God, an House not made with hands, Eternal in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1.
<q>And I cannot but wonder, my Adversaries Understanding should be so benight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:63041:137"/>
as that contrary to express Scripture, he should assert a Resurrection of the <hi>Same Body that is Buried, Properly and Strictly so:</hi> The Apostle (p. 369.) teaches us to believe, that it is not that <hi>same Body that is sown that shall be</hi>; for though we shall be changed from Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to Immortality, Corruption to Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.37, 50.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:63041:137"/>Here <hi>W. P.</hi> at length gives the 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. Verses, which I omit for brevity, and then continues.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I say this doth not concern the Resurrection of Carnal Bodies, but the <hi>two States</hi> of Men, under the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second Adam.</hi> Men are sown into the World Natural, and so they are the Sons of the first <hi>Adam</hi>; but they are raised Spiritually, through him who is the Resurrection and the Life, and so they are the Sons of the <hi>second Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven, a quickning Spirit. The very words of the Apostle unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably prove this to be the Scope; How else could the first <hi>Adam</hi>'s being made a <hi>living Soul,</hi> and the second <hi>Adam</hi> a <hi>quickning Spirit,</hi> be a pertinent Instance to prove Natural and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bodies? Upon which follows, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural was first, that is, the <hi>first Adam</hi>; and then that which is Spiritual, which is the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam,</hi> the quickning Spirit, the Lord from Heaven, who came to raise up the Sons of the first <hi>Adam</hi> from their <hi>Dead,</hi> to his <hi>Living,</hi> from their <hi>Natural,</hi> to his <hi>Spiritual Estate.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But perhaps it will be objected that the 47. v. <hi>The first Man is of the Earth, Earthly.</hi> And part of the 49. v. <hi>We shall also bear the Image of the Heavenly.</hi> Seem to imply a Bodily Resurrection; but let the whole verses be considered, and we shall find no such thing.</q>
                  <hi>The first Man is of the Earth, Earthly; the second Man is the Lord from Heaven.</hi>
                  <q>Who sees not that this is rather spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>earthly Mindedness</hi> than of the <hi>earthly Body</hi> of <hi>Adam?</hi> It was mentioned to shew the great Disparity (p. 371.) that is between the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Qualification of the first and second <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </q>
The following verses puts this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation


<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63041:138"/>
out of doubt, <hi>As is the Earthly, such are they that are Earthly, and as is the Heavenly, such are they also that are Heavenly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>For those words, <hi>We shall also bear the Image of the Heavenly.</hi> I cannot see how they should relate to the Resurrection of the Carnal Bodies of Men; for the <hi>Image of the Heavenly,</hi> is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed State to God, through the Operation of the Spirit and Power of Christ: The first part of the verse clears it; <hi>And as we have born the Image of the Earthly, we shall</hi> (or rather, <hi>let us) bear the Image of the Heavenly</hi> (as <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Theophylact</hi> read it, and 6. or 7. Copies besides have it) which is as much as to say, <hi>As we hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born the Image of the God of this World, by becoming his Children; so may we bear the Image of the true and living God, by being redeemed from a vain Conversation, having our Consciences sprinkled from dead works, and being born again of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible Seed, by the Word of God, which lives and abides for ever.</hi>

               <p>Thus far <hi>W.

                  <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 162. <hi>When I urged to a Quaker-Preacher towards a proof of the Resurrection of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, That Text,</hi> Matth. 27.52, 53. <hi>He made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that that was not meant of the Litteral or Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>that any Dead Body arose there: But of the Spiritual</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>which</hi> John <hi>saw coming down from Heaven.

The Holy Apostle speaking of these Men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19, 20. adviseth <hi>Timothy</hi> to hold the Faith, and a good Conscience: And he adds, <hi>Which some hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put away, concerning Faith have made Shipwrack; of whom is</hi> Hymeneus <hi>and</hi> Alexander, <hi>whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme.</hi> And 2 Tim. 2.16, 17, 18. <hi>But shun Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and Vain Bablings, for they will increase to more Vngodliness, and their word will eat as doth a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, of whom is</hi> Hymeneus <hi>and</hi> Philetus, <hi>who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Truth have erred; saying, that the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is past already, and overthrow the Faith of some.</hi>

               <p>WE have not in this Section of the <hi>Snake,</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Of the Holy Sacraments,</hi> any Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as in all the foregoing Sections: That was not now necessary, because of our known disuse of them: But here, what he gives is a continued De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation against our disuse of them. This Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation he hath intersperst with some false reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to prove their continuance. But he has not (as it might have been expected he should) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and refuted those very many Reasons, and Scripture Defences which we have frequently pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished for this our disuse. But in <hi>Magisterial</hi> and <hi>Despotick</hi> Manner, would obtrude his <hi>Arbitrary Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,</hi> and Additions to the Text of Scripture, which he would have to pass, and <hi>we must ask no Reasons.</hi> Wherefore I might justly pass by, without further notice taken of this his idle and false De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, or at most, only refer to those our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and Scripture Defences, which have been so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten given, till he should have shewn their Invalidity, and have established what he proposes, beyond the strength of those Arguments, which we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. And this I might likely have done, but for the sake of those, into whose hands this may come, who possibly may not have seen them our Reasons and Defences: Chiefly for the sake of such it is that I am content to follow him through this his Section, to detect his false Reasoning; and also to shew, that by our Practice herein, we are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:63041:141"/>
to the Scriptures; though we are so to him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> in his first Paragraph, as is his custom, hath taken care to prepossess his Reader with a false comparison concerning us, by joyning to our Description, <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus:</hi> That they did err, we have Apostolical Warrant; and the <hi>Snake,</hi> the more easily to beguile his Reader, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain their error by a [<hi>that is</hi>] and then does boldly assert, that what the Apostle did condemn them for, is what this <hi>Snake</hi> does now condemn us for: But upon Examination it will appear, that his <hi>abitrary Interpretation</hi> or Explanation of their Error, has in it much confidence, but no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of which now in order.</p>
               <p>Snake, p. 165. <hi>That is, say they, with Hymeneus and Philetus, till his coming Spiritually in our Hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have in p. 255. foregoing, briefly observed already, concerning these Men, part of whose er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was (and which is only taken notice of by the <hi>Snake</hi>) their saying <hi>the Resurrection was past already.</hi> That they do not seem, by the Character the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle gives of them, of being profane and vain Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers; such who had put away a good Conscience, and shipwrack'd Faith; I say, they do not seem hereby to be such, who did contend for the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Coming of Christ in their <hi>Hearts:</hi> Profaneness is Immorality, and what has that to do with the Coming of Christ in the Heart? It is in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to it. And the Apostle could not have made their Character as above; had they so contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Christ; because it was what the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, himself did follow after, Phil. 3.10, 11, 12. <hi>That I may know him, and the power of his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the fellowship of his Sufferings, being made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable unto his Death: If by any means I might attain


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:63041:142"/>
unto the Resurrection of the Dead. Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect; but I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, Think'st thou, that <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus,</hi> those profane and vain Babblers, who ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreckt Faith and a good Conscience in themselves, and did overthrow the Faith of some, did do all these things, and expound that saying of theirs, <hi>That the Resurrection was past already,</hi> in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: (as the <hi>Snake</hi> says) <hi>Spiritually in our Hearts.</hi> No, it could not be, they were gone from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ in them, when they went into <hi>profane Babbling</hi>; and what degrees soever they might have known (while in obedience) of the <hi>Power of Christ's Resurrection:</hi> Yet that they quite lost, when they shipwreckt Faith and a good Conscience. So that the <hi>Snake</hi>'s explanation is not only arbitrary, but contradictory to the Apostles character of them.</p>
               <p>He goes on with great assurance, and pretence of familiarity with the <hi>Holy Apostles, and of the purest Primitive Christians, and Blessed Martyrs</hi>; and affirms of them all, in his frothy manner.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 165. <hi>None of them dream'd of the time being thus expired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the observance of what he calls the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> but that they did <hi>think them</hi> obligatory to the end of the World, <hi>the litteral Resurrection at the last day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It can be no small acquaintance, which this <hi>Snake</hi> pretends to have had with this variety of Persons, who dare so boldly affirm of them all, while sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they did never <hi>dream</hi> of their Expiration, and while waking, that they all did think these Ordinances always were to continue. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the observing Reader will, with me, be apt to question how he came by this great Intimacy,


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:63041:142"/>
and desire him to give some proof of the truth of what he hath so affirm'd.</p>
               <p>But if we should suppose, that he could prove (which he never can) that none of them did so <hi>dream,</hi> that would not be ground sufficient to us, to prove that the time of their continuance is not expired: For the Question being concerning Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, said to be appointed by Christ; we are not to look to <hi>Dreams,</hi> but to consider the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Christ; for, from thence can only be truly learn'd, both the things appointed, and the time for which they were appointed.</p>
               <p>And here, of a sudden, the <hi>Snake</hi> hath much abated of his pretence to know what was not Dream'd <hi>by the Holy Apostles, purest Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and Blessed Martyrs</hi>; and comes to lay his pretence upon the Commission given by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to his Disciples, mentioned <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. And this Commission he gives by piece-meal, so as that it might, if possible, be so large, as to take in the Addition which he makes to it. For first, He would have it to be a Commission for Water-Baptism; next, He would have it to express the Continuance of the Water-Baptism to the end of the World. And having, in disjoynted sort, thus given it, he draws this Pithy Conclusion, p. 166. <hi>For if this be the time, during which Christ promised to assist his Commission, it must doubtless infer the like continuance of the things required in the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We say so too: But the Question is concerning something said to be required in the Commission, which the Commission does not express; therefore we say, not contained in it. And that this has been our frequent Objection to our Opposers, in this particular, the <hi>Snake</hi> could not but know; and therefore if he would have established his addition


<pb n="262" facs="tcp:63041:143"/>
[<hi>Water</hi>] to the Text, he ought to have refuted our objections to the addition, and then to have given his better reasons for it; but none of this is done. But he goes on begging the Question, and taking that for granted, which we deny, <hi>viz.</hi> That when our Saviour saith, Mat. 28.19. <hi>Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost:</hi> He doth herein Command them Disciples to Baptize with <hi>Water.</hi> If the <hi>Snake</hi> had given us some reason why we ought to take this his Addition of that wherein the Text is silent, that reason might have been considered. And it will be yet of greater force, if he can prove from Scripture, that our Saviour is here giving to his Disciples, Commission con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism with Water, and not his own, which is with the Holy Spirit. But of this the <hi>Snake</hi> says, p. 167. <hi>The Holy Ghost is his</hi> (Christ's) <hi>Gift only.</hi> It is true, that the Holy Ghost is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Christ's Gift; yet it is as true, that Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, fitted, and quallified by the operation of his Grace, have Instrumentally, as <hi>Ministerial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> given the Gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thus the Apostle, Rom. 1.11. <hi>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some Spiritual Gift.</hi> And the same Apostle tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.15.—<hi>For in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel.</hi> And he declares, that his Commission was, Acts 26.18. <hi>To open their Eyes, and to turn them from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan to the Power of God.</hi> Now strictly speaking, it is only Christ, by the Gift of the Holy Ghost, who does these great Works, of which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaks. The Apostle herein was Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally made the Minister of <hi>those things wherein God did appear unto him.</hi> And at this day, those who are of God made Ministers of those things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in


<pb n="263" facs="tcp:63041:143"/>
he does appear by his Spirit unto them, such he fits, furnishes, and quallifies, Instrumentally, to be able to impart <hi>Spiritual Gifts,</hi> and <hi>to beget People to God,</hi> by <hi>turning them from Darkness to Light, and from Satan's Power to the Power of God.</hi> Thus Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Baptism and Teaching, mentioned in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Christ, continues to be assisted by Christ, and will be so to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>Now this teaching, with respect to the sound of words, may be said to be outward: But the end of that teaching was to the Soul, the inward Man; and against <hi>Spiritual Wickedness in high places,</hi> Eph. 6.12. And this outward Teaching in its end, and in its continuance is, that it may bring Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in their several Generations, to witness the Spiritual Baptism of Christ with the Holy Ghost, whereby they may be brought to witness, that they are begotten to God.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 168. <hi>This outward Baptism with Water was an Ordinance instituted, as a means of Grace, whereby the Inward Baptism with the Holy Ghost was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is saying, but not proving: We deny that Baptism with Water was <hi>Instituted as a means of Grace</hi>; for then had the far greater number of those who were converted to Christianity by the Ministry of <hi>Paul,</hi> wanted the <hi>means of Grace:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were very few, as himself testifies, that he did Baptize with Water. And to them whom he did so Baptize, is was not the <hi>means of Grace.</hi> Because, if it had been so, it must have perpetually attended his Ministry in that Grace and Truth which comes by Jesus, or otherwise the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was not compleatly as the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, a <hi>Minister of the Spirit</hi>; which I think this <hi>Snake</hi> will hardly venture to affirm. But himself declares it did not perpetually attend his Ministry,


<pb n="264" facs="tcp:63041:144"/>
1 Cor. 1.17. <hi>For Christ sent me not to Baptize, but to Preach the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 168. <hi>Vpon all which accounts it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, even where the inward Baptism with the Holy Ghost was already attained, as St.</hi> Peter <hi>said,</hi> Acts 10.47.</p>
               <p>If where the inward Baptism with the Holy Ghost be attained, the Outward Baptism with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, be still <hi>necessary,</hi> because the Holy Apostle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> commanded, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.48. <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be Baptized. Then why is not Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on also <hi>necessary,</hi> because the same Apostle did compel the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in general to be Circumcised; and concerning which, at that time when <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> was Baptized, it was not determined whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they should be Circumcised. This sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shews, that the Apostles words, in this place, cannot be understood, to Intend or Command Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptism, with Water, to be a standing and perpetual Ordinance in the Church.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 169. <hi>It is very Observable, that among those things wherein St.</hi> Paul <hi>was instructed, thus imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Christ, he tells us,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23. <hi>That one was the Institution of the Lord's Supper. Vpon which he lays so great stress, that he charges grievous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases sent among the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>and Death it self,</hi> vers. 30. <hi>upon their Neglect and Abuse of this Holy Mystery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very observable, that this <hi>Snake,</hi> by beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging every matter in question, takes them for granted, which we deny. And then in usual as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, runs on in his <hi>Doughty</hi> Manner, without so much as offering at any Authority to prove what he says, or disprove what we have often said upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>Thus he will have the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering to that People, the <hi>Institution</hi> of the Lord's Supper: Yet has not proved from the words, that they are any <hi>Institution</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:63041:144"/>The words of the Apostle are these, vers. 23. <hi>For I have received of the Lord that which also I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These words of the Apostle are plainly a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of somewhat done by our Saviour, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not any <hi>Institution,</hi> or Command, as the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Reader may find. And had the Apostle here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in intended to deliver an <hi>Institution</hi> or Command of something that was to be perpetually obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Church; and not to deliver singly an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of matter of Fact; he had, no doubt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd it, in words whose import could not be questioned: But he saith not, <hi>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you; That as the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, took Bread:</hi> So, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apostle saith not thus, but the contrary; and when he repeats the imperative words of Christ to his Disciples on this Head, he seemeth of set purpose so to have placed them, that they do not import any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: For he saith, vers. 25. — <hi>This do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</hi> vers. 26. <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do shew the Lords death till he come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These, I say, do not import any <hi>Command</hi> or <hi>Institution</hi>; which, because the <hi>Snake</hi> will have that they do, let him shew wherein: If he thinks the words [as often,] to have some imperative force; let him see if he can prove that that impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Force, is more than if one should say to him, <hi>As often as thou goes to</hi> Westminster, <hi>call upon</hi> John Thompson, (late one of the King's Messengers.) I easily think the <hi>Snake</hi> will conclude, the impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Force of these words none at all, and will go, as occasion calls, to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and not think himself obliged to make that Visit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:63041:145"/>But the <hi>Snake</hi> goes on with wonderful assurance, and will have the Apostle <hi>lay so great stress upon this Institution,</hi> That <hi>he charges grievous Diseases, sent among the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>and Death it self,</hi> vers. 30. <hi>upon their Neglect and Abuse of this Holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But from the place it self, it does not appear, that the Apostle <hi>lays any such stress upon it.</hi> For, first, as I have already shewn, the Apostle makes a narration of Fact! Tells what our Lord did do, that Night in which he was betrayed; but gives no Command; does not declare it to be instituted; makes no <hi>Mystery</hi> of it as the <hi>Snake</hi> would sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Apostle redargueth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> evil practices of Drunkenness and Unseasonable Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even then when they were pretending to have in remembrance the Death of Christ. And queries of them vers. 22. <hi>What! have ye not houses to eat and drink in, or dispise ye the Church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say unto you? Shall I praise you in this; I praise you not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Apostle does in the 30th verse shew them some of the Consequences which had attended their <hi>Irreverent, Greedy</hi> and <hi>Drunken</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and tells them, <hi>For this cause many are weak, and sickly among you, and many sleep.</hi> And a very natural Consequence it is, and nothing strange, that Intemperance should bring Weakness and Sickness, and finally Death. But the <hi>Snake</hi> would put the Apostles words upon the Tenters and stretch them, to signifie <hi>grievous Diseases.</hi> All Weakness and Sickness may, in some sense, be said to be <hi>grievous:</hi> But when we say <hi>Grievous Diseases are sent among a People,</hi> it does at least imply something more than the common Infirmities which usually our Nature is subject to, by way of Eminence, as a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

This the <hi>Snake</hi> seems to suggest, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not to prove, neither can he; or that those <hi>Corinthians</hi> were more <hi>Weak and Sickly,</hi> &amp;c. than what might be the natural effect of the Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance above spoken of.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 169. <hi>How then would he have censured the Preaching down this, and the other Sacrament of Baptism, as Carnal and Hurtful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it may be asked, how he would have cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd the appointing for <hi>Institutions and Sacraments,</hi> what was not so appointed by our Saviour himself, or any of his Brethren the Apostles?</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>And let me here seriously mind these</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, <hi>and admonish others how their Neglect of the Outward Ordinances and Signs, has lost to them the Reality, and the Thing signified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Snake,</hi> hath (as before shewn) pretended great Charity for us; yet here sticks not to damn us all. See, <hi>Reader,</hi> his Hypocrisie; he pretends to object against us, and hath made a particular <hi>Section</hi> on that Head, <hi>That we damn all but our selves,</hi> (of which in its place.) Yet here in <hi>great</hi> Charity (and as himself says) <hi>seriously</hi>; we have lost <hi>the Reality, and the Thing signified</hi>; which he will say is Christ, then necessarily Salvation, which is only by him.</p>
               <p>But it is well for us, that this <hi>Snake,</hi> whether serious or scoffing, whether profane or arrogant, (and at times he is all these) is still wrong, and false: For we can in deep Humility of Soul, thank God, that thro' the Manifestations of the Holy Spirit upon our Hearts, we are kept in fresh and living Remembrances of the Love of God in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ to us ward; and as we open at his Voice, we do witness him to fulfil his Promise, Rev. 3.20. <hi>I will come into him, and sup with him, and he with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:63041:146"/>Ibid. <hi>For it had been impossible for any, who had been kept in the constant use and practice of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lord's Supper, to have forgot Christ's outward Dying and Shedding of his Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is it not as much impossible, for those who witness Christ to fulfil his Promise, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. in them, to forget his outward Crucifixion, and <hi>shedding of his Blood?</hi> I think it is not less impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; and I am very sure it is not less Beneficial, for a Man to witness the Spiritual Supper of Christ in, and with him, than it is for a Man, without such Spiritual Knowledge, to have only the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Remembrances of Christ by outward Bread and Wine. Now if the <hi>Snake</hi> will say, and prove, that it is <hi>impossible</hi> for all such who have the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinances,</hi> to miss of the Spiritual Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ; that might be somewhat to the purpose; but the Contrary is too plain. Yet it is absolutely, and always impossible, for all those, who do Spiritually Sup with Christ, as mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. while they do so Sup with him, to forget him: No, it cannot be, but that Daily Bread, which he breaks to those who seek him, will preserve the Soul which does receive it, alive to bless and praise his Name.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 70. <hi>The Devil having stoln from us the Body, or Outward Part of Religion, the Soul soon disappeared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Devil, has done so by this <hi>Snake,</hi> it is otherwise than we may observe he commonly does by Mankind. For it was the Complaint of God, by his Prophets against the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, that they had lost the Soul of Religion while they kept <hi>the Body,</hi> or <hi>Outward Part.</hi> The like Complaint our Saviour made of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who had clean outsides. The like Complaint was made against the <hi>Romanists,</hi> by our first Reformers, <hi>viz.</hi> that


<pb n="269" facs="tcp:63041:146"/>
they had the <hi>Body, or Outward Part of Religion,</hi> but the Soul of it was disappear'd: And for all the <hi>Snake</hi>'s suggestion, the Devil holds the same Course. And he may have as Gay an outside as he will, while he continues so deceitful within as he is.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Religion can no more live, and be preserved to us here, while we are in the Body, without outward and corporal means, than the Soul can live to us here, while we are upon the Earth, without our Body; and hence the Corporal Service,</hi> Rom. 12.1.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> has here (as in many other places) advanced a false and dangerous Tenet, little, if any thing differing from the <hi>opus operatum</hi> of the Papists, which he would shrowd under the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. which Scripture is directly opposite to his Assertion, as we shall presently see. He hath asserted <hi>Religion cannot be preserved without Corporal Means.</hi> Now it is an undoubted Truth, that true Religion cannot be begotten in the Heart of Man, by other <hi>means,</hi> than the secret and inward influences of the Holy Spirit; and as this only, and alone can beget it, so it is this only and alone, that can preserve it. When it is thus begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en inwardly in the Heart, it is indeed the <hi>means</hi> of those outward services being acceptable to God: But outward services cannot be the <hi>means</hi> of it; for we cannot <hi>present our Bodies a Living Sacrifice, Holy, acceptable unto God, which is our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable service,</hi> Rom. 12.1. By any other <hi>means,</hi> than by having our Souls and Spirits, subjected to the Guidance and Influences of the Holy Spirit; and therefore it was that the Apostle advised <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. <hi>For Bodily exercise profiteth lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; but Godliness is profitable unto all things, having the promise of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> And to be sure, this Godliness must be first inward, before it appear outward: And


<pb n="270" facs="tcp:63041:147"/>
it is the <hi>means</hi> of all our outward reasonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but outward Service cannot be the <hi>means</hi> of inward Obedience.</p>
               <p>But further, When the Apostle advises, Rom. 12.1. <hi>I beseech you, Brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your Bodies a living Sacrifice, Holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable Service.</hi> He is not bidding the <hi>Romans</hi> take the <hi>Corporal Means,</hi> of Bread and Wine, no such matter; But is directing them to an Inward Work, for he says, vers. 2. <hi>And be not conformed to this World, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your Mind.</hi> And if this <hi>Corporal Means</hi> (Bread and Wine) did thus transform and renew the Mind; this <hi>Snake,</hi> with many others, who partake of it, could not be so wicked as they are.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>This is so necessary and plain a Truth, that those who take upon them to abrogate the Outward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of Christ, do at the same time invent and set up others of their own, as has been before observ'd, of the</hi> Quakers <hi>Institution of Womens Preaching, and Womens Meetings.</hi> —</p>
               <p>Concerning Womens Preachings and Meetings, hath been sufficiently spoken, therefore need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it here. But to his Argument, that they who <hi>abrogate the outward Institutions of Christ, do at the same time invent and set up new ones,</hi> &amp;c. I have this to say, That if from the Commission, Mat. 28.19. <hi>Go ye therefore, teach all Nations, Baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. must of necessity be understood, Baptism with <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>; and that Infants must be understood to be within the Limits of it: It may be convenient for the <hi>Snake</hi> to shew, without taking to himself the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a <hi>Despotick and Arbitrary Interpretation,</hi> why Infants are not within the limits of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25, 26. and that they must not communicate of the <hi>Bread and Wine.</hi> If the <hi>Snake</hi> will take a


<pb n="271" facs="tcp:63041:147"/>
liberty so differently to interpret places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and say they do <hi>appoint Institutions,</hi> tho' the Matter of One (<hi>viz.</hi> Water,) and the Manner of Both, as now used, is not therein exprest; why has not another as much liberty? If what he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for, be not the Text, (as it is not) but an exposition of it; what medium will he use to assure me his exposition is right; since all <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means</hi> lye under the same Objection; which his own particular Exposition does, and they are not a few? For I may object, to his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the Interest he is in, and to the acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal means by which he came so to conclude. And thus Men may grope in the Dark concerning the Mysteries of Religion, and the Way to the Kingdom of Heaven; while they have only <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Corporal Means</hi> (for which the <hi>Snake</hi> does so much contend) for their Guide. But if Men would once come to implore the Assistances, and wait for the Guidance of the Holy Spirit. That as it illuminated the Holy Men of Old, to deliver in Writing a Declaration of the Deep Things of God's Kingdom; so it would illuminate their Minds, to see and know the Meaning of the Holy Ghost in that Declaration. By other <hi>means</hi> than this, there can be no certainty herein. But this <hi>means</hi> the <hi>Snake</hi> depends not on, and would represent us as Criminal because we do: Wherefore we justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse his Expositions, for being Inventions; which whether <hi>set up new,</hi> or of old standing, makes little difference. And while the <hi>Snake</hi> is contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Inventions set up, he <hi>does abrogate</hi> (if not to use, be so as the <hi>Snake</hi> will have it be) <hi>an Outward Command of Christ,</hi> delivered in (at least) as plain, if not plainer terms than either of the foregoing; for here is both Matter and Manner recorded. I instance in the Command of Christ to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:63041:148"/>
                  <hi>to wash one anothers Feet</hi>; John 13.14, 15. <hi>If I then your Lord and Master have washed your Feet, ye also ought to wash one another's Feet: For I have given you an Example, that ye should do as I have done to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet here neither the <hi>Example,</hi> nor the declared Intent of it, is interpreted to <hi>mean</hi> an <hi>Outward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution:</hi> But it is an Allegory, and the Command fulfilled, while the Sign is disused, if we walk humbly before God, and serve one another with Love: We say so too; yet if practical Obedience is here the intent of an <hi>Outward Command</hi>; Why might not Spiritual Baptism and Communion be the intent of <hi>Outward Commands?</hi> Had there been any such, which those before mentioned are not? As before I have shewn.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 170. <hi>Vpon this poor pretence, that</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism <hi>is</hi> not the putting away the filth of the Flesh, but the Answer of a good Conscience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Which Text they so understand, as that the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Baptism <hi>is thereby disanulled; because the</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptism <hi>is preferred before it, and not reckoned perfect without it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This which the <hi>Snake</hi> calls a <hi>poor pretence,</hi> is but poorly assaulted by him; and does remain to be a clear and very plain account of that <hi>Baptism</hi> which Saves: In the Description whereof, the Apostle is very particular: <hi>First,</hi> Negatively shewing what is not; then Affirmatively defining what it is, <hi>viz. The like Figure</hi> (or Anti-type, as it may be truly rendered) <hi>whereunto even Baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the Flesh, but the answer of a good Conscience towards God) by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.</hi> And according to this account of that <hi>Baptism which Saves,</hi> it cannot be the <hi>Baptism with Water,</hi> because that is <hi>putting away the filth of the Flesh,</hi> but it is the <hi>Answer of a good Conscience towards God.</hi> Now


<pb n="273" facs="tcp:63041:148"/>
outward Water cannot give this answer; for as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5, 6. <hi>It is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is Truth.</hi> And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this <hi>Spirit</hi> which is <hi>Truth,</hi> can wash and purify the Soul from its Corruptions and Lusts, and having so purified it, can give to it the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying Answer of <hi>a good Conscience towards God</hi>; and therefore with great reason it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism with <hi>Water,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not add to the Perfection of Christ's <hi>Baptism with Fire and with the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 170. <hi>And so it was in the Institution of Circumcision under the Law; The Outward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of the Flesh, was not the chief thing meant by it; but the Inward Circumcision of the Heart, as the Apostle speaks,</hi> Rom. 2.28, 29. <hi>Will it follow hence, that there were no Outward and Litteral Jews? Or that there was not an Outward and Litteral Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision under the Law? But though the Outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision was not the Circumcision,</hi> i. e. <hi>not that alone, unless the Inward did accompany it; yet the Outward Circumcision was commanded, and that under pain of Death. Thus both Baptism and the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Circumcision</hi> under the Law was <hi>Outward,</hi> so it was the <hi>Sign</hi> of an <hi>Outward Covenant,</hi> Gen. 17.7, 8. <hi>And I will establish my Covenant between Me and Thee, and thy Seed after thee in their Generations, for an Everlasting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee, the Land wherein thou art a Stranger, all the Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>for an Everlasting posession, and I will be their God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apostle who was a Minister of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and of the New Covenant, does in this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> shew the Jew, that his Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Dependance was not Good; for he tells him,


<pb n="274" facs="tcp:63041:149"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17, 21. <hi>Behold thou art called a Jew, and restest in the Law, and makest thy boast of God. Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thy self.</hi> —</p>
               <p>Thus the Apostle having here reproved that Spirit in the Jew, which our Saviour had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reproved in them, when they told him, <hi>We are</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Seed,</hi> &amp;c. and the dependencies which they had, because there was in their Flesh, the Sign of that Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apostle brings the matter nearer from the Type, to the thing typified from the <hi>Outward Jew and Circumcision,</hi> to the <hi>Inward Jew and Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> vers. 28, 29. <hi>For he is not a Jew who is one Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, neither is that Circumcision which is Outward in the Flesh: But he is a Jew which is one Inwardly, and Circumcision is that of the Heart, in the Spirit, and not in the Letter, whose praise is not of Men, but of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apostle is here speaking what the <hi>Spiritual Jew</hi> is, not what the <hi>Legal Jew</hi> was, for of him the Apostle had spoken before; and in the like manner it may be spoken of them, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon the Outward and Decreasing Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of <hi>John,</hi> and the Outward and Temporary Commemoration of Christ's Death, by Bread and Wine, and wait not to know the purifying and strengthning of their Hearts and Spirits by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Thus the Apostle shews the necessary Duty of Christians in the Gospel Dispensation; which is to witness the Inward Circumcision of the Heart and Spirit; this work the Law could not perform, because as the Apostle says, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. <hi>The Law made nothing perfect:</hi> — Nor can Outward <hi>Water,</hi> or Outward <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> That can only be


<pb n="275" facs="tcp:63041:149"/>
done, by the Inward Operation of the Spirit of God upon the Heart and Spirit. This is that which is <hi>as useful and indispensable to Christians,</hi> as the Outward Law was to the Outward Jew: To which Outward Law, <hi>Christ,</hi> who was greater than <hi>Moses,</hi> having put an end. He hath established not another <hi>Outward Covenant,</hi> but the Inward Dispensation of <hi>Grace and Truth</hi> which comes by Him.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 171. <hi>Only let me tell the Quakers, That their Objections which are answerd in that Treatise</hi> (a piece writ by the <hi>Snake</hi> particularly upon this Subject) <hi>are mostly the same which the</hi> Socinians <hi>have set up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And let me tell the <hi>Snake,</hi> that if the <hi>Socinians</hi> Arguments herein, were sound and according to Scripture; it can be no Objection to ours, if they were not only <hi>mostly</hi> but altogether the same: And it does not follow, that they who err in some things, are therefore right in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>But if what the <hi>Snake</hi> tells us of our Arguments, being <hi>mostly the same herein with those of the</hi> Socinians. It will, I hope, be of as good purpose for me to tell the <hi>Snake,</hi> that his Objections which are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in this Treatise, are mostly the same which the <hi>Romanists</hi> did make to the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And then his Witty Remark may be of use to himself, <hi>To see out of whose Quiver those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows came,</hi> which he hath shot against us</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 171. <hi>Thus the</hi> Socinians, <hi>having thrown off or slighted the Sacraments, have lost the true Faith in the Divinity of Iesus; and have rejected him from being the Christ, or Word of God, which they say, only dwelt in him, or inspired him, but was not Personally united to him. Thus say the</hi> Quakers.</p>

                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:63041:150"/>What the <hi>Socinians</hi> have <hi>thrown off,</hi> and lost, is not now my business to enquire: But that the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> have not <hi>Thrown off,</hi> or <hi>Lost,</hi> the True Faith in Christ, either as He is the Divine Word, or as he was truly Man, and dwelt on Earth: I have already abundantly shewn in the <hi>Section</hi> forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein is particularly treated of, and owned, the Divinity and Incarnation of Jesus Christ.</p>

In order to which, I desire my <hi>Reader</hi> to observe, that the <hi>Snake</hi>'s first Argument is drawn from the time of our Appearance, which he makes to be about 1650. and 1654. And of these dates of time he says.</p>
               <p>P. 187. <hi>Then it was that</hi> Rome <hi>was reaping a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Harvest, which they had long been sowing; by setting up, in that Universal Toleration, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Various Sects, on purpose to Divide, and so Confound their only Substantial Adversary the Church of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:63041:150"/>And here let it be observed that he imposes upon his <hi>Reader,</hi> and would have it taken for granted upon his bare Word, that about them Years there was a <hi>Vniversal Toleration</hi>; and that during that time of <hi>Toleration,</hi> there were by Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Emissaries, set up <hi>Multitudes of Various Sects.</hi> Neither of which is true in Fact, but contrary to the Faith of the History of them times; and also to the Experience of many who are yet living, who were eye witnesses of the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of them, and some who were Sufferers in them.</p>
               <p>But first to the <hi>Toleration</hi> which the <hi>Snake</hi> calls <hi>Vniversal:</hi> I doubt not but upon second thoughts, the <hi>Snake</hi> will allow, that at that time the <hi>Church of England</hi> was in Exile; so that it was not <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal.</hi> And as to the <hi>Quakers</hi> then Beginning, they were not included in the <hi>Vniversal Toleration:</hi> As our Testimonies, easy to be produced, of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonments, Blows, Fines,</hi> &amp;c. which our (then few) Friends, suffered and underwent, can te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify.</p>
               <p>These Instances I give (to which others it's like may add more) to shew that there was no such thing as a <hi>Vniversal Toleration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to his <hi>Multitudes of various Sects,</hi> which he says were <hi>then set up.</hi> It is only a <hi>Romantick Story</hi> of his own Brain, which has no truth in it: For should it be supposed, that there were in them Years, People gathered into Religious Societies, under Twelve distinct Denominations (tho' I know not of one quarter that number) What <hi>Multitudes</hi> can Twelve be called? It may be he may say, that <hi>Multitudes</hi> is an Hyperbole. And indeed so it is; for it so far beyond Truth, that the Expression has nothing of Truth in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:63041:151"/>And now having briefly hinted at his falsity both with respect to his <hi>Toleration</hi> and <hi>Multitudes,</hi> I shall proceed to shew, That had there then been that <hi>Vniversal Toleration,</hi> and such <hi>Multitudes of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sects,</hi> as the <hi>Snake</hi> hath falsly alledged. Yet it doth not follow, that these <hi>Multitudes or various Sects were set up by Rome:</hi> Because there were vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dissents from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> even from the first Reformation: And it was objected to Her, by the Author <hi>of an Apology for the English Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi> Printed 1581.

And if the <hi>Snake</hi> will not be angry with me (as he is with <hi>Josiah Cole,</hi> p. 189. for Reprinting some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a <hi>Papist</hi>'s, which he calls a <hi>Sensless and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Libel</hi>; though it is his practice often to repeat part of our Adversaries <hi>Bitter and Sensless Libels</hi> against us; for which it may be he would have us thank him) I will briefly quote that <hi>Apology,</hi> Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 1581. p. 60.

Neither do we despair; but rather doubt not, that that shortly will be agreed. And if there are, who think otherwise than is equal, which sometimes hath its foundation in Names and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, God will make it manifest to them; that the thing may be better considered, and more certainly known, which was sometime done in the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> where were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated all Dissentions from their roots and causes, and buried in a perpetual Oblivion. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>Upon which, it may not be amiss to ask the <hi>Snake,</hi> what certain proofs he can give, that the Divisions (since such there were) or (to use his own words) the <hi>various Sects which were sown and set up,</hi> about the middle of the last Century, were not <hi>sown and set up</hi> by <hi>Rome:</hi> And that these about the middle of this Century were. It also will be proper for him to shew why the Church's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, concerning <hi>Dissension,</hi> does not suit us in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to him, as it did Her in answer to <hi>Rome.</hi> For it is no proof barely to affirm, as he does, p. 187. <hi>Of this many Instances may be given, and Proofs undeniable.</hi> I say, this is no Proof; and any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he does not offer; for he hath not given one of the many Instances, of which he, with great assurance, says, they are <hi>Proofs undeniable.</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected surely that his Reader should take his <hi>Ipse dixit,</hi> and ask no further Proof: But that, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as I do, in this, as in many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, to be false and Scandalous: I do therefore, so far as his Assertion relates to us, viz. <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>were sown, and set up by</hi> Rome, deny his


<pb n="282" facs="tcp:63041:153"/>
Charge, and require him to prove it, by the best Instances which he can; which, when he shall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, if we cannot disprove them, I shall be content to say with him, That <hi>Romish Emissaries did set up Quakerism in England:</hi> But till then it must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for one of his Falshoods.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 187. <hi>Enthusiasm, when it is a Delusion, or falsly pretended, is the surest means to overthrow all Church-Government and Order, and all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety of Religion; for it is no less than Blasphemy, falsly to pretend to extraordinary Inspirations from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> or Inspiration falsly pretended, is all this: But what is that to the purpose? The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not now what <hi>Enthusiasm falsly pretended,</hi> is. But whether that <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> or <hi>Divine Inspiration,</hi> of which we speak, be false? If the <hi>Snake</hi> prove not that (which he can never) he does but Plough the Air, or strive to make Ropes of Sand. His attempts are foolish, as well as false; because, that whatsoever <hi>Enthusiasm, falsly pretended</hi> may be; yet the Inspirations of the Holy Spirit of God (which is the <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> that we own and profess) does at this day, as in all the Ages of the World, first, beget a People to be the <hi>Church</hi> of God; and having so begotten them, does lead them into such <hi>Order and Sobriety,</hi> as does become that Holy <hi>Religion</hi> which it teaches.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 188. <hi>And this Doctrine of Enthusiasm, came chiefly from the Church of</hi> Rome. Labade, <hi>a</hi> Jesuit, <hi>set it up in</hi> Holland; <hi>and</hi> Robert Barclay, <hi>the</hi> Quaker, <hi>was tinctured with it in his younger Years, in the</hi> Stotch Convent <hi>at</hi> Paris; <hi>and</hi> John Vaughton <hi>was a</hi> Roman Catholick, <hi>who is now a great Preacher among the</hi> Quakers <hi>in</hi> London; <hi>and</hi> William Southby, <hi>a Preacher now among them in</hi> Pensilvania.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:63041:153"/>As particular and positive as the <hi>Snake</hi> here is, concerning the place from whence <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> came, and who set it up in <hi>Holland</hi>; he has left us to guess who set it up in <hi>England:</hi> For he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enumerated some Instances in which <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm</hi> is owned in the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of the Church: Does declare, p. 317. <hi>There is not one Book of Devotion used among us, that does not tell us the same:</hi> What Same? Why the same Enthusiasm or Inspiration (p. 119.) <hi>Full as much as any sober</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker <hi>can mean by the Light within.</hi> Now if this <hi>same Enthusiasm came chiefly from</hi> Rome, <hi>and</hi> Labade, <hi>a Jesuit, set it up in</hi> Holland; he will be yet more particular, if he can help us to his Name and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter who set it up in <hi>England.</hi> But the <hi>Snake</hi> says, <hi>R. B. was tinctur'd with it in his younger Years, in the</hi> Stotch Convent <hi>at</hi> Paris. What <hi>it</hi> was <hi>R. B.</hi> tinctured with? If with the <hi>same Enthusiasm</hi> that he says, is <hi>allow'd</hi> and <hi>own'd</hi> in the Church, <hi>full as much as any sober</hi> Quaker <hi>can mean by the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> Can there be any fault in that? And that <hi>it</hi> was not the <hi>same Enthusiasm,</hi> he has no where prov'd, nor attempted to do it, no more than he has attempted to prove that <hi>it</hi> was the <hi>same En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm</hi> with which <hi>R. B.</hi> (as he says) was tinctur'd, and which <hi>Labade</hi> set up in <hi>Holland.</hi> But the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Argument has yet another Branch to shew, that <hi>Popish Emissaries set up Quakerism,</hi> &amp;c. viz. <hi>John Vaughton</hi> and <hi>William Southby,</hi> formerly <hi>Roman Catholicks, are now Preachers; one in</hi> London, <hi>the other in</hi> Pensilvania. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Reader,</hi> It may be worth thy while a little to consider the unconcluding <hi>Rodomantade</hi> of this our Adversary in this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enthusiasm came chiefly from</hi> Rome, Labade, <hi>a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit, set it up in</hi> Holland. Therefore <hi>Popish Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries first set it up in</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:63041:154"/>
                  <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> when Young, was at the <hi>Scotch</hi> Convent in <hi>Paris. J. Vaughton</hi> and <hi>W. Southby</hi> were formerly Roman Catholicks, tho' neither of them were more than Infants, if born; when <hi>Quakers</hi> first appear'd in <hi>England</hi>; yet he will have it hence follow, that <hi>Popish Emissaries first set up Quakerism in</hi> England.</p>
               <p>Besides, that his reasoning is false, I take it to be foolish; for if all the Religious Societies of Men in <hi>England,</hi> who have in their Communion, Persons formerly <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> were <hi>set up by Popish Emissaries,</hi> it will be harder for the <hi>Snake</hi> to shew, which of them, Popish Emissaries did not set up, than which they did; because there is hardly any Community in which there is not one, or more, who have formerly been Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</p>
               <p>And to carry his Folly to its full length, he might with as great force of concluding, say, That the <hi>Quakers set up</hi> the <hi>Church of England</hi>; for <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Bugg,</hi> formerly a <hi>Quaker,</hi> is now a Member of that <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 188. <hi>But God has punished them, by sending the same Spirit among themselves, and has made a Great Fraction in the</hi> Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>Here is a Soloecism, could Rome <hi>dress Enthusiasm in several Shapes,</hi> and <hi>set it up in</hi> Holland, before they had it among themselves? I think they could not. But as much a Novelty as the <hi>Snake</hi> would insinuate, <hi>Fraction</hi> to be in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; If he will rub his Eyes, and look upon the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Apology, afore quoted, p. 21. Art. 50. He will find her there to object against the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists. Vix enim unquam inter se conveniunt, nisi forté ut olim Pharisaei &amp; Sadducaei, aut Herodes &amp; Pílatus contra Christum.</hi>

                  <q>They scarce ever agree among themselves, unless perchance as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> or as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> against Christ.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Character was given by at least as good an Authority as is the <hi>Snake</hi>'s, and that long before <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Barclay</hi> was at <hi>Paris,</hi> or <hi>John Vaughton</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Southby</hi> were Preachers; nay indeed many years before they were born.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 188. <hi>The Quaker-Infallibility was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on purpose, to bring Men back to the Infallibility of the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>It is both false and impossible, that there should have been any such contrivance, because they stand in direct opposition to each other. For that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> assistance of the Holy Spirit, of which we speak, we say continues not with any Man or Men longer than they continue subject, and in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the workings of it. But the <hi>Infallibility</hi> to which <hi>Rome</hi> pretends, is from the Person of the Holy Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> by a Continual Succession, or by Ordination not Qualification, not alienable from the Church: Concerning which I have more largely spoken in the <hi>Section</hi> particularly treating of <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 188. <hi>First the Infallibility was placed by G. Fox, and all the Primitive</hi> Quakers, <hi>in every single</hi> Quaker.</p>
               <p>And all the <hi>Modern Quakers</hi> do continue to say, with the <hi>Primitive ones,</hi> that not only every <hi>single Quaker,</hi> but every single and individual Person, hath given him from Christ, a manifestation of his Grace, Light or Holy Spirit, to which, as Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple come to be obedient, it will infallibly guide them <hi>into all Truth,</hi> in all those things that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Salvation, Redemption and Eternal Life. This, tho' the <hi>Snake,</hi> in his profane manner, calls a <hi>Ridiculous</hi> pretence, yet it is a Gospel Truth,


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:63041:155"/>
and will continue, when his Profane and <hi>Ridiculous Attempts</hi> against it shall vanish.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 188. <hi>And now there is but one step behind, and that is, to dispute the Infallibility betwixt the Two Churches, that of</hi> Rome <hi>and that of the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</p>
               <p>Yes, there is one step more behind, and that is the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Snake,</hi> which is also to be disputed. For it cannot be doubted, but he too, set up for <hi>Infallible</hi> certainty, because of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent great assurance with which he delivers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in Matters utterly false. If the <hi>Snake</hi> had not an <hi>Infallible</hi> certainty that what he calls the <hi>Qua-Quaker-Infallibility, was contriv'd on purpose to bring back Men to the Infallibility of the Church of Rome:</hi> (and that it was impossible it should be so contriv'd, I have shewn) what confidence must it be in him; to affirm that to another of which he hath no such certainty himself.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 188. <hi>And the Issue of this who does not see, when their Succession, and other Marks of the True Church, come to be compared together?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Issue may with more certainty be seen, when the <hi>Dispute</hi> is ended, and the <hi>Comparison</hi> made: Tho' for the present I can see, that if the <hi>Snake</hi> be the Manager, <hi>Rome</hi> will not lose in any Question with any <hi>Protestant Dissenters</hi> whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 189. <hi>Of all the Dissenters now in</hi> England, <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>have come nearest to the Church of</hi> Rome: <hi>They only have taken the pretence of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, (unless they will bring in</hi> Muggleton <hi>for a Third Man) none other except</hi> Papists <hi>and</hi> Quakers <hi>do set up for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither any of the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> nor the <hi>Church of England,</hi> do hold more Negatives in Doctrine, to <hi>Rome,</hi> than do the <hi>Quakers</hi>; for we do not only hold all the Negatives which any of them do hold,


<pb n="287" facs="tcp:63041:155"/>
but also more. And in the Doctrine of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as held by <hi>Rome,</hi> there is not any manner of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or likeness to Her in our Sense and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, as I have already largely shewn, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. foregoing, to which it is unnecessary to add more, for the conviction of him, whose Character, is in nothing so eminent, as in a Dogmatical Falshood, of which a Notorious Instance now next follows.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 189. The <hi>Snake</hi> doth implicitly charge <hi>Josiah Cole</hi> with Reprinting and Publishing <hi>with great Approbation,</hi> a most violent <hi>Invective</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> against the <hi>Protestants, and chiefly against the Church of England,</hi> in a piece of his, Entituled, <hi>The Whore Vnvailed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> for thy more particular Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the discovery of the Hypocrisie and Falshood of the <hi>Snake</hi> herein, I shall acquaint thee, That there was a Book Writ and Subscribed, <hi>A. S.</hi> a Roman Catholick, against the <hi>Church of England</hi> and other <hi>Potestants</hi> (among which, by the way, the <hi>Quakers</hi> were included,) which he Entituled, <hi>The Reconciler of Religions,</hi> or a <hi>Decider of all Controversies in Matters of Faith:</hi> In which Book there was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Reflections upon our Principles, as well as upon others who he pretended to Reconcile. <hi>Josiah Cole</hi> writ an Answer to it, which he Entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Whore Vnvailed,</hi> or, <hi>The Mystery of the Deceit of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>Revealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Title it should not seem to be Repint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>J. C.</hi> with <hi>Great Approbation,</hi> nor indeed was it: For <hi>Josiah Cole,</hi> as he quotes several parts of it, he subjoins his own Answer, detecting the <hi>Deceit</hi> of its Author, <hi>A. S.</hi> very particularly. And there being in this Book of <hi>A. S</hi>'s, a part, which he made his 14th Chapter, that did more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflect upon, and relate to those, who in the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of his Chapter he calls <hi>Protestant,</hi> or <hi>Sectarian


<pb n="288" facs="tcp:63041:156"/>
Ministers,</hi> charging them not to be <hi>true Preachers, or sent by God. Josiah Cole,</hi> with intent, that the Persons charged might answer that which related to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; does put it at the end of his Book, and declares concerning it in his Title Page. <hi>I thought meet to publish, (this) herewith, that the Sectarians or Episcoparians may answer for themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, <hi>Reader,</hi> is the Reality of that Business, of which the <hi>Snake</hi> with so great Confidence and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood grounds that manifest Slander of his, in saying, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>have more barefac'd than any, openly sided with the</hi> Papists <hi>against the</hi> Protestants.</p>
               <p>And I defy the <hi>Snake</hi> to produce any one piece written about that time which <hi>J. C</hi>'s was, that does more particularly detect and lay open the Deceit and Falshood of the <hi>Romanists</hi> than that of <hi>J. C</hi>'s does. So little reason had this <hi>Snake</hi> falsly, as he does, to bring in <hi>J. C.</hi> saying this Charge (<hi>viz.</hi> the 14th Chapter) <hi>against their Bibles and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, whose Cause (says he) I am not engaged in.</hi> When <hi>J. C.</hi> hath no where said, that he was not engaged in the <hi>Cause of the Bible</hi>: But said, he was not <hi>engaged</hi> in the Cause of them who <hi>A. S.</hi> had called <hi>Sectarian</hi> Ministers. This, briefly, is the true state of that Matter on which the <hi>Snake</hi> makes near two pages of most false and scandalous Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations and Charges.</p>

               <p>Here the <hi>Snake</hi> will have the <hi>Quakers</hi> exceed the <hi>Romanists,</hi> and that they have improv'd their <hi>Error,</hi> even in a Question, which himself deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, p. 32. that our <hi>simplicity has depriv'd</hi> us <hi>of every one of</hi> these <hi>helps</hi> which the <hi>Romanists</hi> have. But we having been from p. 32, to p. 190. under the <hi>Snakes</hi> hand, it is no wonder if his Viparous


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:63041:156"/>
Fancy, having formed a Monster at first, that he should think the proportions encreas'd.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 190. G. W. asserts, <hi>that the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which God affects in us is not Finite but Infinite</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Voice of Wisdom, p. 36.</p>
               <p>And the reason (which the <hi>Snake</hi> has left out) is this.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Christ</hi> is God's Righteousness, and <hi>Christ is formed in us,</hi> Gal. 4.19. and so that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which God works in us by his Spirit, it's of the same kind and nature with that which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; for the Saints are made <hi>partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 191. <hi>But if you will ask, how could</hi> Infinite <hi>Righteousness</hi> fall? G. Fox <hi>will answer you, who wrote,</hi>
                  <q>That he was beyond the state of the first <hi>Adam</hi> that Fell, in the state of the second <hi>Adam</hi> that never Fell.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But where <hi>G. Fox</hi> hath so writ, the <hi>Snake</hi> tells not; yet if he hath so writ, what is it more than the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22, 45. hath said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Death by Sin, through the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and our Regeneration through obedience to the Quickning Spirit the second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven? And they, who through the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Quickning Spirit, have witnessed a being <hi>regenerated and born again</hi>; may truly say, that they are <hi>beyond the state of the first</hi> Adam <hi>that Fell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 191. <hi>And in a Printed</hi> General Epistle <hi>of his to the</hi> Quakers, <hi>which I have now here before me, he says,</hi>
                  <q>Who hath any thing against my way, who never fell, nor changed? <hi>And he concludes,</hi> This is the word of the Lord God to you all, <hi>and</hi> spread this abroad.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The truth of the words is not less <hi>General</hi> than the Epistle, for it is a <hi>General</hi> and a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="290" facs="tcp:63041:157"/>
Truth, that <hi>the second</hi> Adam <hi>that never Fell,</hi> Jesus Christ the Just Man's Path, is the Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Way</hi> to the Father, which did never Fall, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Change: Therefore <hi>G. Fox</hi> might well ask, <hi>who hath any thing against</hi> this <hi>Way</hi>? And the Word and Command of the Lord, through all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by his Servants, hath been to call People to walk in this <hi>Way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that I may not forget, I would now ask for that Answer which the <hi>Snake</hi> hath just now said <hi>G. Fox will give</hi> to the Question; <hi>How could Infinite Righteousness Fall?</hi> The <hi>Snake</hi> was willing to start some strange thing, but not being then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with a seemingly probable Lie, (or forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to add such an one) he hath omitted to say any thing, which he calls <hi>G. F</hi>'s Answer to that Question.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Snake</hi> is not more forgetful in this, than he was in adapting the Matter treated of in this <hi>Section,</hi> to the <hi>Title</hi> of it. The Title he gives it, is, <hi>That Popish Emissaries set up Quakerism in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. And to prove his Title, he brings in <hi>G. F.</hi> saying, <hi>That he was beyond the State of the first</hi> Adam <hi>that fell, in the state of the second</hi> Adam, <hi>that never fell.</hi> That is, He was born again by the Operation of the Quickning Spirit of Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus our Lord. See, <hi>Reader,</hi> How far this proves, that <hi>Popish Emissaries set up Quakerism in</hi> England. If this Argument be insufficient, he hath others of like sort; of which one is, That <hi>G. Fox</hi> hath said of <hi>Jesus Christ his Way; Who hath any thing against my Way, who never fell nor changed?</hi> A fine Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Popish Emissaries set up Quakerism in <hi>England.</hi> He hath also given a Quotation from <hi>G. W's Voice of Wisdom,</hi> p. 36. That the <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which God effects in us, is not Finite but Infinite.</hi> And this is another proof much to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,


<pb n="291" facs="tcp:63041:157"/>
that is, to no purpose of answering the Title; and for any relation the <hi>Section</hi> has to it, he might have Entituled it, a <hi>Relation of his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from the Messenger at</hi> Billinsgate: or, a <hi>Relation of his being seized by him at</hi> Lidd <hi>in</hi> Kent, or any thing else in the World, which had no Relation to the Matter treated of.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> next makes a Quotation from the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Hat,</hi> concerning <hi>G. F</hi>'s Marriage, and says, That <hi>G. F.</hi> did say concerning his Wife, (then somewhat in years) <hi>She must not be Barren, but wou'd, as</hi> Sarah, <hi>bring Forth an</hi> Isaac <hi>in her Old Age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I first answer, that that Book from from whence the <hi>Snake</hi> quotes, as above, hath been many years since answer'd: But in this the <hi>Snake</hi> is here silent, that he might evade to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to it. And I might, after his Example, be as silent to his Objections from the <hi>Spirit of the Hat,</hi> as he is to the Answer in the Books <hi>Spirit of</hi> Alexander, <hi>the Copper Smith,</hi> and Judas <hi>and the</hi> Jews. But for the Readers satifaction, I shall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answer and say, that upon inquiry of those who are most likely to know whether <hi>G. F.</hi> did say so or not, such as his Widow, and other Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I am assured by them, and they do say it is utterly false. But the <hi>Snake</hi> to corroborate one <hi>Lie,</hi> he adds another, and says, that She (<hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet Fox</hi>) growing big (p. 192.) <hi>The Midwife at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended several Weeks in the House, till Belly fell, the Figure, was spoiled, and the</hi> Quakers <hi>disappointed of their</hi> Isaac.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Margaret Fox,</hi> when in years, beyond the ordinary time of Child-bearing, should <hi>grow big,</hi> (as if with Child) is nothing strange nor singular, for that the like doth often happen, by means of Flatulencies, and Humours collected in the Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;


<pb n="292" facs="tcp:63041:158"/>
which in their beginnings and progress, sometimes both the Party affected, and the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian have been in doubt to determine; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of these Kinds are frequently met with in the Writings of Physicians. So that it is foolish as well as false, to make any such mistake, a <hi>Legen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary</hi> Story; as it is also false where he says a <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife attended several Weeks,</hi> because there was no such thing.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 192. <hi>This their presumptuous pretence to Miracles, and Foolish Legends, is another instance wherein they have imitated and outstript the Roman Catholicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, the <hi>Snake</hi>'s great <hi>impudence,</hi> in calling the mistake of a Woman, concerning her <hi>Pregnancy,</hi> in which Questions many Women, and also Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, have been mistaken; <hi>a presumptuous pretence to Miracles and Foolish Legends,</hi> is another instance of his Malice or Folly. For, could he enumerate <hi>Ten Thousand</hi> such mistakes of <hi>Women</hi> amongst us, would this be good proof, that we have <hi>imitated</hi> or <hi>outstript</hi> the Roman Catholicks in <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Legends?</hi> I think it would not. For, besides the many Legendary Volumes which the <hi>Romanists</hi> have, and which were calculated for to feed their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition (of which we have none;) should it be allowed, that the mistakes of Women, in this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, is a pertinent instance. May it not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follow, that that Communion or Society in which are the most Women, may not be likely to have the most of these <hi>Miracles and Foolish Legends?</hi> And if so, it may then behove the <hi>Snake</hi> to clear the Communion, in which he pretends Membership, from such like <hi>Presumptuous Pretences.</hi>

               <head>SECT. XIV. Shewing that We do not <hi>Damn all the Christian World</hi> but our Selves.</head>
               <p>THE Uncharitableness of them Principles, which <hi>Reprobate</hi> and <hi>Damn</hi> all besides their <hi>Professors,</hi> must needs be very Obvious, both in their own Declaration, and also in the Lives and Practices of their <hi>Professors,</hi> as influenced by them; and need not the wiredrawing of strain'd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Constructions to prove it: Because at first sight it appears in the very Complexion and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of them.</p>
               <p>But the Principles and Doctrines which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and taught by us, have a direct opposition in their Declaration, and are of quite another tendency and purport, than that <hi>Damning</hi> of which the <hi>Snake</hi> speaks: For as opposite as <hi>Salvation</hi> is to <hi>Damnation,</hi> so opposite is that our Known Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>free and universal Grace,</hi> to that of <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> all but our selves. And to as many as have read our Books, or shall hereafter be incited to read them, they know and will find, that it is, and hath been by us, constantly declared, that the Saving Grace of God doth appear unto all Men, affording them a day of Visitation, wherein, through obedience to the Drawings of the Spirit of Grace upon their Hearts, they may escape <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> And the Work of our Ministry hath been to call Men into obedience to this Grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, declaring to them, that if the Day of their <hi>Visitation,</hi> and the tenders of the Love of


<pb n="294" facs="tcp:63041:159"/>
God, through the Spirit of his Son, shall come to an end through their Impenitency, that then they will have cause to say with them, whom the Prophet Personates, <hi>The Summer is ended, and we are not saved,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Principle of free Grace, and this Work and Labour of our Ministry, to call into Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it, concludes not that we <hi>Damn</hi> them who fall short through Disobedience; any more than <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> our <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> could be said to Damn the People, to whom they declared their Iniquities, and the consequents of their Impenitent abiding in them, which was, That they should <hi>Perish, and be Cut off in their Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as this is the Doctrine, which hath from the first been Believed, Preached and Writ by us; so our <hi>Conversations</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> Influenced by this <hi>Principle,</hi> hath been agreeable to it. And I do appeal to all, who have Knowledge and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with us, whether they have not found us constantly declaring, and shewing forth great good will to their Welfare, and to our Power promoting it; and often Warning and Admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against those things that might hinder it: Nay, the <hi>Snake</hi> himself is so far Evidence against himself, that he hath declared, <hi>He never received in all his whole Life, any sort of Disobligation from any of us.</hi> But it would have been a <hi>Disobligation</hi> in some <hi>sort,</hi> if the <hi>Quakers</hi> with whom he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd had told him he was Damn'd. On the contrary he testifies of the <hi>Generality,</hi> that they are <hi>Honest and well Meaning:</hi> Is it any good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Damn</hi> all but our selves? I think there is not much in it: And I see not how the <hi>Snake</hi> can reconcile that Character to the Title of this Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I say the Title, because this Section in the


<pb n="295" facs="tcp:63041:159"/>
Body of it, does no more answer its Title, in the matter charged in it, than the last Section did.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 192. <hi>Having equall'd themselves to</hi> Adam <hi>in his Innocency, as above is shewn, they must needs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themselves to all since the Fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if this were true, which I shall shew it is not, must they therefore <hi>needs</hi> Damn all <hi>since the Fall.</hi> What the <hi>Snake</hi> by his Title was to speak to, was, not to whom the <hi>Quakers</hi> did prefer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but whom they did <hi>Damn.</hi> The <hi>Snake</hi> is not herein shorter in his Proof, than he is false in his Charge; when he says, They have <hi>equalled Themselves to</hi> Adam <hi>in his Innocency, as is above shewn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> hath indeed, as is observed, p. 290. foregoing, said that <hi>G. F.</hi> Wrote, but where he hath not told us, <hi>That he was beyond the State of the First</hi> Adam <hi>that Fell:</hi> But if <hi>G. F.</hi> hath so Writ, it follows not that he hath <hi>equalled</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>Adam in his Innocency.</hi> Cannot the <hi>Snake</hi> see a Difference between the State of <hi>Adam</hi> in the <hi>Fall,</hi> and before the <hi>Fall?</hi> Beyond the State of <hi>Adam</hi> in the <hi>Fall,</hi> it is the Duty of all Men to come, else they cannot witness the being born again, by the Power of the Quickning Spirit, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven. This I say is our Duty and Interest; and they who measura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do witness this Regeneration, do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Equal Themselves</hi> to <hi>Adam in his Innocency,</hi> nor prefer themselves to all Others <hi>since the Fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 192. <hi>Thus while they themselves pretend to</hi> Infallibility <hi>of</hi> Discerning, <hi>and</hi> Infinity <hi>in</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, <hi>as shewn before, they Arraign the Apostles of Gross</hi> Error <hi>and</hi> Delusion, <hi>even where they speak from the Mouth of the Lord, and in his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:63041:160"/>That <hi>Infallibility, Discerning</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> which we own and contend for, is that which is of the Operation of the Spirit of God, and which he gives as pleaseth him, to all those who through Obedience follow on to know his Will: And, which may be a strange thing to the <hi>Snake,</hi> they are necessary to Man's Salvation: For, <hi>First,</hi> Our Saviour speaking of his Faithful Followers, John 10.4, 5. <hi>They know his Voice, and a stranger they will not follow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they could not thus chuse to follow <hi>Christ,</hi> and not the <hi>Devil,</hi> if there were not an <hi>Infallible</hi> Evidence in the Voice of Christ, to testify that it is his Voice; but such Evidence there is, and they who persevere to be <hi>Workers together with the Grace of God,</hi> shall by the <hi>Infallible</hi> Evidence of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> have a true <hi>Discerning</hi> between the Voice of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Voice of the <hi>Evil One:</hi> And as they shun the one, and follow the other, they will come to witness a being clothed in their Measure, with the Righteousness of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is Infinite.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> is not more false in his Charge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Infallibility, Discerning and Infinite Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; as is above declared, than he is grosly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and false, in saying, we <hi>Arraign the Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. as will be seen by examining the Instance which he brings.

<q>Though he (<hi>G.

                  <hi>G. K.</hi> had in that <hi>Narrative,</hi> above-mentioned, p. 45. made a Quotation from <hi>T. E</hi>'s <hi>Further Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovery,</hi> p. 99. thus, <hi>In comparing the Books of Friends, to the Books of them, called the</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Latin <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. He has not done as a Friend and Brother, but as an Enemy, in supposing Friends Books to have been written by no better Guidance, or clearer Sight, than theirs, who lived and wrote in those dark Times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this <hi>G. K.</hi> remark'd to his Auditory, <hi>You see how modest they are here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this Remark, <hi>G. K.</hi> says, his Auditors gave a Shout, signifying (as he says) <hi>Their dislike that the</hi> Quakers <hi>Books should be preferred so far to the Greek and Latin Fathers, next to the Days of the Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all this, <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> in his Answer to <hi>G. K</hi>'s <hi>Narrative,</hi> as above, in p. 177, 178. replies,
<q>One might wonder here at the cause of his Auditors <hi>Shouting:</hi> For such of them, as could understand what was meant by <hi>Greek and Latin Fathers,</hi> one might expect, should be Men of greater <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gravity,</hi> than to <hi>Shout</hi> in such Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; and for the <hi>Vndiscerning Mobb,</hi> it was a subject so much above their Capacity and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, that it cannot be supposed they should <hi>Shout</hi> at that, if they had not been excited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by some little <hi>Antick Gesticulation</hi> from him. But to the matter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:63041:162"/>
                  <q>They <hi>shouted,</hi> he says, signifying their dislike, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books should be prefer'd so far to the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Fathers, next to the days of the Apostles.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>These are not my words; I did not refer to the Times <hi>next to the days of the Apostles:</hi> But my words were, — <hi>Who lived and writ in those Dark Times.</hi> Must <hi>those Dark Times</hi> needs be next to the Days of the Apostles? See what an <hi>unfair stretch</hi> is this.—Thus <hi>T. Ellwood.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And yet as unfair as <hi>G. K</hi>'s <hi>stretch</hi> was, the <hi>Snake</hi> has <hi>stretch'd</hi> beyond him, and pronounces <hi>They</hi> (the Quakers) <hi>run them down by wholesale.</hi> But whether it be so or not, I leave with the sober Reader to judge; and shall observe by the way, that how jealously tender soever he is of the names of them he calls <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Holy Fathers.</hi> Yet Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi> being prest with some <hi>Authorities</hi> brought from them, by his Opponent <hi>Harding</hi> the <hi>Jesuit,</hi> makes no scruple to (do, what this <hi>Snake</hi> calls) <hi>run them down by wholesake</hi>; for, applying to his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he says, <hi>That Doctors in all Ages, and in all parts of the World, were brought against him.</hi> (And the Bishop then queries) <hi>Who would not be afraid to see such an Army come against him? Howbeit (gentle Reader) be of good Cheer, all this is but a</hi> Camisado: <hi>These be but Vizards, they be no Faces; they are brought in like Mummers for a Shew, and say nothing.</hi> Jewel against Harding, p. 6. Printed 1566.</p>
               <p>What will the <hi>Snake</hi> think of the light Character given of <hi>Doctors in all Ages, and in all parts of the World?</hi> And were it proper in this place, I could add plenty of Instances, that many of the Reform'd have made so bold, with those this <hi>Snake</hi> calls <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> and <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> as to <hi>run them down.</hi> If to discover their Errors, and slight their Authority,


<pb n="301" facs="tcp:63041:162"/>
as incompetent, when offered in Contradiction to the Holy Scriptures, and the Holy Spirit which gave them forth, be so.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 194. <hi>But now, what</hi> Quarters <hi>shall we have?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Snake</hi> ask for himself, the answer is ready, if it be such as he deserves, it will be none of the best. For one who tells Lyes for Bread, and can pawn all the pretences of Religion, upon the Score of Malice and base Design, may easily guess what value is to be put upon such an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 194. <hi>How shall we be able to stand before them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Question the <hi>Snake</hi> may well ask concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself, after so many Injuries of divers sorts, and so great Injustice as he is guilty of towards us; the weight of which may well be some pressure upon a Spirit, that is at all on this side Obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>They damn us all together to Hell,</hi> i. e. <hi>all Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is false, we <hi>Damn</hi> none; no not the <hi>Snake,</hi> much less <hi>all Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>But they are more favourable to the</hi> Heathen, <hi>whom they think Worshippers of the same</hi> Light <hi>with them, and not led to Outward Things, by the Belief of an Outward Christ, and Faith in his outward Sufferings, Death,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Snake</hi> has an unusual degree of <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>; for he is not contented only to suborn our <hi>Books,</hi> and pervert our <hi>Words,</hi> and forge <hi>Lyes,</hi> but he does bely our very <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and say we <hi>Think</hi> what we never declared we did <hi>Think.</hi> For we have never declared, That the <hi>Heathens</hi> (indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely speaking) were obedient to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> But we have often said, according to


<pb n="302" facs="tcp:63041:163"/>
the Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.35. <hi>In every Nation, he who feareth God, and worketh Righteousness, is accepted of him.</hi> And concerning the <hi>Heathen</hi> in particular, with the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>For when the Gentiles, which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, these having not the Law, are a Law unto themselves: Which sheweth the work of the Law written in the Heart.</hi>—</p>
               <p>And of such <hi>Heathens,</hi> who do thus shew forth the <hi>Work of the Law written in their Hearts,</hi> we may say, when considered and compared, with meer Nominal <hi>Christians,</hi> who have not known the <hi>Inward</hi> Vertue of what they believe <hi>Christ</hi> did <hi>Outwardly</hi> Suffer; as our Saviour did say concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Pharisee</hi> and the <hi>Publican,</hi> Luke 18.14. <hi>I tell you, this Man departed to his house, justified rather than the other.</hi> For a Man may have a Historical Faith of all the <hi>Outward</hi> Things, which are record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Holy Writ, that <hi>Christ</hi> did and suffered: Yet through disobedience to the Holy Spirit, which <hi>Reproveth for Sin,</hi> John 16.18. he may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know that Faith begotten in him, which gives victory over the World. Yet hence, it's not to be concluded, that such who are obedient to the Holy Spirit, in its Reproofs for Sin, do therefore slight, much less disbelieve, any part of what <hi>Christ</hi> outwardly did and suffered: No, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but must and do highly value and esteem It, knowing the Benefits that we receive by it; and do bless God, that it is our Lots to have the means of the Knowledge of what Christ did out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly do. So that the <hi>Snake</hi> is most injuriously Abusive in his false Insinuations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> now turns again to <hi>G. F</hi>'s <hi>Great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi> from whence (not unlike the <hi>Quacks</hi> of the Town, who of their pretended Panacea's, boast


<pb n="303" facs="tcp:63041:163"/>
they will cure all Diseases) he pretends to fetch proofs for every Charge, tho' contradictory to themselves, (but how falsly I have at least in some measure shewn.) As that the Quakers, <hi>at first setting up, pretended to be equal, and of the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with God.</hi> And it must also prove, that the <hi>Quakers now abated from that, and do now only claim to be Infallible as Prophets and Apostles.</hi> Again, <hi>Great Mystery</hi> must prove that there <hi>was a time when there was no God,</hi> (p. 122.) And also that <hi>not the Divinity, but the Incarnation of Christ is denied by them.</hi> Again, <hi>Great Mystery</hi> must prove <hi>that Popish Emissaries set up Quakerism in</hi> England. And it must also prove, <hi>that the</hi> Quakers <hi>Damn all the Christian World but themselves.</hi> Again <hi>Great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> must prove that the <hi>Quakers are pure and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</hi> And it must also prove, <hi>that they are Venemous and Nasty.</hi> These, with many other, no less Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, and for which the Book affords no true Ground, does the <hi>Snake,</hi> by the help of a prolifick fancy, draw.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 195. G. F. <hi>in his</hi> Great Mystery, p. 89. <hi>says,</hi> "That the <hi>Quakers</hi> have a Spirit given them beyond all the Fore-Fathers, since the Days of Apostles. In the Apostacy. <hi>G. Whitehead would fain come off of this, and thus endeavours to excuse it, in his</hi> Charitable Essay, <hi>Printed</hi> 1693. p. 5. <hi>in these words,</hi>
                  <q>The very intent and meaning of <hi>G. F</hi>'s words herein, was not beyond all the Fore-Fathers without exception, but beyond all in the Apostacy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed it is very plain, that <hi>G. F</hi>'s mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing must be so, because the natural import of his words shew as much. But the <hi>Snake</hi> says, <hi>Here it would have been incumbent upon</hi> G. W. <hi>to have named those, whom he or</hi> G. Fox did believe were not in the <hi>Apostacy.</hi> Why so incumbent? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose


<pb n="304" facs="tcp:63041:164"/>
should they be <hi>named who were not in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy.</hi> The prophet shews not any Incumbency there was to have the Seven Thousand named, whom God said he would spare, and for whom he testified, that they had not bowed their Knees unto <hi>Baal,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.18.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 195. <hi>Let us hear</hi> G. Fox <hi>explain himself in other places of the same Book, you will best know his meaning from himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Wonder! The <hi>Snake</hi> has once spoke Truth! But it mightily contradicts himself; for in other places speaking of this very <hi>G. Fox,</hi> whom he here supposes capable to <hi>explain himself.</hi> He says he was a <hi>Fool,</hi> one of <hi>such an immoderate degree of Dulness, and lack of Vnderstanding as could hardly befall any thing in Humane Shape.</hi> But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, let us hear <hi>G. Fox,</hi> as quoted by the <hi>Snake,</hi> from <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 217. <hi>He says, That since the Days of the Apostles, all the World went after him,</hi> i. e. <hi>after those who</hi> (as he there expresses it) <hi>did inwardly raven in Sheeps Clothing. And now</hi> (says he) <hi>are People but coming from them to a Rock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the <hi>Snake</hi> calls hearing <hi>G. Fox</hi> explain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but is in Truth nothing less, because the <hi>Snake</hi> has miserably cut assunder and disjointed <hi>G. Fox</hi> his words; and by the help of <hi>i. e.</hi> he has put a <hi>meaning</hi> of his own upon them. To prove which I shall only give the place as it is in <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> by which we have the <hi>Snake</hi>'s word; we shall <hi>best know his meaning</hi>; which, with the occasion of them, is as follows. <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Opponent had said, <hi>False Prophets and Christs, and Deceivers many shall come, if it was possible to deceive the very Elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>G. Fox</hi> says,
<q>Yea, Christ said they should come, to his Apostles which before their decease did come, and went forth from them;


<pb n="305" facs="tcp:63041:164"/>
which Christ said should inwardly raven, and get the Sheeps Clothing: And since the Days of the Apostles all the World went after them, as thou mayst read in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and now are People but coming from them to the <hi>Rock</hi>; and now shall the <hi>Everlasting Gospel be preached to them that dwell upon the Earth,</hi> over the Heads of the Beast, and False Prophet, and they shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the <hi>Lamb</hi> and the Saints shall have the Victory.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is what the <hi>Snake,</hi> blinded by the Dim <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions</hi> of Malice, says, is to <hi>condemn all the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World</hi> but our <hi>selves.</hi> But whether it be so or not, we will now examine by Scripture, and there our Saviour tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. that <hi>false Christs, and false Prophets should come.</hi> And the Apostle, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.7. testifies, <hi>The mystery of Iniquity doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready work,</hi> &amp;c. and so great was the increase of its workings. in the space of fifty years (for it was hardly more from <hi>Paul</hi>'s writing to the <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians,</hi> to <hi>John</hi>'s writing the <hi>Revelations</hi>) that <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations</hi> 13.3. says — <hi>all the world wandred after the Beast.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would here ask the <hi>Snake,</hi> Did <hi>John</hi> the Divine herein condemn all the <hi>Christian World?</hi> Did he condemn all those, who at the writing of that Book, did yet persevere in true <hi>Faith</hi> and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to <hi>Christ?</hi> Surely he did not. Why then must <hi>G. F.</hi> using the Apostles words, and having respect to the same <hi>Apostacy,</hi> of which the Apostle speaks, be so understood? They cannot be justly so understood; because their natural import, as used by the Divine, and from him by <hi>G. Fox,</hi> is <hi>all the World,</hi> that is, all that were entred into the <hi>Apostacy,</hi> which was foretold by our Saviour should come; and declared by the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was come in its beginnings; and which <hi>John</hi> testifies was


<pb n="306" facs="tcp:63041:165"/>
more generally come at his writing of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the same purpose, with the Quotation last made by the <hi>Snake,</hi> he makes about twelve more from several places of the same Book, in all which the <hi>Snake</hi> would pervert <hi>G. Fox</hi> his words to be meant of such who were not in the Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but offers not one Argument to shew, that those to whom <hi>G. F.</hi> did speak were not so. To which it may be convenient here to observe, that as the <hi>Apostacy</hi> from the Spirit and Life of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity had its beginning very early, even while se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Apostles were yet alive, and was more generally overspread before the death of <hi>John</hi>: So it did (by general confession) continue for many Ages after. Nay, it is not yet quite done away; for all those who do resist and withstand the Spiritual Appearance of <hi>Christ</hi> in People, and do endeavour to keep them, from witnessing that Faith of which he is the Author and Beginner, and which gives <hi>Victory over the World,</hi> may be, and are truly said to be in that Apostacy, which did overspread the Nations through their forsaking the <hi>right way of the Lord.</hi> And to such who are in that <hi>Apostacy,</hi> to tell them of it, and admonish them to come out of it, is not to <hi>Damn</hi> them. No, it is the Office and Duty of those to whom God giveth the Ministry of his Word; as to the Prophet <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> 58.1. <hi>Cry aloud, and spare not; lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, and shew my people their Transgression, and to the House of</hi> Jacob <hi>their Sins.</hi> And this the Prophet did do, very sharply many times; yet he did not therefore <hi>Damn</hi> them, nor include every particular of the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>House of</hi> Jacob, under his Charge, no more hath <hi>G. F.</hi> or any other of our Friends. For fuller evidencing of this, past all the little tricks (by perversion, insinuation or


<pb n="307" facs="tcp:63041:165"/>
false quoting) of the <hi>Snake,</hi> I shall for conclusion to this <hi>Section,</hi> subjoin somewhat out of a piece writ by <hi>Isaac Penington,</hi> which was first Printed 1660. and reprinted in his Works 1681. p. 313. and bears for Title, <hi>An Answer to that Common Objection against the</hi> Quakers, <hi>that they Damn all but themselves.</hi> The words are these,
<q>This then is the sum of our Answer in this respect, We are not against the Life and Power of Godliness, where-ever it hath appeared, or yet appears under the Vail of any form whatsoever. Nay, all persons who singly wait upon the Lord, in the simplicity and sincerity of their Hearts, whether under any form, or out of forms (that matters little to us,) are very dear unto us in the Lord. But we are against all Forms, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Imitations and Appearances, which betray the simplicity and sincerity of the Heart, keep the Life in bondage, and endanger the loss of the Soul. And too many such now there are, which hold the Immortal Seed of Life in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity under Death, over which we cannot but mourn, and wait for the breaking of the Chains, and its rising out of all its Graves into its own pure Life, Power, and Fulness of Liberty in the Lord.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Testimony which has been published now near 40 years, and others of like tendency, which I could produce, but that I would be as brief as may be, shews, that from the first we have not <hi>Damn'd</hi> all the <hi>Christian World,</hi> as is falsly said by this <hi>Adversary.</hi>

               <p>HAving thus shewn the falsity of the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Charge of our <hi>Damning</hi> all the <hi>Christian World,</hi> and on the contrary prov'd, that <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> which we have from the first had, and shewn to all the sincere hearted under any Form: So herein I hope to make appear, that the <hi>respect</hi> wherewith we have treated Men, hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it; and that if <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Language</hi> may be allowed to discover <hi>the Furious, Spiteful and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Ebullitions of a distorted Soul,</hi> that then the <hi>Snake</hi> hath discovered so much.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Good Nature</hi> have no doubt, expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons suitable to their <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Occasion,</hi> which in their utterance are always <hi>Kind,</hi> but may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not be otherwise <hi>Sweet,</hi> than as <hi>Reproof</hi> and <hi>Rebuke</hi> may be said to be, when properly and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably given. And on the contrary, <hi>Fury, Spight</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> have ever Expressions suitable to their <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Hateful</hi> Nature, and are level'd against Men in order to their Hurt and Destruction; and


<pb n="309" facs="tcp:63041:166"/>
have falshood for their original; but are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways (tho' often) in <hi>violent</hi> manner, for they are sometimes cover'd with <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi> Instances of both <hi>Violent</hi> and <hi>Hypocritical,</hi> I shall anon shew in the <hi>Snake,</hi> after that I have told my Reader, that as <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Language</hi> are the Servants of the Mind, so they are to be varied as the occasions thereof require. Hence <hi>Kind</hi> and <hi>Sweet Expressions</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be given to Men and Actions that are Good and Honest: And it is as proper, by a Sharp and <hi>Kind</hi> Severity, to express the Just Indignation of the Mind against the Evil Actions of Wicked Men.</p>
               <p>A multitude of Examples in both kinds, we have in Holy Writ; where the <hi>Dejected,</hi> the <hi>Disconso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> the <hi>Mourner</hi> and the <hi>Penitent</hi> are comforted by the <hi>Kind and Sweet Expressions</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> speaking through the Holy Prophets and Apostles; as does also our Lord himself: It being the way of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> by <hi>Love unfeigned,</hi> to seek and to save Mankind. But on the contrary, to the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical,</hi> the <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Impenitent,</hi> it hath been the way of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> by sharp and severe <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,</hi> (even such sometimes as in ordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course might not be seemly or convenient) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them.</p>
               <p>How severely doth God, both in the Law and in the Prophets, threaten the punishment of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi> even in terms which the <hi>Rabinnical Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liasts</hi> have thought fit to alter, in obedience to that foolish rule in their Talmud, <hi>that all words which in the Law are writ obscenely, must be chang'd to more civil words? (Milton</hi>'s <hi>Apology, Printed</hi> 1642, p. 25.) Much so foolishly wise wou'd this <hi>Snake</hi> appear, in refusing to allow what God at times, as occasion did require, hath thought fit to speak thro' his Servants. Thus the Holy Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi>

hath pronounced from the Lord concerning <hi>Jeza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Eth-baal,</hi> King of <hi>Zidon,</hi> as mentioned, 2 Kings 9.37. <hi>And the Carcass of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel <hi>shall be as Dung upon the Ground.</hi> Thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Lord, by his Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> threatneth the Inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem, Jer.</hi> 8.2. That they should <hi>be as Dung upon the Earth.</hi> And the Prophet Malachi 2.3. <hi>Behold I will cast Dung upon your Faces, even the Dung of your Solemn Feasts, and you shall be like unto it.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> rebuking the Wickedness of the <hi>Priests and Prophets,</hi> telleth them, <hi>all Tables are full of Vomit and Filthiness, so that there is no place clean,</hi> Isai. 28.8. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> when he objected to the People their <hi>Secret Nakedness,</hi> he tells them — <hi>The Cup of the Lords right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful Spuing shall be upon thy Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These, with abundance more Instances, there are in the Holy Scriptures, which are sufficient to shew, that <hi>Love and Good Nature</hi> (for such is the Holy Spirit) doth not always use such, as in the account of this <hi>Snake</hi> are to be called <hi>Kind and Sweet Expressions:</hi> No, for tho' the Spirit of God is Purity and Meekness it self; yet in the reproving the Iniquities of Men, it hath often used severe expressions. Thus <hi>John</hi> the Baptist calls the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Jews,</hi> a <hi>Generation of Vipers.</hi> Our Saviour calls <hi>Herod,</hi> a <hi>Fox</hi>; and told the <hi>Wicked Jews,</hi> they were of their <hi>Father</hi> the Devil. The Proto Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, <hi>Stephen,</hi> detects their <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> does the <hi>injustice</hi> of the High-Priest.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> will surely not be so <hi>Blasphemous,</hi> as to say, these were in them the marks of <hi>Fury, Spight,</hi> or <hi>Envy,</hi> &amp;c. Nor will it be answer suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, for him to say, of all these, and others of like sort, recorded in Holy Writ, that he believes them to be the immediate Dictates of the Spirit


<pb n="311" facs="tcp:63041:167"/>
of God: But that all <hi>such Speeches,</hi> since that time, are the effects of <hi>Fury, Spight</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> and that they are <hi>the wicked and hateful Eubullitions of a Distorted Soul</hi>; unless he can shew, that <hi>God</hi> hath promised, that he will no more, through his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, in like manner rebuke the <hi>iniquities</hi> of Men.</p>
               <p>This, as denied by the <hi>Snake,</hi> puts him upon a worse Dilemma; for all those in him, which are not <hi>Kind and Sweet Expressions.</hi> (And some such I think he has.) They must of necessity be <hi>Furious, Spightful</hi> and <hi>Envious,</hi> and the <hi>wicked and hateful Ebullitions</hi> of his <hi>Distorted Soul</hi>; of which I will give some Instances, when I have first shewn, that if it be denied, that the Instances above are Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for us to build on. Yet that there wants not Examples of the like practice in the Reformation, I will content my self to instance but in two, <hi>Martin Luther</hi> and <hi>William Fulk,</hi> who for the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Style, hardly come behind any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martin Luther</hi> being called before the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, <hi>to answer for his Books; Having divided them into Three Sorts; one of which was, those he had sharply written, refused though upon delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given him to retract or unsay any word therein; as we read in</hi> Sleidan;
<q>
                     <hi>Yea, he defends his Eagerness, as being</hi> of an Ardent Spirit, and one who could not write a dull Style; <hi>and affirm'd</hi> he thought it God's Will to have the Inventions of Men thus laid open, seeing that Matters quietly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led are quickly forgot.</q>
                  <hi>Milton's Apology,</hi> p. 24, 25.</p>
               <p>And <hi>William Fulk</hi> comes not much short of him herein; for it being objected to him, that he had ill treated <hi>Allen, Stapleton, Martial, Staphylus</hi> and <hi>Bristow,</hi> who were Papists; he defends the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and further says, <hi>I call not only</hi> Martial, <hi>but


<pb n="312" facs="tcp:63041:168"/>
all Papists, shameless Dogs, and Blasphemous Idolaters, who maintain, and make Vows to Images, which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to them, and offer up both Prayers and Sacrifices of Candles, Mony, Jewels and other things. Fulk</hi>'s Confutation of the Papists Quarrels, p. 9. printed at the end of his Edition of the New Testament, 1633.</p>
               <p>And upon a search neither strict nor tedious, it were easie to heap up Instances of this sort, which as I am not inclin'd to do, so neither would I have mentioned these, had not the meer necessity of Teaching this Adversary, the practice of such, whom that Church will own, to which he is a Pretender.</p>
               <p>But now this <hi>Snake,</hi> who denies the soundness of such reproof, as I have before shewn from <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> and from the <hi>Reformation</hi>; and will needs have it proceed from a Spirit <hi>Venemous</hi> and <hi>Nasty,</hi> and that it is the effect of <hi>Fury, Spight</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> and proceeds from the <hi>wicked and hateful Ebulliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Distorted Soul.</hi> May yet, (nay doubtless is) when speaking of himself, be in the right. For it is not impossible but he may know what <hi>Distortion</hi> of Soul, what <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>hateful Ebulliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> they were in him: From whence proceeded his <hi>Fury, Spight</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> in the several Appearances which it has made, against the <hi>Government,</hi> against <hi>Vs</hi> and against <hi>Others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was a <hi>Venemous</hi> Libel which was writ in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Dr. <hi>King,</hi> now <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>London-Derry</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> It savour'd of no small <hi>Envy,</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to run over to our <hi>Enemies</hi>; nor did it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of less <hi>Nastiness,</hi> to run away from the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger; who by the force of some <hi>Sweet and Kind Expressions</hi> (which were the Covers of <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> in the <hi>Snake</hi>) was prevail'd upon to let him go and ease himself, upon the occasion of a <hi>Violent


<pb n="313" facs="tcp:63041:168"/>
Loosness,</hi> which in <hi>Jesuitical</hi> manner, he had before told the Messenger, <hi>He feared would carry him off.</hi> The Officer not mistrusting the meaning of the words <hi>(carry him off)</hi> had no fear upon him from them, till it was too late, and had found that his pretences to a <hi>Violent Loosness</hi> (and which received some colour from the fear he was in) had afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him an opportunity which had indeed carried him off.</p>
               <p>And now for the <hi>Libel, The</hi> Snake <hi>in the Grass,</hi> O! The <hi>Fury, Spite</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> which his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Good Nature,</hi> or rather <hi>Wicked and Hateful Ebullition of his Distorted Soul</hi> hath vented, as <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon, Fool, Blockhead, Monster, Deluded Wretch, George Magus,</hi> and <hi>G. W</hi>'s plain words he calls, <hi>Rank Sophistry, Equivocation, Jesuitical Confession, Diabolical Suggestion</hi>; and of all that differs from him, he says they are <hi>like the Spawn of the Viper</hi>; and that <hi>the Devil enter'd into the Herd of our Swine, the Beasts of the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are a few of the many Instances which this Libel affords, which, whether they are <hi>Kind and Sweet Expressions natural to Love and good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or, <hi>Furious, Spiteful, Envious and Grating, vented</hi> from the <hi>Wicked and Hateful Ebullitions of a Distorted Soul.</hi> Let the Impartial Reader Judge.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding this his practice, he objects to <hi>G. F.</hi> p. 199. That he calls <hi>William Thomas</hi> a <hi>false Prophet,</hi> and that he said to <hi>Christopher Wade, The Devil was in thee.</hi> And of this, what great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Proof need any Man give, than false <hi>Doctrine and Lyes,</hi> which <hi>G. F.</hi> hath shewn they had ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 299. You be in the Diabolical Devilish <hi>(says he to some Priests in the Bishopwrick.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:63041:169"/>But the <hi>Snake</hi> has not told the Reader, that the words <hi>(Diabolical Devilish)</hi> were not <hi>G. F</hi>'s, but the Priest's, and <hi>G. F.</hi> did only shew, that they themselves were in that, which they had said the <hi>Quakers</hi> were in. Is there no Venom in <hi>(Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Devilish)</hi> when spoke first by Priests? And yet much Venom when their own words are justly returned to them.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 200. The <hi>Snake</hi> does from an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries Book, take upon trust a great many names, which he gives without further Proof, or attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to shew that they are the words of our Friends; or that if they were, they were impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as spoken: No, that would have been a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult task. But it is easier for him to pronounce, like one of <hi>Liberal Education: Much of this is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the mean Education of these Scribes, which furnished them with such Mechanick Ribaldry and Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingsgate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And why owing to that? Pray don't beg the Question, since I have shewn before, that sharp and severe Expressions, have been the Immediate Dictate of the Spirit of God: And that some, not of meaner Education, than possibly the <hi>Snake,</hi> have used the like: If they were proper (as it may be the <hi>Snake</hi> will grant) because properly applyed; these may be so too, if the <hi>Snake</hi> cannot shew that they were improperly apply'd, let the <hi>Education</hi> of the Speakers be what it will.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 202. You have seen the <hi>Venom, Fury</hi> and <hi>Nonsense</hi> of this <hi>Quaker-Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And why pray, the <hi>Venom, Fury</hi> and <hi>Nonsense?</hi> Names are no Proof, and other than Names the <hi>Snake</hi> has not given.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 202. <hi>That it may appear Vniform, and all of a piece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:63041:169"/>After all the Deformity and Distortion, which the <hi>Snake,</hi> from a likeness of it, to his own <hi>Mind and Soul,</hi> shall endeavour falsly to fix upon our Principles; they will still when set in their true Light, have a perfect Symetry and Proportion of Parts, and agreement to the Truths recorded in Holy Writ.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 202. <hi>These and such like were sent to</hi> John Wiggans, <hi>from the</hi> Quakers <hi>in Letters open,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A good token there was nothing sent but what was true, and if true? A good means to have Truth Published; and if <hi>read by others,</hi> as the <hi>Snake</hi> says, it was no hurt, while Truth: That which would have been of great Moment (if I may inform the <hi>Snake,</hi>) after a Collection of these <hi>Characters, Descriptions</hi> or <hi>Epithets,</hi> given in these Letters, said to be sent to <hi>John Wiggans,</hi> would have been to have shewn, that they had been <hi>Falsly</hi> and <hi>Nonsensically</hi> given; but of this not one Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 202. <hi>And this shews the true Picture of the Quaker-Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, it can't, because it is not only Cloudy, but it is <hi>Dark</hi> and <hi>False,</hi> to say that words are <hi>Furious, Venemous</hi> or <hi>Nonsensical,</hi> and not give any Proof that they are so. It is no help to the <hi>Snake</hi> to say as he does; <hi>There needs no Argument to Discern betwixt Perfume and Stench.</hi> Because that if the Nose can <hi>Discern</hi> (as his Philosophy expresses it) without <hi>Argument</hi>; yet the <hi>Mind</hi> is not established, but by <hi>Arguments</hi> drawn from true <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and none such, nay none at all, does the <hi>Snake</hi> offer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> for Conclusion to this Section, has brought in two texts from the <hi>Psalms,</hi> which he does improperly apply to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as he has before falsly charged them, with <hi>Venom, Fury, Spite,


<pb n="316" facs="tcp:63041:170"/>
Envy</hi> and <hi>Nonsense.</hi> And till he can prove that the words spoken by our Friends (which, whether these quoted were so or not, remains to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, being only taken from Adversaries) were in their Original from <hi>Fury, Spite</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> and in their delivery <hi>Nonsense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Texts of Scripture are but abused by him, as a Text in the same Book, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.11. was by the Devil, when he repeated it to our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.10. and it will be answer sufficient, if after the Example of our Lord, we answer in the words of Scripture. <hi>Psal.</hi> 101.7. <hi>There shall no deceitful Person dwell within my House, he that tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Lyes shall not remain in my sight.</hi>

               <head>SECT. XVI. Of Fighting and Loyalty.</head>
               <p>I Have hitherto shewn the falsity of the <hi>Snake's</hi> Charges, and his perversions of our <hi>Words, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> and how Unduly and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteously, he would endeavour to inferr from them, Meanings and Consequences, which neither are, nor ever were ours, but which we Abominate, as destructive of and contrary to those <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, which the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> teacheth and leads into, and which we do sincerely Believe.</p>
               <p>And what is thus already in the foregoing Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made appear, will be further manifested in this, and the following <hi>Sections</hi>; for that in these, as in those, he hath not shewn what we are, but


<pb n="317" facs="tcp:63041:170"/>
what he would have us appear to be, under the disguise which himself has put upon us. In the pulling off which disguise, there is at least this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Help and Advantage; that the disguise in which he has represented us, is exceedingly unlike our true <hi>Features.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I call it an accidental Advantage, because if his Malice could have been satisfied, in accusing us with only an abundance of improbable things, they might have found some unthinking People, who might have been misled into a too easy belief of them. But as that could not be satisfied, but by charging us with a number of <hi>Absurd</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> things: So all that shall consider the ground and nature of our <hi>Principles</hi>; and the nature of his <hi>Charge,</hi> will with little difficulty be satisfied of their Contrariety and Inconsistency.</p>
               <p>And tho' from this Consideration, the sober <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> might and would have ground sufficient to determine the Question in this particular. Yet for the detecting his particular <hi>Charges, Perversions</hi> and <hi>Abuses,</hi> I shall (as in the former) follow him through them: And for his more full and plain Confutation herein, I will briefly hint our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as Influencing Men, with respect to <hi>Fighting</hi> and <hi>Loyalty:</hi> The first of which, the <hi>Snake</hi> most falsly does Charge us to approve and use, and that in the last we are short and defective.</p>
               <p>And first as to Fighting.</p>
               <p>We say the end of the coming of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, as is prophesied of him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. was to <hi>Finish the Transgression, and to make an end of Sin:</hi> And in the Room thereof, to establish Truth and Righteousness in the Earth. And as many as do witness the <hi>Power of his Coming,</hi> by the Operation of his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in them, do know that the work thereof is to take away, and cleanse from, all the


<pb n="318" facs="tcp:63041:171"/>
                  <hi>Fleshly Lusts that War against the Soul,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. which the Apostle makes to be the ground of Outward <hi>Wars and Contentions,</hi> James 4.1. and as the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> in all those in whom it does ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually work, does destroy and purge away the very root from whence unjust Wars do proceed; so it prevents in them, the occasion of all outward Wars.</p>
               <p>And this our Saviour did Teach, in that Sermon of his, upon the Mount, Matth. 5.21, 22. <hi>Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>But I say unto you, whosoever is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with his Brother,</hi> &amp;c. — vers. 38, 39. <hi>Ye have heard it said, an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth: But I say unto you, that ye resist not Evil; but whosoever shall Smite on thy right Cheek, turn to him the other.</hi> Vers. 43, 44. <hi>Ye have heard it hath been said, thou shalt love thine Neighbour and hate thine Enemy: But I say unto you, Love your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And if Anger, Resistance and Hate, be taken away, What then can remain to occasion Wars? Surely nothing. From a sight of this Gospel Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation it was, that the Prophet in the Holy Vision, did foretel the peaceable practice of those, who should come under the peaceable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Jesus Christ, — They shall beat their Swords into Plow-shares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks, Nation shall not lift up Sword against Nation, neither shall they learn War any more,</hi> Isa. 2.4. And they who thus are redeemed, out of the Grounds and Occasions of Wars, by the workings of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in them: Such, if they continue obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, cannot any more take the Sword into their hands.</p>
               <p>Hitherto with respect to those who are in, and under, the Administration of the Gospel of Peace,


<pb n="319" facs="tcp:63041:171"/>
concerning whom, we have from the first, since we were a People, declared that God hath taken the Sword out of their hands.</p>
               <p>But tho' God hath thus disarm'd his peculiar People of the outward Sword, that he might bring them to have a full and entire Dependance upon him for their safety: Yet he hath never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd himself of the outward Sword; and as he is as well Soveraign of the World, as of the Church, and ought to have the command of all Mankind; so he may put the Sword into the hands of those, who are not yet brought under the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, which I have above spoken of; and he can make them Instrumental in his hand, to Chastize his and his Peoples Enemies. Thus <hi>Cyrus.</hi> who many years before he was born, was by name foretold of by the Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.28.45.1. is there called, in the Word of the Lord, <hi>Cyrus is my Shepherd, he is the Lord's Anointed.</hi> These Titles were given, with respect to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which God had fore-appointed he should do, <hi>viz.</hi> be instrumental in the delivery of <hi>Jacob his Servant, his Elect.</hi> In like manner, and to the like purposes, the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the Word of the Lord, does in three places call <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> the Lord's <hi>Servant:</hi> but neither of these were of the peculiar People of God; but it pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to appoint the Sword into their hands, to Chastize those, whose Iniquities were then full. And thus he can use those who are not yet come in, and under the Administration of the Gospel of his <hi>Peace,</hi> to pull down, set up, afflict, scourg and punish one another; as also <hi>Vespasian</hi> in the Destruction of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And God can make known his Mind and Will, concerning these Turnings and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnings, Afflictions and Punishments, by such of his Servants, as he has redeemed out of that State


<pb n="320" facs="tcp:63041:172"/>
War and Destruction, which they are made to Proclaim.</p>
               <p>Thus the Evangelical Prophet proclaimed a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <hi>All ye Beasts of the Feild come to Devour, even all the Beasts of the Forrest,</hi> Isa. 56.9. And for the Iniquities of the People, he again denounces, 65.12. <hi>Therefore will I number you to the Sword, and all you shall bow down to the Slaughter.</hi> — Thus also the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> proclaim'd, <hi>Set up the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard in</hi> Zion, <hi>prepare to flee, and stay not; for I will bring a Plague from the</hi> North, <hi>and a great Distru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> Jer. 4.6. and in like kind, have very many of the Prophets and Servants of the Lord been made the Messengers, of those Wars and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedings (because of Wickedness) which they were not called to have any hand in.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have briefly shewn thee, sober Reader, our Sentiments with respect to Fighting and Wars, and the Messages concerning it, which may have been delivered from the Lord, by those his Servants, who were or are redeemed out of that State, which was and is the ground and occasion of these Messages, which was and is Sin. I shall now as briefly hint concerning <hi>Loyalty,</hi> (as it is commonly call'd.) By which Word I understand a faithful Performance of the Duties of Subjects to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors; and in this faithful Discharge of Duty in all Godly and Peaceable sort, it is impossible that they should be wanting, who do in the first place <hi>give unto God the things that are God's.</hi> Because, that in the Discharge of such their Duty to God, they are also taught by his Spirit, <hi>to keep a Conscience void of offence towards</hi> Men. And this has been our Practice from the first, in that we have always, since a People, been clear of all Plots, Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Combinations, to subvert Governments or Governors; and in the many Changes which


<pb n="321" facs="tcp:63041:172"/>
have been in the fifty Years last past, we have been peaceable and quiet, waiting to see the Hand of God in and through them all: For, as it pleaseth him, he sets up, and he can and hath pull'd down, when those whom he hath set up have not answer'd his Good Pleasure. And when Kings, Princes, or Governors, have disobey'd the Lord; God in Mercy to them hath often laid it upon his Servants, to warn them in the day of their Visitation, that so they might repent and be established. Of this sort we shall have many Instances in this Section, which the <hi>Snake</hi> does diversly pervert, according to the Purpose he would falsly draw them to. Tho' after all his Perversions, an irrefragable Proof of our <hi>Loyalty</hi> or Faithfulness, is, That under none of the several Changes in Government which have been, since we were a People, were we ever found guilty of any Practices against any of them; yet have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered under them, (but in some more than others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) Not as Offenders against the Rights of Men, but for our Consciences towards God, in matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Eternity, and always patiently endur'd those our Sufferings: And in the feeble In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the <hi>Snake</hi> to the contrary, which will hereafter be examined, it will appear that there is nothing more of this sort in them, but his Falsity: Of which now in order.</p>

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:63041:173"/>
what adds to the Ambiguity of the <hi>Snakes</hi> Assertion, is, that it is a <hi>pleasant Instance</hi> of Fighting. Then surely nothing tragical attended, as Blood and Death.</p>
               <p>Ibid. P. 204. <hi>They were in great pain how to save this</hi> Principle, (of not Fighting) <hi>and their Sloop too: But that was impossible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Great Pain</hi> cannot consist with the Terms of <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Instance.</hi> The <hi>Snake</hi> as he contradicts himself, must be a Lyer in at least one of these. But the Quakers were at no such strait as he does falsly sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest.</p>
               <p>For as it is not impossible to take Offenders <hi>Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> without fighting, so there is not any necessity that they who do so take them, should have <hi>great Pain</hi> for the distinction. And thus it was in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>Sloop,</hi> which was taken by Privateers, for there were Persons who did follow them, and overtake them; among whom were some Quakers, none of which did bear Arms, yet did retake the Sloop, and also some Prisoners, and that without any Bloodshed, or Wounds.</p>
               <p>Ibid. P. 204. <hi>Therefore they coined or borrow'd a pretty Distinction, and said that they did not use the</hi> Carnal Weapons <hi>as</hi> Quakers, <hi>but as</hi> Magistrates.</p>
               <p>They needed no such <hi>Distinction</hi>; for if there had been <hi>fighting,</hi> it does not follow that the Figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were <hi>Quakers:</hi> There were other Persons, not only Inhabitants, but also <hi>Magistrates,</hi> who were no <hi>Quakers,</hi> but Men of professed <hi>fighting</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. That's well known, and himself says, <hi>p.</hi> 203. <hi>the Government there is</hi> chiefly <hi>managed by Quakers, who are Justices of the Peace, and in other Commissions there. Chiefly</hi> not <hi>only</hi>: The Government is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by others besides, and that not only in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions of the Peace, but other Commissions also. So that the <hi>Coining</hi> or <hi>Borrowing</hi> is likely a Fiction of

his own, and may serve for the counterpart to his beloved Distinction, <hi>de Jure,</hi> and <hi>de Facto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. P. 205. <hi>And their Principle is, that such (viz.</hi> as oppose their Church) <hi>may be resisted by Arms, whether their own Kings, or any others.</hi> This as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the Quakers, is as false as malicious: And it is a strange degree of (to use his own terms) <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence</hi> and <hi>Boldness</hi> must be in a Fellow, to make him run with so greedy assurance into the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Lies. It is but just now that he says, the <hi>Quakers</hi> were in <hi>great Pain</hi> how to save their <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of <hi>not fighting,</hi> and here he says their <hi>Principle</hi> is to fight: But not only this <hi>Contradiction,</hi> but also our <hi>Practice,</hi> hath shewn the <hi>Falsity</hi> of his Charge: In that, for Conscience sake we have always refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to take Arms; nor did ever own the carrying of <hi>Arms</hi> since we were a People, as we have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently testified.</p>
               <p>And after our being cleared from <hi>fighting Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> by his own words, and by our Practice as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove observed; I may here fitly retort upon him, to own, abet and practise a Principle of <hi>resisting</hi> by Arms, <hi>such as oppose his Church, whether his own Kings or others.</hi> Whence else did proceed that Seditious <hi>Libel,</hi> which I have before observed to be written in answer to Dr. <hi>King,</hi> &amp;c? and if it be not a <hi>Principle</hi> owned by the Communion he pretends Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in, yet one and he no small Member, did once publish a Sheet, intituled, <hi>An Enquiry into the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Submission to the Supream Authority.</hi> In which is declared something to this purpose, as it seems to me: His Words in that Sheet are these, <hi>p.</hi> 5.
<q>Here is the true Difficulty of this whole matter, (viz. <hi>of Submission</hi>) and therefore it ought to be exactly considered: First, all general Words, how large soever, are still supposed to have a Tacit Exception and Reserve in them, if the Matter


<pb n="324" facs="tcp:63041:174"/>
seems to require it. Children are Commanded to Obey their Parents in <hi>all things</hi>: Wives are declared by the Scripture to be Subject to their Husbands <hi>in all things, as the Church is unto Christ:</hi> And yet how Comprehensive soever these Words may seem to be, there is still a Reserve to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in them; and though by our Form of Marriage, the Parties Swear to one another, <hi>till Death them do part,</hi> yet few doubt but that this Bond is dissolved by Adultery, though it is not nam'd; for odious things ought not to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, and therefore not named upon such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions; but when they fall out, they carry still their own force with them. 2. When there seems to be a Contradiction between two Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the Constitution, we ought to examine which of the two is the most Evident, and the most Important, and so we ought to fix upon it, and then we must give such an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating Sense to that which seems to contradict it, that so we may reconcile those together. Here then are two seeming Contradictions in our Constitution: The one is the <hi>Publick Liberty</hi> of the Nation; the other is the Renoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Words. Therefore since the chief Design of our whole Law, and of all the several Rules of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, is to Secure and Maintain our <hi>Liberty,</hi> we ought to lay that down for a Conclusion, that it is both the most Plain, and the most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant of the two: And therefore the other Article against <hi>Resistance</hi> ought to be so softned, as that it do not destroy this.—Thus he.</q>

               <p>That some few of them did afterward go back and grow stiff, is nothing to the purpose; for as that uncertainty of Conduct in them could not abate the <hi>Validity</hi> and <hi>Legality</hi> of the Present Established Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, so neither could it clear them of having that (<hi>viz.</hi> Resistance) in <hi>Principle,</hi> which some did first practise and then deny; and others in the same Communion did first deny, and then practise, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for which hath been, I think by both sides given.</p>

               <p>That [<hi>They</hi>] the <hi>Quakers,</hi> did act against the King, and join <hi>with all the Vsurpations upon him,</hi> from 1650, to 1660, is most notoriously false, for that there is not any Instance to be given of such, who after they became <hi>Quakers</hi> did so <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Join.</hi> But the Charge is as well Malicious as False, for there were but few <hi>Quakers</hi> in the Year 1650. And <hi>E. B.</hi> Dating his Epist. (Prefixt to <hi>G.

               </p>
               <p>'Tis false, they (the <hi>Quakers</hi>) did not approve the putting the King to Death, neither were they a gathered People when that was done; nor did they ever Glory in it, tho' sometimes they had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to mention it to those who came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into Power, by way of caution and warning to them, not of Exprobation to the former.

<q>Though His Majesty, as a Dutiful Son, be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Honour the Memory of his Royal Father, and have in Estimation the Person of his Mother, yet doth he desire to be deeply humbled and afflicted in Spirit before God, because of His Father's heakning to Evil Councils, and his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Work of Reformation, and to the Solemn League and Covenant, by which so much of the Blood of the Lord's People hath been Shed in these Kingdoms, and for the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of his Mother. —</q>

there <hi>Craves Pardon,</hi> as he says himself. But in the Language of the <hi>Snake,</hi> thus to object Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness to his <hi>Father's House,</hi> and to remember the the Judgments that came upon it, because of the above-said Evils, is to <hi>approve</hi> of the <hi>Murther</hi> of His <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Glory in it.</hi> I question not but the Sober Reader, will have another sense of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for that, remembrances of the Evils that have befallen Princes, and denunciations of Evils that should befall them because of iniquity, are most frequent in the Prophets, of which I shall have occasion to mention some: And here it may be fit to ask the <hi>Snake,</hi> whether <hi>Elisha</hi> the Holy Prophet did <hi>Approve of,</hi> and <hi>Glory in</hi> the <hi>Murther</hi> of <hi>Ben-hadad,</hi> King of <hi>Aram,</hi> when he told <hi>Hazael</hi> the King's Servant, who did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards commit the Murther, 2 Kings 8.10. —<hi>Go and say unto him, thou shalt recover</hi>; howbeit <hi>the Lord hath shewed me he shall surely Die.</hi>

               <p>If by the [they] the <hi>Snake</hi> speaks of, he means the Church he claims Membership in: It is then too true, that <hi>they Fought, as</hi> Rome, <hi>with Double Arms; viz.

But if by [<hi>they</hi>] he means [<hi>they</hi>] the <hi>Quakers</hi>; it is notoriously false, as hereafter in his particular Instances will be found.</p>

He leaves out all the Explanatory Part, and gives the rest by piece-meal; yet not, but under the direction and explanation of his Perverse Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <hi>i. e</hi>'s: In which, whether he has done justice to <hi>E.

The words are as follows.</p>
               <p>Thus saith the Lord,
<q>My Controversie is against you, even my Hand in Judgment is upon you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and you are become cursed in all your Hatchings and Endeavours; and from time to time my Hand hath been against you in Battle, and you have been, and are given up as a Prey to your Enemies: for the purpose and intents of your Hearts have been known always to be against the Form of Truth, and much more against my Powerful Truth it self. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you attempted to <hi>take my Throne</hi> (Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science) therefore I rose in Fury against you, and will have War with all your Followers <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> for ever. And tho' my Hand hath been evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently against you, yet to this day you remain in Rebellion in your Minds, in <hi>hatching Murder and Cruelty</hi> in your wicked Hearts; and tho' your Kings, and Princes, and Nobles have been cut off in Wrath; and your cruel desperate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and Plots of Wickedness (conceived in your Cursed Womb) have been broken, and you cut short in your Desires, yet you repent not, nor will see how you are given to be a Curse and a Desolation, and a Prey in Houses, and Lands, and Persons, to them whom I raised


<pb n="330" facs="tcp:63041:177"/>
up against you, and gave Power over you, yet you are hardned, and your Cruelty in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of my Servants cannot be measured; where you have any Power, you smite with the Fist of Wickedness, and count it your Glory to despise my Name. In the Vallies of vain Hopes you feed, and on the Mountains of Foolish Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and conceive in your Cruel Womb of Tyranny the overthrow of the Nations, but in the bringing forth, your selves are overthrown, and it is not for well-doing that you suffer; but my Hand is against you, and my Judgments are upon you, and except you repent, shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue upon Earth with you, and follow you, and persue you to the Lake of Destruction, where there is no Repentance, and you, and your Kings and Lordly Power (by which you have thought to exercise Lordship over my Heritage) shall be enslaved by the Devil in the Pit of Darkness, in Everlasting Bondage, where he shall reign your King and Lord for evermore.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>E. B.</hi> who in this place does not otherwise speak, than against those same evil practices which King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, in the Declaration fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, did desire to be <hi>deeply humbled for</hi>; and by means of which the Judgments that did overtake were brought. And where <hi>E. B.</hi> saith, <hi>You are become cursed in all you</hi> Hatchings <hi>and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</hi> It was not as the <hi>Snake</hi> falsly Glosses with his (i. e. <hi>to Restore the King.</hi>) But as <hi>E. B.</hi> saith himself, <hi>because you have attempted to take my Throne, (Conscience.)</hi> And this is so true a saying, that all who shall attempt to take the <hi>Throne</hi> of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Consciences</hi> of Men, will sooner or later find, that those their attempts will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with manifest oppositions, and overthrow from the Hand of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:63041:177"/>But further, <hi>E. B.</hi> in this Book did not speak <hi>only</hi> or <hi>chiefly</hi> against the wickedness of that Party: No, but he also speaks against the same Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi>; and tells him as plainly from the Lord, <hi>Thou hast broken Truce with me, and now thou suffers grievous and Heinous Oppression and Cruelty:</hi> And to the <hi>Generals, Colonels</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> he speaks as plainly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Wickedness, and tells them, <hi>You are abundantly waxed fat, and exalted through Victories and Deliverances, and now you kick against the Lord that hath handled you as Instruments, in his Hand to do his Will; and many of you who have been raised out of the Dust, are set down in your high Nest of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, in the Lust, and Pride, and Filthiness of the Flesh.</hi> And in like manner he goes through many of the then Parties, into which the People were divided; and faithfully tells them their Trangres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and admonishes to Repentance, that so, their then impending Destruction (and which did come) might have been averted.</p>
               <p>And this is so far from being the effects of a <hi>Cursed Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Hellish Thundrings,</hi> and the <hi>opening of the Infernal Pit,</hi> that it hath many Examples in Holy Writ, in which, God by his Prophets hath denounced and foretold grievous Desolations and Destruction which should come because of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression. Thus the Prophet Amos 8.11. Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am <hi>shall die by the Sword, and</hi> Israel <hi>shall be led away Captive out of their own Land.</hi> And the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he met with, was much such as the <hi>Snake</hi> gives; for we read in the 10th vers. <hi>Then</hi> Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah, <hi>the Priest of</hi> Bethel, <hi>sent to</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>King of</hi> Israel, <hi>saying,</hi> Amos <hi>hath conspired against thee in the midst of the House of</hi> Israel; <hi>the Land is not able to bear all his words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:63041:178"/>Thus <hi>Amaziah,</hi> and our <hi>Snake,</hi> are of the same Mind, who, when a Prophet from the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his Will concerning the Disobedient; these will have such a Prophet to <hi>Approve</hi> of, and <hi>Glory</hi> in their Destruction. Which horrid Imputation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not appear in any thing to be more false, than that these same Men, with many of the Prophets of the Lord, who have been concerned in like Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, have called, in the Word of the Lord, to Repentance and Amendment, by which the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Judgments, that they foretold should come might have been turned away; and that there was need of Repentance. King <hi>Charles</hi> in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before-mentioned, has abundantly testified; but of that I care not to be more large at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 208. next carps at a Book Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Good Council and Advice</hi> (but mentions no more of the Title, lest it should betray and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the purpose he quotes it for, and testifie that the Writers of it were true Prophets, it is thus,) <hi>Rejected by Disobedient Men. And the days of</hi> Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cromwell<hi>'s Visitation passed over, and also of</hi> Richard Cromwell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Printed 1659. From which Book, p. 27, 36. the <hi>Snakes</hi> quotes thus, and begins, Oh Oliver, <hi>arise and come out</hi>; which is an abuse and false Quotation; for these words in that Book do stand twelve Lines assunder, and begins thus, <hi>Oh,</hi> Oliver! <hi>hadst thou been Faithful?</hi>—</p>
               <p>And of this the <hi>Snake</hi> declares <hi>they did</hi> (blow the Trumpet) <hi>to</hi> Oliver <hi>effectually.</hi> But it is very false, for from the Title of the Book, <hi>(their Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation passed over)</hi> and from the event, <hi>viz. Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>'s Death, and <hi>Richard</hi>'s being Cast out, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears otherwise.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 208. <hi>And he further charges</hi> Oliver, <hi>not to turn</hi> Sober Men, <hi>and</hi> True Hearts <hi>out of his Army.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:63041:178"/>And a very good Charge it was.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>So it seems they esteem'd Fighting a</hi> Lawful, <hi>and a</hi> Good <hi>Thing, (in a</hi> Good Cause) <hi>because they thought it consistent with</hi> Sober Men, <hi>and</hi> True Hearts.</p>
               <p>According to what I have before observed, p. 138. God not having disarmed himself of the <hi>Outward Sword,</hi> he may, and often hath, for <hi>Causes</hi> seeming <hi>Good</hi> in his Sight, put the Sword into the Hands of such, whom he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the Ministers of his Anger against wicked Men; and among these his Ministers, we believe there very often is, and hath been <hi>Sober Men</hi> and <hi>True Hearts</hi>; according to those Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of the Will of God which they have had. And this we also know, that if <hi>Sober Men</hi> and <hi>True Hearts,</hi> who have been raised up by the Lord, and made Instrumental in his Hand, by the outward Sword to Castise His, and His Peoples Enemies, do humbly wait upon God to have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discoveries of his Will, and thereby come into greater degrees of Obedience to the Holy Spirit of Christ, the Peaceable Saviour; they may at length come to see, concerning them against whom God raised them up, as <hi>Joshua,</hi> in the word of the Lord, recounts to <hi>Israel</hi> concerning their Enemies, Jos. 24.12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>And I sent Hornets before you, which cast them out before you, even the two Kings of the</hi> Amorites, <hi>and not with thy Sword, nor thy Bow.</hi> For it is certainly true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 209. <hi>But since</hi> 1660. <hi>it is an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before and since 1660, even ever since we were a People, it hath been our Principle and Practice, not to use the outward Sword.</p>

               <p>Our <hi>Yearly Meeting</hi> did never give forth any <hi>Commands</hi>; but in Brotherly sort hath caution'd against those things which are not consistent with our Holy Profession, of which this is one.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 209. <hi>They presented</hi> G.

               <p>That it was not <hi>Because</hi> he <hi>Queried,</hi> &amp;c. (as the <hi>Snake</hi> falsly says) he was presented; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his indecent and tumultuary Behaviour, the Declaration of the Sessions it self will best shew, which I shall here quote from S.

<q>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the undeceiving of all People, we have thought fit by this Publick Writing, not only to signify that our Procedure against the Persons now in the Sheriffs Custody, as well as what we intend against others concerned, (in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place) respects only that part of the said Printed Sheet (viz. <hi>The Appeal</hi>) which appears to have the tendency aforesaid, (that is, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Disturbance, Subversion of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or aspersing the Magistrates) and not


<pb n="335" facs="tcp:63041:179"/>
any part relating to Difference in Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—</q>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 210. <hi>But it is plain, that they are not against</hi> Force of Arms, <hi>when they like the Quarrel; for they did not only encourage</hi> Oliver, <hi>&amp;c. but they fought themselves against the King, if you will believe</hi> G. F. <hi>who — complains of many</hi> Quakers <hi>being Disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the</hi> Army, <hi>and that for being</hi> Quakers, <hi>tho' they were good</hi> Fighters.</p>
               <p>It is false, <hi>G. F.</hi> does not complain that any <hi>Quakers</hi> were <hi>disbanded</hi>; much less that they were <hi>disbanded for being</hi> Quakers: That which <hi>G. F.</hi> does here complain of, is the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Haughtiness</hi> of them to whom he writ; and as an instance of their Apostacy, from that tenderness towards Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Conscientious People, which they once did profess to have: He says thus, p. 5. <hi>To the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Officers of the Army, and the Heads of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>Many Justices of the Peace (faithful to the Lord God, to serve him in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to keep Peace, to do the thing that is Just, and to keep down the Unruly and Rude) you have put out, whereby you have been the cause of letting all the Bruits upon them, that matters not Religion nor Law: That these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been in many Places, as though there were neither Law, Government, Teachers nor Ministers, as tho' they never had God nor Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures taught among them. And <hi>(Here the</hi> Snake <hi>begins his Quotation)</hi> many Valiant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Soldiers, and Officers have been put out of the Army, (by Sea and Land) of whom it hath been said among you, That they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have had one of them, than seven Men, and could have turned one to seven Men; who, because of their <hi>faithfulness to the Lord God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faithful towards him; it may be for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Thou</hi> to a Particular, and for <hi>wearing their


<pb n="336" facs="tcp:63041:180"/>
Hats,</hi> have been turned out from amongst you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s remark upon this, is (p. 211.) <hi>Here it is plain, that they were</hi> Quakers, <hi>while they were in the Army, because by this they were turn'd off for being</hi> Quakers, <hi>for saying</hi> Thee, <hi>and not taking off their</hi> Hats.</p>
               <p>And is it not <hi>here</hi> as plain, that they were <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> while in Commissions of the Peace? But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them is plain, as in the <hi>Snake</hi>'s manner of suggesting. Yet this is plain from the true natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meaning of the Words, That as there then was an Apostacy in the <hi>Council of Officers,</hi> &amp;c. from their first Religious Tenderness, so there also was an encrease of that Religious Tenderness in the Hearts of many, who in their Commissions of the Peace, had well discharged their Duty: And others, who in their Martial Affairs had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven proof of their Valour: And some of both these, had their Understandings so far opened, as to see the Vanity and Evil, of respecting Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with <hi>Tongue</hi> or <hi>Hat</hi>; tho such were not come so far as to see the evil of, and deny, <hi>Fighting</hi>; yet they forthwith turned them out. And if they were obedient to the Manifestation of God, in these smaller things, yet they were not therefore <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The noted <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> who never was, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be a <hi>Quaker,</hi> refused from a Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Tenderness to put off the Hat to <hi>Cromwell. R. Eccleston</hi> used the plain Language to <hi>Oliver,</hi> and was no <hi>Quaker,</hi> and very many, besides <hi>Quakers,</hi> use the plain Language. And therefore when <hi>G. F.</hi> says, p. 6. as quoted by the <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 211.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oh! How are Men fallen from that which they were at first, when Thousands of</hi> Us <hi>went in the front of you,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:63041:180"/>He does not; nay, it was impossible he should mean in them words [<hi>Thousands of us</hi>] Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of <hi>Quakers:</hi> Because at the first of the War, which is the time he speaks of, which was 1642. there was no such thing as a <hi>Quaker</hi> spoke of, or heard of, for he (who is willing, on this occasion to make us as old as he can) dates the first Rise of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> 1650. therefore they could not be <hi>Quakers,</hi> that then went in the Front of the Army.</p>
               <p>Tho' 'tis true that many of Them, that at the <hi>First</hi> ingaged in that cause, and were forward and zealous in it, did afterwards come to be of <hi>Vs</hi>; and so did some also that fought for the King, and were as forward and bold in his Cause. But as they came to be really of us, they left off to Fight with Carnal Weapons, as <hi>George Fox</hi> does plainly shew in the very next lines to those last Quoted by the <hi>Snake,</hi> and which he maliciously left out, they are these, p. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Oh! The Lord's Truth, the Lord's Power, and the Lord's Arm is more dear to us than all who, are not sat down in the Spoil of our Enemies, who are come to the Lord, who hath given us Victory, and hath brought us to the Light that takes away the occasion and root of Wars.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>G. F.</hi> shews plainly, that those whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings God had opened, and did grow up in Obedience to the Manifestations of God to them; they did according to their gradual growth in his Grace, first leave off one thing, and then another: And thus God discover'd his Will to Men, not all at once, that they might not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scouraged with the sight of too much work, or too great difficulty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:63041:181"/>Thus they refused first to <hi>set down in the Spoils,</hi> to pull off their <hi>Hats,</hi> or to use other than the <hi>plain Language:</hi> And this their Conscientious Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, tho' despised by Men, as they did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in it, it did please God to open their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings to see and know the peaceable Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Gospel of Christ. And by giving them Victory over their Sins, did bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; whereby they could at last say, <hi>The Lord hath given us Victory, and hath brought us to the Light that takes away the Occasion and Root of Wars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed so it is; for as many as through the coming of our Lord Jesus, by his Spirit in their Hearts, do witness their Spirits to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to him, <hi>So as not to be Angry with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Not to resist Evil, and to Love Enemies</hi>; do know the Root and Occasion of Wars taken away.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 211. <hi>But if you would know in whom they make it unlawful to use the Sword, he tells</hi> p. 4. <hi>where he threatens that God</hi> will overturn the World, and all the Powers of the Earth, and all Sword-men that be not in his Power: <hi>That is, the King and the Cavaliers, whom they damn to the Pit of Hell, as I have shewn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou wouldst know the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Adversaries Injustice, Perversion and Falshood, please to consider <hi>G. F</hi>'s words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately foregoing, these last quoted by the <hi>Snake,</hi> they are these,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Lord is risen, who will plead the cause of the Innocent, not by</hi> Sword, <hi>nor by</hi> Spear, <hi>but by his Power in which he will overturn the World,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What plainer Testimony could a Man give, against his dependence upon an Arm of Flesh, and his deliverance by it. But further, to shew the


<pb n="339" facs="tcp:63041:181"/>
foolish Malice of the <hi>Snake</hi> in this false suggestion; it could not be the <hi>King and Cavaliers</hi> that <hi>G. F.</hi> meant in those words [and all Sword-men that be not in his Power] because this was printed in 1659. and they were overthrown before that. But the <hi>Sword-men</hi> here mentioned, were those <hi>G. F.</hi> then wrote to, who had once felt and known some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Power of God with them, but were then departed from it.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>So that instead of their disowning the use of the</hi> Sword, <hi>their true meaning is, that none have a right to it but themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon all the foregoing, the inference is Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and without all ground: There is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Sentence of <hi>Vs</hi> or the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or that the threatned overturn should be wrought by them; nay, expresly the contrary, <hi>not by Sword, nor by Spear</hi>: And God, as he pleases, can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn without the <hi>Sword,</hi> as well as with the <hi>Sword:</hi> And the <hi>overturn</hi> here threatned, is not by <hi>Sword-men,</hi> but of <hi>Sword-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 212. The <hi>Snake</hi> hath here injuriously made a Quotation, from, <hi>A Declaration of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called</hi> Quakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by leaving out the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate lines, which are expressive of the sense of his whole Quotation; and which are as opposite, to the Gloss the <hi>Snake</hi> puts on them, as can be. After his Quotation from the Tract above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, he saith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is plain Language, they will not</hi> yet <hi>take Arms, nor</hi> for the present, <hi>not till they see their time. But they have entered a Caveat, to secure their Right and Title to it, till they think sit to set up their Claim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> Language, in this place <hi>is plain Language,</hi> is very true, and therefore so much the greater is the fault of the <hi>Snake,</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting


<pb n="340" facs="tcp:63041:182"/>
to a wrong sense, what <hi>E. B.</hi> has delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red so plainly, as these his words, which the <hi>Snake</hi> hath left out in the Quotation, does shew, p. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> yet <hi>his Kingdom is not of this World, neither is his Warfare with Carnal Weapons, neither is his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory by the Murdering and Killing of Mens Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, neither hath he Chosen us for that end, neither can we</hi> yet <hi>believe he will make use of</hi> us <hi>in that Way,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is indeed such <hi>plain Language,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>plain Malice</hi> could have perverted: And tho' the <hi>Snake</hi> pleases himself by playing upon the words, <hi>yet</hi> and <hi>for the present,</hi> and would base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly insinuate them to be <hi>a Caveat entered,</hi> &amp;c. they are no such thing.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>First,</hi> the word <hi>yet</hi> is not always an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb of time, as in the words above, it appears it is not; for so would they absolutely destroy each other (and the <hi>Snake</hi> don't seem inclin'd, that the last words should, for if they be, then his pretence of their being <hi>a Caveat</hi> will necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanish) and [<hi>yet</hi>] before [<hi>His Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.] cannot possibly relate to <hi>Time,</hi> because our Saviour hath assured us, without all bound of <hi>Time; My Kingdom is not of this World:</hi> And by the way it is worth observing, that our Saviour gives that as the reason, why his Servants could not Fight, <hi>John</hi> 18.36. now this reason must always continue, and the Kingdom of God (in the sense which our Saviour speaks it) can never be of this World, for that as the Apostle says, <hi>It is Enmity with God</hi>; therefore can his Servants not Fight: and <hi>E. B.</hi> hath said expresly, <hi>Neither hath he chosen us for that end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Those words [<hi>for the Present</hi>] on which the <hi>Snake</hi> does with equal Malice and Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood insult, have no Relation to <hi>Fighting,</hi> but to


<pb n="341" facs="tcp:63041:182"/>
                  <hi>Suffering,</hi> under which many of our Friends then were; and as the words immediately following, those quoted by the <hi>Snake</hi> do shew, they are these.</p>
               <p>P. 9.
<q>But for the present, we are given up to Bear and Suffer all things for his name sake; and our present glory and renown therein stands, till the appointed time of our Deliverance, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> the <hi>Arm of Flesh,</hi> or any Multitude of an <hi>Host of Men,</hi> this we declare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>What more notorious and wilful Perversion could an Adversary be guilty of, than to suggest, and pervert, the meaning of these words, to be the <hi>Entering a Caveat, to secure a Right and Title to take Arms?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What follows, p. 213, 214. Is already reply'd to, and therefore shall not repeat the Answer, tho' the <hi>Snake</hi> does the Objection. It is with him an easie way of making a great Bulk of Charge and Slander; but tho repeated a Thousand times over, it is of no weight, when refuted in the first Instances as these have been; and now the <hi>Snake</hi> labouring in that Mine of Lyes his Brain, has met with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which in p. 215. he calls a <hi>Material Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi> He expresseth it thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Because the</hi> Quakers, <hi>since</hi> 1660. <hi>would make us believe, that they had been Loyal in the Rebellion of</hi> 41. <hi>and the Reason they give is, their Sufferings under those Vsurpers. But here it is plain, that their Sufferings were not for their Loyalty to the King, but for their Principles destructive to all Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here, Reader, is (to use the <hi>Snake</hi>'s expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) a <hi>Material Discovery</hi> of the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Lying Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; for in p. 329. foregoing, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served him saying, that we <hi>joyned with all the Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:63041:183"/>And here he gives as a reason for our Sufferings under them, that our <hi>Principles are destructive to all Government.</hi> How then could we <hi>Joyn with them,</hi> that we were destructive too? Or if we were not destructive to them, How could we <hi>Joyn with them,</hi> at the same time when we suffered under them all? No, it was impossible, it could not be; nor did we ever so <hi>Joyn with them.</hi> For evidence of this, take <hi>E. B</hi>'s own words in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> &amp;c. fore-quoted; where he saith, p. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither are we for one Party or another, nor do we side with one sort, and rebel against another, neither do we joyn our selves to this sort or the other, nor do we War against any by Carnal Weapons; neither shall we ever provoke the Nation against us, otherwise than by our Righteous and Holy Walking,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This our Testimony, published 1659. had it been false, could then have been easily detected and refuted, but no such thing we ever heard of then: But this <hi>Snake</hi> now will have, that the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> did <hi>Rebel,</hi> did <hi>Joyn with Vsurpers,</hi> and <hi>Fight against the King,</hi> tho' the contrary is most true, as is above testified by <hi>E. B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have for the present done with <hi>Edward Burroughs,</hi> and now the <hi>Snake</hi> turns to <hi>Francis How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill,</hi> in a Book of his, called, <hi>An Information, and also Advice to the Army,</hi> &amp;c. printed 1659. from p. 7. of which Book, the <hi>Snake</hi> in p. 216. quotes, <hi>Them who were your real Friends, called</hi> Quakers, <hi>who gave you and the Army Intelligence about the late Insurrection,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This</hi> the <hi>Snake</hi> gives for proof that <hi>They</hi> (the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers) <hi>held out against the King to the very last, and that not only in</hi> Talking, Writing <hi>and</hi> Fighting, <hi>but in</hi> Watching, Discovering <hi>and</hi> Betraying.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:63041:183"/>And if this be proof sufficient for all this, then it may be also proof sufficient, that the Priests did to the last <hi>hold out against the King,</hi> &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that some of them did upon that Insurrection come up, and acquaint the House with the same thing, and declared they had not <hi>engaged with the rest of their Brethren</hi> (Priests) <hi>in</hi> Cheshire <hi>and</hi> Lancashire, and they had thanks con'd them for their pains: But this, tho' mentioned in the same page, from which he takes the foregoing Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the <hi>Snake</hi> takes no notice; but when the <hi>Quakers</hi> gave Information to the House, (as <hi>F. H.</hi> says) that they were <hi>Spoiled of their Goods and Horses to a great Value:</hi> Oh! This is a great Crime, this is <hi>Watching, Discovering</hi> and <hi>Betraying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 217. <hi>And as the King deviated, so (says he) the Parliament deviated; and thereby Justifies the Committee of Safety against the Parliament. And so every thing that is uppermost to the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They too have stumbled upon the Doctrine of Success!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No such matter, we have not so <hi>stumbled</hi>; for tho' we know that God can, and will, bring his own works to pass; and he will cause to succeed that Work which he doth appoint. Yet every matter which doth succeed according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of those who are Instrumental in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing of it, is not therefore approved of God.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Deviating</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> I need not trouble my self to say more than what his Son, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second hath declared in his Declaration, from <hi>Dunfirmling,</hi> before quoted, p. 327. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.
<q>Tho' his Majesty, as a Dutiful Son, be obliged to Honour the Memory of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Father, and have in Estimation the Person


<pb n="344" facs="tcp:63041:184"/>
of his Mother: Yet doth he desire to be deeply humbled and afflicted in Spirit before God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his Father's hearkning to, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil Councels, and his Opposition to the work of Reformation, and to the Solemn League and Covenant, by which so much of the Blood of the Lord's People hath been shed in these Kingdoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> —</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now if the <hi>Snake</hi> will answer this <hi>Declaration,</hi> and shew that the King did not <hi>Deviate,</hi> I shall not engage to reply to it, no more than the <hi>Snake</hi> would to those Tracts of the Royallists; which do affirm, that that <hi>Parliament deviated:</hi> As they are <hi>Questions</hi> which concern us not in our private Capacities; so I shall not pretend to meddle in them further, than under the good Authority of what is given under the Hand of a <hi>King,</hi> as is the Testimony above: And in this I had been wholly silent, had not the necessity of shewing, that the <hi>Snake</hi> had no cause to Cavil and Misrepresent <hi>Francis Howgill,</hi> for using the word <hi>Deviate,</hi> while there was such publick Allegations of it. For with respect to <hi>States,</hi> and the unhappy differences which have sometimes happened in them, we do continue to say with <hi>Edward Burroughs,</hi> as before quoted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither are we for one Party or another, nor do we side with one sort, and rebel against another, neither do we joyn our selves to this sort or the other, nor do we War against any by Carnal Weapons, neither shall we over provoke the Nation against us, otherwise than by our Righteous and Holy Walking,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But now we come to a very Grievous Charge, which the <hi>Snake</hi> in his Romantick Method, calls p. 219. <hi>A formal Association, the</hi> Quaker <hi>Solemn League and Covenant, wherein they bind themselves, under their Hands, their Lives and Estates, to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate


<pb n="3 4" facs="tcp:63041:184"/>
the Church, and the Laws and Government which support it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Which most Scandalous and <hi>Impudent</hi> Assertion, will vanish, when I shall have Informed my <hi>Reader,</hi> both of the Nature of that which he so Intitles, and the Ground and Occasion of it, which are briefly these.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1659, the then <hi>Parliament</hi> had, among other things under their Debate, <hi>The Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Church-Ministers</hi>: And upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, there were different Endeavours of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this Question, according to their different Liking and Belief, by Petitioning, by Remonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or otherwise; for it being a Question then handled <hi>de novo,</hi> as to the manner of their Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, it appears each side did suppose they had an equal Right to express their Sense of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to endeavour their ease and safety in the Conclusion of it. And when for this purpose the <hi>Clergy,</hi> &amp;c. found themselves so nearly concern'd, as to procure and send up <hi>Petitions</hi> in the Name of <hi>Six Thousand, or more,</hi> to pray <hi>The Parliaments</hi> Establishment of Tythes, and had thus lead the way, by <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> into <hi>a Formal Association,</hi> as the <hi>Snake</hi> will have it, then others found it their Season to Remonstrate the contrary, and to shew that great <hi>Spoil</hi> and <hi>Havock,</hi> that had been made by the <hi>Clergy</hi> upon their Conscientious Neighbours, and particularly by Means of an Act which they had before obtain'd for the Recovering of <hi>Treble-Damages</hi> (for they love an abundance) upon the Refusers of them. And under that grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Oppression, the Women who did find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves included in their several Capacities, did speak their Sentiments of the Matter then in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. Some might be sensible of the Oppression in their own Persons, others, as Wives of those who


<pb n="346" facs="tcp:63041:185"/>
did so; and some as the Children of Parents whose Estates were impaired by that means; and as Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, they from their several Counties did send to the Parliament. And if a Petition from <hi>Six Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, or more Men,</hi> might then be offer'd, as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why that <hi>Parliament</hi> should determine the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to their Sense, Pray, why might not the like be offer'd from <hi>Seven Thousand, or more Women,</hi> shewing their past Grievous Sufferings, which they, or some of them had lain under? and therefore desire that the Question might be determin'd to their future ease.</p>
               <p>This Reader, is what the <hi>Snake</hi> calls <hi>a Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> but that it's vastly differing in Nature from that which his Country afforded, the fore-going brief Account does truly shew. And as it was no such <hi>Association</hi> as this <hi>Adversary</hi> doth falsly Suggest, so neither was it in its Nature or Terms binding <hi>under their Hands, Lives and Estates, to Extirpate the Church, and the Laws, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c. For while a Question is yet <hi>undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,</hi> and is under the Cognisance of Superiours (as this then was) I cannot see that they who Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition against it, do more <hi>bind themselves, Lives and Estates,</hi> to Extirpate the <hi>Laws,</hi> &amp;c. than they who Petition that that might be Enacted (<hi>viz.</hi> the Establishment of Tythes) which was then a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether it should be so or not.</p>
               <p>But that these Papers Subscribed by the Women were an <hi>Association,</hi> for the <hi>Extirpating</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> the <hi>Snake</hi> gives himself the Lye; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were delivered to those, whom I doubt not, he will acknowledge were <hi>Vsurpers:</hi> And he hath said, as I have observed, P. 326. fore-going, that we <hi>Joined with all the Vsurpations from</hi> our <hi>first Rise.</hi> And I think they give no great mark of <hi>Joyning</hi> with a Usurpation, who <hi>bind themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der


<pb n="347" facs="tcp:63041:185"/>
their Hands, Lives, and Estates to Extirpate it.</hi> Yet thus Contradictory is the <hi>Snake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. P. 220. <hi>They Exult, That</hi> Strafford<hi>'s Head was cut off, and</hi> Canterbury<hi>'s, and</hi> Charles Stuart<hi>'s, as Traytors, for endeavouring to Subvert the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws.</hi> For these, and many more Scraps, pick'd here and there a Line, he quotes <hi>The West Answering the North,</hi> Printed 1657.</p>
               <p>But that there is no such <hi>Exulting</hi> as the <hi>Snake</hi> does Suggest, will soon appear, both from the Form and Occasion of the Words.</p>
               <p>First to the Occasion: This Book <hi>West Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the North,</hi> was Writ to lay open the Illegal Practices, and Grievous Persecutions which some then in Authority did do and use, against many of our Friends in the Counties of <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire</hi> (which was by the way no Mark of Joyning with them) as other Books Writ about that time do abundantly testifie of the like evil Practices in other Counties. And that they might the more effectually Convince their Persecutors of the wrong they then did them, they Expostulate with them, P. 78, 79. concerning the Pretences on which these their Persecutors had proceeded against others, for what they called <hi>Arbitrary Actings,</hi> while they themselves were then found in Practices not less Arbitrary and Illegal. The Words are these:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>To what purpose have been the Hangings by the Neck, the Cuttings of the Throat at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> the Imprisonments, Confiscation of Estates, and other exemplary Punishments executed on <hi>Judges,</hi> Justices, and Ministers of State, for Arbitrary Acting, of which the Records of this Nation speak? Why was <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Head cut off, and <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s, and <hi>Charles Stuart</hi>'s, as Traitors, for Endeavouring to Subvert the Fundamental


<pb n="348" facs="tcp:63041:186"/>
Laws of <hi>England</hi>; and what Justice was there in all these, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This, it's plain, is not <hi>Exulting,</hi> but <hi>Quaerying</hi>; not Praising, but Questioning; yet the <hi>Snake</hi> by his Art in Splitting Sentences, puts it in another face than this its true one.</p>
               <p>Another Instance the <hi>Snake</hi> quotes, p. 221. from the Book aforesaid, p. 96. <hi>Multitudes of People flock'd up out of the City to</hi> Westminster, <hi>to complain of their Sufferings, which</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>call'd Tumults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the place as it lies in that Book is thus: <hi>In the beginning of the Long Parliament some such thing (viz. Guards) was set at</hi> White-hall-gate, <hi>to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>er the Multitudes of People which flock'd up out of the City to</hi> Westminster, <hi>to Complain of their Sufferings by the Bishops, and Oppressions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The last Words it seems the <hi>Snake</hi> would have kept <hi>under the Thumb,</hi> and by no means have it known, that the cause why the People then flock'd to <hi>Westminster,</hi> was their <hi>Oppression</hi> and <hi>Suffering</hi> by <hi>Bishops.</hi> No, by no means; the <hi>Snake</hi> can much more willingly have it known, that King <hi>Charles</hi> the First was counted faulty, than that those <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> should stand Recorded for <hi>Oppressors</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors.</hi> This must not be Published in <hi>Gath</hi>; nor had I now reviv'd it in this Instance, but to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the Injustice and Falshood of this Partial Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary.</p>
               <p>I come now to a Book, Entituled, <hi>Several Papers given forth by</hi> G. Fox, Printed 1660. From which the <hi>Snake</hi> in the same manner, as from the last quoted, gives many Scraps of Quotations, with purpose that they may Answer the <hi>Title</hi> of this <hi>Section</hi>; and to prove his Solecism, <hi>That</hi> all <hi>their Fighting has been chiefly against the King.</hi> But alas! his base and nasty practice of Splitting Sentences,


<pb n="349" facs="tcp:63041:186"/>
Curtailing Periods, and Perverting the Sense, Scope, and Purport of them, will never be able effectually to do it; as, who shall read the Pages referr'd to by him, <hi>viz.</hi> p. 8, 9, 12, 15, 16. and from which, in an interwoven manner, he hath plac'd the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bits he picks, will more fully see: I omit to Transcribe them, for Brevity; but their Purport is this: <hi>George Fox</hi> does in those Papers (which were Writ long before the King's Restauration, though not Printed till the Year before) fore-warn and reprehend those who would have Constituted and Set Up an <hi>Oppressing King,</hi> which it was fear'd some in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Days would have done, thereby to Establish and Impose their Religion upon the Nation, contrary to their former great Pretence to the Headship and Kingship of Jesus Christ over the Church: And thus much, as it hath the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Example of Precedent from Holy Writ, so neither was it any <hi>Fighting</hi> against the King.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Jews,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.5. would have a <hi>King to Judge them, like all the Nations</hi>; it is said in the very next Verse (according to the <hi>Hebrew) It was evil in the eyes of Samuel</hi>; yet <hi>Samuel</hi> was not therefore accused of <hi>Fighting</hi> against him whom <hi>God in anger</hi> gave them, to be their King. <hi>Samuel</hi> had a sight of that Declension which was in the <hi>Jews,</hi> contrary to their former Practices in this their desire; that <hi>displeased</hi> him, and <hi>seemed evil unto him,</hi> in that there should be such Declension in them. Thus some there were, who once had some beginnings of the Work of God in their Hearts, and while they continued under that Sense, were willing that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> should have his proper Headship and Government in his <hi>Church</hi>; and that all should be persuaded in their own Minds, in the Exercise of their Religious Worship towards God. But having declined from this, they were endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring


<pb n="350" facs="tcp:63041:187"/>
to set up the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> a Governour and Government, by which they might impose upon those, with whom they had formerly Unity, as relating to the Freedom of the Conscience. Against this it is <hi>G. Fox,</hi> in those Papers speaks, which shews the <hi>Snake,</hi> in his scornful Flout, p. 223. <hi>Alas! wretched</hi> George; <hi>now must all Men know, that thou, even thou thy self, didst quench the Spirit, and deny the Light,</hi> &amp;c. does of none speak so properly, as of himself; concerning whom all Men that read him, <hi>must know,</hi> by this his Falshood and Malice, that he does <hi>quench the Spirit, and deny the Light,</hi> which will further appear in the falsity of his saying.</p>
               <p>P. 223. <hi>Thee</hi> (G. F.) <hi>didst Change, just as the times did Change, and just as soon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Instance which the <hi>Snake</hi> gives, that <hi>G. F.</hi> did so Change, is a <hi>Declaration</hi> which he with other of our Friends did give unto the King at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration, importing their <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Fidelity</hi> to him: 'Tis thus Entituled, <hi>A Declaration and an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, from us the People of God, called</hi> Quakers, <hi>To the Present Governours, the King, and both Houses of Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. And was delivered to the <hi>King,</hi> the 22 Day of the fourth Month, 1660. From p. 4. of this <hi>Declaration,</hi> the <hi>Snake</hi> p. 224. quotes thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We therefore Declare, to take off all Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, Fears and Suspicions, of our Truth and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to the King, and these present Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, That our Intentions and Endeavours are and shall be Good, True, Honest and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able towards them, and that we do Love, Own, and Honour the King, and these present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, (what follows the <hi>Snake</hi> has cut off) so far as they do Rule for God and his Truth, and do not impose any thing upon Peoples Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,


<pb n="351" facs="tcp:63041:187"/>
but let the Gospel have its free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage through the Consciences of Men, which we do not know that they have, by any Law, as yet imposed: And if they Grant Liberty of Conscience towards God and towards Man, then we know that God will bless them. —</q>
               </p>
               <p>So that the ground of that <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> which our Friends did then profess to have for that Government, was their <hi>Ruling for God, and his Truth, and not impposing upon the Consciences of Men.</hi> And I must needs say, that there never was any Governours in the World, who have so <hi>Ruled,</hi> but the People of God, in every Age, have <hi>lov'd</hi> and <hi>honour'd</hi> them, as they have been always <hi>True, Honest and Peaceable towards all</hi>; and must continue to be so through every Age of the World; and such Kings, Princes and Governments, God will bless.</p>
               <p>But in all this, where is the <hi>Change</hi> the <hi>Snake</hi> speaks of, who says, that we did <hi>Change just as the times did Change?</hi> Why indeed there is no such thing: For to all the Governments, since we have been a People, our <hi>Endeavours</hi> towards them, in much <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Fidelity</hi> have been, that they would <hi>Rule for God and his Truth, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any thing upon the Consciences of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Long Parliament (1652.) was warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Day, not to persecute; they not hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, their Power was taken from them.</p>
               <p>Thus the Council of State (1653.) was warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but hearkned not, and the Oppression was very great.</p>
               <p>Thus the Little Parliament in the same Year was warn'd, but they received from the Priests Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions against us, whereby Bondage and Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on continued, but They ended.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> (who in the same Year was made Protector) and instead of removing


<pb n="352" facs="tcp:63041:188"/>
Persecution, he caused new Acts to be made to persecute by, of which, he also was then warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>His Second Parliament, call'd in 1654. were also warned, but they going on in the same Road of Persecution, were soon stop'd and laid by.</p>
               <p>His Third Parliament in 1657. they also made Laws for Persecution, of which they also were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished, but they rejected, and they also were laid by.</p>
               <p>Thus also <hi>Richard Cromwell,</hi> who in 1658. was made Protector, was also warned; but no Redress ensued, for he, as those that went before him, harkned to the Numerous Petitions of the then Priesthood, for the enslaving of Conscience.</p>
               <p>His Parliament in 1659. continued the same Course, were warn'd but not hearkning, they were broken.</p>
               <p>In the same Year succeeded the Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who according to their very great Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for Liberty of Conscience, did set some free who were in great Sufferings for their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards God; but they continued not herein, of which they were warn'd, and laid by.</p>
               <p>In the same Year the Army and Council of State set up, but they not receiving, nor hearkning to the just desire of Freedom in matters of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God, were laid by.</p>
               <p>In the same Year the <hi>Long Parliament</hi> had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day; but the Fury of Oppression being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted among them, of which they being warn'd, and not hearkning, they were finally overthrown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> the Secluded Members, who brought on the Restauration of the King; as also the King and his Parliament were timely admonished; the first instance of which was, the Declaration lately spoken of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:63041:188"/>But here, <hi>Reader,</hi> it may be fit to remark to thee, that under all the several Changes before-mentioned, the Sufferings which our Friends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent in Name, Person and Estate, were very Great; for our Religious Meetings and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious Obedience to God, who hath called Us to be a People; which Sufferings might have been prevented, could we have <hi>joined with them,</hi> as the <hi>Snake</hi> hath falsly said we <hi>did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that we neither did, nor could do; but were under all of them a suffering People; who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were <hi>for one Party or another,</hi> nor sided with one Sort or <hi>another,</hi> nor rebell'd against any, being brought out of <hi>Warring</hi> (with <hi>Carnal Weapons</hi>;) to witness the Work of the Gospel of Peace, in which the Ground of all outward <hi>Wars</hi> is taken away.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Declaration above spoken of, the <hi>Snake</hi> says, p. 225. that there was great Opposition to the first Draught of it; because of the words <hi>Loyal Subjects.</hi> And the Opposition to these words he affirms to have been grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Conscienciousness of some then present; that they (the <hi>Quakers</hi>) had not been True and Faithful, which is a Gross Falshood. First from the Terms of the Declaration it self; for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in that, of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> are at least equally significant and expressive with the word [Loyal;] which word, it is possible might be opposed, as a new way of expressing our Constant Practice under all Governments. But if the word [Loyal] was opposed from a Consciousness to the contrary, it may not be amiss for the <hi>Snake</hi> to procure from his <hi>Informer</hi> (who at the time of the Drawing of this Declaration, did declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be one of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>) some Testimonial, that he the said <hi>Informant,</hi> whilst called


<pb n="354" facs="tcp:63041:189"/>
a <hi>Quaker</hi> (and owned by that People as such) was conscious to himself of <hi>Vntruth</hi> and <hi>Vnfaithfulness</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> or any of the former Governments; and give some Instances to corroborate that Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial; and then it may be allowed a degree of Credit in proportion to its Truth.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Snake</hi> comes off from this contending for the word [Loyal;] and in page 226. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>This contest about the word</hi> [Loyalty] <hi>was perfectly needless, since they suffer'd the words which I have quoted, to stand, viz.</hi> Truth <hi>and</hi> Fidelity <hi>to the King; for these imply all that</hi> Loyalty <hi>can mean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Contest about the word was needless, so also was the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Long Observation of near two pages upon it, more especially when it is consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he hath beat down all that he said before: For here he acknowledges that the words, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Fidelity mean all that</hi> [Loyalty] <hi>can:</hi> Very well; but then it is to be consider'd, that had <hi>E. Billing,</hi> (whom the <hi>Snake</hi> says, was one of open Sincerity and Courage) or others, who opposed the word [Loyal] known that themselves, with the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> had not been <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Faithful,</hi> which the <hi>Snake</hi> says, is all that [Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty] <hi>can mean</hi>; they ought as much to have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed them, as this. And had this been the cause why the word [Loyalty] was refused by <hi>E. Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> it could not consist with the Character which the <hi>Snake</hi> gives him of open <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> to have accepted the words <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Fidelity.</hi> So that let the matter be which it will, the <hi>Snake</hi> must still be a Liar.</p>
               <p>But he goes on in the same page, and says, <hi>They</hi> (the Quakers) <hi>had the Face to upbraid others for their Changing and Trimming. Hear the words of their Declaration</hi>; (that before mentioned) p. 6.
<q>And those Priests turn'd to every Power and


<pb n="355" facs="tcp:63041:189"/>
every Government, as it turned, and made Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, and Addresses, and Acknowledgments to every Change of Government, (what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, the <hi>Snake had the face</hi> to leave out) and conform'd to every Power, and shewed much Love and Zeal to every Present Power, for their own ends, tho' many of them were Instruments to throw others out: Yet through their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and Subtilties have kept themselves in, in all these <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Changes.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Now let any Honest Hearted People Judge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Conforming Deceit and Subtilty</hi> which was objected to those Priests, the <hi>Snake</hi> had the <hi>Face</hi> to leave out, least it should seem too sharp a <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon</hi> upon them: But this the Priests, who were then in being, could neither discharge themselves from, nor lay it upon the <hi>Quakers</hi>; though there was opportunity enough favourable for such an undertaking, could they have prov'd it.</p>
               <p>But to go on, the <hi>Snake</hi> says, and quotes from p. 8. They (the <hi>Quakers</hi>) tell the <hi>King, False Dealing we do utterly deny—and speak the Truth in Plainness and Singleness of Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But tho' he was willing so much shou'd be known, which is also a very great Truth, that we have towards all Governours <hi>utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied all Fase Dealing,</hi> and have dealt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and plainly with every one, without favour or partiality, reproving and blaming every one for their Faults, shewing every one their Dangers, and warning every one by the Fall of others that went before them, to beware of, shun and turn from those Evils which brought ruine upon the former. But they never joined with, fell in with, acted with, sought or accepted Places of Profit or Trust from any of them, which the Fawning Priests, and some Professors did; and therefore as


<pb n="356" facs="tcp:63041:190"/>
with very great Truth and Boldness they might, and did say, all that the <hi>Snake</hi> has quoted above: So with like Truth and Boldness they say more, which the <hi>Snake</hi> has cut out; least while he remember'd their Faithfulness, his relucting Mind should object his own past Treachery. The words as they stand in the place he quotes from, are these,
<q>Treason, Treachery and False Dealing we do utterly deny. False Dealing, Surmising, or Plotting against any Creature upon the Face of the Earth, and speak the Truth in plainness and singleness of Heart.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Snake</hi> could for himself, in truth say so much, it would be a brave Testimony.</p>
               <p>I come now to a Book of <hi>George Bishops,</hi> Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The Warnings of the Lord to the Men of this Generation,</hi> Printed 1660. Under the <hi>Title</hi> of which Book, because of Directions to two Places, at which it was then sold, the <hi>Snake</hi> says they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously spread their Treasons. But I would know of him, why a Warning to <hi>Peace, Love</hi> and <hi>Vnity,</hi> and Caution against <hi>Persecution,</hi> (and such this Book is) may not at least be disposed of at as many publick Places as his Defamatory Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, or as his Seditious ones was at private Places.</p>
               <p>But now from the Manner of its Disposal, we come to the Matter of the Book.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> begins with p. 27. of this Book, and quotes thus, p. 228. <hi>Beware of falling under this Spirit, or of thinking the Breach between you can be healed; for I declare it to you from the Lord, That it is irreconcileable, it cannot, it will not be healed.</hi>—</p>
               <p>Thus far the <hi>Snake</hi> quotes, and by a dash strikes out about three following Lines, which are these,
<q>Yea, the day will come, and now is, wherein it will be said, we would have healed <hi>Babylon,</hi> but she would not be healed; let us depart every one to his own place.</q>


                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:63041:190"/>
And now upon a Consideration of these Lines, what more can be the meaning, than that that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and distance, which was between the <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> of the <hi>Conquerors</hi> and <hi>Conquered,</hi> was irreconcileable? And the Breach of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was such, as could not be healed with the peaceable and quiet possession of those who were then uppermost (<hi>viz.</hi> in the Year 1659.) which some might then either foolishly hope or wish. But now the <hi>Snake,</hi> after his Dash, at which he left out the Lines above-mention'd, continues his Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus, <hi>Therefore in the Power and Dread of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, stand and bear over it, (viz.</hi> that Spirit of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution which would vainly hope a Reconciliation) <hi>Crush it to pieces,</hi> (for that <hi>Spirit</hi> of which <hi>G. Bishop</hi> is here speaking, had persecuted and afflicted, and in many ways made Men to suffer for their Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Consciences,) <hi>Stamp it to Powder,</hi> i. e, that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Persecution. But the Forgery of the <hi>Snake</hi> is remarkable here, for that after the words last above-quoted, he puts an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then goes on, as if what followed in his Quotation, did follow in the same order in the Book from which he quotes it, but it is far otherwise; for the Lines which he here makes to follow, do in that Book precede the beginning of his Quotation, eleven or twelve Lines; and by the like packing and transposing of Lines, which this <hi>Snake</hi> uses, a Man may make the <hi>Decalogue</hi> or the <hi>Lords-Prayer</hi> speak, to answer any purposes which the wicked Projector shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 229. Yet in their <hi>Declaration</hi> to Him (the King) after his Return, p. 7. they Gravely tell Him, <hi>We are a People that follow after those things that make for Peace and Vnity, and</hi> (which the <hi>Snake</hi> has left out) <hi>it is our Desire, that others Feet may walk in the same; and</hi> (here the <hi>Snake</hi> goes


<pb n="358" facs="tcp:63041:191"/>
on) <hi>do deny and bear our Testimony against all Strife and Wars, and Contentions,</hi> &amp;c. that is, (says the <hi>Snake,</hi>) when they were beaten, and cou'd fight no longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is notoriously false, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> did <hi>Fight</hi> or bear Arms in the Year 1659. (or any other Year) to the opposing of the <hi>Restauration</hi>: Nor indeed was the <hi>Restauration</hi> brought to pass by <hi>Fighting,</hi> but there was more immediately the Hand of God in it; in that without outward Strength, the Powers which then were, crumbled and broke to pieces; (as they were often by our Friends foretold they should) having in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Days and Times of Trial, been found to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease that Yoak, which was the Original Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their First Opposition to the <hi>King.</hi> And that it was always our Principle to follow after those things that make for Peace and Unity, and have desired that others might walk in the same, and did bear our Testimony against all Strife, and War, and Contention, <hi>&amp;c.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> George Bishop</hi> does in this Book of his (<hi>the Warnings of the Lord</hi>) testifie; where, in p. 10. speaking to <hi>O. Cromwell,</hi> and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in what, and how far he had regard to him: He saith in <hi>behalf of Liberty of Conscience,</hi> (which <hi>Oliver</hi> had before declared to be, <hi>a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right,</hi> yet was herein so far darkned, as not to establish this <hi>Right,</hi> which once was in his power to have done; and therefore <hi>G. B.</hi> enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates some of the Sufferings of our Friends to him herein, and at the same time tells him, what was the nature of that Dispensation which the <hi>Quakers</hi> were come to; which he tells him in these words.) <hi>We, who through the unspeakable love of the Father, are come to Witness the end of the Wars, the Son of God made manifest in the Flesh, whose is the Kingdom, and the Glory, and the Dominion for ever; even his

Immortal Seed raised, and raising up in us; by which we are brought to testifie against the World, and all the Deceivers therein; and against the Fashions, and Customs, and Works, and Deeds thereof, that they are Evil, as by his Light we have been shewn, and by his Blood redeemed therefrom, in our own particulars,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in p. 14. <hi>G. B.</hi> enumerating some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of those, whom the <hi>Spirit of Persecution</hi> had overthrown, and the pretences on which they went, as <hi>Haman</hi> to <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> the Informers against <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Three Children</hi>; and the Pretences of the Elders, Chief Priests and Scribes against our <hi>Saviour</hi>; as also their pretences against the <hi>Apostles,</hi> under which they would cloak their wickedness, hath these words, <hi>This is what that Spirit (viz.</hi> of Persecution) <hi>suggested throughout all Ages, on Record in the Scriptures of Truth; and with this, that Spirit blinded the Kings, Princes and Rulers, and set them against the Lord, and against his Anointed, which prov'd in the Issue their destruction. This is that the</hi> Bishops <hi>said of the</hi> Puritans <hi>to the</hi> Late King; <hi>this is that which brought forth the Law in those days against their Meetings to seek the Lord, upon pretence of Conventicles; and with this the</hi> Late King <hi>they blinded, and set him against these People, which became the overthrow of Him, his Posterity and Followers, and of that Generation, and of those that joined with them. And this is that Spirit that</hi> is now blinding of thee, (<hi>viz.</hi> Oliver Cromwell) <hi>who wast the Lord's Battle-Ax, and Weapon of War, to the cutting down of him and those whom after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it blinded and set against the Lord and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and which is now</hi> setting Thee against the Seed of God, <hi>which in this fulness of the Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of times he is raising up to reign for ever and ever; unto which Spirit, if thou continue to hearken and to follow, and to be guided by,</hi> thou shalt be cut


<pb n="360" facs="tcp:63041:192"/>
off, <hi>the Mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is part of a Letter which is in that Book, and which <hi>G. Bishop</hi> did send to <hi>Oliver,</hi> as it is there dated, the 16th of the 5th Month, 1656. By which, and much more, such plain Dealing in the said Letter, wherein he tells him, p. 17. <hi>Because thou hast hardned thy Heart, and turned against him, He</hi> (God) <hi>hath turn'd from thee his Presence, Wisdom from thy Councils, Spirit from thy Men of War, and Success from thine Vndertakings; and is Stripping of thee of thy Fence and Guard, and making thee naked and bare, and is coming against thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It appears from all this, according as our Friends in their <hi>Declaration</hi> to <hi>King Charles</hi> upon his <hi>Restauration</hi> had said, That the <hi>Quakers,</hi> even in the Days of <hi>Oliver,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were a People that did follow after those things that made for Peace,</hi> &amp;c. in that they did faithfully warn the then Powers against that <hi>Spirit of Persecution,</hi> which was (as they had foretold) their overthrow. And that they did not <hi>fight,</hi> but were redeemed out of all outward fighting, and <hi>through the Vnspeakable Love of the Father,</hi> were brought <hi>to the end of the Wars.</hi> So that it is false and malicious in the <hi>Snake,</hi> to say the <hi>Quakers were Beaten, and could Fight no longer,</hi> when they gave that Testimony in their <hi>Declaration,</hi> that they did <hi>Deny and Bear</hi> their <hi>Testimony against all Strife, and Wars, and Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> &amp;c. For had they been in that Warring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there was space and time, when that <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>G. Bishop</hi> to <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> before-mentioned, was writ, wherein he testifies, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> did <hi>witness the end of the Wars,</hi> it being near four years before the <hi>Restauration</hi> of the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:63041:192"/>But tho' there was time and space, yet the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> did never joyn with them, or fall in with them, nor were they concerned in places of Trust or Profit under them; but when those who were in such places, or in the Army, did in their own particulars, come to be redeem'd out of all outward Wars, and to be obedient to that Convincement; they laid down such their Places or Arms, which is more than can be truly said of many fawning Priests and Professors.</p>
               <p>And what is more, the <hi>Quakers</hi> from the first, even all the time of those several Changes in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment before the Restauration, were great Sufferers by them, because of that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> which they witnessed forth, both to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and Governed.</p>
               <p>And thus <hi>G. Bishop</hi> not soothingly, but plainly told <hi>O. C.</hi> in his time, wherein his safety and dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er stood. Thus he told <hi>R. Cromwell</hi> in his time, wherein his safety and danger stood. Thus he told the General Council of the Army, wherein their safety and danger stood. Thus he told the then Parliament, wherein their safety and danger stood. Thus he also told the Council of State, wherein their safety and danger stood, <hi>viz.</hi> In Establishing that equal and just Liberty and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Conscience in matters of Worship, which near all of them in their turns promised and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do, but did it not, therefore were they, as he shews, overthrown.</p>
               <p>And when the King was <hi>Restored, George Bishop</hi> did also Warn Him and his Parliament, as in his piece, <hi>A Book of Warnings,</hi> &amp;c. p. 2 it is seen, where after having recounted the Mercies of God to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Them,</hi> he says, <hi>And now what doth the Lord require of you? — That you take not upon you to rule over his Kingdom, or to prescribe to


<pb n="362" facs="tcp:63041:193"/>
his Dominion; whose Kingdom is an Everlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his Dominion that which shall never have end, that of him in the Conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Reader,</hi> under the different Governments, his Advice was, that Persecution might be taken away; and in great Plainness, without Soothing or Flattering of any to whom his Messages were, he did, it appears, deliver them.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 232. <hi>But after all this Sweetness, as soon as ever the King was Restored,</hi> Anno. 1660. <hi>the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>stoutly deny that ever they had Complemented</hi> Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>or they had forgot it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What the <hi>Snake</hi> calls <hi>Sweetness,</hi> that (We) the <hi>Quakers</hi> did shew to <hi>Oliver,</hi> we take to be our <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as required by the Lord, to shew to all whom it shall please God come to have Government: That is, to Advise that they Govern for God and his Truth; that all Profaness, Immorality and all Wickedness may be discouraged, in which the Blessing both of Governors and the Governed doth consist, This, <hi>O. C.</hi> was frequently admonished of; but he rejecting his Vows to God, his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Men, and the Admonition which God by his Servants did frequently send: Several of our Friends, in great Truth and Plainness, did foretel him of his Overthrow, which none of those his <hi>Soothing</hi> and <hi>Flattering</hi> Priests did dare to do.</p>
               <p>The same plain Dealing our Friends did use to the other Changes in Government, and also to <hi>Richard Cromwell,</hi> not <hi>Complementing</hi> nor <hi>Flattering</hi> any.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>W. Caton,</hi> in his <hi>Truth's Character of Professors,</hi> said, that the Priests and Professors did <hi>Sooth</hi> and <hi>Flatter O. Cromwell</hi> and his <hi>Son,</hi> and made great Promises to him, the Proof was apparent by their <hi>Addresses</hi> to him, which in that Book he does briefly give.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:63041:193"/>What less than Flattery was it, when the Priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> in their Address to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Cromwell,</hi> upon the Death of his Father, told him, <hi>Although our Sun is Set, no Night hath ensued?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what less was it in the Priests of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who did solemnly Promise and Engage <hi>Faithfully to serve and obey his most serene Highness</hi> (for so they then called <hi>R. Cromwell) as his Leige People, in the Defence of his Person and Government, with their Lives and Estates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's true, they did afterwards so <hi>soften</hi> the terms of their Allegiance, that they found themselves ready to embrace another Shelter, when the <hi>Gourd</hi> was withered; and thus they turn'd to the <hi>Rising Side.</hi> But after all, if all this was done, but [Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically] as the <hi>Snake</hi> says; and that they did not mean what they said in their Address: The <hi>Snake</hi> instead of doing them a kindness, by endeavouring so to bring them off; hath given the <hi>Reader</hi> cause to suspect that those Priests when they did so <hi>Solemnly Promise and Engage</hi>; if they did <hi>not mean one word</hi> of what they then spoke, they were as well guilty of <hi>deep Hypocrisie,</hi> as of <hi>Soothing</hi> and <hi>Flattery.</hi>

               <p>Ibid. p. 233. <hi>They (the</hi> Quakers) <hi>represent to him (the King) that the Professors could not be good</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects <hi>to him, because that in his Exile, some of them call'd him only the King of the</hi> Scots, E.

               <p>
                  <hi>Edw. Burroughs,</hi> or any of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> had great cause to represent to the King, that those <hi>Professors,</hi> who <hi>only for and because of our difference in Judgment and Practice concerning Spiritual things</hi>: did Murder and most Barbarously use some of our Friends in <hi>New-England,</hi> could not be good <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:</hi> Nor can any be good Subjects to a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, who for such cause endeavour to raise

Persecution, disturb the publick Peace, and raise Jealousies and Evil Surmisings, whereby all Civil Prosperity is overthrown; and this had then been the practice of the <hi>New-Englanders</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and for their own excuse and colour of their wicked Practices, they did send over a <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Address</hi> from the <hi>General Court</hi> at <hi>Boston, Anno.</hi> 1660. In answer to which, <hi>E.

I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy answer'd it in the order which it's first quoted in, and therefore judge it needless to repeat my Answer to him here; either in this, or those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Instances, in which he does but repeat (to shew the Strength of his Malice) what he has said before: Of this sort are the many little scraps of perverted Quotations, about which he spends near two Pages, to endeavour to prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>E. B. That</hi> all <hi>his Fighting was</hi> chiefly <hi>against the King.</hi>

B.</hi> was not a Man of a <hi>Fighting</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, it may for Conclusion, to what I may say of him on this head, be proper to give a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from himself: It is in his <hi>Standard lifted up,</hi> &amp;c. printed 1658. p. 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:63041:194"/>
                  <q>Again, all Kings, Princes, Rulers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whatsoever, know ye assuredly, that we are not Enemies against, but Friends unto all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government, and to all Just and Righteous Orders and Decrees, and wholesome Laws and Customs of any Common Wealth, and no way (no not by the Sword) are we destructive to, or destroyers of the Peace and Welfare, and wholesome Laws (which are according to God) of any Nation whatsoever: But are preservers of the Peace of all People, and wait in Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the establishment of Justice and true Judgment; and that Righteousness may spring forth, and the Government of all Nations may be according to the Law of God. Neither are we such who make void the just Government of any Nation or City, neither are we such, who through evil purposes, Plot, Conspire or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, Evil in our Hearts against any Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors or Government whatsoever, but wish Peace and Truth, and the fear of the Lord unto all Men and Nations, and desire not the overthrow or evil to any People, or their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but are <hi>Subject to just Government, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where by Obedience to it; and Subject to evil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by Suffering in Patience under it; and for that cause we Suffer patiently under our Enemies.</hi>
                  </q>
Thus <hi>E. B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Principle, vouch'd by an agreeable Practice in <hi>E. Burroughs, F. Howgil, G. Bishop,</hi> and all others who were truly <hi>Quakers,</hi> did occasion a Letter to the <hi>Parliament of England, An.</hi> 1653. wherein is set forth a brief Account of the Sufferings of our <hi>Friends</hi> at that time: And there, in p. 8. it is Testified by the Author, <hi>Anthony Pearson,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Quakers</hi> at that Day.
<q>They are (says he) above all others (I know it) Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,


<pb n="396" facs="tcp:63041:195"/>
Harmless, Peaceable; they Dispute not Authority with any Man, nor Question Forms of Government, nor trouble their Heads what becomes of the World; but as Strangers and Pilgrims, they have their Conversation on the Earth, wandring to and fro, seeking another City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This Testimony, as it was given to the then <hi>Parliament,</hi> so had the above relation concerning the <hi>Quakers,</hi> been false, it had been easie to have Detected it, and shewn the contrary. I could heap up Instances on this Head from our <hi>Friends,</hi> would I be tedious, but I choose Brevity, where Truth easily appears: Wherefore I shall here on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly add the following Testimonies of our <hi>Early</hi> Peaceable Obedience to <hi>Magistracy</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi> The first is from <hi>James Parnel,</hi> in his Book, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>A Shield of Truth,</hi> &amp;c. Printed 1655. p. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We own it (Magistracy and Government) in its place, for while the Devil hath Power over Man there will be Transgression— For this end was the Law given forth, to Curb Evil Doers, and to Preserve and Encourage them that do well— And all Magistrates who Fear God, and hate Covetousness, and are guided by the Light of God in the Conscience, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes the Law in its place, and this we Own, and Honour, and are Subject to, for Conscience sake.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The next is in the same Year 1655. from <hi>James Naylor,</hi> in his Book, Entituled, <hi>A Fool Answered according to his Folly,</hi> written as the former, of <hi>Ja. P</hi>'s was, In Answer to the Charges of our Enemies, among which one was: <hi>The Magistrates to you are no Magistrates (viz.</hi> the Magistrates during the <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> which by the way I would desire the


<pb n="367" facs="tcp:63041:195"/>
                  <hi>Reader</hi> to observe, is yet some Testimony for us, against the direct contrary Charge of the <hi>Snake,</hi> who says we <hi>joined with them.</hi>) To this <hi>J. N.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, p. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Magistrates we own, and the Power of God, who bear the Sword of God, which is a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to the Evil Doers, and is to be laid upon the Offenders, Ordained of God for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and to this Ordinance, for Conscience sake, we are subject.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou hast here some Testimonies both against Fighting, and of our Subjection to Magistracy, during those Years from which the <hi>Snake</hi> falsly Suggests the contrary; and with these do concur those Testimonies which the <hi>Snake</hi> Cites out of the Declaration of our <hi>Friends, An.</hi> 1660. and in the <hi>Quakers Plea,</hi> 1661. And all of them are no more nor less, than we have held and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, ever since we were a People. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where it is said, p. 235, 236. <hi>Such of us whose Principles were once so</hi> (viz. <hi>for Fighting) are chang'd,</hi> &amp;c. the meaning is (not as the <hi>Snake</hi> would pervert it, that such were for Fighting, though of us, before the Restoration, but are chang'd <hi>now</hi> since that, but) that such of us, whose Principle was once for Fighting, before they were of us, are now (since they came to be of us) chang'd. And whereas it is there also said, <hi>We are all of that mind—that in the Administration of the Gospel, it is, on all Occasions whatsoever, Vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to War and Fight with Carnal Weapons.</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects those who are in, and under the Gospel-Ministration, of which I have already spoken, and not those who are not yet come under it. But the <hi>Snake</hi> thinks, now he has a full Proof, for he says, p. 237, 238. <hi>When a fair occasion seem'd to offer towards the Re-asserting the Good Old Cause, in</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth<hi>'s


<pb n="368" facs="tcp:63041:196"/>
Rebellion,</hi> 1685. <hi>several of the Quakers in the</hi> West, <hi>where he Landed, took</hi> Arms, and Fought—<hi>Yet we heard nothing of their Repentance, or that they were any way Censur'd for it by their Yearly Meeting, or any other Authority of theirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Seeming Fair Occasion</hi> (as the <hi>Snake</hi> calls it, <hi>for Rebellion</hi>) was (I doubt not, he will own) snatch'd at by many, who did profess to be of his Communion, but whether they were therefore Censur'd, I shall not inquire; it is sufficient for us, that if any who had pretended to be of us, did do so, that they were therefore disown'd. And if the <hi>Snake</hi> hath neither heard this, or whether they Repented, it had well become one who pretends (though herein, as well as in many more Instances, it appears falsly) to so much <hi>Charity,</hi> to have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, Whether either of these had been. But since it appears not that he has, I will here sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join, concerning this Matter, the Testimony against, and Denial of such, who were so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and their Practices, as given from our Friends in the Counties of <hi>Somerset, Devon,</hi> and <hi>Dorset,</hi> and then Presented to Authority, in the Terms following.</p>

And therefore our Friends were Warned not to concern themselves in this War, and all Unanimously consented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</q>

To which the <hi>Snake</hi> adds part of a Letter, said to be sent from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and says, he <hi>will make no Comments, but leave it to Mr.</hi> Penn <hi>himself to</hi> Own <hi>or</hi> Deny <hi>the Matter of Fact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatsoever may be the Groundless <hi>Suspicions</hi> of some Apostatizing <hi>Quakers,</hi> or the <hi>Forgery</hi> of the <hi>Snake</hi> herein; it cannot be <hi>incumbent</hi> upon <hi>W.

               <p>Ibid. p. 242. <hi>I hope this dismal Prospect of the</hi> Birth <hi>and</hi> Growth <hi>of</hi> Quakerism, <hi>will cure those</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>of</hi> Honesty <hi>and</hi> Sense, <hi>who have a just appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the</hi> Heinousness <hi>of</hi> Schism <hi>in the Church, and</hi> Rebellion <hi>in the</hi> State.</p>

he has made the Church (to which he pretends) <hi>Schismatical</hi> and <hi>Rebellious.</hi> But whether or no She be so, He is both, of which I have already spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>

               <p>That the <hi>Prophesies</hi> of <hi>G. F, E.

               <head>SECT. XVII. Concerning Tythes.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 244. <hi>THere is no Point wherein the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>are more Positive and Fierce, than in Opposition to Tythes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That's for their Credit; for Tythes (as drawn by the <hi>Romish Church</hi> from the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> and by others taken from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> along with other of her Errors and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions) is a Legal Right abrogated by Christ; the Re-establishment whereof is an Implicit De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial that Christ is come in the Flesh; which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Unreasonableness, Inequality and Oppression thereof, and the unsuitableness of Tythes, to a Gospel Ministry, is the true reason why the <hi>Quakers</hi> are so Positive and Zealous in Opposing of them.</p>
               <p>But the reason which the <hi>Snake</hi> gives, is not much for the Clergy's Credit, which is, (Ibid.) <hi>Because if they</hi> (Tythes) <hi>were once taken away, the Clergy (as they suppose) wou'd sink of Course, being depriv'd of their Subsistence, and so the total ruine of the Church would follow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Supposition is either true or false: If it be true, it concerns the Favourers of that Clergy to consider, what sort of Clergy that is, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the True Primitive Ministry of the Gospel, and how unworthy to be held up, which would sink of course, if depriv'd of Subsistence by Tythes. And also whether that is likely to be the true Church of Christ, whose <hi>Total Ruine</hi> would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, for want of Tythes to support it. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles


<pb n="377" facs="tcp:63041:200"/>
and first Preachers of the Gospel, had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with Tythes. The Gospel Ministry in the First Ages of the Christian Church medled not with Tythes, had not their Subsistence by them; yet these did not sink, but stood upright and firm; much better and faster than those that came after in those corrupter Ages, wherein Tythes were hook'd in again.</p>
               <p>The Christian Church was more pure in its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Simplicity, before Poyson (to use the words of an Historian) was poured into it by setling of Worldly Riches and Temporal Revenues upon it. How can they, who read and believe that saying of Christ, Mat. 16.18. <hi>The Gates of Hell shall not prevail against his Church</hi>; believe that Church to be His, whose <hi>Total Ruine</hi> wou'd follow if Tythes were taken way? Now least the <hi>Snake</hi> should glide away, and make his Escape through the words in his Parenthesis [<hi>as they suppose:</hi>] (which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he left for a starting hole) Pretending, that it is only a Supposition of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that if the Clergy be depriv'd of their <hi>Subsistence,</hi> (Tythes) they would sink of Course, and so the <hi>Total Ruine</hi> of the Church wou'd follow. It will be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to remember, That one of the Clergy, in a Book writ on purpose in Defence of Tythes, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>The Right of Tythes Asserted,</hi> &amp;c. p. 13. compares Tythes to the Oyl that nourishes the Lamp, without which the Lamp would not burn, nor give any Light at all; and comparing the Priests to an Army, says, <hi>Because they dare not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage this Army, they attempt to force them to disband for want of Pay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And p. 15. From a saying of <hi>Tacitus</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State, (which he says, <hi>May be applied to the Church in this Case,) viz.</hi>
                  <q>[There can be no Quiet to the Nations without Soldiers, no Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers


<pb n="378" facs="tcp:63041:201"/>
without Pay, nor no Pay without Tribute, on which therefore the Common Safety doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend:]</q>
(<hi>He infers</hi>)
<q>Even so, no Peace in the Church without Ministers, no Ministers without Maintenance, nor no Maintenance without these Publick Contributions, (namely Tythes) on which therefore the safety of Religion doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I hope the <hi>Reader</hi> will here consider, that it is not [as they <hi>(the Quakers)</hi> suppose,] but, [as they the Clergy suppose,] that the <hi>Total Ruin of the Church would follow</hi>; as also I wou'd desire my <hi>Reader</hi> to consider what <hi>Religion,</hi> what <hi>Church,</hi> what <hi>Clergy</hi> that is, that doth so depend on <hi>Tythes,</hi> that if <hi>Tythes</hi> were taken away, these must sink in Course.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 245. <hi>And this</hi> R. Barclay <hi>does not conceal,</hi>
                  <q>That Antichristian Apostatiz'd Generation <hi>(says he)</hi> the National Ministry have receiv'd a Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Blow by our Witness against their forc'd Maintenance and Tythes. — So that their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in the Hearts of Thousands, begins to Totter, and shall assuredly fall to the Ground.</q>
                  <hi>Anarchy,</hi> &amp;c. p. 41. Printed 1676.</p>
               <p>This is a Truth, which it was not proper to Conceal; for it is fit their <hi>Kingdom in the Hearts</hi> of People should fall, because they have but usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; they have no Right to have a Kingdom <hi>in the Hearts of</hi> People; and the Reason why it <hi>Totters,</hi> and why <hi>it</hi> and <hi>they will fall</hi> is, because they are not built upon the Rock <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon a forc'd Maintenance by <hi>Tythes,</hi> of which, if they be depriv'd, the <hi>Clergy will</hi> (it seems) <hi>sink in Course.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>But what if the Light within some</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>should allow them to pay Tythes, and think they ought in Conscience to do it, as being Legally Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:63041:201"/>Whether Tythes be Legally Established, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my business nor purpose here to discuss; but supposing them to be Legally Established, is a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Establishment, by Civil or Human Authority, a Bond to bind Conscience in things relating to Religion and the Worship of God?</p>
               <p>Time was, when the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Altar, Auricular Confession,</hi> the <hi>Caelibate</hi> or single Life of <hi>Priests,</hi> and the rest of the Six <hi>Articles,</hi> were in this Nation, <hi>Legally Established:</hi> Did that <hi>Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> bind the Conscience to the performance of those things? Unhappy Martyrs then! who gave their Bodies to be burnt rather than they wou'd comply with those things, tho' so <hi>Established! Legal Establishments</hi> are of equal force, in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as in another. Are not these Six <hi>Articles,</hi> not only practised by the <hi>Popish</hi> Party, but reputed to be <hi>legally established</hi> in <hi>Popish</hi> Countries, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously impos'd and press'd in some, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>France?</hi> Are the Poor <hi>Protestants</hi> there, to be Condemned as acting against Conscience, while they have suffered such Ravages and Inhumane Cruelties, for not complying with those things which are there <hi>Legally Established?</hi> Who but a <hi>Snake</hi> wou'd thus hiss at them, in his envy against Us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (says he) <hi>if the Light within some</hi> Quakers <hi>should allow them to pay Tythes. — Wou'd the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Rulers <hi>allow them Liberty of Conscience, and give them leave to follow their Light within?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words [<hi>Quaker Rulers,</hi>] as scoffingly used by him, I reject and know of no such; that the <hi>Light within</hi> ought to be the <hi>Rule</hi> for every one to walk by I assert: But it is not impossible for some, who, may pretend to walk by it, to put <hi>Darkness</hi> for <hi>Light,</hi> and take that to be the Allowance of the <hi>Light</hi> to them (especially in a case where either


<pb n="380" facs="tcp:63041:202"/>
advantage or danger outwardly is likely to follow) which is contrary to the <hi>Light.</hi> This is not to be wondred at, especially by them who call the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> their <hi>Rule of Faith and Manners,</hi> since there is hardly any thing more common, nor more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, than that some, in all Communions of them, do think and are persuaded, that according to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> they ought to believe and practise such things, and after such manner as others, not only of other Communions owning the same <hi>Rule</hi>; but those of the same Communion with themselves, deny to be the meaning of that <hi>Rule,</hi> and oppose or condemn them for.</p>
               <p>If a Bishop or other Clergy-man of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> or any Minister or Member of any other <hi>Religious Society,</hi> should so far mistake himself, as to think the <hi>Scriptures</hi> (which he takes for his <hi>Rule</hi>) does allow (not to say require) him to say <hi>Mass,</hi> to pray to <hi>Saints</hi> departed, or other distinguishing Doctrines of <hi>Popery,</hi> or to practise any abrogated <hi>Jewish Rite,</hi> as <hi>Circumcision,</hi> or the like; wou'd the <hi>Church of England,</hi> or any of the other Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons allow such an one the Liberty of his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence therein, and give him leave to follow that which he says is the sense of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and yet continue to be of the Clergy of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> or a Minister or Member in those other <hi>Communions?</hi> If not, but that they wou'd (as they ought) disown or deny such a one to be of them, let not them condemn themselves in condemning us who have done no more, as we ought not to have done less.</p>
               <p>This I judge sufficient answer to his Idle Cavil about <hi>T. Crisp,</hi> and other Apostates from us, whose pretence to an allowance from the <hi>Light within,</hi> to act those things, which are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the General direction and Testimony of the


<pb n="381" facs="tcp:63041:202"/>
                  <hi>Light within,</hi> has been fully laid open in several printed Treatises.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> to swell his <hi>Libel,</hi> not strengthen his Argument, here brings in two Quotations, from <hi>G. Fox</hi> and <hi>R. Hubberthorn,</hi> nor relating to Tythes; to which I need say little, being already before answered, and therefore shall here only add to what is already said, that if he intend hereby to deny the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> only: That any of our Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are given forth by the same Spirit, by which the Holy Scriptures were given forth, I am content to leave it to the Witness of God in the Consciences of them, that without prejudice, and with an equal mind do read them: But if he denies the <hi>Thesis,</hi> viz. That God can speak and make known his Mind now to Men Immediately by the same Spirit, in and by which he spake to the Holy Prophets and Apostles: Let him shew when and where God hath imposed that Silence upon himself, and bound himself to speak no more in that Immediate manner by his Spirit to Men.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 246. <hi>And from the same Mouth of the Lord,</hi> Tho. Ellwood <hi>denounces, that they who pay Tythes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>How knows the <hi>Snake</hi> that? <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> did not say he delivered it <hi>from the Mouth of the Lord:</hi> Yet what he there delivered is true: But if <hi>T. E.</hi> did not deliver it <hi>from the Mouth of the Lord</hi> (but laid it down as a plain proposition deduced from Scripture) and this abdicated <hi>Snake</hi> positively says he did: From whose <hi>Mouth</hi> did the Priest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that Lye? Unless from the Mouth of him who is the Father of them; which is the more likely, in that he wrongs <hi>T. E.</hi> in the Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion also, which he gives thus, <hi>T.

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>T. Ellwood</hi>'s words are,
<q>They who pay Tythes, do therein uphold a Legal Ceremony abrogated by Christ, and thereby deny Christ to be come in the Flesh, which is a Mark of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-christ, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> by leaving out those words [do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in uphold a Legal Ceremony abrogated by Christ] hath conceal'd from his <hi>Reader,</hi> that part of <hi>T. E</hi>'s proposition, on which the remaining parts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended (which he hath also done, in p. 254. and repeated the same again with some addition in p. 273. to make the more noise) for the propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on consists of three parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they who pay Tythes, do therein up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a Legal Ceremony abrogated by Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That by upholding a Legal Ceremony abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by Christ, they deny Christ to be come in the Flesh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That to deny Christ to be come in the Flesh, is a mark of Anti-christ; for proof of which, <hi>Tho. Ellwood</hi> quoted, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3.</p>
               <p>Now if the <hi>Snake</hi> can without nibling, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>T. E</hi>'s words by piecemeal, disprove them, or the Authority on which they are built, it may answer his purpose; otherwise the Conclusion is Firm.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>G. Fox in his decretal Epistle, bearing date the</hi> 3 <hi>d. Month</hi> 1677. <hi>commands, Severely, that the Friends Testimony against Tythes be kept up with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet none of these words [Command] [Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely,] nor Vigor] are in that Epistle, which this Scoffing <hi>Snake</hi> calls <hi>Decretal.</hi> The Quotation he gives out of that Epistle, begins thus, <hi>For any to cry against the Priests in words, and yet to give

them means, and put into their Mouths</hi> (he has left out here [that they may not prepare War against you] as not willing to publish that their Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Practice) <hi>is a Contradiction.</hi> And is it not so? Then he goes on, <hi>And therefore take heed, for if the Lord God do bless you with outward Creatures, and you do bestow them upon</hi> Baal<hi>'s Priests, the Lord may justly require the Outward Things from you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Snake</hi> stops, and covers with a — what follows in the Epistle thus, <hi>Who</hi> (i. e. the Lord) <hi>saith that his Christian Ministers, should freely give, as they have freely received of Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the Priests don't love the People should hear of; no, by no means, <hi>giving Freely</hi> is what they care not for: And if for a Reason, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and say, they have not <hi>freely received,</hi> though it be Truth, yet it will be of no great Advantage. But it seems by the <hi>Snake</hi>'s quarrelling with this Quotation, that he would have <hi>God's Creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon</hi> Baal<hi>'s Priests</hi>; for which I should want a reason, had I not this, <hi>viz.</hi> That he himself might hope to get a share of them.</p>
               <p>But we have not yet done with <hi>G. F</hi>'s Epistle: The <hi>Snake</hi> goes on with the Quotation thus, <hi>So all the Preachers for Tythes and Mony, and the Takers and Payers of Tythe, must be testified against in the Lord's Power and Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here he leaves off again, dashing out several lines, which mention the Spoil that had been made by the Tythe-mongers upon such as refused to pay them, and the Judgments that have come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those Persecuting Spoilers. And therefore said <hi>G. F.</hi> in the next words, <hi>In the Power of the Lord maintain the War against the Beast</hi> (that is, that Persecuting Spirit in the Priests) <hi>and do not put into his Mouth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:63041:204"/>To pervert this passage, the <hi>Snake</hi> has printed it [Beasts] in the Plural, that he might make way for a false and wicked Comment of his own, <hi>that is</hi> (says he) <hi>as well Payers as Receivers of Tythes, and that</hi> (adds he) <hi>is the whole Kingdom, King and Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas, by those words [and do not put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] which the <hi>Snake</hi> has left out; it is very plain, that <hi>G. F</hi>'s words in that place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to those that exacted, not to those that pay'd Tythes.</p>
               <p>But as he hath perverted this Quotation, to render the <hi>Quakers</hi> Obnoxious to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by insinuating as if they set up an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Authority against it: So he craftily, but falsly says, <hi>G. F.</hi> concludes his Epistle abovesaid with these words, <hi>Keep your Authority and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas, that is not the Conclusion, but after those words, <hi>Keep your Authority and Dominion,</hi> it follows, <hi>in the Power, and Spirit, and Name of Jesus:</hi> Which shews, the War before mentioned was a Spiritual Warfare, to be maintained by a Suffering Testimony, and this also shews the Malice and Falshood of this Adversary.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 247. <hi>There they wou'd perswade us, that all they have said against the Payment of Tythes, was only meant by them against the Payment of them to the Popish Clergy: But by no means, against the Right of the</hi> Church of England <hi>to their Tythes, as settled upon them by the Civil Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is false, and the words he quotes from that Paper, <hi>Signed on the Behalf of Friends, and their Yearly Meeting,</hi> do not say, or imply it: There is not in them, any acknowledgment of any Right the <hi>Church of England</hi> hath to Tythes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:63041:204"/>He goes on and quotes from that Paper, <hi>We are not convinced, that it can be against the Fundamental Laws of the Land, either to deny Tythes</hi> [What, when the Law enjoyns them?]</p>
               <p>The Law (and that made in the same Reign, and not much after that which was the first express Statute-Law for Tythes) enjoyn'd, owning of the 6 Articles, <hi>viz.</hi> Transubstantiation in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Altar, Auricular Confession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Was that a Fundamental Law of the Land? The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs that then chose rather to suffer Death in Flames of Fire, than keep it, did not think so.</p>
               <p>Again, are not all Acts of Parliament, though made in Popish Times, <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of this Realm? Tho' such as were made about Religion; for if they had, either the Popish Religion must have yet stood, or the Reformers must all be guilty of breaking the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of the Realm; which is a Charge, that the Modesty of this <hi>Snake</hi> will hardly forbear to put upon them, after having so warmly endeavoured to prove them Schismaticks, as I have before shewn. But while I am upon this point of <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws,</hi> I would ask the <hi>Snake</hi> to give, if he can, some Reason, why the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made in the 27th <hi>H.</hi> 8. for setting out of Tythes, was more a <hi>Fundamental Law</hi> of the Land, than the other Act made in the 31st. of the same Reign, for Establishing the 6 Articles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tythes</hi> are rightly deem'd Anti-christian, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by Popes and Popish Laws, because they were so imposed by vertue of the Levitical (abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated) Law: Besides, by <hi>Popish Laws</hi> there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I take our Friends to mean, not Acts of Parliament made in Popish Times (which the <hi>Snake</hi> would craftily twine it to) but Decrees, or Constitutions of Popish Bishops or Councils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>


                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:63041:205"/>
because <hi>Popish Laws</hi> are joyned there, with Popes [<hi>impos'd by Popes and Popish Laws</hi>] not Papists in their Civil Capacities only, but Papists, <hi>quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Papists, in their Ecclesiastick Capacities; and for Establishing not Civil Government, but the Popish Religion and Church: And indeed the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the 27th <hi>H.</hi> 8. was not properly imposing of them, for they were impos'd by the <hi>Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> long before, and the Impositions of them was intirely Popish.</p>
               <p>And upon that Imposition, Tythes being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be due to God and Holy Church (as the Preamble of that Statute shews) the manner of Payment, and direction for Recovery, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by that Statute; and the other Statute made in the 2<hi>d Edw.</hi> 6. is grounded on that of <hi>H.</hi> 8. and refers to it, and expresly declares, it is made to the intent the said Tythes may be hereafter truly paid, according to the mind of the makers of the said Act.</p>
               <p>And that being made by <hi>H.</hi> 8. and his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, about four Years before the Act for the Six Articles was made; sufficiently shews, what the mind of the Makers of that Act was, and whom they would have Tythes then paid to, who profest Communion with the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>; tho' they quarelled with the Pope, and burnt the Protestants as fast as they appear'd; so that if it should be supposed, that Tythes were imposed by those Statutes, it will be hard to free them from being a Popish Imposition.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 248. <hi>There were no Tythes paid to any</hi> Popish <hi>Priests in</hi> England, <hi>ever since Quakerism appear'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, rather, was there any Tythes paid to any Priests, but what in their Original here in <hi>England</hi> were demanded by <hi>Popish</hi> Priests? Are not all


<pb n="387" facs="tcp:63041:205"/>
Priests that take Tythes, what ever other Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination they may go under, in that, and so far at least <hi>Popish?</hi> And this may serve for Answer to his Interrogative in the same Page, <hi>Why do you not now pay your Tythes to the Ministers of the</hi> Church of England?</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Why do you boast of your Sufferings and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonments?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We do not boast, nor have we any thing to boast of, that we can do or suffer, it is the Lord that hath carried us through our Sufferings (as he did his People in former times) and the Glory belongs to him, which it is fit we should give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, by Commemorating his Goodness therein towards us.</p>
               <p>But it is an Aggravation of Cruelty, and an unusual sort of Barbarity, to put Men to pain, and then blame them for Groaning; to oppress Men, and not suffer them to Complain or seek Redress.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 249. <hi>Why do you Persecute and Disown those of your Communion who pay their Tythes?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We Persecute none; but in disowning such as pretending to own our Principle, do act contrary to it, we do but our Duty.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Why are you so Zealous herein, as not to leave them to their own Conviction, or Light within?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We leave them to take their own way if they will persist therein, after frequent Admonition and Endeavours to bring them to the right way.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Why will you not allow them what your selves so much plead for, Liberty of Conscience in this Case?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do allow all such, the same Liberty we our selves plead for: For we don't plead for a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to act contrary to the Principles of any other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to receive and own us as Members of that Society we oppose. We meddle no further with any of those who have deserted our Principle, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare they are gone from us, and are no longer of us; and to Defend our Principle and us against Assaults: And if other Societies which we depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from, had done no more, nor otherwise by us, we should not have complain'd of them.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>are not fewer, by the lowest Computation, than One Hundred Thousand, here in</hi> England.</p>
               <p>I wish he speak true. Let <hi>Joab</hi>'s wish, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.3. go with it. <hi>The Lord add unto the People</hi> (how many soever they be) <hi>an hundred fold.</hi> But since the <hi>Quakers</hi> are known to all, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged even by their Enemies, to be an Industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous People, it may be hop'd this Intimation of their Numbers may occasion our Governours to consider, How much more useful an Hundred Thousand working <hi>Bees</hi> may be to the Civil Government, than Ten or Twenty Thousand <hi>Drones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>If the Tythes, first of all the Quakers, and then of all those, who to avoid Payment of their Tythes, will pretend to be persuaded by them herein, were Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, there would not be Sufficient left to keep half the Clergy in</hi> England <hi>from Starving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this one wou'd think, either that there are great Numbers of those who Pay their Tythes with an ill will, and would gladly be <hi>eased</hi> of the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them (which I hope we may be allow'd to say, is very good News, because it bespeaks a growing Sense of the Oppression and Evil of Tythes.) For, since the Clergy (as they love to call themselves) are not the hundredth part of the People, if the Tythes of the one half of all those who Pay to them were Substracted, they should


<pb n="389" facs="tcp:63041:206"/>
have, instead of the Tenth, but the Twentieth, nay the Thirtieth Part of the Increase, they would have more than double, or near treble to their Proportion, than all the rest of the Inhabitants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, of the danger of whose Starving, this <hi>Snake</hi> seems not at all apprehensive.</p>
               <p>What he says <hi>(Ibid.) was Threaten'd or Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied</hi> (he can't tell which, it seems) by <hi>Rich. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berthorn,</hi> seems to be a Reproof of the Priests Pride and Luxury, who would be likely rather to Beg, or suffer want, than set their Bones to Work for their Living, as others are glad to do. And this being spoken of the Priests of that time, when that Book was Written, before the Year 1660, who were not of that Church, which is now call'd the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when they were turn'd out, and the Law of the Land ceas'd to maintain them (which came sooner upon them than they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) they might have begg'd their Bread, or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd for want, for any Care, or Pity, these Priests (who call themselves the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) took of them, or shewed to them.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 250. <hi>They did not think it sufficient to Preach and Print against Tythes, but they went about and got Subscriptions of many Thousand</hi> Quakers <hi>throughout all</hi> England, <hi>against Tythes, and sent them to the Parliament, in a Humble Threatning Manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this he must mean, That this was Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men: For he adds:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And, as if this had not been sufficient, the Women too must be Assembled— And they too must sign the like Subscriptions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet this Subscription of the Men, which he says, they <hi>sent up in an Humble Threatning Manner,</hi> he confesses in the next Page, he had not seen. <hi>I have not yet seen the Subscriptions of the Men,</hi> p.

251. So that he throws out his Scoffing Lye [<hi>of an Humbling Threatning</hi>] at a venture, on hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say from others, or his own bare Surmise, of which when he brings truer Proof, it may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther considered. And for the Subscriptions of the Women, I have already spoken to it, p. 345, 346, fore-going: Yet for further Discovery of the Malice and Falshood of this Adversary herein, I will Remark upon his Quotations, from those <hi>Papers</hi> of the <hi>Women</hi>'s Subscriptions against Tythes, concerning which he says, p. 251. <hi>The Women do positively declare for Annulling of Tythes, if the Parliament wou'd not alter the same.</hi> He begins his Quotation thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Commands of Men</hi> (say they, p. 3.) <hi>must be Annulled, that takes Tythes, and not be obeyed by them that live in the Covenant of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here he stops, and dashes out what follows, as he left out what went before these Words: <hi>The Commands of Men must be Disannulled.</hi> How? <hi>By the Covenant of Life,</hi> which Abrogates the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law that gave Tythes. And if <hi>the Covenant of Life</hi> hath Abrogated the Levitical Law that gave Tythes; which Law was given by God: Shall it not also Annul the Commands of Men, upon that (Abrogated) Law? I think it must. But how? Must it be as the <hi>Snake</hi> says? <hi>If the Parliament wou'd not alter the same:</hi> (Insinuating, that they then wou'd Rebel; which is a most false Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation) Yes, if they wou'd not, it must be Annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to as many as are in <hi>the Covenant of Life</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such <hi>Witness</hi> (as the Words in p. 3. imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately foregoing the <hi>Snake's</hi> Quotation, are) <hi>the End of the Command of God to the Jews, that gave Tythes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:63041:207"/>Thus much for the Words left out at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which sufficiently shews the Malice of the <hi>Snake:</hi> Now for what he hath dash'd out at the end of this Quotation, which is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now if you</hi> (the then Parliament) <hi>act in the same Power that hath held up Tythes since the Apostles Days, which hath taken away many of our Friends Lives, that have been Imprison'd till Death, in nasty Holes and Corners, for bearing their Testimony against that unjust Oppression of Tythes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the <hi>Snake</hi> Conceals; it is not with him worth minding, if <hi>Quakers</hi> are Imprison'd till Death: But whether he will mind it, or not, I think it did very highly concern them, who were exposed to such Sufferings, for their Testimony against an Abrogated Jewish Law; to represent as they did, to the then Powers their Case, and warn them that they stood not in that <hi>same Power,</hi> by and from which they had known such Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> continues thus: <hi>And they tell,</hi> p. 4. That they <hi>bear their Testimony for the Lord Jesus Christ</hi> (in Opposition to Tythes) <hi>against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Man, set up in Opposition to him, since the Days of the Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which to you</hi> (say they) <hi>is the Word of the Lord God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Compass of this short Quotation, here are three Abuses, which the <hi>Snake</hi> was willing to do to this Place, that thereby he might twine it to his purpose. The first is, he gives for our Friends Words: <hi>Bear their Testimony,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas it is Printed, <hi>Bearing.</hi> But that would not suit his purpose, therefore it must be chang'd, for that wou'd have spoil'd his Connection, and given cause to suspect, that it was Relative to something that went before, which he was very desirous should be conceal'd; but now it must out: It is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:63041:208"/>
                  <hi>There are many in Prison at this Day, in nasty Holes, bearing their Testimony,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I find the <hi>Snake</hi> wou'd have us lye so close in <hi>Nasty Holes,</hi> as neither to be seen nor heard of.</p>
               <p>His Second Abuse, is his Parenthesis (<hi>in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to Tythes</hi>) which he puts, as looking with a better Grace, than the Words which really are in a Parenthesis, in this Quotation in the Book it self, for they are these: (<hi>That Disannulled the Command that gave Tythes.</hi>) But he thought that it was not proper to have it seen, that the Reason why our Friends did lye in <hi>Nasty Holes,</hi> was for <hi>bearing their Testimony for the Lord Jesus Christ</hi> (that Disannulled the <hi>Command that gave Tythes.</hi>)</p>
               <p>His Third Abuse is after these Words; <hi>since the Days of the Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. (he adds) <hi>which to you is the Word of the Lord God.</hi> Now these last Words stand not thus in that Page, but five or six Lines higher; and are a Warning from the Lord to that <hi>Parliament,</hi> in these Words. <hi>Let not the Nation be ruin'd, and the People Prison'd to Death, and the Blood of the Innocent be drunken, as abundance of it hath been within these few Years, which lies upon the Heads of some; therefore keep it clear from off your own Heads, we warn you, which to you is the Word of the Lord God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> now takes for his Quotation, from p. 21. these Words: <hi>The shout of a King is amongst us, the Lord God omnipotent.</hi> And then gives a Dash, instead of these Words which follow: <hi>Who will throw down all that is come up, since the true Church went into the Wilderness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is no doubt a great Truth; That when Jesus Christ, the Spiritual Head of the true Church, comes to take that Power which of Right belongs to Him, He will throw down, and deliver his Church, from all that Deceit and Oppression,


<pb n="393" facs="tcp:63041:208"/>

               <p>Ibid. p. 252. He quotes thus (from those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Womens Subscriptions) p. 40. <hi>This Priesthood which takes Tythes now</hi> (this was not the Popish Priesthood, says the <hi>Snake) we in the Power of the Lord God deny them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And a very good Reason is, in this p. 40. given why we do deny them; which is, Because <hi>there was never no Priesthood that took Tythes, who was made by the Law of God, but what was in the time of the Law,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And if the Priest-hood now taking Tythes, are not so Constituted by the Law of God under the Gospel: Is there not very great and good Reason why it should be denied?</p>
               <p>Ibid. He goes on, and quotes from the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Papers,</hi> page 63. <hi>We Declare with our Hands, and with our Lives and Estates, against the Ministry that takes Tythes, and the Setters of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Snake</hi> gives a Dash, instead of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following part of their Testimony, which is in these Words, <hi>And the first Author of them up.</hi> He was not willing it should be known, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> do with Hands, Lives and Estates, testifie against (by Suffering in both these) the <hi>Popes,</hi> who were the <hi>Setters up,</hi> and <hi>Authors</hi> of the bringing into the Church, the Levitical (Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated) Law for Tythes. No, instead of this their peaceable Meaning in these Words, <hi>Hands, Lives, and Estates,</hi> and that prov'd, and attested by their agreeable Practice, the <hi>Snake</hi> would Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, our Violent, and Forcible Opposition, which is an Insinuation as False as Malicious. For our Friends laid their Grievances before the then <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> which was the then only visible Power,


<pb n="394" facs="tcp:63041:209"/>
which could relieve them, which was both Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and Reasonable, and shews that they neither attempted, nor sought to relieve themselves, in a tumultuous or violent way. They in these <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> quoted by the <hi>Snake,</hi> set their Hands against that Oppression, and had before (from their being first a People) given up themselves in an innocent, peaceable, Suffering Testimony, to the Loss of Estates and Lives. For Proof of which, did I care to bring back to remembrance, particular Instances of cruel Sufferings of our Friends, I could draw a very large Catalogue of their Sufferings, by Whippings, by Stonings, by Stocks, Dungeons, Confiscations, and other such like. And as the <hi>Quakers</hi> were then, as since then, a People which Suffer'd so much, and did never Resist, so nothing but utmost Baseness, Folly and Hypocrisie in this <hi>Snake,</hi> could lead him to affirm, of a Testimony given from People so Suffering, was a <hi>Formal As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation,</hi> a <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> to <hi>Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the Church, and the Laws, and the Government, which Support it</hi>; more especially, when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd, That the Church and Government that then was, at the time when those Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were given in (which he dates to be the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of the fifth Month, 1659.) are disown'd by himself to be either true Church, or true Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that he hath said, p. 326. fore-going, <hi>We joyned with all the Vsurpations upon our Natural Prince.</hi>

               <p>And as for his Malicious Quibble, (p. 257, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) upon the word [<hi>Vniversal,</hi>] it is grounded on a wilfull Fallacy of those words of <hi>W.

But the <hi>Independency and Vnaccountable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Practice and Conversation,</hi> which <hi>W.

               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 261, 262. <hi>The Greatest Zeal which Christ ever shew'd, was to preserve the Honour and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence due to Outward Institutions of Religion, even to the Material Temple of Stones and Lime,</hi> Mat. 11.16. Psal. 69.9. John 2.17. <hi>And if he thus Reprov'd the Jews Prophanation of their</hi> Outward <hi>Temple — How wou'd he have scourg'd those who durst despise and contemn it at the Vile Quaker-rate, and Ridicule it by the name of a Steeple-house,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here, the <hi>Snake,</hi> by a noted fallacy, would make [<hi>Theirs</hi>] the <hi>Jews</hi> Legal Temple, to be <hi>it</hi> which we call a <hi>Steeple-House,</hi> which is very false. And that his Deceit and Hypocrisie may appear more clear herein. It may be consider'd,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Their,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> Temple, was a Temple of God's own appointment, as were all the Legal Services which he appointed in it. And this Act of Zeal in Christ, was shewn in the time while that Temple, and the Worship of it were (<hi>de Jure,</hi> as well as <hi>de Facto</hi>) standing and in force.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Zeal, was not more (if so much) for the Temple it self, as for God's Command, with respect to the then Holy Services appointed in it: For with respect to the Temple it self, he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that it should be (as not long after, it was) destroyed, <hi>not one Stone thereof left upon another.</hi> But now <hi>it, viz.</hi> that House, or those Houses, which this <hi>Snake</hi> calls <hi>Churches,</hi> and we <hi>Steeple-Houses,</hi> cou'd never pretend to a Divine Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are far from being God's House, 1. For that since the ending of that Legal Dispensation,

we have Divine Authority, <hi>God Dwelleth not in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples made with Hands.</hi> 2. These are so far from being God's Houses, that they are for the most part in their first Erection, dedicated, some to Heathen Deities, and some to Popish Men-made-Saints.</p>
               <p>And if any have called any of those Houses a <hi>Bawdy House,</hi> a <hi>Whore House,</hi> (which yet I never heard, and do much question the Truth of, and which he reports upon bare hear-say) I suppose it was not meant or exprest in a Litteral but Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sense, as Houses wherein Spiritual Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (which False Worship was of old compar'd to by the Prophets) had been committed.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>They value themselves, — from this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God's House, and of all outward things dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his Service, — as if they were more Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual than Christ, or Wiser than he, to think that Outward Institutions were not necessary, to</hi> Guard, <hi>to</hi> Preserve <hi>and to</hi> Improve <hi>the</hi> Inward <hi>and</hi> Spiritual <hi>part of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That a <hi>Steeple-House</hi> cannot be God's House, I have above-shewn, to which I may add, that 'tis below Christianity, and the Gospel-Dispensation, to talk of, and call one of these God's House now, since the Legal Temple is forsaken and destroy'd: The Saints are now his House, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. and 6.19. so for <hi>Outward</hi> things dedicated to God's Service; they did belong to the Legal Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if Christ had judged <hi>Outward Institutions</hi> necessary to <hi>Guard, Preserve</hi> and <hi>Improve</hi> the <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Spiritual part of</hi> Religion, he would not have abolished those which God had so Divinely and Solemnly Commanded. The talking of <hi>Tythes</hi> and <hi>Tribute</hi> due to God, now under the Gospel, (for which that affords no Warrant) is a meer Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and Knack of Priest-Craft: Our detecting and

opposing of which, is the chief Ground of the Priests pouring forth their Rage and Fury upon us; and indeed it is no wonder, for it is not easie for them to part with what the <hi>Snake</hi> calls, the <hi>Baal of Tythes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What he prates, <hi>Ibid.</hi> of <hi>Sacrilege, Robbing of God, in this Gospel-Day, seizing his Tythes, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute due to him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Is only a noise of Words without Sense; and the Course of his Jewish Expressions shew, that he understands not the Gospel-Day. They who were not to appear empty before the Lord, were to bring Outward Sacrifices and Offerings, Oxen, Sheep, Turtles, Flower, Wine, Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If they must not now appear (in that Sense) empty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, but must have something to offer, must that be Outward, as under the Law? If so, why not the same? Pray where did Christ, or his Apostles appoint any Commutation of those, for these now in use, as <hi>Easter</hi> Offerings, Womens Churching (as it is call'd) with a whole Train of such Ceremonial Fragments, from which there is no need to produce any discharge, until he shall have shewn how they became obligatory in the Church at this Day? And after all his Idle Tattle, how little does, (or rather did) he (because of his Abdication) or do too many of the Priests, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard how empty of the Spiritual Sacrifice the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>appear before the Lord,</hi> provided they appear full-handed to them? They may Sacrifice to the Lord that which cost them nothing; (if Prayers ready made, and read out of their Book, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by rote may be said to cost them nothing,) so they do but offer to the Priest that which will yield him something; if he may but have a <hi>Calf from the Stall,</hi> it's much better to him than the <hi>Calves of their Lips</hi>; if he may but have the <hi>Sweat</hi>

of their Brows, it will serve such <hi>Priests</hi> turn, tho God be not in all their thoughts.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 263. <hi>No, not so much as a tenth part, tho' we acknowledge that to have been God's Tribute, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally paid to him, both before and under the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>Tenth was universally paid,</hi> &amp;c. Is but begging the Question, which never was, nor can be prov'd. Before the Law it was never paid, nor but once given as appears, and then expressy call'd a Gift, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.2, 4. Under the Law it was paid by virtue of a Legal Command for it, which extended to none but those that were under the Law, and to them only for the Tythes of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that only during that Law and Priesthood. We can and have produced a fair and full discharge from it under the Gospel, <hi>viz. Heb.</hi> 7.12. tho' there was no need of an express dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge for that which was instituted but for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Yet they are afraid of the Face of Man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There is indeed little sign of it, for had they been affraid of the Face of Man, they had not been <hi>Quakers,</hi> nor had ever been able to hold out in their Testimony against what he calls the <hi>Baal of Tythes,</hi> as it's well known they have done.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>It was said of</hi> Hannibal, <hi>that he never Fought without an</hi> Ambush, <hi>so the</hi> Quakers <hi>never write with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Reserve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is said of a Slanderer, <hi>He that hideth Hatred with Lying Lips, and he that uttereth Slander is a Fool,</hi> Prov. 10.18. This <hi>Snake</hi> has made sure of that Title to himself, for his Hatred has opened his Lying Lips, to expose his Folly, by uttering a Slander, against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> of such a nature, as every Body that reads our Books may Convict him of, nothing being written more plainly, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly and free from reserve, or double meaning, than


<pb n="400" facs="tcp:63041:212"/>
our Writings, and that in the case of Tythes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they are treated of.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 264. <hi>I see the starting Hole that they have left, whereby to escape from what I have before quoted,</hi> viz.
<q>That their Testimony against Tythes, does ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affect a Popish Clergy, than a Protestant Civil Government.</q>
               </p>
               <p>True, it does so; and yet affects both: It does rather affect a Popish Clergy, as 1st, reputing every Clergy (however otherwise denominated) which exacts Tythes, in that (and so far) Popish: And 2<hi>dly,</hi> it affects the Clergy principally, as those that have abused the Civil Governments, and drawn them to Spoil their Honest and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Protestant Subjects, for not feeding the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy with Tythes.</p>
               <p>But that we never endeavoured to <hi>Smooth it to the Government,</hi> as he words it, or to persuade them that we refused Tythes to one sort of Priests, or of Men only; our constant practice in denying to pay Tythes to any, and therefore Suffering does sufficiently disprove.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>They grievously accuse</hi> F. Bugg, <hi>in that he most shamefully Quarrels with the</hi> Quakers, <hi>for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing and asserting his</hi> (Wickliff's) <hi>and other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Protestants and Martyrs Testimonies, against the Corruption, and Priests, and Popish Imposition and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of Tythes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And not without very good reason; for <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff</hi>'s Testimony, as ours is, was against the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Priest, both in Life and Doctrine, against the Imposition of Tythes, or any forced Maintenance, which he would have had left free.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 265. <hi>But will the</hi> Quakers <hi>be ty'd to the Opinion of those Men in other things? No, surely. — Why then should they think to tye us to their Opinion as to Tythes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:63041:212"/>This is extreamly Shallow, will the Priests of any sort, or this <hi>Snake</hi> himself, who quote the Opinions of those they call <hi>Fathers</hi> (as <hi>Origen, Tertullian, Cyprian, Chrysostome, Augustine, Jerome,</hi> &amp;c.) be ty'd to the Opinions of those Men in all things? If not, why then should he think to tye others, against whom they alledge the Opinions of those Men, to those Opinions for which they alledge them?</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 266. <hi>Tythes were paid to</hi> Melchisedec, <hi>long before</hi> Levi, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tythes were not <hi>paid</hi> to <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> but <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> (that's the word used both by <hi>Moses,</hi> Gen. 14.20. and by the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.2, 4.) and that but once, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 14.20. and that, not of Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but of the Spoil of War.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>The</hi> Evangelical Priesthood <hi>is after the Order of</hi> Melchisedec, <hi>and therefore they claim Tythes, as being due to that Order of Priesthood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Tythes were due to <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> or to the Order of his Priesthood; is <hi>gratis Dictum,</hi> a begging of the Question, which I deny the <hi>Snake</hi> to prove. That the <hi>Evangelical Priesthood</hi> is after the order of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> is a false Notion, deny'd and disprov'd by some of great Note in the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I instance for the present, <hi>Andrew Willet,</hi> in his <hi>Synopsis of Popery,</hi> fifth General Controversy, p. 315. where writing against the Popish Priests, who claim'd by this same Plea, which the <hi>Snake</hi> now claims, says, <hi>It is great Blasphemy to say, that every Popish Priest is after the order of</hi> Melchisedec.</p>
               <p>And that none may think he says this only of <hi>Popish Priests,</hi> because they are <hi>Popish,</hi> he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards adds, <hi>The Scripture maketh this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Priesthood of</hi> Aaron, <hi>and the Priesthood of</hi>

Melchisedec, <hi>that the Priests of the Law were many, because they were taken away by Death: But</hi> Christ<hi>'s Priesthood is Eternal, he Dyeth not,</hi> Heb. 7.23. <hi>But if there should be</hi> many <hi>Priests after</hi> Melchisedec<hi>'s Order, there should herein be no difference at all.</hi> Wherefore seeing <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s Priesthood only resteth in <hi>Christ,</hi> and is not translated to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — Thus far he, which plainly shews, that he excludes all Priests, even the Gospel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, from being of the Order of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> which he confines to <hi>Christ</hi> only; and herein he hath the Warrant of <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.24. Where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaking of the Priesthood of <hi>Christ</hi> after the order of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> saith, <hi>But this Man, because he endureth ever, hath a Priesthood which cannot pass from one to another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the same purpose, <hi>Edw. Reynolds,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> in his Works, printed 1658. p. 528. speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Priesthood of Christ, and shewing that the Popish Priests (who, as well as the Priests in the Reformation, pretend to the Evangelical Priesthood) were not after the order of <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec,</hi> saith thus, <hi>The Priesthood of</hi> Melchisedec as Type, <hi>and of</hi> Christ <hi>as the Substance was <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And if the <hi>Snake</hi> follow his own Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> That a <hi>Bishop</hi> be to be follow'd as <hi>Christ</hi>'s Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent; I see not how he will avoid throwing away his idle and false notion, <hi>That the Evangelical Priesthood is after the order of</hi> Melchisedec, because the Priests of <hi>England</hi> are made such by Humane and Ecclesiastical Ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="403" facs="tcp:63041:213"/>Thus, <hi>Reader,</hi> by the Testimony of two Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Doctors of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> one of them a Bishop, is refuted his bold but groundless Assertion, that the <hi>Evangelical Priesthood is after the order of</hi> Melchisedec, and consequently his Claim to Tythes, as due to that order, does of necessity fall to the Ground with it.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 267. <hi>Nor is</hi> Melchisedec<hi>'s Tything of</hi> Abraham, <hi>mentioned as the beginning or first rise of Tythes, but it is told only occasionally, and as a thing well known and received in those early Ages.</hi>

               <p>But further, if we should suppose (according to his <hi>Blasphemous,</hi> as before observ'd, pretence) that the <hi>Evangelical Priesthood were after the order of</hi> Melchisedec, and that Tythes were payable to them after the order of <hi>Aaron</hi> (which is most absurd and ridiculous to believe) let us a little see how the payment of Tythes at that day, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate with the Exaction of Tythes in this: For the better clearing of which, I will set down those


<pb n="404" facs="tcp:63041:214"/>
four Texts which the <hi>Snake</hi> quotes (but gives not the words, because that would have done him Disservice as we shall see anon) for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>The first, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.24. <hi>But the Tythes of the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>which they offer as an heave-Offering unto the Lord, I have given to the Levites to Inherit: Therefore I have said unto them, among the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>they shall have no Inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.1. <hi>The Priests and the Levites, and all the Tribe of</hi> Levi <hi>shall have no part nor Inheritance with</hi> Israel: <hi>They shall eat the Offerings of the Lord made by Fire, and his Inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third and fourth are, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.32, 33. <hi>And concerning the Tithe of the Herd, or of the Flock, even of whatsoever passed under the Rod; the Tenth shall be Holy unto the Lord. He shall not search, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or bad, neither shall he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be Holy, it shall not be redeem'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From these Texts of Scripture it appears, <hi>First,</hi> that the Tythes were Ceremonial, in that they were not given to the Levites, till they were first offered <hi>as an Heave-offering unto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Priests and Levites, who had a portion of the Tythes for their use, after they had been so offered as an <hi>Heave-Offering,</hi> had not that portion only for their Service in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but because <hi>Among the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>(God said) they shall have no Inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when thus by a particular Command of God concerning them, they were cut off from their portion of Land, a twelfth among the Tribes, it pleased God to appoint them a Tenth, for that their Deprivation.</p>
               <p>But then it is also further to be considered, that Tythes were of two sorts, 1<hi>st,</hi> those of every


<pb n="405" facs="tcp:63041:214"/>
Year, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.23, 24, 25, 26. of these every one that paid them, was also to eat his share, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>Thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, in the place which he shall chuse to place his Name there, the Tythe of thy Corn, of thy Wine, and of thine Oil,</hi> &amp;c. And if by reason of distance from the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> or <hi>Temple,</hi> the Person paying his <hi>Tythes,</hi> cou'd not bring them in kind, he was then at Liberty to <hi>turn it into Money,</hi> ver. 25. and <hi>bestow that Money</hi> (ver. 26.) <hi>for whatsoever his soul lusteth after, for Oxen, or for Sheep, or for Wine, or for strong drink</hi> — And thou <hi>shalt eat thereof, before the Lord thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou and thine Houshold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This for the Tythes of every Year; Then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, There was those of every Third Year, and they were not only given to the <hi>Levite,</hi> but also to the <hi>Stranger,</hi> the <hi>Fatherless,</hi> and the <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> ver. 29. — <hi>And the Stranger, the Fatherless, and the Widow, which are within thy Gates, shall come and shall eat, and be satisfied; that the Lord thy God may bless thee, in all the work of thine hand, which thou doest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a brief Account of these <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Tythes, and the manner of their Payment, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Law from whence the <hi>Snake</hi> pretends to fetch his Authority for their continuance at this Day. Now, according to this Rule, let me ask the <hi>Snake</hi>;</p>
               <p>Whether the Tythes at this Day claim'd by the Priests, be first offer'd <hi>as an Heave-offering unto the Lord,</hi> which those in the Law were to be, before they were given to the Levites: And to offer these Tythes as <hi>an Heave-Offering,</hi> does necessarily infer both a Sacrifice and an Altar, without which the Tythes given by that Law were unholy?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Priesthood at this Day are under no Sentence of Deprivation, from <hi>Inheritances in the


<pb n="406" facs="tcp:63041:215"/>
Land,</hi> as were the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi>; they may and do (many of them) acquire large Possessions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do they let the <hi>Stranger, the Fatherless, and the Widow</hi> (to whom of Right they did belong, as well as to the Priests and Levites) partake with them of the Tythes? Or do the Priests at this Day let the <hi>Persons,</hi> with their Housholds, from whom they exact the Tythes, partake of them, with themselves: For to them that paid the Tythes, it is said, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.26. <hi>And thou shalt eat thereof, before the Lord thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou and thine houshold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, The <hi>Snake</hi> says (p. 266.) <hi>all their Arguments, as to the</hi> Law <hi>and</hi> Levitical <hi>Priesthood being superseded, operate nothing against Priests of a Superiour and more excellent Priesthood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they are not superseded, for the Objections still remain; and the Arguments heretofore offer'd by our Friends, are Unanswer'd; as are these I have here already given, and more that follow: So that they do <hi>operate</hi> effectually against the claim of Tythes, from the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood, upon the false and vain pretence of being <hi>Priests after the Order of</hi> Melchisedec; to pretend to which, Bishop <hi>Reynolds,</hi> p. 528. says, Is <hi>Most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiously</hi> to Rob Christ of his Honour.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>And there being as</hi> Ancient <hi>mention of Tythes, as there is of Priesthood in the World, I have no manner of doubt but they are as</hi> Ancient <hi>as Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood it self, that is as</hi> Adam.</p>

                  </gap> have already observ'd, That the earliest men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tythes in the World, is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.18. concerning <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> less ancient than <hi>Adam,</hi> by more than Two Thousand Years; and therefore <hi>I have no manner of doubt</hi> (which is Answer Sufficient to such Insufficient Arguing) that the <hi>Snake</hi> is quite out in making Tythes as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient


<pb n="407" facs="tcp:63041:215"/>
as <hi>Adam</hi>: But if Tythes were as <hi>Ancient</hi> as <hi>Adam,</hi> who paid Tythes? To whom were they paid? And when were they paid?</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Knowledge of Tythes, as of Sacrifices and Priesthood, descended from</hi> Adam,</p>
               <p>Is <hi>Gratis Dictum,</hi> much of Confidence and Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but no Proof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the one was the Maintenance, the other the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Priesthood; and therefore one must be as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the other,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is no true Consequent. For in those elder times, and before the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood was Instituted, every one was (in a Sense) his own Priest, and offer'd for himself, as appears in the first Recorded Instances of Sacrifice offer'd by <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> each in his own Person, and so downwards: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as after the Institution of the Levitical Priesthood, it was peculiarly the Priests office, to offer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for all the People: And till the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was settled in <hi>Levi</hi>'s Tribe, there was no need of a settled Maintenance, nor does there any foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of any such appear.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>They were all alike received by the Heathen World, by an Immemorial Tradition, from the beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Immemorial Tradition!</hi> A Fable, which in many things has been long and often falsly pretended in the Church, of which in the lump, hear Bishop <hi>Taylor,</hi> in his Liberty of Prophecying, p. 95. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 1647.
<q>To Dispute (says he) concerning the Truth or necessity of Traditions, in the Questions of our Times, is as if Historians Disputing about a Question in the <hi>English Story,</hi> should fall on wrangling, whether <hi>Livy</hi> or <hi>Plutarch,</hi> were the best Writers: And the earnest Disputes about Traditions are to no better purpose. For no Church at this Day admits the one half of those things, which certainly by the Fathers were


<pb n="408" facs="tcp:63041:216"/>
called Traditions Apostolical; and no Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Ancient Writers does consign the one half of the present Questions to be, or not to be Traditions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he, which as it shews the light esteem and little dependence which is to be had on <hi>Tradition,</hi> pretended Apostolical; so necessarily it includes, at the least as great, if not greater uncertainty, and as little, if not less dependence, on pretended, Heathen <hi>Immemorial Traditions.</hi> But for his more full Conviction herein, I shall add one more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, particularly respecting his pretence of <hi>Heathen Immemorial Tradition,</hi> upon this Point of Tythes. It is <hi>Richard Hooker</hi>'s, <hi>Ecclesiastical Polity,</hi> Printed 1622. Book V. p. 427. Sect. 79. His Words are these.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And as <hi>Abraham gave voluntarily,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> vowed to give God Tythes; so the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> did require from the Hands of all Men, the self same kind of Tribute, the Tenth of their Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Insomuch that <hi>Paynims, being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Followers of</hi> their Steps, paid Tythes likewise.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And that the <hi>Heathens</hi> were herein, as in several of their Religious Performances, borrowers from the <hi>Jews,</hi> is not only the Opinion of this, but many other Learned Men.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 267. <hi>God reserv'd the</hi> Tenth <hi>Part of our</hi> Substance, <hi>as the</hi> Seventh <hi>of our</hi> Time, <hi>to be paid as a</hi> Tribute, <hi>and an</hi> acknowledgment <hi>to Him, from whom we receive all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Non constat.</hi> No such <hi>Reserve</hi> ever was, or can be made appear, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses.</hi> By <hi>Moses</hi> 'tis granted, God made a <hi>Reserve</hi> of a <hi>Tenth</hi> part, not of <hi>our</hi> Substance, but of some part of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his then peculiar People, the People of <hi>Israel</hi> outwardly, of the Increase of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when they should come into the Possession


<pb n="409" facs="tcp:63041:216"/>
of it. And this Reserve he made (as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shewn) for the Maintenance of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> the Poor, Fatherless, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Tribe</hi> he then Consecrated wholly to the Priesthood, and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from their share of the Land, at the Division thereof among their Brethren. And as this is the only <hi>Reserve</hi> of the <hi>Tenth,</hi> which it appears God did ever make. So neither the <hi>Heathens</hi> at that Day, nor the <hi>Christians</hi> in this, were, or are at all oblig'd by it, or concern'd with it.</p>
               <p>The Heathens were not oblig'd by it, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd with it, because, what the Law said, it said to those that were under it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. which the Heathens were not.</p>
               <p>The Christians are not oblig'd by it, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd with it; because the <hi>Tenth</hi> was appropriated to that Priesthood, Worship, and Oeconomy of the Jews, which lasted no longer than <hi>till the time of Reformation, Heb.</hi> 9.10. till Christ was offer'd up, the Author and Institutor of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And this by the way shews, that Tythes are now so far from being a part of God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that it is an Implicit Denial that Christ is come in the Flesh: To which I may add, that Tythes were so particularly restricted to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that though the <hi>Jews</hi> had Substance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came into that Land, yet they paid no Tythes, before they came into possession of it, as they pay none since they were dispossessed of it.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>The</hi> Priests <hi>being made the</hi> Receivers <hi>(be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot Pay them to God immediately) is but a secondary Consideration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And a third necessary Consideration is, who made these <hi>Priests</hi> the <hi>Receivers?</hi> If the <hi>Snake</hi> can, for the Priesthood, produce an express Commission from God to them to receive the Tythes, as due to him now under the Gospel, let the <hi>Snake</hi> do it?


<pb n="410" facs="tcp:63041:217"/>
He knows he can produce no such Commission, no Warrant, no Authority, and therefore would In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it from the Impossibility of paying <hi>Tythes to God immediately</hi>: But the Inference is false; for if it were granted that Tythes were now due to God (which nothing but an express Reservation now, as heretofore in the Levitical Law could make) yet it would not thence follow, that the Priests must be the Receivers, unless God as expresly had Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and Deputed them thereunto.</p>
               <p>The Divine Wisdom did not think such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference sufficient to make the <hi>Levitical Priesthood</hi> a Title to Tythes, for having made a <hi>Reservation</hi> then of the Tythes of that Land to Himself, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.30. He transfer'd that <hi>Right</hi> to that <hi>Priesthood</hi> by express Donation, in these Words. <hi>I have given the Children of Levi all the Tenth in Israel for an Inheritance,</hi> Numb. 18.21. And this express deed of Gift extended no further, nor to any other <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> but that which was to do, and did the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation,</hi> ver. 23, Let the <hi>Snake,</hi> who now claims Tythes for the <hi>Priests,</hi> shew such a Deed of Gift, make such a Title to Tythes for them, if he can.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 267. <hi>Therefore the Substraction of</hi> Tythes, <hi>as of other</hi> Offerings, <hi>is call'd a</hi> Robbing, <hi>not of the Priest, but of God,</hi> Mal. 3.8.</p>
               <p>He should have said <hi>was call'd,</hi> not <hi>is call'd,</hi> as speaking of <hi>Malachy</hi>'s time, the time of the Law. Tythes were then his peculiar Right, by vertue of his special Reservation thereof for his <hi>Priests,</hi> in that Dispensation: But since that is ended by <hi>Christ,</hi> once Offering of himself, the Substraction of Tythes is no more a Robbing of God now, than the Substraction of those other Legal Offerings can be so called.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:63041:217"/>Ibid. p. 268. <hi>It is invading what God has reserv'd pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Himself, that we may not touch it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It was so after the Reservation of them was made, which began with the Levitical Priesthood, and it continu'd to be so, so long as that Reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continu'd, which was, as long as that <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> stood, and no longer. In the time of the Law, the Offerings which were by God assign'd as a part of the Priests Maintenance, were not to be touch'd, not to be taken by the People from them, any more than the Tythes from the Levites: And it was as much a Robbing of God in with-holding those Offerings then, as in with-holding the Tythes then: For Tythes and Offerings are joyn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8. and the with-holding of either call'd Robbery then. And it is no more a Robbing of God in with-holding the Tythes, than in with-holding those Offerings now. For as with respect to positive Command, they both came in together, so by the Abrogating that Law which requir'd them, they both went out together; that Dispensation being ended, to which they were adapted and subservient.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Of all the other Trees of the Garden we may freely eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Comparing Tythes to the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Good and Evil, is a whimsical conceit in the <hi>Snake.</hi> The Fruit of that Tree was forbidden at the first, and to all Mankind; so that by his Comparison of Tythes to it, the Priests ought not to eat of Tythes any more than other Men.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>And this is the same Sacrilege, as to tast of the forbidden fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was it Sacrilege then to tast of the forbidden Fruit? Yes, says the <hi>Snake: That was the first sin. It was Sacrilege.</hi> A bold Fellow at Dogmatizing: But how proves he that? Is <hi>Adam</hi> any where in


<pb n="412" facs="tcp:63041:218"/>
Scripture taxed with Sacrilege, or only with the Sin of Disobedience, in breaking God's Command, that he should not eat of the Fruit of that Tree? <hi>Or,</hi> is the breach of every Negative Precept Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege?</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>And I am not afraid to say, that all are Guilty of it, who have seiz'd upon the Tythes of God, and pay them not to his Priests.</hi>

               <p>Reader, Here's a <hi>Doughty</hi> Clerk, who says he is <hi>not afraid,</hi> yet is afraid to say it with his Name to it: A Bold Fellow in the Dark, while he may think no Body sees or knows him, so as to detect him, and can by Lurking, keep out of danger. But is this Man fit, if we deserv'd it, to tax us with Disloyalty, who is so eminent herein, as to have lost decent respect to the Government, by thus impeaching all the Protestant Princes that have sat upon the English Throne since <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, with being guilty of the sin of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege?</p>
               <p>He begins (p. 269.) with <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth whom he charges with <hi>instead of restoring</hi> Tythes to the Secular Clergy, more <hi>Sacrilegiously impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating them to the Laity.</hi> And yet this was in the latter part of that King's Reign, when (for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reason at first) he was less obsequious to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and gave some way to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> plac'd by History among the best of Princes, as they went further than their Father in the Reformation; so they persever'd in <hi>Impropriating</hi> to the Laity those Tythes which they found in the hands of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Regular Clergy, (as they were then call'd) or which from his time remain'd in the Crown. Nor can any one Prince, from <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. to this time, escape the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Impious Sentence of <hi>Sacrilege</hi>;


<pb n="413" facs="tcp:63041:218"/>
unless haply Queen <hi>Mary</hi> (who is said to have at least desir'd and endeavour'd the restoring of Tythes) may obtain his absolution, as having, perhaps in his sense, thereby sufficiently atton'd for that Sea of Martyrs Blood which She shed. But this high Impeachment stops not at the Throne; No, but takes in almost all Ranks and Degrees of Men. For what was done in taking those Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate Tythes from the Clergy, had the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Confirmation of both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nay, he impeaches such of the Martyrs as were Bishops in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, (as <hi>Cranmer, Ridly</hi> and <hi>Latimer,</hi>) who as Members of the Upper House, must be supposed to be then sitting, and thereby Parties to those Acts of Parliament for Impropriations. Nor does his Charge extend to the Men of that Age only, but to all ever since, whether Prince, Lord or Commoner, who hath, or ever had any Estate in Impropriate Tythes, and have not paid them to the Priests; (of which among the Nobility and Gentry especially, there are very many.) He Proclaims he is <hi>not afraid to say they are Guilty of Sacrilege.</hi> And what must be their Doom, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And to this of the <hi>Snake,</hi> let this be added, that had he not made further addition, he had said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths enough before: <hi>Several Kings of</hi> England! Let him instance if he can, any one King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> who had the <hi>Sole Right and Property in all the Lands of</hi> England. And next, that any King, either singly or jointly, with his People, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate <hi>all the whole Tythes of the Lands of</hi> England <hi>to God.</hi> And when he has done that, or (rather) something towards it (for what he has here said he can never make Good.) Let him also set forth the Grounds on which any such <hi>Vows</hi> were made, that they may be compar'd with that of <hi>Jacob</hi>; and that the <hi>Reader</hi> may see what Religion and Principles those Kings were of, and for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons they made those Vows, and dedicated Tythes, as he says. When this be done, what he shall offer, may be further Consider'd. But his saying in the Close of this Paragraph, <hi>That the same has been confirm'd by several Acts of Parliament,</hi> shews his Partiality and Hypocrisie who can urge Acts of Parliament for Confirming, but Damn not only Acts of Parliament, but Parliaments and Kings too, for putting any of those Tythes into Lay-hands.</p>

                  <pb n="415" facs="tcp:63041:219"/>Ibid. p. 269. <hi>It was the Friars and Schoolmen who first set up the Notion of Tythes being Eleemosinary.— And they</hi> (the Quakers) <hi>have only lick'd up the Spittle of the most Corrupt part of the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>and gone into the Scandal of our Reformation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That Tythes were Eleemosinary, was asserted, maintained and defended, not only by our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman <hi>Wickliff,</hi> but by <hi>John Huss, Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> the Churches of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and others, first Reformers from Popery: Did all these <hi>Lick up the Spittle of the most Corrupt part of the Church of</hi> Rome?

               <p>Ibid. <hi>But the High Places were not taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The High Places among the Heathen and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Jews, to which he here alludes, were the <hi>Groves</hi> and <hi>Oratories</hi> where their Altars stood; where they offer'd the Sacrifices, and perform'd the Ceremonies of their Superstitious Worships. Parallel to these (in his Allusion) must be those Houses which are commonly call'd <hi>Churches,</hi> in which the Papists had their Alta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and were wont to offer their Idolatrous Sacrifice of the <hi>Mass,</hi> and perform the rest of their Superstitious Devotions. <hi>These were not taken away:</hi> Is that it he complains of? <hi>Reader,</hi> can'st thou pitty him that he had that occasion left him to Grumble?</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Our Iehu Reformer, destroy'd indeed</hi> Baal <hi>out of the Land,</hi> (2 Kings 10.28, 29.) <hi>but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not from the Sin of the Golden Calves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whom can he here mean, by <hi>Iehu Reformer,</hi> not <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. sure? For he did not destroy <hi>Baal</hi> out of the Land, (if either by <hi>Baal,</hi> the <hi>Snake</hi> here means the Idol then worshipped; or, as he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore express'd it, the <hi>Baal of Tythes,</hi>) But left the Mass standing, and the Popish Priests in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of it.

                  <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. or Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> when by suppressing the Mass, they <hi>Destroy'd Baal,</hi> departed not from the Sin of the Golden Calves, (which were Idols set up to be worshipp'd instead of <hi>Baal</hi>) the more's the Pity. Thus this allusion of his, to the <hi>Golden Calves,</hi> with his former to the <hi>High Places,</hi> makes not for the Credit of the Reformation, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of that Church which he pretends to be of.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 270. <hi>They Simper with half a Mouth, and say they mean it not against a Civil Protestant Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when no longer since, than in their</hi> Yearly Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, — 1693. — <hi>It is positively enjoin'd,</hi>
                  <q>That none should Pay Tythes, but refuse the payment thereof, as an Antichristian Yoak of Bondage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which is least offensive, to <hi>Simper with half a Mouth</hi>; or tell a Lye with a whole Mouth, as he does? But setting aside his simple Flout, of <hi>Simper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> 'Tis false, that we did ever tell, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to persuade the <hi>Civil Government,</hi> that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Tythes to one sort of Priests, or Men only, (for we have always refus'd them to all sorts of Demanders.) And therefore when in the Yearly Epistle 1693. it was advised (not as the <hi>Snake</hi> says, <hi>positively injoin'd</hi>)
<q>That our Christian Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which we have greatly suffer'd for, be born against the grand Oppression and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Yoak of Tythes.</q>
It was but agreeable to our Practice since we were first a People; and very good advice it was, because agreeable to the Apostles Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Where do they find any Law of Christ against Tythes? no, they are not able to produce one word, or any thing like it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hebrews</hi> the 7th affords enough (if he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low what is there written to be a Law of Christ) against Tythes. There are words enough to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest


<pb n="417" facs="tcp:63041:220"/>
that Tythes were abrogated by Christ, as well as Circumcision, Sacrifices, and other things depending on the Ceremonial Law. There it is said expresly, vers. 12. <hi>The Priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the</hi> Law. If it be ask'd, what <hi>Law?</hi> He had said before, vers. 5. <hi>They that are of the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>who receive the Office of the Priesthood, have a Commandment to take Tythes of the People according to the Law.</hi> Hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that by the Change of the Priesthood, there was made also a Change of that Law, according to which the Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> who received the Office of the Priesthood, had a Command to take Tythes of the People. What can be plainer? Yet more, if needed, might be urged from vers. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where it is said, <hi>There is verily a</hi> disannulling <hi>of the</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>going before, for the weakness and unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof.</hi> What Commandment was this which was disannulled? That Carnal Commandment mentioned <hi>vers.</hi> 5, 16. after which the Levitical Priesthood was made and maintain'd. Here then, that Law, that Commandment by which the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Priesthood took Tythes of that People is declar'd to have been chang'd, and that Change explain'd by the word <hi>Disannulled:</hi> If this be not <hi>one word against Tythes, or any thing like it.</hi> Let the Reader Judge.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>But on the Contrary, there are plain</hi> Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>in the Gospel of their Continuance, particularly,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.13, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Intimations?</hi> Oh! Oh! is it come to that, must the world be Decimated by <hi>Intimations!</hi> Does <hi>God's Right, God's Due, God's Tythes</hi> depend upon <hi>Intimations</hi> at last! Must all our Kings and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. till now, all the Nobility, Gentry and others concern'd in with-holding <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations</hi> from the <hi>Priests</hi> be Damn'd for <hi>Sacrilege</hi>


                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:63041:221"/>
upon Intimation only! This sufficiently <hi>Intimates</hi> what sort of Fellow this <hi>Snake</hi> must be. Well, let us see how plain his <hi>Intimations are,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13, 14. The words of the Text are, <hi>Do ye not know, that they which Minister about Holy Things, live</hi> (in the Margin, <hi>feed) of the things of the Temple? And they which wait at the Altar, are Partakers with the Altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which Preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel.</hi> Here's not so much as the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Tythes,</hi> and will he call this <hi>a plain Intimation,</hi> that Tythes should be continu'd! So far from it, that this place neither speaks of Tythes, nor the Levites who took them: For to the Levites were the Tythes given, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.21. (not to the Priests, they were to have but the Hundredth Part; the Tythes of the Tythes, <hi>vers.</hi> 26, 27, 28.) and the Levites were so far from Ministring about the Holy Things, that they were not permitted to touch them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.15. No, nor to see them, <hi>vers.</hi> 20. on pain of Death. But <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, the Priests, were commanded to take down the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle upon any remove, and to pack up, and cover close all the Parts and Utensils therof, <hi>vers.</hi> 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the Levites might come near to take up and carry their Burdens; which was the service of the Tabernacle they were appointed to. But it is evident that the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. spake not of the Levites, but the Priests, them that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred about Holy Things, them that waited at the Altar, them that Liv'd, Eat or Fed of the Things offer'd on the Altar, and so partook with the Altar. Hence this place is so far from <hi>Intimating</hi> a continuance of Tythes, that if a continuance of any thing were <hi>intimated</hi> here, it must be a continuace of those Offerings at the Temple, and at the Altar, which belonged to the Ceremonial Law; which, as


<pb n="419" facs="tcp:63041:221"/>
on all occasions the Apostle shews, was abrogated, so he would in no wise <hi>Intimate</hi> the continuance of it. But further, if the Apostle had spoke of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, and mentioned the Name of Tythes in his comparison, yet his Allusion to those Legal and Shadowy things, wou'd still have (as what he mentions hath) served his purpose very well, to convince the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that since <hi>Christ</hi> had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.7, 8. that they <hi>who preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, should live of the Gospel,</hi> as well as they, who, under the Law, ministred about Holy Things, and waited at the Altar, were then to partake with the Altar. And thus he, and the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles might freely, and without blame, live of the Gospel, while they preached the Gospel, by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving such necessaries as were freely offered them, by those that received and embraced the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 271. <hi>But we need no new Commandment for them in the Gospel, if they are not forbidden, and abrogated by</hi> Christ.</p>
               <p>The contrary way of arguing is of more force, <hi>viz.</hi> There needed not a positive or express Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or verbal Abrogation of Tythes, in the Gospel. For if they are not expresly Commanded to be continu'd under the Gospel, they are not of force, that Law being temporary by which they were Commanded, and now expired. It was adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Oeconomy of the <hi>Jews,</hi> made to answer that Dispensation, appropriated to that Levitical Tribe and Typical Priesthood, restrained to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> (no other spot of Ground, under the Sun, being Tythable by vertue of that Law,) and all this limitted to <hi>the Time of Reformation,</hi> Heb. 9.10. The coming of Christ in the Flesh, and offering up himself to his Father, on the Cross, an Attonement for Mankind. So that an Express Abrogation of Tythes in the Gospel was no more


<pb n="420" facs="tcp:63041:222"/>
necessary, than an Express Repeal of an Act of Parliament, which was but Temporary, and would expire of course at the end of that Term for which it was appointed.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>They are no part of the Typical or Ceremonial Law; and nothing else of the Law was abrogated by Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, <hi>Snake,</hi> this is striving against the Stream, and giving the Lie to Protestant Writers, both at home and abroad. For the <hi>Readers</hi> satisfaction I shall mention some.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. §. 4. says, <hi>The payment of Tythes, as it was a Ceremonial Duty is obrogated by Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Willet,</hi> in his <hi>Synopsis of Popery,</hi> (before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) <hi>Fifth General Controversie,</hi> p. 314. arguing against the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> who (with the <hi>Snake</hi>) affirm'd, that the payment of Tythes is a Natural Duty, that Men owe to God in all times, and to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his Priests in his behalf for his Honour, says,
<q>St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith in flat words, If the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood be changed, of necessity also there must be a change of the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. But the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Law is altered and changed, <hi>ergo,</hi> also the Law of the Priesthood, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Duty of Tythes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Wilson,</hi> in his <hi>Christian Dictionary,</hi> on the word Tythes (tho a zealous contender for them) acknowledges that they were a <hi>Shadow</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> as other Oblations were <hi>figuring</hi> Christ.</p>
               <p>Among Foreigners, I shall first instance <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius,</hi> in <hi>Harm. Evang. C.</hi> 109. He having distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished Tythes into Political and Ecclesiastical, says of the Ecclesiastical Tythes thus,
<q>Porro, quia ex hac Disputatione Christi cum Pharisaeis patet, Christum decimarum solutionem inter <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniales</hi> Leges rejecisse, opponit enim iis Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium &amp; Charitatem Dei, hoc est forenses &amp; morales Leges, Ceremonialis autem Lex per ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventum


<pb n="421" facs="tcp:63041:222"/>
Christi est sublata, — ideo non inepte quaeritur, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreover seeing by this Dispute of Christ with the Pharisees, it appears that Christ threw off</hi> the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tythes among the Ceremonial Laws <hi>(for to them he opposes Judgment and the Love of God, that is, the Judicial and Moral Laws) and the Ceremonial Law is taken away by the Coming of Christ, — there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not unfitly inquired,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I shall next Instance <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> of great Note in the Reformation, who in his Common Places, <hi>Clas.</hi> 4. <hi>l.</hi> 13. <hi>De Magistratu,</hi> §. 18. says,
<q>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum debemus Intelligere, <hi>Decimas olim pertinuisse ad Ceremonias</hi> idque tam in <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> quam in Levitis, <hi>i. e.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>First we ought to understand, that Tythes did of old belong to Ceremonies, and that as well in</hi> Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec <hi>as in the Levites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then having shew'd how and wherein Tythes were Typical, and having also declared that the Ministers now, do not receive Tythes by the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law, but upon a Moral Account as a Compensation for work, he says,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Proinde Ministris sive persolvantur ex agris, sive ex aedibus, sive pecunia numerata, sive in Decimis, nil refert: Modo non sordide sed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neste sustententur, <hi>i. e.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Therefore whether their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Maintenance be paid out of the Feilds, or out of the Houses, or in ready Mony, or in Tythes, it is all one to the Ministers; so they be maintained creditably, not meanly.</hi> To this he adds,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Retinent quidem alicubi Mercedes istae vetus nomen Decimarum, in multis autem Locis, non appellantur Decime, sed Stipendia &amp; Salaria. Et sane potius revera sunt Mercedes, quae Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus Ministrorum debentur quam Decime, <hi>i. e.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>In some Places those Wages retain the old Name of Tythes, but in many Places they are not called Tythes,


<pb n="422" facs="tcp:63041:223"/>
but Stipends and Salaries. And truly they are in reality rather Wages, which are due for the Ministers Labours than Tythes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of all which, this appears to be the Sum, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martyr,</hi> tho' he thought Ministers Maintenance might be given them in that Proportion of a Tenth: Yet he positively concludes Tythes as Tythes, and in their own Nature to be a part of the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law abrogated by Christ.</p>
               <p>The third Witness from abroad, which I shall bring, is <hi>Zanchius. Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 116. <hi>De Cultu Dei Externo.</hi> Where, distinguishing between the <hi>Quota</hi> and the <hi>Alliquota</hi> of Maintenance, between Maintenance in General, and Maintenance particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by <hi>Tythes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He says,

                  </q>
                  <hi>All these Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning First-Fruits, Tythes, and Vows may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a twofold respect, as to the Substance, and as to the Accidents or Circumstances. As far as concerns the Substance, they belong to us also: For the sum and end of those Laws was this, That the People might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their thankfulness to God by the offering of these things; and that for the profit of the Church, that is, of the Ecclesiastical Ministry, the Ministers and the Poor, as we have now shewed out of the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And are we not commanded by the Law of Nature to do the same? That the Ministers should be sustain'd at the Costs of the Faithful Members of the Church; the Apostle demonstrates not only from the Law of Moses, but from the Law of Nature also, that the Widows, the Poor and the Strangers, should be maintain'd, is frequently Taught in the New Testament too. And as clear it is from the same Books, that the whole Ministry of the Church ought to be kept; but how shall all this be done? By a</hi> Contribution <hi>of Goods, whether under the Name of First-Fruits, or of Tythes, or of Vows, or</hi> under any other name <hi>it matters not. Therefore as to what concerns the Substance and End of these Laws, of First-Fruits, Tythes and Vows, those Laws as Natural belongs also to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Zanchius,</hi> who in all this, pleads only from the Equity of the Law, for a Sufficient Maintenance to the Ministers, from the Faithful of the Church. And of what Nature he accounts Tythes, may be easily seen, by his coupling them with First-Fruits and Vows, which none I think, doubt to have belong'd to the Ceremonial Law: But if any shall yet suppose, that he did not suppose Tythes to be part of the Ceremonial Law, he puts it beyond doubt, that he did so esteem them: For he says,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:63041:224"/>
                  <q>At vero Circumstantiae considerentur illarum Legum, — Leges <hi>illae nihil ad nos,</hi> ut qui Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus <hi>Ceremonialibus</hi> &amp; Politiis istius Populi, non Sumus Subjecti, <hi>i. e.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>But if the Circumstances of of those Laws be considered,</hi> — those Laws do not at all belong to us, <hi>who are not Subject to the</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial <hi>and Political Laws of that People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And treating further upon the same subject, p. 485. he saith,

                  <hi>Certain it is, that the Law concerning the paying of Tythes also was abrogated by Christ.</hi>

               <p>This, with more to the same purpose, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Reader may find in him, and which I omit not being willing to be too prolix: And besides the Testimonies above cited, I could also add from <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> on <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. from <hi>Melancton, De Libertate Christianae,</hi> with others; whose joynt Testimonies do overthrow the false and bold As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of this <hi>Snake,</hi> who is so remarkably Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in a Confident Assurance, as to say of Tythes, <hi>They are no part of the Typical or Ceremonial Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And tho' to the knowing <hi>Reader</hi> it might seem superfluous to bring witnesses further to prove Tythes a part of the Ceremonial Law: Yet I shall take leave to add one witness more, if not for his Information in so known and received a Truth, yet for the more full detecting of this our Adversary.</p>
               <p>This Witness, is the <hi>Snake</hi> against the <hi>Snake,</hi> who in p. 267. says expresly, <hi>They were part of the Offerings to God under the Law,</hi> for which he cites <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.24. (as I have observ'd, p. 403, 404, 405.) Where they are indeed call'd an <hi>Offering,</hi> and an <hi>Heave-Offering</hi> unto the Lord, the words of that Textare, <hi>But the Tythes of the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>which


<pb n="425" facs="tcp:63041:224"/>
they offer an Heave-offering unto the Lord, I have given to the Levites to inherit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the People were to make an <hi>Heave-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the Tythes which the Levites received of them, so the Levites were to make an <hi>Heave-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> also, of the Tenth of the Tythes, which the Priests receiv'd of them, <hi>ver.</hi> 26, 27, 28. So that both the Tythes from the People to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, and the Tythe of the Tythes from the Levite to the Priests, were appointed to be made an <hi>Heave-offering</hi> to both, which fully proves, they were in each respect a part of the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law: For what else but a <hi>Ceremony</hi> was either the <hi>Heaving,</hi> or <hi>Waving</hi> of the Offering? the difference whereof (as <hi>Goodwyn</hi> in his <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ch. 6. l. 2. shews) was, that the <hi>Heaving</hi> was perform'd by <hi>Elevation,</hi> lifting the Oblation upward and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: the <hi>Waving</hi> was perform'd by <hi>Agitation, waving</hi> it to and fro, from the right Hand to the left. Now since the <hi>Snake</hi> hath from Scripture brought by himself, prov'd that Tythes were an <hi>Heave-offering</hi> under the Law; let him Solve, if he can, his Contradiction, in Asserting, that <hi>Tythes are no part of the Typical,</hi> or <hi>Ceremonial Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to find this our Adversary in Contradictions is no wonder, no more than it is to find him not sound in Expression, I had almost said Heretical; for so he wou'd have call'd a Position not half so Erroneous from us, as is that of his which I am now about to discover: It is this saying:</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Nothing else of the Law</hi> (but what was <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical</hi> or <hi>Ceremonial) was Abrogated by Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pray then are the Judicials in <hi>Moses</hi> Law in force still, and binding now unto Christians? If <hi>an Ox that hath been known to push with his Horn in times past,</hi> shou'd not be so kept in, but that he should kill a Man or a Woman, must the Owner of necessity be


<pb n="426" facs="tcp:63041:225"/>
put to Death, as well as the Ox? <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.29. Must it still be Eye for Eye, Tooth for Tooth, Hand for Hand, Burning for Burning, Wound for Wound, Stripe for Stripe (as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.24, 25.) notwithstanding what <hi>Christ</hi> hath said, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.38, 39, &amp;c? Must the old Law of Jubilee still take place, that Lands may not be Sold for ever, but that they must return again from him that bought and paid for them, to the Seller? And (to touch the <hi>Snake</hi> more nearly) may not a Priest now take a Sup of Wine, or strong Drink, when he goes into the place he calls his Church, <hi>lest he die (Levit.</hi> 10.9.) Or was not that a <hi>Judicial,</hi> but <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law, fit enough in the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be Abrogated?</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>They</hi> (Tythes) <hi>were before the Law; and the Reason of them is Eternal. That is,</hi> Honouring the Lord with our Substance, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9.</p>
               <p>They were no more before the Law than Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision and Bloody Sacrifices, or Burnt-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were: And there is no more Reason that they shou'd continue after the Law, than those which all acknowledge to be ended by Christ.</p>
               <p>And if Honouring the Lord with our Substance, were only to be done by paying Tythe, it would be a very mean way of Honouring the Lord, to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Him with a Tenth Part only, and our selves with Nine times as much.</p>
               <p>The rest of this p. 271. and most of 272, he spends only in Quibling, and Repeating his false Charges and Suggestions, which are before An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, and Confuted from the places were they are first met with.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> now turns to his old work of mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Quotations, and so gives for one, from <hi>E. B</hi>'s works, p. 780. these Words, <hi>Tythes, as received and paid in these Days— are of Anti-Christ,</hi> which


<pb n="427" facs="tcp:63041:225"/>
though so mangled, are Sound and True; for <hi>Edw. Burroughs</hi> shews the Reason why they are so, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were brought at first into practice in the time of the Gospel, by the Appointment and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Popes, and are grounded upon the Jewish Law, for paying Tythes to <hi>Levi,</hi> in which respects they are highly <hi>Anti-Christian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 273. The <hi>Snake</hi> here again repeats a Quotation (which is a frequent practice with him) from <hi>T. Ellwood,</hi> which he had before given (with some little variation) in p. 246, and also in p. 254. to which Quotation I have already Answer'd, p. 381, 382. fore-going, and therefore need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it here, but refer the <hi>Reader</hi> thither.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 273. <hi>As to the Tenth Part of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that was determin'd long before the Law; and was the universally receiv'd Notion of the World in all Ages,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He who is not afraid, or asham'd (so far as I see) to say any thing, may, if he please, say that the <hi>Quantum</hi> of a Tenth was determin'd as soon as the <hi>Moon</hi> was made. And also he may say, if he please, that it was paid to the Imaginary Man in that changeable Planet; but they had need be more than common Lunaticks that believe him: He begs what we deny, and affirms what he cannot prove; but a confident Assurance is his Talent.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 274. He goes on in the same strain, and takes for granted (which is utterly false) that Tythes were no Legal Ceremony, and adds, <hi>So neither</hi> (says the <hi>Snake) were they any Type of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As well as that it is false in fact, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shewn from the Scriptures, quoted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; so also <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> as before quoted, is of another Mind, where he says: <hi>Et enim in utroque Sacerdotio referebantur ad Christum:</hi> i. e. <hi>for in each


<pb n="428" facs="tcp:63041:226"/>
Priesthood they referr'd to Christ.</hi> So also, when he asks,
<q>Sed quid sibi decime volebant in utroque Sacerdotio? Non sane aliud significabant, quam veteres omnia sua debuisse ad Christum referre illa Ceremonia populus Christum ipsum venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur: <hi>i. e.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>But what did Tythes signifie in either Priesthood? Truly</hi> (says he) <hi>they signified nothing else, but that the Ancients ought to refer all they had to Christ. By that Ceremony the People Worshipped Christ Himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 274, <hi>Sacrifices, and all other Types of Christ, are fulfilled: For He only is now our Sacrifice, but He is not our Tythe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An idle Whim! He is not our Tythe: Did Christ by his coming end no Types but those that were immediate Types of Himself? But that even Tythes also were a Type of Christ to come. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Wilson,</hi> where I have before cited him, p. 420. does acknowledge they were a <hi>shadow and figure, as other Oblations were</hi>; and what pray is that less than a Type?</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>As Tythes are no Legal Ceremony nor Type, so neither are they Abrogated by Christ, as</hi> T. Ellwood <hi>affirms, but cannot prove,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Both their being a Ceremony, a Type, and Abrogated <hi>by Christ, T. Ellwood</hi> hath not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, but prov'd also: And the same is now again plainly prov'd, in every part in this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Discourse, by Argument, Scripture, and Authority.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>We desire any one Text to shew it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It might be <hi>Abrogated,</hi> and that <hi>Abrogation</hi> shewn and prov'd, from the nature of the thing, without a Text. Yet so much according to the <hi>Snake</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, it happens that I have before-going shewn divers Texts for that Abrogation, and particularly <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. compar'd with <hi>ver,</hi> 5. and 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:63041:226"/>Ibid. <hi>He</hi> (T. Ellwood) <hi>quotes</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3. <hi>which has no more relation to it, than Neh.</hi> 10. <hi>to the</hi> 28 ver.</p>
               <p>Did not the <hi>Snake</hi> sit playing at <hi>Tables</hi> (a Sport he uses by him) till his Eyes were dim, when he read it, he might one wou'd think have seen that <hi>T.E.</hi> did not quote that Text, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3. to prove Tythes abrogated by <hi>Christ</hi> (which he needed not do in that Controversie, his Opponent then owning it) but to prove, that to deny Christ come in the Flesh, is a Mark of <hi>Anti-Christ,</hi> which that Text was aptly urg'd to prove, and follow'd immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after those Words [is a mark of Anti-Christ.] So that both his foolish Cavil at <hi>T. E.</hi> for 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3. and his frothy Squib upon the Prophet <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> shews as well the weakness of his Cause, as the levity of his Temper.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 275. The <hi>Snake</hi> summons a great many Names, without naming Books or Pages where to be found, which he says <hi>F. Bugg</hi> (an Apostate) <hi>produces out</hi> of our <hi>Books</hi>; but that <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Charges upon us, and Quotations from our Books, have been repeatedly Answer'd, not one Word. No; it will serve the <hi>Snake</hi>'s base ends better, either to be ignorant of our Answers, or else knowing them, not to consider them as they are, but wickedly to pervert and false quote them; of which two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances now next follow. The first is a Quotation borrow'd from this same <hi>Bugg,</hi> out of the <hi>Guide Mistaken,</hi> by <hi>W. P.</hi> Printed 1668, p. 18. which the <hi>Snake</hi> says was for the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but it may appear otherwise by <hi>W. P</hi>'s Words, which are left out in this Quotation: they are these:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But lest I may be Censur'd by the <hi>Reader,</hi> for too Severe, let me beseech thee to Inquire throughout the Story of the World, where any kind of Religion has been, or is Establisht by Authority, and thou wilt doubtless find upon a


<pb n="430" facs="tcp:63041:227"/>
diligent Search, that the People's Judgments have ever been, and are fast Chain'd in the Priest's Inquisition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And of these Priests it is, who through all <hi>Ages</hi> have thus Chain'd the Peoples Judgments in their Inquisitions, that <hi>W. Penn</hi> does here speak. And I think the <hi>Snake</hi> will hardly more own, that they have done this; than he can make it appear, that the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as now denominated, hath been through <hi>all Ages</hi>: If he can, he will help her to one <hi>Mark</hi> which the Romanists say <hi>is a mark of the true Church:</hi> And to another <hi>Mark,</hi> which all will say, is a mark of the false one.</p>
               <p>The Second is a Quotation which he makes from <hi>W. P</hi>'s <hi>Quakerism a new Nick Name,</hi> &amp;c. p. 165. which the <hi>Snake</hi> says is, <hi>For the Dissenters (for he deals his blows round)</hi> so Insinuating, as if what <hi>W. P.</hi> there said, did relate to all Dissenters, which is notoriously false; his Words are otherwise, and do fully shew, that they were only Relative to such <hi>grosly abusive</hi> Men, as his then Adversary was, (to which I may add) and as the <hi>Snake</hi> now is. For his Words are these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is this the Man that must be thought fit to</hi> vaunt it over us with such Impudent Scurrility, <hi>ungodly, as well as unmannerly Reflections? But in the Earth there is not any thing so fantastical, conceited, proud, rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, busie-body, and sometimes ignorant, as a sort of Priests, to me not unknown (among whom our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary is not the least) who think their Coat will bear out their worst Expressions for</hi> Religion, <hi>and practice an haughty Reviling for</hi> Christ, <hi>as one of the greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of Zeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And of such as these it is, that <hi>W. Penn</hi> said, and said truly, that they are <hi>an ill bred Pedantick Crew, the Bane of Reason,</hi> &amp;c. for so they really are.</p>
               <p>And of such as these it was, that <hi>W. P.</hi> in his


<pb n="431" facs="tcp:63041:227"/>
                  <hi>Serious Apology</hi> speaks, p. 156. as quoted by the <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 275, 276. And how strange soever he may make of it, the Holy Prophets in the Scriptures do abundantly shew and denounce <hi>Woes and Plagues,</hi> to those who made the People <hi>Drink, and laid th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m to sleep on Downy Beds of soft Sin-pleasing Principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To such <hi>Isaiah</hi> spake, Chap. 28.7, 8. — <hi>The Priest and the Prophet have erred through Strong Drink, they are swallowed up of Wine — they err in Vision, they stumble in Judgment: For all Tables are full Vomit and Filthiness, so that there is no place clean.</hi> And therefore he denounces from the Lord, vers. 18. <hi>And your Covenant with Death shall be disannulled, and your Agreement with Hell shall not stand, when the overflowing Scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it:</hi> And vers. 22. he tells them, <hi>I have heard from the Lord God of Hosts, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption even determined upon the whole Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in like manner, Jeremiah 6.13, 14, 15. —<hi>And from the Prophet, even unto the Priests, every one dealeth falsly. Also the hurt of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my People slightly, saying, Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace. Were they ashamed, when they had committed abomination? Nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush.</hi> And for this the Prophet says, vers. 26.—<hi>For the Spoiler shall sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly come upon us.</hi> And the same Prophet, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Great Wickedness of the Priests, <hi>&amp;c. Jer.</hi> 23. denounces from the Lord, vers. 19. <hi>Behold a Whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in Fury, even a grievous Whirlwind, it shall fall Grievously upon the Head of the Wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These, with abundance more, of the Just De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations of God's Judgments upon the Wicked, and such <hi>who pervert the right way of the Lord,</hi> are to be seen in the Scriptures of Truth. And it is not unlikely, that those to whom these denunciations


<pb n="432" facs="tcp:63041:228"/>
were sent, did, as this <hi>Snake</hi> now does, ask, <hi>What flaming Ovens are the Hearts of these Men! Belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth nothing but Hell and Damnation.</hi> They who are hard enough, through Rebellion against God, to draw down Judgments, seldom fail of being hard enough to Ridicule and Dispise the Monitors of them.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 276. Bugg <hi>tells us, in the same place, how industriously these Books are spread amongst the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; <hi>insomuch that a Poor Widow-Quaker, to whom he administred, whose Substance did not amount to Ten Pounds — had more than two hundred of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this place I do tell the <hi>Snake,</hi> that we should be wanting to our selves, if we were not as industrious to spread our Defences, as the <hi>Snake,</hi> or any <hi>Apostate</hi> may be, to spread their Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and False Charges: As to what <hi>Bugg</hi> may brag of having <hi>Administred</hi> to a poor <hi>Widow-Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> I have no need to question the truth of it, nor what the Substance she left really was, tho if it was but ten pound, yet it was a Real tho but small Substance; which if himself could have pretended to no more, his Debts being paid and discharged, I see not what just account, or reason he can give for his compounding with his Creditors: And if this <hi>Quaker-Widow</hi> had 200 of them, Books of ours, (which I take to be false,) she was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stored; so if he did not reckon them any part of her ten pound Estate, he might, if he had sold them, somewhat encreased that.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 277. Nihil Dicit, <hi>is Confessing of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Supposing <hi>Nihil Dicit</hi> to be <hi>Confessing of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; yet that is not our Case, we have been far from saying nothing, for we have replyed (I think) to all that <hi>Bugg</hi> hath writ against us, at least while he pretended to bring a Stock of new


<pb n="433" facs="tcp:63041:228"/>
Charges; and so Contentious a Man deserves not to be hearkned to, or answered, only for his noise sake.</p>
               <p>But now to <hi>Nihil Dicit,</hi> which the <hi>Snake</hi> says is <hi>Confessing of Judgment.</hi> Sure he unluckily forgot the <hi>Suspicions</hi> he lay under, to which he never yet dare appear to make answer, so that <hi>Nihil Dicit</hi> is <hi>Confessing of Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>If they could prove Tythes to be Abrogated by Christ, then indeed</hi> Bugg<hi>'s Impeachment would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be Malicious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very well! I am contented to put it to that Issue, because they have not only been proved hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to be abrogated by <hi>Christ,</hi> in the Writings of several of our Friends; but herein also (as I take it) it is fully proved that <hi>Christ,</hi> by coming in the Flesh, and offering up himself, hath abrogated Tythes: And that confirmed by Scripture, Reason and Authorities.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>It is no Objection that</hi> Quakerism <hi>has not been voted in St.</hi> Stephen<hi>'s Chappel, (as bad things have,)</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What he means by <hi>Quakerism being voted in St.</hi> Stephen<hi>'s Chappel,</hi> may seem doubtful; yet that the Parliament have given us a Christian Liberty we are truly thankful, tho I question not but this Malicious Abdicated Priest is sorry for it. But why, <hi>Snake?</hi> that scurvy and saucy flurt upon the House of Commons, [<hi>as bad things have.</hi>] Can't the Parliament escape the Lash of this Lurking <hi>Snake,</hi> who by the base treatment he has given to the Reformation, in <hi>England,</hi> from Popery, and also to the present Government, seems to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>both these</hi> to be some of the <hi>bad things</hi> he flurtingly means to have been <hi>voted in St.</hi> Stephen<hi>'s Chappel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This brings me to the end of this <hi>Section</hi> of Tythes.</p>

this <hi>Snake</hi> doth frequently endeavour, both by false Relations of fact, by false Quotations from our Books, by gross known Perversions of our Words; and giving meanings to them which were never ours; and also by boldly affirming of things utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly false: As where he says, p. 280. <hi>Our present Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate</hi> Quakers — <hi>refuse to be brought to disown their own False Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have not refused to Disown and Testifie against any who have <hi>spoken</hi> falsly in the Name of the Lord: No, but have (according to the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of like kind, recorded in Holy Writ) denied them; of which I have already in the <hi>Section con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Infallibility</hi> given some instances.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>But do still fearlesly go on, and pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to the same Extraordinary Commission of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Divine Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Divine and Immedate Revelation, to which we do pretend, is no other than that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and held forth in the Scriptures of Truth, as I have already shewn <hi>Section</hi> IV. and which the <hi>Snake</hi> does acknowledge, p. 27, 28. <hi>In some sense they may be called Revelations, and Immediate too:</hi> And as to <hi>Extraordinary Commissions,</hi> or the Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Manifestations of God to his Children in the Higher Degrees of <hi>Immediate Revelation</hi>; those which we own, are not repugnant to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, but are consistent and agreeable therewith, as I have there more largely shewn; to which I shall only add, that God hath not in the Scriptures of Truth declared or bound himself, that he would not any more manifest himself to Men in such spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Manifestations, or extraordinary Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which it is recorded he did give to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in the breaking forth of the Gospel Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. Nay, on the contrary; the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> shewing the People what was the Dispensation of


<pb n="436" facs="tcp:63041:230"/>
God to Men, in the Gospel-day, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.17, 18. he saith (having reference to the Prophecy of Joel 2.28.) <hi>And it shall come to pass in the last days,</hi> (saith God) <hi>I will pour out of my Spirit upon all Flesh; and your Sons and your Daughters shall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, and your Young Men shall see Visions, and your Old Men shall dream Dreams: And on my Servants, and on my Handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit, and they shall Prophesie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are not <hi>Etraordinary Commissions</hi> herein promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? I think there be; so that there is not any uncertainty or doubt to know, whether such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions may be or not: Which though the <hi>Snake</hi> wou'd suggest, yet he dare not undertake to prove. And therefore chuses to oppose the Spirit of Prophecy in the Servants of God at this day, by saying they <hi>affix God's Seal, Thus saith the Lord, to whatever their Rage, their Malice, or Folly shall suggest.</hi> This is to affirm, but not to prove; and unless it be proved, it deserves not be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>This is nothing short of Blasphemy, Rank, Wild Blasphemy,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To affix <hi>Thus saith the Lord</hi> to <hi>Rage, Malice,</hi> or <hi>Folly,</hi> it is indeed as the <hi>Snake</hi> says, <hi>nothing short of Rank Blasphemy.</hi> But that the <hi>Quakers</hi> do affix <hi>Thus saith the Lord</hi> to <hi>Rage, Malice,</hi> or <hi>Folly,</hi> is nothing short of <hi>Rank</hi> Lying in the <hi>Snake</hi> to affirm, unless he can prove it. It is no Objection to give particular Instances of some that have been called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and have spoken falsly in the Name of the Lord, and thence conclude and say, therefore none of the <hi>Quakers</hi> speak truly in the Name of the Lord. For by such undue Inference, all the True Prophesies in the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament are at once denied and refused, as not from the Lord; because some false Prophets did


<pb n="437" facs="tcp:63041:230"/>
also speak in his Name, and say, <hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi> when he sent them not.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 281. <hi>This is the Prince of the Spirits of Delusion; and this Prince they worship, — for God,</hi> who <hi>mistake his Inspirations for God's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very well! I say so too; but that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are they <hi>who mistake his Inspirations for God's,</hi> is <hi>Gratis Dictum,</hi> 'tis saying, but not proving; as more particularly will appear, upon the several Instances which the <hi>Snake</hi> brings.</p>
               <p>The first Instance (in this <hi>Section</hi>) is what he calls <hi>a Prophetical verse</hi> of <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s, with which he says <hi>G.W. pursued George Keith,</hi> after he was denied by us. He gives it in these words.</p>
               <p>Thus saith the Lord, <hi>Because thou hast poured out great Contempt and Reproach upon my Servants and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I will assuredly pour out, and bring great Contempt and Confusion upon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this the <hi>Snake</hi> says, p. 282. <hi>Copies were given out amongst the Friends, that they might admire these Prophetical Gifts; and if any thing unfortunate should in all</hi> George Keith<hi>'s Life-time befall him, that it might certainly be esteemed as the Consequence of this Curse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What Proof is this, that (what he calls) <hi>G.W</hi>'s <hi>Prophetical Verse,</hi> did proceed from <hi>Rage, Malice,</hi> or <hi>Folly</hi>? Or, that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> hath therein mistaken the <hi>Inspirations of the Prince of the Spirits of Delusion, for God's.</hi> See, <hi>Reader,</hi> how forward the <hi>Snake</hi> is to give <hi>hard words,</hi> and how backward to prove them.</p>
               <p>That <hi>G. Keith</hi> hath, with great <hi>Contempt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,</hi> treated the <hi>Quakers</hi> is very certain; and not only so, but hath Contemptuously and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully spoken many things of that way of Truth which they profess, and which himself did also for many years profess with them; which


<pb n="438" facs="tcp:63041:231"/>
practices, as it is an apparent mark of <hi>Confusion</hi> in him; so it n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>essarily draws after it <hi>Contempt</hi> upon the Actor, from all Observing Men.</p>
               <p>So that the <hi>Prophetick Verse</hi> (as the <hi>Snake</hi> calls it) of <hi>G. W.</hi>'s carries with it many evidences of Truth; which plainly shew, he did not therein <hi>mistake</hi> the <hi>Inspirations of the Prince of the Spirits of Delusion, for God's:</hi> And which is further seen, in that there is no proof given by the <hi>Snake,</hi> that it did proceed from <hi>Rage, Malice,</hi> or <hi>Folly</hi> in <hi>G. W.</hi> as is falsly and maliciously suggested by the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
               <p>And as there can nothing more unhappy fall out to <hi>G. K.</hi> in all his Life-time, than to continue and go on from one degree of <hi>Confusion</hi> to another; so that <hi>Confusion</hi> is not the <hi>Consequence</hi> of (what the <hi>Snake</hi> calls) <hi>George Whitehead's Prophetick Verse:</hi> But that Verse was the <hi>Consequence</hi> of <hi>Confusion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in <hi>G. K.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Mr.</hi> Penn <hi>did own before the Yearly Meeting,</hi>
                  <q>That the Glorious Power of God, which he felt, did so transport him, that he was carried beyond himself, and knew not whether he was Sitting, Standing or Kneeling, <hi>when he pronounced that Sentence</hi> (of Apostacy concerning <hi>G. K.</hi>)</q>
                  <hi>This was like St.</hi> Paul's, whether in the Body, or out of the Body, he could not tell. —</p>
               <p>Well! Suppose it is like it, I would ask the <hi>Snake,</hi> whether he dare affirm, that at this day, it is altogether impossible for the Spirit of God to influence any to that degree of Extasie or Rapture. If he will deny that, or (which will answer the end of our Present Inquiry) if he will allow that, but deny this to be so, it will then be necessary for the <hi>Snake</hi> to produce the marks, by which he proves it to be, what in p. 283. he hath so confidently said it is, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Violent Transports of Passion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="439" facs="tcp:63041:231"/>But if <hi>the Force of this Mad Spirit</hi> of Malice, had not govern'd the <hi>Snake,</hi> he might have seen that while he does acknowledge, what he there says <hi>W. P.</hi> does speak of himself, to be <hi>like</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle (<hi>This was like</hi> (says he) <hi>St.</hi> Paul, <hi>whether in the Body,</hi> &amp;c.) and calls <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s words, <hi>The force of this Mad Spirit of Enthusiasm:</hi> He does then <hi>Intimate</hi> that the Apostles words proceeded from the <hi>like force:</hi> And how far this may expose <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the whole Scriptures, to Loose and Atheistical Wits</hi>; may concern some to see, who are more truly concern'd for the honour of both, than he, who while he is inquiring, <hi>How great is the force of this mad Spirit of Enthusiasm?</hi> Observes not how great is the force of the mad Spirit of <hi>Atheism</hi> in himself.</p>
               <p>But further, I do own (with the <hi>Snake</hi>) that this Extasie or Rapture of <hi>W. P</hi>'s, is <hi>like</hi> that of <hi>Paul, Whether in Body, or out of Body he knew not:</hi> That is, they are a-like in Kind, but not <hi>Degree; W. Penn</hi>'s, as the <hi>Snake</hi> says, did relate to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of the Body, but the Apostle's was much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, even so as to forget the Body.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 283. <hi>And he is thus far towards it, — that he must either make out his own Inspirations to be from God, in as High a</hi> Degree <hi>as those which were given to the Prophets and Apostles, or otherwise that he has no Authority to inscribe the name of God upon them as they did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> does here (as before) allow the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration</hi> to be the same; but falsly supposes <hi>W. Penn</hi> under a necessity to <hi>make it out,</hi> to be in as <hi>High a Degree</hi>; which he is not, because the Operation of it on <hi>W. Penn,</hi> the <hi>Snake</hi> says, was not in so <hi>High</hi> a Degree, as on the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:63041:232"/>And while the <hi>Snake</hi> does falsly suppose, that the <hi>Inspirations from God,</hi> at this day, must be made out to be in as <hi>High a Degree,</hi> as those which were given to the Prophets and Apostles: Or else, his name is <hi>not to be inscrib'd on them.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, the <hi>Snake</hi> does hereby overthrow, what in <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 31. he calls, <hi>The greatest Flights and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies of Devotion,</hi> and which he there advises to let <hi>Rise as High as they can, the Higher the better!</hi> He does also overthrow all that Enthusiasm, which he says the <hi>Church of England owns</hi>; for these he hath acknowledged to be <hi>Revelations,</hi> and <hi>in some sense immediate too:</hi> Yet here he says they are not so to be inscrib'd, unless they are in as <hi>High a Degree, as those given to the Prophets and Apostles:</hi> Which I think he will hardly presume to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.</p>
               <p>But altho' this Adversary is thus Contradictory to himself, by denying and affirming the same thing; yet Truth remains unmoveable, and the Inspirations of the Holy Spirit at this day, in what Degree soever they are given; are truly the same in kind, with those given to the Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles: In that now as then, God by the divers Gifts of his Spirit, doth fit, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and qualifie, his Children and Servants, to the several Duties and Services in his Church, to which he calleth them.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>He must likewise justifie all the False Lying Prophesies before told; or otherwise he must unherd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>W. P.</hi> is not obliged to defend <hi>False Lying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies,</hi> but deny them; nor doth he <hi>Herd</hi> (as the <hi>Snake</hi> scornfully speaks) with any such.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 284. Gives two Quotations, one for <hi>G. F</hi>'s Answer to <hi>The Westmerland Petition,</hi> p. 5. the other from his <hi>Saul's Errand,</hi> p. 7. which are both to this purpose, <hi>All that speak, and not


<pb n="441" facs="tcp:63041:232"/>
from the Mouth of the Lord, are false Prophets and Diviners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this the <hi>Snake</hi> is wonderfully offended, and taking his Copy from other Adversaries (for he is not the first herein, no more than in his other Charges) makes many false Inferences from them: As for the Assertion of <hi>G. F's</hi> it was (as I have just now hinted) objected against in the Year 1656. by <hi>Jeremy Ives,</hi> and answer'd by <hi>James Nayler,</hi> in a Peice of his, printed that Year, Entituled, <hi>Weakness above Wickedness:</hi> In p. 12, 13. of which Book answering to this Charge, he saith, <hi>What is done now, by such Diviners as deny the Faith of Christ, and his Call, and Spirit in them; what such raiseth must needs be Conjuration, who denies the Faith and Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in like manner we find, God by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets hath often rebuked them who spake Lyes in his Name, and who were Strangers to his Holy Spirit, by the name of <hi>Diviners, Jer.</hi> 27.9. <hi>Micah</hi> 3.7. <hi>Zach.</hi> 10.2. And their False Prophesies are frequently called, <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Flattering Divinations</hi>; which were Truths they could hardly bear, any more than those, to whom this was spoken. But whether it can be born by them or not, it will remain a Truth, that such who deny the <hi>Faith and Spirit of God,</hi> and shall yet pretend to speak in his Name; it can be no other than the Lying Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations of their own Brain.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 285. <hi>If all the False and Foolish Miracles which</hi> G. F. <hi>tells of himself. — If all these were not from God, then was he and those who recommended that</hi> Journal <hi>all Conjurers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Miracles there related, are False or Foolish, is <hi>Gratis Dictum</hi>; it is boldly said, but not prov'd, Prove them <hi>False</hi> and <hi>Foolish,</hi> and then there needs no [If they were not from God]

               <head>SECT. XIX. The Charge of Visible Possessions by the Devil, Examined and Refuted.</head>
               <p>HAving hitherto trac'd the <hi>Snake</hi> through the Twinings of his several Charges, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd (at least in some measure) his Falshood, Hypocrisie and Malice, in them, I am not less in hope to perform the same in this.</p>
               <p>His Charge is, that many <hi>Quakers</hi> have been <hi>Visibly Possest by the Devil:</hi> A Charge, which if upon Inquiry, it prove not true upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> will at least prove some such thing in the Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; who from a collected Malice, cou'd with so much Confidence and bold Effrontry, pretend to tell such <hi>Visible</hi> Falshoods.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 286. <hi>A Visible effect of this (Possession by the Devil) was that extraordinary Shaking and Quaking like Fits of Convulsions, which these</hi> Quakers <hi>at the first either acted, or like the</hi> Heathen <hi>Priests of old were possess'd with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Snake</hi> will venture to affirm, that all <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Shaking and Quaking,</hi> is a <hi>Visible effect of Possession</hi> by the <hi>Devil:</hi> I can give him two Instances, wherein himself has been so <hi>possessed.</hi> The one was when he was seized at <hi>Lidd,</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> by <hi>Tompson</hi> the Messenger; and the other was not very long since, in the City, when he was under some Apprehension of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken


<pb n="443" facs="tcp:63041:233"/>
by the same Person, from whom he run away. And I make no Question, but he hath frequently been attended with the like <hi>visible effects of Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi>; which whether he will attribute <hi>to the strong Impression made by the Devil upon his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as I know not, so I shall not trouble my self to inquire, nor should I have in this place told this Truth, but to redargue the <hi>Confidence</hi> of one, who from a course of Clandestine and Base Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, shuns Day-light, and is thereby justly subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Frights which the ugly shapes of Fear can terrifie him with, from his <hi>Superiours</hi>; yet not that I might thereby pass over his False Allegation, which I shall now consider.</p>
               <p>And here, concerning <hi>Quaking and Shaking,</hi> I make no Doubt or Scruple to own and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, agreeable to the Instances thereof Recorded in Holy Writ: That God by his Power some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in this Age, hath brought <hi>Holy Fear, Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, Quivering,</hi> and <hi>Quaking,</hi> upon the Bodies of some, as in the former Ages we read he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did, of which some few follow: Thus the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in the Camp, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.16. <hi>Trembled.</hi> Thus <hi>Moses,</hi> Acts 7.32. <hi>Trembled.</hi> Thus the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> 119, 120. saith, <hi>My Flesh trembleth.</hi> Thus <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk,</hi> 3.16. saith, <hi>My Lips quivered.</hi> Thus God Commanded the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> 12.18. <hi>Son of Man, eat thy bread with Quaking.</hi> Thus <hi>Daniel.</hi> 10.7. testifies of the Men that were with him, <hi>Great Quaking fell upon them.</hi> And many more such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances there are of the <hi>visible effects</hi> of God's ower; which howsoever Ridicul'd or Stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd, by such who are Strangers to it, are not to be despised, or profanely contemn'd by any, who are at all acquainted with the Work of <hi>Christ</hi> in them. How much less then ought they Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemously to be call'd the <hi>visible effects</hi> of <hi>possession


<pb n="444" facs="tcp:63041:234"/>
by the Devil,</hi> which are really the <hi>visible effects</hi> of the Power of God?</p>
               <p>And it is nothing strange, that when God by the Discoveries of his Light in the Heart, lets Men see their undone Estate without him; that then they should be in trouble, and cry out with the Apostle, of that <hi>Body of Sin and Death,</hi> by which they are held in Bondage. And as many as have come to this Discovery, and patiently abode under the Judgment of God's Grace, by which they might be made Victors, do know, that through the gradual workings of the Power of God, in <hi>the binding of the strong Man,</hi> in the <hi>spoiling of his Goods,</hi> and finally, in <hi>casting him out of the Heart</hi>: they can say, it was the <hi>Day of Jacob</hi>'s <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>; and these oft-times are such as do affect the Body.</p>
               <p>And while the <hi>Soul</hi> is in this Conflict, and the <hi>Creature</hi> groaning to be delivered, the <hi>Tempter,</hi> who as he always opposes the Work of God in Men, so in this Day of Trouble, he aims to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Soul by his Stratagems, sometimes by Imitating the Discoveries of God; and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lead the Mind into Imaginations and False Appearances, thereby to lift it up above the Sense of the Operation of God's Grace: Sometimes by Imitating the Judgments of God, and by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to lead the Mind down into Despair, and a Distrust of God's Mercy.</p>
               <p>An Instance of this sort is <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom, <hi>Harding</hi> the Jesuit objected to the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> That the <hi>Devil</hi> in a Night-<hi>Vision</hi> did reason with him, against the <hi>Sacrifice of the Mass</hi> (as the Jesuit calls it) and the Jesuit quoted for this a Book of <hi>Luther</hi>'s, entituled, <hi>De Missa Angulari &amp; Vnctione Sacerdotali,</hi> and infers from it, that the Reformation sprung in the <hi>School of Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:63041:234"/>The Bishop, in his <hi>Reply to</hi> Harding, Printed 1565, p. 2, saith;
<q>D. <hi>Luther</hi> sheweth what terrible Temptations the Devil hath to trap Men withall, taking occasion sometime of well-doing, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of Evil, sometime of Truth, sometime of Falshood. And, for example, he sheweth that the Devil on a time Assaulted him, not in visible Form, but by dreadful Suggestions in his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as it were thus calling him to remembrance.</q>
                  <hi>These many Years thou hast said Mass, thou hast shew'd up Bread and Wine to be Worshipped as God, yet now thou knowest it was a Creature, and not God; thereof follow'd Idolatry, and thou wert the Cause thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>All these things he saw to be true by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony and Light of his own Conscience, and therefore confess'd he had offended, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself unto God. The Devil's purpose was to lead him to Despair; but God mercifully deliver'd him— If he think it so heinous a Matter for a Godly Man to be vex'd by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, perhaps he will also find some fault with Christ, who was carried by the Devil into the Mount; or with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that had the Angel of Satan to buffet him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Bishop, who seems to have had another Sense of this Matter, than this our Adversary. I shall only add to this, (before I come to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Instances) to my <hi>Reader,</hi> That if any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Professing Unity with us, in whom was began the work of Reformation, hath not abode Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but run into the Temptations of the Enemy; and hath had freakish Actions and Gestures, and loose and wild Imaginations, and have Falsly and Blasphemously Ascrib'd them, to be the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit of God. We are not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for them, as the Apostle was not for those in his time, who were given up to strong Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,


<pb n="446" facs="tcp:63041:235"/>
because they receiv'd not the Truth in the Love of it. All that we find the Apostle did to them, that we have done to such, that is, testifie against them and their ways: For we do not own such Inspirations, as have not for their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, the Holy Spirit, and are warranted by the Scriptures of Truth.</p>
               <p>I come now to the <hi>Snake</hi>'s <hi>Instances.</hi> His first is thus, p. 288.</p>
               <p>John Gilpin <hi>of</hi> Kendal <hi>in</hi> Westmerland, <hi>has given us a strange and wonderful account of his own Possession by the Devil, while he was a Quaker, in a Book which he Entituled,</hi> The Quakers shaken, <hi>Printed</hi> 1653.</p>
               <p>In Answer to this, there was Published in that same Year 1653, a Book Entituled, <hi>The Standard of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. to which Book <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> writ the <hi>Epistle to the Reader</hi>: In which, speaking of this same <hi>John Gilpin,</hi> p. 2. he saith;
<q>By hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Truth declared, through the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in his own Conscience, he was Convinced of the Everlasting Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This was very well; but it seems he continued not under that Convincement, for he ran out into <hi>Airy Imaginations and Imitations,</hi> as <hi>E. B.</hi> saith; who speaking further of him says:
<q>I was mov'd to go to see him, and his Will was at liberty, got above the Judgment, though the Judgment was upon the head of the Beast in him, and a true Power working; but his Will not being kept in Subjection, it led him into Impatiency, and into Rebelling against the Lord, who was made manifest, to destroy the unruly Will, and wandring Mind: <hi>And then I did declare against him, and shewed him the deceit, where it lodged in him.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:63041:235"/>Thus <hi>E. B.</hi> who it hereby appears, did shew the Man his state, and did also deny him and his doings: But the Matter issu'd thus: This <hi>Gilpin</hi> continu'd to go on, in that same <hi>Rebellion</hi> of which <hi>E. B.</hi> speaks; so that he quite run from under the <hi>Judgment</hi>; and <hi>Gilpin</hi> in this his worst Estate, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, with the help of the then <hi>Priest</hi> of <hi>Kendal</hi> (in a Book Publish'd under <hi>Gilpin</hi>'s Name) to charge the Wicked and Blasphemous Actions and Sayings, which he had been guilty of, upon that <hi>Principle</hi> of the <hi>Light of Christ</hi> in Men, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> Profest; though <hi>Gilpin</hi> being Charg'd with it, did deny it, in these Words: <hi>I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther written, nor spoken, any thing against the</hi> Quakers. So that by this it should seem the Book was writ by the <hi>Priest,</hi> and <hi>Gilpin</hi>'s Name put for a Cover: And if it had not been so, but that <hi>Gilpin</hi> did real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly write it, there was a fair opportunity given them to have prov'd it; because the Words above-mentioned, spoke by <hi>Gilpin,</hi> were Publish'd in the Answer before-mention'd, Entituled, <hi>The Standard of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. which came forth in the same Year, which that Book Subscrib'd by <hi>Gilpin</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Attested by the then Mayor of</hi> Kendal, <hi>the Minister of</hi> Kendal, <hi>and several other Persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was not strange that the Mayor of <hi>Kendal</hi> should be procur'd to Subscribe, what the Priest had so eminent a Hand in, though he owns it no further than a Fellow Subscriber. But as this was an early Instance (<hi>viz.</hi> 1653.) wherein the Priest did lead the <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> into such a Mistake, which a prudent Inquiry wou'd have prevented; so we have often since found, they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to Ride the Civil Power blindly into Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, and Prejudices against us; and where such have been able to Hood-wink a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> we


<pb n="448" facs="tcp:63041:236"/>
have seldom found so little disadvantage from it, as is the setting his Name to Partial and Untrue Relations of Fact.</p>
               <p>In fine, the Case is thus; <hi>Gilpin,</hi> as before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, was once under a Convincement of <hi>Truth,</hi> but he abode not under the Judgment of God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in him for Sin, but started aside as a broken Bow: He got into Wild Blasphemous, and Airy Whimsies and Notions. In all this he was presently denied and testified against. For <hi>Edw. Burroughs</hi> did, while this <hi>Gilpin</hi> was under these Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies deny him, and we were sufficiently discharg'd of him: And what may further shew the Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy of the Man, was the Dissoluteness of his After-time; for some Actions of which, a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant was (it seems) Issu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d out for his Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; but he, like this <hi>Snake,</hi> ran away from it, as is express'd in the Book aforesaid, which was writ in Answer to him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi>'s next Story is, of one <hi>James Milner,</hi> mention'd p. 66. fore-going. This Man, and some others, did as the former; start aside from under the Judgment, but the Event was not the same, as is seen in <hi>G. F</hi>'s Journal, p. 103. where speaking of this Man, and his Condition, he saith.
<q>
                     <hi>James Milner,</hi> and some of his Company, had true Openings at the first; but getting up into <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Exaltation</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> they run out from <hi>Truth.</hi> I was sent for to them, and was mov'd of the <hi>Lord</hi> to go and shew them their Goings forth. And they came to see their Folly, and Condemn'd it, and came into the way of <hi>Truth</hi> again.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That he did see and condemn his Folly, was very well, and it was yet better for him, that he return'd into the <hi>way of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:63041:236"/>Ibid. p. 289. <hi>But then, as an Excuse for his false Prophesies, and his Blasphemies, in calling himself Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he</hi> (G. F.) <hi>makes this Comical Apology:</hi>
                  <q>In some things his mind runn'd out, and that he Condemns; and yet these wicked Men will go tell the Nation of it. <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> Page 298.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is not very Comical, but very Provoking, to find one who pretends to be a <hi>Lover of Souls,</hi> to be really a Hater of Truth, and a gross Perverter of Words. Is it any Excuse for <hi>False Prophesies,</hi> or <hi>Wild Whimsies,</hi> to say of those who are guilty of them, <hi>That they are got up into Pride and Exaltation of Spirit, and that they are run out from Truth?</hi> I think it is not, but is on the contrary, a Sound and Substantial Denial of them, as it was an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their Return, who had so been guilty; when from a sight of, and sorrow for the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they had been guilty of; they did Condemn their Wickedness, and return into the Way of <hi>Truth,</hi> which they had forsaken; and when Erring Persons are so return'd, it is no less than Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, imperiously, and by way of <hi>Taunt,</hi> to object to them their past Miscarriages; and much more so, to throw them Evils so forsaken and repented of, at a Community for their Scandal.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 289. <hi>I will trouble the Reader but with one Instance more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then we are not like to have very many, for we have had yet but two: And were I dispos'd to vie Numbers with the <hi>Snake,</hi> I could enumerate more pretended Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who have in Wicked and Freakish manner preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded falsly to Revelations and Inspirations.</p>
               <p>Ibid. John Toldervy <hi>has Printed a very Punctual Narrative of his Conversion to</hi> Quakerism; <hi>and of the most Astonishing Possession of the</hi> Devil, <hi>in which he


<pb n="450" facs="tcp:63041:237"/>
was held after his said Conversion, even to the Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions of</hi> Evil Spirits, <hi>dancing and Singing about him, and directing him what he should do,</hi> and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him in the Principles of Quakerism.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> has taken up near three pages with the story of this Man, of which the foregoing words are the substance, which are a complex of falshoods, as I shall presently make appear.</p>
               <p>But first, I shall desire my Reader to observe, that the <hi>Snake</hi> affirms, that the <hi>Astonishing Possession of the Devil did encourage</hi> this J. Toldervy <hi>in the Principles of Quakerism</hi>; which is so venemous a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood, that nothing short of Envy could lead him to affirm it; and that in opposition to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he quotes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Book, <hi>Foot out of the Snare,</hi> which is the Book which the <hi>Snake</hi> here calls a <hi>Punctual Narrative,</hi> and also quotes in p. 290.</p>
               <p>I will give my Reader some account, both of the Man <hi>J. Toldervy,</hi> and his Book above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; from both which it may fully appear, how far the <hi>Astonishing Possession of the Devil,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched Imaginations in which he was, was from being either owing to, or <hi>encouraging</hi> of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of Truth which we profess.</p>
               <p>And first for the Man; He was one, who (I shall anon give my Authority for what I say) <hi>had been zealously affected</hi> in divers ways of Worship; at length he made a shew of a Convincement upon his Spirit, and did come to our Meetings, but it was not long before he did discover himself not to have any true work of Regeneration upon his Mind, but run out into very strange and wicked Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for which he was soon reproved by the <hi>Quakers</hi>;<note rend="inter">
                     <hi>Foot yet in the Snare,</hi> Printed 1656. p. 6. <hi>Jam. Nayler.</hi>
                  </note> but he persisting, <hi>they did sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from him, and deny him both by Word and Writing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause


<pb n="451" facs="tcp:63041:237"/>
of his following a Bewitched Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> being thus discharged of him, his Wild Imaginations turn'd to Envy, and he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to charge his Crimes upon the Principle of the Light of Christ in Men, professed by us; in order to which he writes a Book, Entituled, <hi>Foot out of the Snare</hi>; and to give it greater Grace, it hath Eight Warrantees or Subscribers for the truth of it: Wherein they pretend to set forth the <hi>Manner of his Separation from the</hi> Quakers. In answer to this of theirs, <hi>James Naylor</hi> wrote a Piece, entituled, as above, <hi>Foot yet in the Snare</hi>; in which he shews, (and often repeats it) that <hi>J. Toldervy</hi> was denied by the Quakers, and that they had Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied against him: And for the fuller evidencing that the <hi>Quakers</hi> had denied him, he does in p. 21, 22. refer to their Book, <hi>Foot out of the Sare,</hi> and says. In p. 33.
<q>Do you not confess, that when he came to the Meeting, at the place where the <hi>Quakers</hi> were, shewing the holes he had made in his Thumbs, and telling of those Lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which he had been acting, many of the <hi>Quakers</hi> being there, all of them Judged him with one Consent, charged him to be silent, and told him that he was in Darkness, and had slain the Witness of God in him?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus by their own Testimony; nay, by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Toldervy</hi> himself, (for he was it seems the Author.) The <hi>Quakers</hi> had denied him, of which we can desire, sure, no better proof than his own Confession, attested by Eight Witnesses, of which <hi>Tho. Brooks, Tho. Jacomb, Geo. Cockaine, Joh. Tombs,</hi> and <hi>Will. Adderly</hi> were part.</p>
               <p>Having thus shewn, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> did deny, and therefore not chargeable with him, nor his Actions, I shall further shew from the same Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which hath testified our denial of him, as


<pb n="452" facs="tcp:63041:238"/>
above; that those his strange and wicked Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, were neither owing to, nor <hi>encouraging of the Principles of Quakerism in him,</hi> as the <hi>Snake</hi> has wickedly said. For proof of this, see <hi>Foot yet in the Snare,</hi> p. 20. where <hi>James Naylor,</hi> clearing our Principles from this suggestion, saith thus, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their own Book before-mentioned.
<q>And have not you confessed, p. 49. the <hi>Cause</hi> of these Distractions and Confusions in his Mind was, having been zealously affected in <hi>divers ways be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?</hi> There was begotten in him much Fleshly Wisdom, in which his Hope did rest, believing it to be the Holy Spirit revealed in him, and that he was covered with Deceit, and could glory in that Condition.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here, in their own Testimony, they say, he was <hi>Covered</hi> with <hi>Deceit,</hi> did <hi>rest</hi> in <hi>Fleshly Wisdom,</hi> and believed it to be the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>; and in this he had been zealously affected in divers ways; which was, as themselves say, the Cause of his <hi>Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> and <hi>Confusions</hi>; and <hi>all</hi> this before he came among us, (and staid not long when he was come.) But yet further, <hi>James Naylor</hi> does in p. 26. quote them more amply, clearing the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Principle from his Delusions, where they clear the Truth, and say,
<q>He <hi>(J. T.)</hi> being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, by what he learned from the <hi>Quakers,</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> which was made known by the <hi>Light</hi> in us, which Light is Spiritual, and guides out of the Work of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> to worship God in Spirit and Truth; he was then to wait out of Thoughts and Imaginations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And his Understanding being now thus opened, he was possessed with much Joy in the Sense of that Love he had received; whereupon he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to give all diligence, that his <hi>Calling and Election may be made sure.</hi> But being naturally


<pb n="453" facs="tcp:63041:238"/>
of a hasty and forward Mind, and his Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in part, being a <hi>Covenant of his own,</hi> there was speedily begot in him an extream <hi>Fiery</hi> Zeal; so that in the general he was hastily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forth before the true Light, by which in a short time he became lost in his Understanding, and so the Disputer was raised to Life; and that which was for Condemnation, having dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Light of the Sun, form'd it self in the shape of the True Light; and <hi>so</hi> Deceit got the Power, and led out of the true Obedience in things before related, by which the Simple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>became exceedingly deceived. But when he was restored by the Clear Light of Life, being gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that Obedience, which was professed by those People, among whom he was, <hi>being the Quakers,</hi> and his Witness.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a Clear Testimony, that the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> professed by the <hi>Quakers</hi> leads out of the Works of the Flesh, to worship God in Spirit and in Truth. And that by this <hi>J. Toldervy</hi>'s Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing was opened. What hinder'd then, that the Work of Regeneration did not go on in him? Why, they say, that <hi>he being of a hasty and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mind, it was, in part, a Covenant of his own, which raised a Fiery Zeal, by which he lost his Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and thereby the Sun was darkned</hi>; a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry natural consequence of that <hi>Covenant</hi> which was his own, and not of the Spirit of God; and here it was, that that which was for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, formed it self in the shape <hi>(as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it)</hi> of the True Light. And thus indeed the Enemy of Man, the Devil, works in a Mystery, to drive Men to make Covenants in their own Wills, for their Regeneration; which as they can never last, so according to the various Disposition of the Person so Covenanting, are the extreams


<pb n="454" facs="tcp:63041:239"/>
which they run into. Thus they acknowledge, in direct opposition to the <hi>Snake,</hi> that, that Deceit which was in <hi>J. Toldervy</hi> was so far from <hi>encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him in the Principles of Quakerism,</hi> that it did lead him out of the True Obedience to that <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liple,</hi> which they say he <hi>learned from the Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 291. <hi>He made a sort of a half Vindication, and half Recantation, not of the matters of Fact of his aforesaid Delusions; (for these were undeniable) but to free the</hi> Quakers <hi>from the Imputation and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of them, and to clear himself to have been, and still continue a true</hi> Quaker, <hi>which makes the Cause much worse on their side.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Supposing <hi>John Toldervy</hi> did endeavour <hi>to clear himself to have been, and still continue a true</hi> Quaker, at a time, and in things wherein we had by Word and Writing denied him. I pray how shall that <hi>make the Cause much worse on</hi> our <hi>side,</hi> any more than it makes bad of the side of the <hi>Church of England</hi>? because the <hi>Snake,</hi> a former <hi>Scandalous</hi> Member, does pretend to have been, and still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a True Member in her Communion.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, the <hi>Snake</hi> is here forc'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that <hi>J. Toldervy</hi> did free the <hi>Quakers</hi> from the Imputation and Scandal of his Delusions; which whether he had or not, the <hi>Quakers</hi> had freed themselves from them, by denying of him, both by <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Writing</hi>: And as he stood thus denied by them, so they could not be chargeable with any of his after Actions. But if he had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely repented of his great Wickedness, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by found favour in the sight of God, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd to him the <hi>Light of his Countenance,</hi> and had so been received again into fellowship with those from whom he had been separated; this would have been far from <hi>making the Cause much worse on their side:</hi> For with respect to their own satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction


<pb n="455" facs="tcp:63041:239"/>
it would <hi>make the Cause much better.</hi> Because the People of God in all Ages did always rejoice, when one that had err'd and stray'd from the Fold, did by sincere Repentance return into it again.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 292. <hi>That same Year, viz.</hi> the 24th of October 1656. <hi>all the Good and Evil Spirits entred into</hi> Naylor <hi>himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Profane <hi>Snake!</hi> why must both <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> Spirits be thus flouted? It shews no true Sense of Religion, in one who can with so much ease ridicule both the beginning of all true and saving Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Man, <hi>viz.</hi> the entrance of the Good Spirit of God; and the beginning of all Misery, <hi>viz.</hi> the entrance of the Evil Spirit into Man.</p>
               <p>But with respect to <hi>Jame Naylor,</hi> and his Great Fall, and yet greater deliverance from it, I have already spoken from p. 111, to 118. and therefore need not enlarge further here.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> now turns to Quotations again, where in p. 295. he quotes <hi>Patrick Levingston,</hi> in a Piece of his, Entituled, <hi>Plain and Downright Dealing with them that were with us, and are gone out from us</hi>; in p. 10 of which Book, <hi>P. L.</hi> makes an Allusion of the Operations of <hi>Physick</hi> upon the Body, to the Operation of the Spirit or Power of God upon the Soul; and shews thence, what melting into Tears, and Shakings he had known upon his own Body; and also what some others had known, when the Lord did first appear <hi>with a mighty hand</hi> (as he says p. 9.) <hi>to bring his People out of Spiritual</hi> Egypt <hi>in this our Age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he here goes on and shews, that these emotions of Body, and terrible breakings the Soul were but for a little time, and that the Voice of the Lord was not distinctly discerned there, they being only preparatory of that way of <hi>Peace, Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Quietness</hi> in which as they continued obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,


<pb n="456" facs="tcp:63041:240"/>
they came to be established. This briefly is the substance of what the <hi>Snake</hi> hath pick'd and quoted from p. 10. And I will now shew thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> his strange perversion of all this.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 296. <hi>Now here is a Comparison made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the State of the Quakers from</hi> 1650, <hi>to</hi> 1660. <hi>and from thence to this time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, <hi>Snake,</hi> the Comparison does not lie in any date of Years, but in the Progress of the Work of God in Men.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>Their first State was their time of Physick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first State, of all who have been Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and Born again, may by allusion be called a time of Purging or Cleansing; and so it hath been frequently term'd in Holy Writ. Our Saviour speaks of this <hi>first State</hi> in such Pathetick Terms, (<hi>Mark</hi> 3.27.) as does evidently denote it to be a <hi>State</hi> of Trouble. For the binding the <hi>Strong Man</hi> of Sin, by the <hi>Stonger</hi> Power of God, is not to be effected while the Soul is at ease, and secure in Sin: Nor can the <hi>Strong Man's Goods be spoil'd,</hi> in Man, unless, through Obedience, he comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Workings of the Power of the <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>; and that will not give Deliverance to Man, before he sees the great necessity he is in of a Deliverer.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>But there was worse than that, For as</hi> Leving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston <hi>here informs us,</hi> —
<q>The Voice of the Lord was not distinctly discern'd among them, the Mind was so Hurried and tossed, so that there was not a clear discerning what might be done or left undone in many things.</q>
                  <hi>This is a very sad Reckning! For what will become of the first</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker <hi>Infallibility?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is nothing so <hi>Sad</hi> a <hi>Reckning,</hi> as the <hi>Snake</hi> is like to make, when he shall account, for all that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness, Injustice</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> which he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered


<pb n="457" facs="tcp:63041:240"/>
under the gilded pretence of advancing the Glory of God, the Unity of the Church, and the Good of Souls.</p>
               <p>But to his Flouting Question; <hi>What will become of the First</hi> Quaker <hi>Infallibility?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Answer, Nothing but well; because as I have largely shewn in the <hi>Section</hi> particularly treating of Infallibility, neither the <hi>First Quakers,</hi> nor the Present, have ever placed Infallibility in any Man or Men, but only in the Spirit of God: And the Manifestations of this being given by the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Jesus Christ, to lead Men to Heaven; it is absolutely necessary, that it be able, on it's part, Infallibly to answer the End for which it is given.</p>
               <p>Well, but if it be asked, <hi>How comes the Voice of the Lord not to be distinctly discerned?</hi> Since the Spirit of God is Infallible in its Manifestations to Men: Why, the Answer is ready, because when the Mind is <hi>Hurried</hi> and <hi>Tossed,</hi> and in the deep Exercise and Affliction, because of its condition; it cannot yet come to have so clear a <hi>discovery,</hi> and so <hi>distinct</hi> discerning of the Voice and Will of God, as afterwards in its further Growths in his Grace and Truth: And the different attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of such who are turned into the Way of the Lord, the Apostle hath exprest by <hi>going on from one Degree of Grace unto Another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 297. <hi>It seems these Hurryings and Tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings — did not come from the Holy Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Effects of the Work of the Power and Spirit of God, binding the <hi>Strong Man,</hi> and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging out the <hi>Old Leaven,</hi> does much agree with that which is described by the Prophet, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.11, 12. and hath sometimes been as with a <hi>Great and Strong Wind,</hi> sometimes as with <hi>an Earthquake,</hi>


                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:63041:241"/>
sometimes as with a <hi>Fire,</hi> before the <hi>Still Small Voice</hi> hath been heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Rage of the Enemy</hi> (as <hi>P. L.</hi> saith) is not small against the Soul, which is redeeming from under his Captivity, but endeavours to raise <hi>Hurryings</hi> and <hi>Tossings,</hi> whereby the mind might be so darkn'd, as not <hi>distinctly to discern the Voice of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now again for Stories: And there the <hi>Snake</hi> bestows 3 Pages about a Story, bearing date the 19th of the 8th Month, 1654. related by one whom he is contented, <hi>pro hac vice,</hi> to call a <hi>Minister,</hi> because his <hi>Narration</hi> is against the <hi>Quakers.</hi> But when that is over; then with <hi>all</hi> the rest of the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> he is (with the <hi>Snake</hi>) but as the <hi>Spawn of the Viper.</hi> But to take him in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Minister:</hi> He was a <hi>Seventh-Day Baptist,</hi> named <hi>Tho. Tillam,</hi> sometime Resident in the County of <hi>Durham,</hi> where he was <hi>Pastor</hi> to a People; but they, because of his <hi>Wickedness</hi> and <hi>Filthiness,</hi> did cast him out, and deny him. This same <hi>Minister</hi> (such a one in many respects, as the <hi>Snake</hi>) came up to <hi>London,</hi> and wanting <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi> to some place, he apply'd himself to the then Commissioners for approving and giving <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi> (such as they then used) to <hi>Ministers</hi>; this <hi>T. Tillam</hi> from them gets a Place in <hi>Essex,</hi> about <hi>Colchester,</hi> and here it is that he spreads this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: This Report one <hi>Gyles Firmin</hi> (another such Minister) takes up and puts at the end of a Book of his, which he writ against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and printed 1656. To this <hi>Edw. Burroughs</hi> did writ an Answer, printed the same Year; wherein he does positively deny both this Story of <hi>Tillam</hi>'s, and that other of <hi>Firmin</hi>'s (which the <hi>Snake</hi> mentions) and says it is a Lye. Then it was Incumbent upon the <hi>Snake</hi>'s two <hi>Ministers,


<pb n="459" facs="tcp:63041:241"/>
Tillam</hi> and <hi>Firmin,</hi> to have brought out their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials of the Truth of what they had said, but no such thing came; nay indeed one of them could not stay for that purpose, for he Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously run away from his Charge here in <hi>Essex,</hi> to which he had been <hi>Inducted,</hi> as before he was thrown out of his Charge in <hi>Durham,</hi> because of his Scandalous Carriage in it: As Witnesses yet living, do testifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 304. <hi>Since the Publishing the</hi> 1st <hi>Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Book, there has been published an astonishing account of some</hi> Quaker-<hi>Witches, who prosecuted one</hi> Henry Winder <hi>and his Wife for their Lives, — accusing them of Murder, from the Mouth of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And since the Publication of the <hi>Snake,</hi> an Answer hath been published thereto, entituled, <hi>An Old Apostate Exposed,</hi> manifesting the great Wickedness and Uncleanness of the said <hi>H. W.</hi> to his lasting Shame and Confusion of Face; and had he not been under strange Delusions and hardness of Heart, he could hardly have been drawn by his abettors, to have given such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to make his abominable Actions publick. — But so great is the Malice of the <hi>Snake,</hi> and such like envious Men, that even their own Shame will not deter them from venting their Malice, but let them reap the Fruit of their doings, and let's hear the <hi>Snake</hi> further.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  <q>One of them being examined, how this Revelation came to her, said, she could not tell, but she was sure it began in her Feet.</q>
               </p>
               <p>See what Idle and Ridiculous Stories this <hi>Snake</hi> licks up; surely if Satan's Delusions had not began in his Malicious Heart, he had never been brought so to vent it with his Pen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="460" facs="tcp:63041:242"/>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> But the <hi>Snake</hi> goes on to give an account of matters notoriously infamous, of which the said <hi>H. W.</hi> was by these two Women accused: Wherein, whether the Women were altogether Wrong, and how far the said <hi>Winder</hi> was Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, God knows. However for some satisfaction to the Moderate Reader, hear the said <hi>Winder,</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi> what they said then (<hi>viz.</hi> about 1674.) under their hands, as it is related by <hi>T. Cam</hi> in the aforesaid Answer, p. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We acknowledge and confess, that we have sinned and transgressed against the Lord God, and against his People, who have born grievous Burthens for us, we must needs confess before you. But this know, dear Friends, that the Enemy wrought in a Mystery in us, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading of us, that we might do such things and yet live: Then through the weakness of the Flesh, Sin took occasion and overcame us; then Sin being finished, it brought forth Death to the Innocent Life which we once lived in.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here it's plain from <hi>H. W</hi>'s own Confession, he had been about some foul piece of Work then, though now a fit Tool for the <hi>Snake</hi>'s turn.</p>
               <p>However let's a little further view the account of <hi>H. W's</hi> matter, as we have it in the <hi>Old Apostate Exposed,</hi> page 9, 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I shall now add what is so notoriously known in the Neighbourhood, that though the said <hi>H. W.</hi> be greatly hardned, yet I presume he cannot have a Face to deny; relating to their great Uncleanness, for which they were denyed of us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So that it seems before <hi>H. W.</hi> was fit for this <hi>Snake</hi>'s Communion, he was fit to be expell'd


<pb n="461" facs="tcp:63041:242"/>
ours: But since the <hi>Snake</hi> has him, let's shew him further what he has got, <hi>Old Apostate Exposed,</hi> p. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The said <hi>H. W.</hi> had her, that is now his Wife, so great with Child in his first Wife's days, that there was but about Six Weeks betwixt the Death of his first Wife, and the Birth of that Child.</q>
               </p>
               <p>However, a good Champion in the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and well enough to serve to Revile a People more Righteous than himself; and for whom, his Iniquities would no longer admit him a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and was therefore <hi>denied by them,</hi> p. 10. And though now he is grown so hard in Impiety, as to revile them that denied him for his Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>Yet while some little tenderness was remaining, he agreed to the Judgment of our Friends against him, as may further appear by his own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, cited also, p. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>(Thus)
<q>Be it known to all People, unto whom these presents shall be read, that I <hi>H. W.</hi> and <hi>A.</hi> my Wife, do acknowledge and confess before the living God, and all People, that we have sinned, and done that which we ought not to have done, in suffering the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sin in the Flesh to overcome us. — So this know all People, that it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Quakers</hi> Judgment, or Doctrine, or way of Worship, is false, that it caused us to fall from them, <hi>But our Fall was of our Selves.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So here's <hi>H. W.</hi> and his Wife against the <hi>Snake,</hi> his reviving this false matter, was to vilifie the <hi>Quakers</hi> and their Holy Doctrine; <hi>H. W.</hi> confesses to his Shame, there <hi>Fall was of themselves.</hi> — And on their Heads and his let it rest, till they Repent


<pb n="462" facs="tcp:63041:243"/>
and Ask Pardon of God, they for their Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and he for his Revilings on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>

               <head>SECT. XX. Of Enthusiasm or Inspiration, as said by the <hi>Snake,</hi> to be Owned by the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Ibid. p. 314. <hi>THe Word</hi> Enthusiasm <hi>signifies</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, <hi>and may mean a</hi> good <hi>as well as an</hi> evil Inspiration.</p>
               <p>I am no more in doubt of the Truth of this, than I am certain that the <hi>Snake</hi> did affirm falsly, when in <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 43. he said, <hi>There is no</hi> Enthusiasm <hi>where there is not Pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>These poor misled</hi> Quakers — <hi>are made to believe that the Church of</hi> England <hi>does wholly throw off all</hi> Inspiration <hi>of the Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> has told us (as above quoted) <hi>there is no</hi> Enthusiasm <hi>where there is not Pride.</hi> And if he would so mislead the <hi>poor Quakers</hi> as <hi>to believe,</hi> that she does <hi>wholly throw off all</hi> that; it would be in him no less a fault, than it is to bely the <hi>poor Quakers,</hi> and mislead his <hi>Reader,</hi> concerning what the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> do, or do not <hi>believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>I will here briefly set down the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England <hi>in this Point.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which if the <hi>Snake</hi> could have truly added [and my Agreeable Practice] as it would have been for his Credit, so it would have dwindled his Libel to a much less bulk, than that which


<pb n="463" facs="tcp:63041:243"/>
his numerous and many fork'd Falshoods have swell'd it to.</p>
               <p>But now he spends 4 or 5 Pages in giving Instances from the Service and Liturgy of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> concerning her Doctrine in this point of <hi>Inspiration</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; with which I am so far from being displeased, that I could with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure have read them all over, if he had given as many more, and am glad that so Essential a Truth, as is the <hi>Inspiration</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is owned by her (tho' this is not the first Knowledge I had of it, for I have some Years since read the same in her Liturgy.)</p>
               <p>And after the Instances he has given of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of the Holy Spirit, he says, p. 319. <hi>It is made necessary to every good word and thought, and the Cause of all the Good that is in us. And we are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to it, to Follow and be Guided by it; and are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it will lead us to all Truth that is requisite and necessary for our Eternal Salvation: It is this which opens the Scriptures to us, and our Vnderstandings rightly to apprehend the true sense and meaning of them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In all this, the <hi>Snake</hi> as he hath said, what is agreed to, and believed, by every <hi>Sober Quaker:</hi> So he hath herein declared the <hi>Inspiration of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost</hi> to be as <hi>Infallible</hi> as we believe it is. And now before we part, from a point in which we do (as he says) so exactly agree; let us a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reason upon it, and examine, whether he has <hi>Squared</hi> his foregoing Sections by this <hi>Infallible Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And first I shall observe, the <hi>Snake</hi> says, <hi>We are directed to it to Follow and be Guided by it, and are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured</hi> (no doubt by a certain Knowledge) <hi>that it will lead us to all Truth that is requisite and necessary for our Eternal Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:63041:244"/>Supposing this to be true; the <hi>Snake</hi> did very Scandalously (not to say worse) when he made the <hi>Devil</hi> as Infallible as any of their Church. For in p. 39. speaking of that Light or Knowledge which comes from God (which is the Inspiration of the H. Spirit) he saith:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If that Knowledge which comes from God be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then while the Devil follows that Light or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he must be Infallible: And if this be all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility which the</hi> Quakers <hi>ascribe to themselves</hi> (it seems it is all the <hi>Snake</hi> ascribes to the Church) <hi>It Distinguishes them not from Wicked Men or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is very hard; but there is worse yet. For though he does here say, That the <hi>Inspiration</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost, will lead us to all Truth, requisite and necessary to our Salvation,</hi> (and so consequently will bring them that follows it to Heaven. Yet <hi>this</hi> (they are his own Words, p. 40.) <hi>will no more prove it to be Infallible, or sufficient of it self to bring us to Heaven, than it will follow, that Man cannot die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God breathes into him the breath of Life; or that he is Omnipotent, because his Strength comes from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Instances from the <hi>Snake,</hi> though they clash, yet in some that follow, they will be found to cut one another up by the Roots: For here, in p. 319. He is very confident, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> does agree with us, concerning what we <hi>mean</hi> by the <hi>Light within.</hi> And I must needs say the same. Yet in p. 60. He gives the <hi>Light within</hi> (in which he says we do so much agree with the <hi>Church of England</hi>) a very evil Character, and says, <hi>It does totally root up and destroy all Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:63041:244"/>Nay, in p. 96. speaking of this Enthusiasm, he says, It is <hi>Inconsistent to the Government, either in Church or State, or any Security from all the Dismal and Enthusiastical</hi> Murthers, Rapines, <hi>and</hi> Outrage <hi>of the Zealots among the Jews, who went upon the same Principle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fye <hi>Snake,</hi> what the same Principle with the Church! These are very ill Characters to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that <hi>Inspiration,</hi> in which he is Confident the Church of <hi>England</hi> does agree with us. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he endeavours with a strange Contradiction to make all whole again, by adding in the next Words; <hi>yet shew'd</hi> no evil signs <hi>of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would not willingly tire my <hi>Reader</hi> with Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations of the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Contradictions upon this Head, and therefore I shall but gather, and add a few more, of which this is one worthy of notice. That though here, in Page 319. he has made every True Son of the Church an <hi>Enthusiast</hi>: Yet in p. 98. he says <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> (indefinitely) <hi>have no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; they have no Rule but their own Fancy, which is strongest in Mad-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> Is it not very <hi>Comical</hi> to see this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary dealing his Blows with so much <hi>blindness</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> thus to wound himself, while he thinks he is hitting of others: which is a very great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that whatsoever <hi>Inspiration</hi> he may pretend to believe to be in the Church, yet that he has lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle benefit from any, because of his repeated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Assertions in the same thing. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the propense Malice herein Legible, it's like he used less guard and caution, and car'd not how he put upon us, since he declares his Assurance, p. 32. <hi>That the Simplicity of our</hi> Quakers <hi>has depriv'd them of every one of these helps,</hi> which others might have to detect him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="466" facs="tcp:63041:245"/>But, be that as it will, let me here add one Observation, to shew yet plainer, if plainer can be, whether this blindness has led him.</p>
               <p>He would have us believe, nay, he says (p. 319.) <hi>We are assured that it</hi> (the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost) <hi>will lead us to all Truth, that is requisite and necessary for our Eternal Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if the <hi>Snake</hi> does here speak both the Churches Sense, and his own; I will shew, that notwithstanding he has writ a <hi>Section</hi> of <hi>Tythes,</hi> as payable to her; yet he has absolutely cut them up by the Root, while he doth positively affirm, that <hi>Teaching</hi> does cease; nay, that it's inconsistent with the <hi>Sufficiency of the Light within</hi>: But if this <hi>Light within,</hi> or Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Leads us to all Truth requisite and necessary for our Eternal Salvation,</hi> as both himself, and as (he says) the Church do confess. I think it hath <hi>Sufficiency</hi> enough, for all the wants of Men.</p>
               <p>For Proof that this <hi>Sufficiency</hi> supersedes all <hi>Teaching,</hi> and necessarily <hi>Tythes,</hi> which are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, turn to p. 166, 167. where speaking against us, upon this very Head of the <hi>Sufficiency of the Light within,</hi> he saith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teaching does in its own Nature cease, when Men are sufficiently Taught, therefore to those who hold the Sufficiency of the Light within, outward Preaching must be wholly Inconsistent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How far this agrees or contradicts what I have above quoted from him, in p. 319. the <hi>Reader</hi> may easily Judge.</p>
               <p>Now again to Quotations; and the first is, from p. 38, of <hi>W. P</hi>'s <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>G. F</hi>'s <hi>Journal,</hi> and is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have seen the Fruit of</hi> all <hi>other Ministries, by the few that are turn'd from the evil of their ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="467" facs="tcp:63041:245"/>And let the <hi>Snake</hi> think as he please, it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be one good Mark to Judge of a Ministry by its Fruit, those that are turn'd by it from the evil of their ways. It was the end of the Commission which God gave to his Apostles, to turn Men from <hi>Darkness to Light</hi>; and it is the end of the Commissions which he gives at this Day; and where this end is not Answer'd, there Fruit is not brought forth.</p>
               <p>His Objection, p. 320. is besides the Point, where he says, <hi>Mens being evil, may proceed from their own perverseness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For I know none that doubts it: But what is to the present Case, is; That Men's continuance in Evil, is often too much owing to the deadness of the Ministry they are under, as in <hi>Hosea</hi> 9. <hi>And there shall be like People, like Priest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>And to Justifie rather the Ministery of Theudas,</hi> Acts 5.36, 37. <hi>who got above</hi> 400 <hi>to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, it is to Justifie rather the Ministry of <hi>Peter,</hi> from the Holy Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. by which there was, at one Sermon, added to the Church, about 3000 Souls.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 320. quoted from p. 21. of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face before mention'd; where the <hi>Snake</hi> has given a notable Stroak of his Art in — I will give the Quotation first as he has made it, and then from the Preface it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They</hi> (the many Ministers in the World) <hi>declare of Religion, say many things true in Words, of God, Christ, and the Spirit, of Holiness, and Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but which of them all — ever directed a Man to a Divine Principle, or Agent, plac'd of God in Man to help him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="468" facs="tcp:63041:246"/>Thus the <hi>Snake</hi> has given it; but in the Book it self it is thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>They declare of Religion, say many things true in Words, of God, Christ, and the Spirit, of Holiness and Heaven; that all Men should Repent, and mend their Lives, or they will go to Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But which of them all pretend to Speak of their own Knowledge and Experience? Or ever directed Men to a Divine Principle or Agent, plac'd of God in Man, to help him, and how to know it, and wait to feel its Power, to work that good and acceptable Will of God in them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he; So that when the <hi>Snake</hi> Answer'd the Question, as himself had split it, and said, p. 321. <hi>Not one of them as I know of.</hi> He did but Answer one half of it; But if he will Answer the Question as it lies above, in <hi>W. P</hi>'s Words, and say: <hi>Not one of them Ministers, but have so directed Men, as is above-mentioned</hi>; there may Thousands be able to Confront him, and say his Answer is false.</p>
               <p>In like manner he abuses a Passage in p. 39. of the fore-mention'd Preface; Where <hi>W. P.</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Words to those in the Ministry, saith:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For even those that have receiv'd the Word of the Lord, had need wait for Wisdom, that they may see how to divide the Word aright; which plainly implieth, that it is possible for one that hath receiv'd the Word of the Lord, to Miss in the Division and Application of it, which must come from an Impatiency of Spirit, and self-working, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>What the <hi>Snake</hi> carps at in this, is the Word <hi>Miss,</hi> and among other things says, p. 321. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="469" facs="tcp:63041:246"/>I Answer; Very well. For as the Apostle does not Charge <hi>Timothy</hi> with having <hi>miss'd,</hi> when he gave him that Caution, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. to which <hi>W. Penn</hi> has respect in them Words [<hi>which plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth,</hi> &amp;c.] So I think the <hi>Snake</hi> will not be so hardy as to say, That either the Apostle or <hi>Timothy</hi> had <hi>miss'd</hi> in the <hi>Division of the Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 322. <hi>Will they give no body leave to miss but themselves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We give none leave to <hi>miss</hi> in the Division and Application of the Word: <hi>W. Penn</hi> hath truly said (as above) it is fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>an Impatiency of Spirit and Self-working.</hi> And if the <hi>Snake</hi> will not allow of that to be <hi>missing,</hi> it is easie to know that himself does <hi>miss</hi> exceedingly.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 324. The <hi>Snake</hi> makes a Quotation from p. 83. of <hi>G. F</hi>'s <hi>Journal,</hi> which is but a Repetition of what he has before quoted, in p. 28. and which I have already Answer'd, in p. 76, 77, fore-going, and therefore need not here repeat it.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 325. <hi>But when,</hi> p. 29. <hi>of his Preface</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mention'd) <hi>Mr.</hi> Penn <hi>wou'd persuade us, that this</hi> Fox <hi>had outward Revelations, and Visions from God — This Obliges us to look more narrowly into the Matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Snake,</hi> by narrowly looking, can prove to the contrary, of what <hi>W. Penn wou'd persuade us</hi>; then he will look to some purpose. But if he <hi>Misses,</hi> in judging of <hi>Revelations and Visions,</hi> and that he may, as well as <hi>Miss</hi> in Dividing and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Word: Then while he confidently calls <hi>G. Fox</hi> a <hi>Wizard,</hi> he proves himself to be <hi>Possess'd with an Evil Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 326, 327. <hi>It is desir'd that Mr.</hi> Penn <hi>wou'd</hi> now <hi>Publish his Register of Quaker Prophecies, or for ever after hold his Peace.</hi>

               <p>But besides, There are already Publish'd in the <hi>Journal,</hi> and other of our Books, so many, that if the <hi>Snake</hi> can but prove them false, he will go a great length to prevent the Credibility of all others.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 328. <hi>When</hi> Tho.

               <p>That <hi>Tho.

The Caution was good and useful; but it is wholly false, that there was any such thing as a <hi>Quaker Sanhedrim,</hi> or that they took <hi>him to Task,</hi> or that they <hi>rejected him,</hi> for that his Prophecy. Indeed, there was no room to reject the <hi>Vision,</hi> which soon came to pass: For the Man came to Town on the Sixth Day, commonly call'd <hi>Friday,</hi> Employ'd that and the next Day, in going about the City, and Publishing his <hi>Vision</hi>: And the <hi>Fire</hi> broke out on the First Day Morning following (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd <hi>Sunday</hi>) and was indeed a dreadful Judgment.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Snake,</hi> as he saith, p. 329. began this his Prophane <hi>Comparison,</hi> in p. 5. of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction</hi>: In Answer to which, so far as he there speaks of it; I have reply'd to it, p. 33, 34, 35. fore-going, and shall here go in my Reply, to what he saith further on this Head.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 332. <hi>This was the first Instance we find of a Prophet, who submitted to be cur'd of his Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by Physick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is <hi>Prophanely</hi> False. <hi>G. F.</hi> did not <hi>Submit to be cur'd of his Inspiration by Physick. G. F.</hi> does in p. 5. of his <hi>Journal,</hi> speak, how that in his Youth (for he was then in the 21th Year of his Age) being in very great Affliction of Spirit, he went to several <hi>Priests,</hi> that from them he might have receiv'd some Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Comfort: But they were so far from being Spiritual Comforters, that one of them was in great Rage with him, because (as they were walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Priest's Garden) he accidentally set his Foot upon the side of one of the Beds in it. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would needs give him some Physick, and did endeavour to let <hi>him Blood</hi>: This <hi>G. F.</hi> mentions, to shew how much they were estrang'd from that Work of God, then in him: And he there fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speaks, How that his Body was, <hi>as it were


<pb n="473" facs="tcp:63041:249"/>
dried up,</hi> with <hi>Sorrows, Grief and Trouble,</hi> that he could have wish'd he had never been born: And the reason which <hi>G. Fox</hi> there gives, why he could have so wish'd, was, because of the <hi>Vanity and Wickedness,</hi> and the <hi>Blaspheming of the Name of the Lord,</hi> which was among the People. And the <hi>Snake,</hi> by his light esteem of this concern, does shew, That he is of them that glory in doing wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly; and does prophanely <hi>mock</hi> with those, who did occasion the Prophet's Complaint, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.18. <hi>Why is my Pain perpetual, and my Wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed</hi>— And from this same Cause proceeded the Complaint of the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.19. <hi>My bowels, my bowels; I am pain'd at my very heart, my heart maketh a noise within me</hi>—</p>
               <p>And notwithstanding the mockery of the <hi>Snake,</hi> it is always Matter of Sorrow, Grief and Trouble, to the Righteous, to see and hear the wickedness of the Wicked, and more especially and eminently to those, whom God doth immediately by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Power, call and lay a necessity upon, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and testifie against it.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 132. <hi>And</hi> (as he tells us, p. 8.) <hi>when all hopes in them</hi> (Priests) <hi>and in all Men was gone, so that I had nothing outwardly to help me, nor could tell what to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Snake</hi> cuts off the next Words of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> wherein he says, <hi>Then, O then, I heard a voice which said,</hi>
                  <q>There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy condition.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And instead of giving these Words, which are of moment, and are a sound Truth, he does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely add: <hi>In this most dismal of all Conditions, quite over-run, and given up to despair (the blackest Fury in Hell.)</hi> So that it seems the <hi>Snake</hi> does, by a most Blasphemous Implication account it the


<pb n="474" facs="tcp:63041:250"/>
most dismal of all Conditions, and to be quite over-run, and given up to Despair, to hear the Joyful Tydings (to a weary Soul) <hi>There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy Condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to <hi>G. F.</hi> this was Glad Tydings of great Joy, and as he gave up, to learn of this <hi>Wonderful Counsellor,</hi> Jesus Christ, who does indeed speak to the Conditions of all Men: He did, as he relates, p. 17. <hi>Come up in Spirit, through the Flaming Sword, into the Paradise of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And I do Testifie, there is no other way to come into it, than by obeying the Teachings of Jesus Christ; and this Obedience is so far from raising any <hi>mad Joy,</hi> as the <hi>Snake</hi> does Blasphemously call it; that it is Impossible for a Man to have more evident Demonstration of any thing in the World, than he may have of his future Happiness, if he grows up in Obedience and Faithfulness to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, the way</hi> that leads to it.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>He tells as a wonderful opening, (to repeat his Cant) which the Lord gave to him— thus,</hi> p. 5.
<q>About the beginning of the Year 1646, as I was going to <hi>Coventry,</hi> and entring towards the Gate, a Consideration arose in me, how it was said, That all Christians were Believers, both <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi>: And the Lord open'd to me, that if all were Believers, then were all born of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here was a mighty Discovery!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after all the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Prophane Banter, of <hi>Wonderful Opening,</hi> and <hi>Mighty Discovery</hi>; It is a great Truth, and it was a wonderful Opening in <hi>John</hi> the Apostle, where he testifies, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. <hi>Whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the World, and this is the Victory that overcometh the World, even your Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="475" facs="tcp:63041:250"/>This Divine Truth, when it was again opened to <hi>G. F.</hi> by the Openings of the same Holy Spirit, did well deserve to be mentioned by him, to shew the Unity and Harmony that there is in its Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries; the same may be said with respect to that other <hi>Opening from the Lord,</hi> mentioned by the <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 334. which <hi>G. Fox</hi> mentions, p. 5. of his Journal, <hi>That being bred at</hi> Oxford <hi>or</hi> Cambridge, <hi>was not enough to fit and qualifie Men to be Ministers of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which is agreable to what the Apostle testifies, Gal. 1.11, 12. <hi>But I certifie you, Brethren, that the Gospel which was preached of me, is not after man; for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What the Apostle does here certifie the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians concerning his Commission, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to open to <hi>G. Fox</hi> was the way and means by which all that were truly his <hi>Ministers</hi> came to be such. And tho' the <hi>Snake</hi> would suggest and insinuate as if the contrary <hi>was never the belief of any one Man in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is false, nor can those who receive their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from Men, either after the mode of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> or otherwise, say they <hi>neither received it of Man,</hi> nor were <hi>taught it, but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 335. <hi>He tells,</hi> p. 6. <hi>at another time it was opened in me: That God who made the World, did not dwell in Temples made with Hands: And this at the first seem'd a Strange Word; because both Priests and People use to call their Temples or Churches</hi> Dreadful Places <hi>and</hi> Holy Ground.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>G. Fox,</hi> upon which the <hi>Snake</hi> adds a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Lie: <hi>It seems</hi> Fox, <hi>did not know before, but that God dwelt in a Church, as a Man does in a House, so as to be lock'd up, and to be no where else when he was there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="476" facs="tcp:63041:251"/>No, <hi>Snake,</hi> there seems no such thing of <hi>G. F.</hi> but if the People, who continue to call them <hi>Dreadful Places</hi> and <hi>Holy Ground,</hi> do know no better; their Superstitious Ignorance, (if it be as described by the <hi>Snake</hi>) will much of it be laid to the Priests Charge, who have so blindly led the People.</p>
               <p>But if none of all this <hi>Gross Blindness,</hi> there is yet a Reprovable Misapprehension, not grounded upon any Example or Authority from the Gospel-Day, so far as it's recorded in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That is, calling their Churches <hi>Dreadful Places</hi> and <hi>Holy Ground,</hi> from a supposition, that after their <hi>Consecration,</hi> there is a kind of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or more Immediate and Powerful Presence of God in them by vertue of it.</p>
               <p>This Reprovable Misapprehension, as Peoples Minds did continue under it, so they were therein liable to let it increase to a <hi>Superstitious Reverence.</hi> And God, in the Calling Forth of his Servant, did in this, as in other things, open his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and let him see, according to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Proto-Martyr, Acts 7.48. <hi>The Most High dwelleth not in Temples made with hands.</hi> And he there further shews, that Consecrations of Houses are vain: Nor indeed is there, from the Authority of the New Testament, any Holiness to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Place. The Doctrine there deliver'd is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God</hi>; and agreeable to this is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>And such are all his Discoveries, all his New Light; even this Fundamental Distinguishing Principle of the</hi> Quakers, <hi>of the Light within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Discoveries</hi> before-mentioned, I have shewn to be agreeable to the Scripture; and the <hi>Snake</hi> hath been so far from offering to prove them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; that he would have it supposed they are the Concessions of every <hi>Man in his Right Wits.</hi> Where


<pb n="477" facs="tcp:63041:251"/>
is then the Objection? Why they are Truths of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notice; or, in the <hi>Snake</hi>'s <hi>Prophane Railery,</hi> they are <hi>Notable Discoveries,</hi> the <hi>Commonest Notions in the World,</hi> which <hi>G. F.</hi> has here taken for <hi>Supernatural Revelations</hi>; and because the <hi>Snake</hi> supposes them to have been the <hi>Common Knowledge</hi> of Mankind; therefore he Concludes, they were no Openings from the Spirit of Truth in <hi>G.

               <p>But this is a false Conclusion, because he may find in Holy Writ, that the <hi>Supernatural Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Discoveries</hi> and <hi>Openings</hi> which it hath pleased God to give to particular Persons; have frequently been such Truths. Thus the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> had a <hi>Supernatural Revelation</hi> in answer to his Petition: <hi>My Grace is sufficient for thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. And I would know of the <hi>Snake,</hi> who then there was, that had received the Christian Faith, that did not believe as much. And had the <hi>Corinthians</hi> been as Blasphemously Prophane as this our Adversary, they might have queried in his words, p. 335. Why <hi>so sottishly Ignorant as to take the Commonest Notions in the World for such Wonders, such Supernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how common or mean soever this <hi>Snake</hi> may judge many of those Truths to be, which the Holy Spirit hath, and doth at this day reveal and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver upon the Spirits of those who are obedient to it, in the Openings which it gives of the Scriptures; I must needs say, that were it possible for a Man, Distinctly to remember and repeat the whole Old and New Testament; so that all the Truths there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained were of easie and common notice to him, yet the advantage he would thence reap, would be nothing in comparison to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he may reap from having but some of the Truths therein recorded, opened upon his Spirit, by the Holy Spirit, which did at first Dictate them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="478" facs="tcp:63041:252"/>And the Reason is, because men cannot be made Holy by Imitation, but only by Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which as it is the work of the Holy Spirit, so that work is began, in what the Scripture calls the <hi>Day of Small Things.</hi> The first Discoveries are often small, not only to try the Obedience, but to encourage to Faithfulness. And they who will not thankfully receive its lowest Manifestations, and obey the Discoveries of the Light of Christ, in the forsaking and denying vain Honours and Language are not likely to be obedient to greater Discoveries, if they had them.</p>
               <p>Ibid. p. 332. <hi>But</hi> G. Keith <hi>for his Christian Doctrine of a</hi> Christ without, <hi>was condemn'd by their Late Yearly Meeting in their Bull of Excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was, not for Christian Doctrine, but Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Practice, which <hi>G. Keith</hi> was denied, as the Testimony given against him, does fully shew in these words,
<q>
                     <hi>George Keith,</hi> of late hath been, and yet is acted by an Unchristian Spirit, which hath moved and led him to <hi>stir</hi> up Contention and Strife in the Church of Christ, and to cause Divisions, Separations and Breaches amongst them that Profess the Truth; and that the tendency of Divers of his late Writings and Actings, hath been to expose the Truth and Friends thereof.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What has Christian Doctrine to do with such Unchristian Actions? They have no agreement; and this was the Cause there assigned of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> now gives (p. 333.) part of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which he says <hi>W. P.</hi> sent to <hi>R. Turner</hi> of <hi>Pensilvania,</hi> in which, speaking of <hi>G. Keith,</hi> are these words,
<q>I love his Spirit, and honour his Gifts, and his Peculiar Learning, especially Tongues and Mathematicks, his Platonick Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies too; all being sanctified to the Truth's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,


<pb n="479" facs="tcp:63041:252"/>
which is worthy to have the Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which the <hi>Snake</hi> says, <hi>here will be a sad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Infallible Discerning Spirit which the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>do appropriate to themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I shall first say, that it is utterly false, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> have ever <hi>appropriated to themselves</hi> the Spirit of Discerning. It is only <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propiated</hi> to the Holy Spirit; and what true Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of Spirits is given to Men, must be from that Fountain.</p>
               <p>Now as to the Letter, the words above quoted do well consist with that Spirit of Discerning; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in order of Time it appears not, but that that Letter was writ some Years before the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Yearly Meeting against <hi>G. K.</hi> which I have before quoted. And if <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments in Learning had continued to have been <hi>all sanctified to the Truth's Service,</hi> as it is there exprest, which was the ground of that Love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in declared. He could not have stirred up Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Strife, nor caus'd Divisions, Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Breaches, which was the reason of his being denied.</p>
               <p>But further, If that Letter was writ, when there was some small beginnings of Misunderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt <hi>G. K.</hi> and those in <hi>Pensilvania:</hi> Yet the words of that Letter, referring the Love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to his Spirit and Learning, to be, <hi>as all are sanctified,</hi> &amp;c. they are very safe; as <hi>G. K.</hi> would also have been, had he kept to the Holy Spirit which sanctifies; and that would both have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented further Disturbance, and removed all Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding.</p>

               <p>A <hi>Snake</hi> turn <hi>Knight Errant,</hi> the <hi>Scandal</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> presume to set up for her <hi>Representative: O Monstrum!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to his Ridiculous Arrogance: <hi>I do here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> &amp;c. What mighty <hi>I</hi> is this? What Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Snake</hi>? Why, an <hi>Anonymous,</hi> who is as fear ful of putting his Name to his <hi>Demand,</hi> as he is to appear before Justice. One, who Jugler-like, plays Tricks in the Dark: Therefore sure no true Pleni-Potent of the Church, not one Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally Delegated by Her.</p>
               <p>And he is not less the Church's Delegate, than he is <hi>John Selden</hi>'s, who, in his time, was one of the Glories of this Nation; one whose Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Labours may at once endear and preserve his Memory, with those who know his Works. And with what Forehead, one so differently qualified as is the <hi>Snake,</hi> should pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Satisfaction, (if the Demand were just) in his Behalf, is no small wonder? But the Demand is Arrogant, Trifling and Impudent, in that he says <hi>F. Howgil</hi> has <hi>stoln whole Paragraphs</hi> verbatim <hi>out of</hi> J. Selden's History of Tythes. I have with what care I can, examined the Charge, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Books, and cannot find one whole Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph so taken. I find that <hi>F. H.</hi> does in some places treat of Tythes, in the same manner as <hi>J. Selden</hi> does; and the Books which are his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities he puts mostly in his Margin: And among others which he quotes, <hi>J. Selden,</hi> by Name, is one in his <hi>History of Tythes:</hi> and upon this Subject of Tythes he is twice quoted by <hi>F. Howgil, viz.</hi> p. 482, and in p. 567. which is sufficient to shew, that <hi>F. H.</hi> is no Plagiary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="481" facs="tcp:63041:253"/>But since the <hi>Snake</hi> hath thus taken upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a <hi>Knight Errant,</hi> I will direct him to a piece of Work of the sort he here speaks of, and if he can get satisfaction, he may pretend to be Captain of the Band of <hi>Knight Errants.</hi> He may find it in <hi>John Daille</hi>'s Treatise of the <hi>Right use of the Fathers,</hi> first Book, p. 104.

Thus he.</p>
               <p>I spare to give more such Instances till the <hi>Snake</hi> shall here have demanded Reparation in due form. But now we are speaking upon the vice of Stealing, it may not be improper to remind him, that it had been highly necessary for him to have surveyed himself, and considered with what Face he could unjustly object Theft to <hi>F. Howgil,</hi> because he speaks of the same Subject in the same manner with <hi>John Selden,</hi> whom he also names: While himself, if he had been duly prosecuted for Theft, must of necessity have been hang'd, if at least the Law of the Country where he stole the Virgin, whom he made his Unhappy Wife, be in that case agreeable to ours.</p>
               <p>But as to the Punishment I shall not now enquire, nor yet what <hi>Reparation</hi> he made to the injur'd Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or Relations. But as to the Fact, it had the Forms of <hi>Theft,</hi> in that he had not <hi>their good leave before</hi> he <hi>took her</hi>; and whether the Canons


<pb n="482" facs="tcp:63041:254"/>
do not declare the <hi>Theft</hi> of Souls, the <hi>Stealing</hi> of a Wife to be in the same Class of Crimes, in which himself puts Obedience to the King <hi>de Facto.</hi> It may be proper for him to <hi>consider,</hi> which if he find, and that he squares himself in his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for that, by his practice in this; his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence will be as singular, as his tenacious Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience hath been observable.</p>
               <p>But of this, now no more, nor had there been so much, nay here none at all; had it not been thrown in my way, by his first crying out <hi>Thief, Thief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> hath in this <hi>Section</hi> made very many scornful and false Comparisons (according to his title) between <hi>G. Fox, Muggleton</hi> and <hi>Oliver</hi>'s <hi>Porter,</hi> which is but a repetition of somewhat of the same kind in the beginning of his Libel, and which I have replied to, from p. 33, to 36. it being there somewhat Argumentative; and the Enlargement which he here makes, together with the Addition of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s <hi>Porter</hi> in the Comparison, has so much of Scandal to all the Pretences of Religion, that his Impudence deserves no other Answer than Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, nor himself any other treatment, than as a Person very Contemptible, even as the Scandal of Religion, and the bane of Society: In that against the Experience of many Thousands of our Friends, against the knowledge of very many Persons of all Ranks, amongst whom are some of Chief Note and Dignity who are not of Us, before whom, and with whom <hi>G. Fox</hi> for Forty or more Years, even to his Death, had occasion to converse: Towards all which Persons, his Sobriety of Life, Peaceable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, Exemplary Conversation in Godliness and Humility, was evident Demonstration, that he acted both as became a Man and a Christian: Should yet after his Death be by this Incendiary, listed with a Known <hi>Mad-Man</hi> and Profest <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="483" facs="tcp:63041:254"/>I come now to Consider of a Letter which the <hi>Snake</hi> gives at the end of his <hi>Libel,</hi> which he says is <hi>Spelt and Pointed according to the Original,</hi> and of which he gives some bits before in p. 115.</p>
               <p>And here I have to say, that what he calls <hi>John Audland</hi>'s Letter, I have many Reasons to believe is none of his.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>First,</hi> Some former Adversaries have (as the <hi>Snake,</hi> p. 115.) pretended to give some Pieces of it; but have contradicted one another, as to the Matter of it; by which contradiction, in terms, it is fully shewn, that they could not all be right, as they have pretended they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Spelling and Pointing of it, it is so far from being agreeable to <hi>John Audland</hi> in other of his Writings; that it hath many plain marks of being Spurious, because he was Correct in both; and did understand Orthography better than is shewn in this pretended Letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Pretended Letter from <hi>J. Audland</hi> to <hi>G. Fox</hi> was not so well contriv'd, but that the Forgers, who have heretofore given it with a date, have made it bear date from <hi>Bristol, Anno,</hi> 1665. This was a very unlucky oversight, which as it cannot be now mended, so it absolutely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the pretence of its being his; because <hi>John Audland</hi> was buried in <hi>Westmerland</hi> the 24th of the 1st Month, <hi>March</hi> 1663. being the last day of that Year. So that it appears he was dead about two years before the Date of the Pretended Letter.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Lastly, John Audland,</hi> has in a <hi>Collection of Books and Epistles</hi> writ, some by himself, and some by him and <hi>John Camm,</hi> and of which we have undoubted Proof that they are genuine, giving very many Testimonies of his Clear and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Principle, Holy Reverence and Honour to Jesus Christ according to Holy Writ, which do effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally


<pb n="484" facs="tcp:63041:255"/>
shew that it was far from him, to attribute Divine Honours to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> or any Man. Some of which Testimonies I shall here subjoin from that <hi>Collection,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>These, with very many more Plain and Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Confessions of <hi>J.

My Accuser presently shews his Prejudice and Enmity against me without cause, <hi>As with a new Confession of Faith, in such dubious and general Terms, as may at first sight deceive the unwary Reader</hi>; tho' I gave it in as plain and as much in scriptural Terms as I could, and as the Matters concerned would admit of.

Whither will not Pride and Envy precipate some Men? What scriptural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to confess <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> and the holy Scriptures (as above) is this no Contradiction to Heresie?

Is it to confess Jesus Christ come in the Flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to holy Scripture-Testimony of him? Oh! For shame, leave off such blind Envy and blasphemous Abuse.</p>
               <p>And now to come to the Point, How or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in have <hi>I slily insinuated Excuse and Defence of it</hi> (i. e. <hi>of the Heart of Heresie,</hi> as before?) p. 175. <hi>Thus</hi> (saith my Accuser) <hi>in his first Article he confesses Jesus to be the Christ, even the same Jesus Christ who was born of the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>at</hi> Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confess this is part of my Confession, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe this is either not contradictory to the Heart of Heresie, or that it is any Excuse or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it.

               <p>Now have I herein <hi>attributed no more to Jesus Christ</hi> than to my self, as he saith? Where did I ever <hi>attribute</hi> this to my self? Where is the <hi>meer Fallacy?</hi> Not in my Confession to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, but in this Horrid Abuse, and Gross Perversion thereof.

For Shame, who cannot see such Malice and Madness as my Adversary has vented against me in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
               <p>Again, I find no Fallacy in my Confession to Christ, as without; nor is there any, unless I had denied the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> (of whom Christ was born) to be without, or <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to be without us; nor doth Christ, being without, prove him not to be our Light within; for the same Christ said, <hi>I am the Light of the World</hi>; therefore he is our Light, <hi>yea the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Light</hi> (as he calls it) they being included in the World.

                  <q>But that the Divine Anointing (to which Name Christ hath relation) virtually is in some measure or degree afforded to every Member of his Body, but not so <hi>amply</hi> as to him the Head; <hi>nor for any Member to be called Christ, but a Christian</hi>; because Christ received the Anointing, the Holy Spirit, not by measure, but in fulness; and because he is the Head of the Body, the Church.</q>

               <p>And in the true Sense of Scripture, I have both confessed Christ's coming in the Flesh, and as he the <hi>Word</hi> was made (or took) Flesh, <hi>John</hi> 1.14.

                  <q>We own no such saying, as that the Holy Doctrine, or Divine Precepts of Scripture, is either Dust, Death, or the Serpent's Meat, but truly profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to us by the Assistance of God's Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit given to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And this was in direct Opposition to <hi>F.

Introd.</hi> p. 18. to his <hi>New Rome.</hi> [We do not believe any of these Quakers ever so said of the Precepts and Doctrine, nor do they own any such Saying, I wholly disown it.] But then to beg the Question, <hi>What was it you called Dust and Serpents Meat? Was it nothing else but the Ink and Paper? Did any Body ever say, That these were not Dust? Or, Is that any part of the Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us?</hi> Snake, p. 177.</p>
               <p>Here he yields the Point; he grants the Ink and Paper to be <hi>Dust.</hi> I said, <hi>Will decay and turn to Dust</hi>; but so will not the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Gospel,</hi> nor the <hi>Holy Doctrine contain'd in Scripture.</hi> And it has been confess'd by <hi>F.

That the Books and Writings in Ink and Paper will wear out, so will not the <hi>Word,</hi> is evident. <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> could burn <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet's Roll, or Book, writ with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

after the Roll was burnt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. If then the Books, the Paper and Ink be combustible, or will decay and turn to Dust, but not the <hi>Word,</hi> nor the <hi>Doctrine</hi>; where's then the Controversie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when the same thing is granted on both sides?</p>
               <p>He quotes <hi>Gr.

And in the said <hi>Gr.

               </p>
               <p>For my part, as I am not in the least conscious to my self of the least Contempt of Holy Scripture, nor yet of the Bible; for I have always preferr'd it to all other Books extant in the World, and more affected Reading therein, than any other Book, even from my Childhood; and often bless Divine Providence, for preserving to us the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: So I know of none among us guilty of contemning them: Neither is what's said, from any Contempt of Scripture, no more than it is of the Earth and the Heavens, to say, They shall wax old and perish, but the <hi>Word</hi> that made them endureth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.25, 26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.11, 12. But say what we can in this Case to clear our selves of any Contempt to the Holy Scripture, this our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Judge and Accuser will not believe us: He's bent to asperse, he has swallow'd down so much of the sour Leven of the Malice of a few false Brethren, Persecutors and Apostates, from whom he derives much of his Authority; and thus scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilously

and most falsly imposes upon me, <hi>viz. And therefore</hi> George, <hi>notwithstanding all thy meally Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, it is; it is indeed</hi> George, <hi>it is the very Doctrine of the Scriptures which you blaspheme as Dust, and Death, and Serpents Meat, on purpose to bring Men off from trying your pernicious Heresies, by those Sacred Oracles,</hi> Ibid.</p>
               <p>This is a pernicious Abuse and Calumny, against my self, and others of us (to out-face us against our very Sense and Consciences) and in good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science I Testifie against it; it never entred into my Intention or Thoughts, so to blaspheme the Doctrine of the Scriptures, as to term or deem it Dust, Death or Serpents Meat: the Lord rebuke this lying, envious Spirit.</p>
               <p>Neither do <hi>I vilifie the written Doctrine and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of God, in comparison of our New Light</hi> (as he falsly calls it, p. 177.) but reverently esteem them: The Man makes no Conscience of Defaming us. Neither do we <hi>quarrel with the Law, and the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> nor yet with Writing or Scripture, as 'tis in <hi>Ink and Paper,</hi> but distinguish between the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> and the <hi>Things written,</hi> which is no contempt to either. We are thankful to Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for both the Scripture, or Writing, and the Holy Doctrine and Divine Precepts therein writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; for they testifie unto Christ our Light, and our Light to the Truth of them.</p>
               <p>And to what he saith, <hi>If any do not teach the same,</hi> i. e. <hi>according to the Law and the Testimony, or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word, it is because there is no Light in them,</hi> Isa. 8.20. And then puts this Emphasis upon it, <hi>No Light, George! Mark that: Your false Pretences to the Light within are here over-rul'd,</hi> Ibid.</p>
               <p>I deny that our Pretences to the Light within is either false, or are here over-rul'd; if they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is <hi>no

Morning</hi> to them. If he'll see the Note from the Hebrew in some Bibles, he may see <hi>no Morning</hi> in the Margin, over against <hi>no Light:</hi> Then let him Mark that. But is there no Light in the Creation before Morning, either inward or outward, pray? Did not the Light shine in Darkness, before it shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of Darkness? And had not the Believers a more sure Word of Prophecy, whereunto they did well to take heed, as unto a Light shining in a dark place, until the Day dawned, and the Day-star arose in their Hearts? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. And are not many reproved by the Light in them, for tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Lies, and speaking contrary to the Word? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore there was some true Light in them, before the <hi>Morning</hi> appeared to them.</p>
               <p>And though my Accuser says, Ibid. <hi>These, and such-like Texts, detect and explode the miserable Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Blasphemy of these Pretenders to Light.</hi> For which we have his own <hi>ipse dixit,</hi> and much such Raillery, but know no plain Texts of Scripture yet produced by him, that so detects us; but his own Falshood and great Ignorance about the Light, is very apparent.</p>
               <p>Again, he falsly defames and reproaches me, from p. 28. <hi>Of Innocency Triumphant,</hi> with <hi>excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and justifying Diabolical Suggestions in the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-Refuge</hi> (he saith) <hi>against the Authority of the Sacred Scripture,</hi> by saying, <hi>That it questioned but some, not all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Accuser has a most odious, injurious course of defaming and perverting, as well as curtalizing our Words, wherein he has taken part with his famous Author, <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> to whom the Answer was given, on which he grounds his black Charge against me, <hi>Of Justifying Diabolical Suggestions,</hi> &amp;c. In which Answer I expresly declare thus, <hi>viz. His Accusation that the Quakers Insinuate, in a Book


<pb n="496" facs="tcp:63041:261"/>
called</hi> The Quakers Refuge, <hi>That What the true Prophets spake was false, and What the false Prophets spoke was true,</hi> p. 47. <hi>New Rome Vnm.</hi> p. 23. We disown these Expressions, and I think they are not duly inferred from the said Book, questioning whether <hi>some Words were not spoken by wicked Men, some by wise Men, ill applied; some by good Men, ill expressed,</hi> &amp;c. Now, at my saying, <hi>Yet this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned but of some Words in Scripture, not all</hi>; he takes occasion to Rail fearfully against me, as a <hi>Justifier of Diabolical Suggestions.</hi> When my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was not with the least intent to oppose or lessen the Authority of the Sacred Scriptures; but in direct opposition to <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Calumny, in these general, odious, and false Expressions, <hi>viz. That the Quakers insinuate, that What the true Prohets spake, was false.</hi> Which Expressions we utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as both in themselves grosly false, against the true Prophets, and falsly charged on the Quakers, to defame them.</p>
               <p>And as to the Questions cited out of the <hi>Quak. Refuge,</hi> at which Offence is taken, 1. They are not mine. 2. I do not believe they are the Author's of that <hi>Quak. Refuge,</hi> though Cited by him. 3. It is apparent he does not espouse them as his own Judgment, nor make them the Matter in that present Controversie, nor resolve them in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative; but seems to recite and wave them, as Originally proceeding from some other Person, as I understand. The furthest that can be drawn from my said Answer to <hi>F. B.</hi> that may seem offensive (which I should be sorry for, if 'twere really so) is my seeming to grant the Question, <hi>That in some Words some true Prophets were mistaken.</hi> And if this be made an Offence, I think 'tis no real one, for I designed none: However, I still confess, <hi>I believe the Record of Scripture to be true.</hi> Good Men, and


<pb n="497" facs="tcp:63041:261"/>
some true Prophets also have been, and may be mistaken in some things, and have had their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and Failings truly recorded in Scripture; and also their Deliverances, for good Ends and Admonition to others. Was not <hi>Samuel</hi> a good Man and a Prophet, and yet mistaken, when he took <hi>Eliab</hi> for the Lords Anointed? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.6, 7. And in the Argument upon <hi>Job</hi> in the ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is marked,
<q>That <hi>Job</hi> maintaineth a good Cause, but handleth it evil. Again, his Adversaries have an evil Matter, but they defend it craftily. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he was assured that God had not rejected him; yet through his great Torments and Afflictions, he burst forth into many Inconveniences both of Words and Sentences.</q>
See the Argument at large.</p>
               <p>And was not the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> mistaken when he thought himself alone, or none in <hi>Israel</hi> but himself, that was zealous for the Lord God of Hosts? But what saith the Answer of God unto him? <hi>I have reserved unto my self seven thousand Men, that have not bowed the knee to Baal,</hi> 1 King. 19.10, 18. Rom. 11.3, 4. And to say but little of the Old Prophet that persuaded the Young Prophet, contrary to the Word of the Lord, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. I could instance <hi>Jonas, David,</hi> and several others that were good Men, who had some Weaknesses and Mistakes in Words and Actions, yet the Lord was good to them and helped them, according to the Integrity of their Hearts towards him. And these Things being truly recorded in Scripture for Instruction and Admonition, we truly esteem the Scripture-Record thereof. And even where the <hi>Words, Lies, Blasphemies</hi> and Actions of the Devil, wicked Men and Persecutors, and the Judgments which befel them, are recorded in the Scriptures, we own the Record or History thereof to be true, and highly esteem it for Instruction and Warning


<pb n="498" facs="tcp:63041:262"/>
to Men. And to distinguish between the Words of God in Scripture, and the Words of the Devil, is but what the Scripture it self doth, which can be no Contempt to it; for I have known some stumble, by some of the Priests making no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but calling all that's written in Scripture <hi>the Word of God</hi>; as one that was the Mayor of <hi>Thetford</hi> near forty Years ago, told me, That a Priest wanting Induction into the vacant Benefice, and preaching there for Approbation, took his Text out of the Words wherewith the Devil tempted Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. And bidding the People hearken to the Word of God, as they should find it written in such a Chapter and Verse; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Person that told me of it was so offended, that he would not give his Voice to chuse the said Priest, because he had told them, that was the Word of God, which was the Words of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Now let none be so disingenuous as to take this as in Contempt of the Holy Scripture, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Precepts therein; for where either the Words, Blaspemies, wicked Actions or Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Devil or Men, are therein mentioned, the Record thereof is true, and in Testimony against them, and the intent of such Record holy, just and good.</p>

But really</hi> George (quoth he) <hi>this is not re-assuming your Christian Testimony in the Affirmative, as thou didst promise,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>still hiding your self in the Dark in Negatives: But we would know affirmatively, what it is you do profess; and this thou didst promise, and this thou hast not perform'd,</hi> p. 179.</p>
               <p>Here he accuseth me with breach of Promise; but very falsly, as in the said 11th Article it is plain, that my Confession of Christ Jesus himself, is not only Negative but affirmative, namely, <hi>He being the Substance and End of all Figures, Types and Shadows.</hi> Is not this Affirmative, pray? And as remote from Truth is his accusing the <hi>Quakers Books of calling Christ Jesus a Type or Figure of their Light within,</hi> p. 183. I know no such Books of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers that so call Christ Jesus <hi>A Type of our Light within,</hi> but that he is our Light, which hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd us among the rest of Mankind.</p>
               <p>It's implied by way of Question, <hi>That Christ clothed himself in Flesh and Blood, and that he took Flesh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for so</hi> (quoth he) <hi>it may be said that our Soul is clothed with our Body, as with a Garment or Veil. It is not Words, but the meaning that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about,</hi> saith he, p. 180.</p>
               <p>We know best our own Meaning, being well satisfied that 'tis according to Holy Scripture. Where's then the defference? he then quarrels with our Meaning, not with the Words here, but elsewhere; he doth as his Author <hi>F.

But I have not <hi>called Christ himself a Type of our Light within,</hi> nor justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="503" facs="tcp:63041:265"/>As to my Accuser's Offence at my saying <hi>Christ's Flesh is called a Veil,</hi> Heb. 10.20. it was to remove an Offence taken against my Friend <hi>J. P.</hi> for using the same. And it would have become this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary to have forborn his blasphemous Scoffing at my Light; as, <hi>George, if thy Light has hitherto forgot to tell thee,</hi> I bless the Lord my God, who is my Light, Life and Salvation; he has shewn me the new and living way of the New Covenant, which our blessed Lord and Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated, prepared or set open thro' the Veil, that is to say, his Flesh; yea, through his Sufferings and Death, as being the Testator, he hath enforced that New Testament or Second Covenant; he took away the First, that he might establish the Second; and so hath open'd the Passage into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, into the Holiest of Holies within the Veil, and beyond all the Shadows and Veils under the Law.</p>
               <p>It was in the most Holy Place within the Second Veil in the Tabernacle, which was called the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest of all</hi> in the Old Covenant, that <hi>the golden Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor and Ark of the Testament were put, and the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Pot which had Manna, and</hi> Aaron<hi>'s Rod that had budded, and the Tables of the Testament, and over the Ark the Cherubims of Glory shadowing the Mercy-Seat,</hi> Heb. 9. Exod. 26. So the most excellent things were within the Veil, tho' there was a Beauty and Glory also without it.</p>
               <p>All which, I doubt not were Shadows of the New Covenant, and the Spiritual Dispensation thereof in Christ Jesus, in whom the <hi>Most Holy Place</hi> of that Divine Service and Worship (in the New Covenant-Sanctuary which the Lord has placed in the midst of his People) is <hi>in the Spirit and in the Truth.</hi> And all our Spiritual Blessings and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Treasures are in Christ Jesus, who is our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary and Hiding-place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="504" facs="tcp:63041:266"/>And it is in the inmost, or most inward and Spiritual Dispensation of <hi>the New Covenant,</hi> that Mercy and Forgiveness is receiv'd, and Christ most livingly and effectually known to us and enjoy'd; and in him the most holy and heavenly Places, wherein the true Spiritual Believers sit down with him; and as being washed from their Sins in his Blood by his Spirit, are his Church and Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary also, and thereby have boldness to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy Place, even by <hi>that new and living Way</hi> (which Christ hath prepared for us through the Veil, that is to say, his Flesh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.) that we may follow him therein into <hi>Heaven</hi> it self. And what entrance through Christ our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor we have here in Measure received into this new and living Way, and Holy and Heavenly Places in him, we doubt not but it is to us an Earnest of a more full Enjoyment of Heaven and Glory hereafter, with Christ Jesus our Fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Leader and Captain of our Salvation, we continuing faithful to the end in this his new and living Way, as true and constant Followers of him.</p>
               <p>God in his great Love and Wisdom has afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed several Dispensations, one higher and more glorious than another, in order to bring Man nearer and nearer to himself; as that of the Law, and of Shadows and Types; that of the Prophets; that of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi>; that of Christ in the Flesh, and that of Christ in the Spirit and New Covenant, which is higher, more powerful and more glorious than the former, and therein a more clear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ than in all the former, wherein there was some Sight of him through Shadows and Veils, but by his Divine Light shining in our Hearts God is pleased to give us the Light of the knowledge of his Glory in the Face of his dear


<pb n="505" facs="tcp:63041:266"/>
Son Christ Jesus, that we all with open Face, as in a Glass, may behold the Glory of God, and be changed into the same Image from Glory to Glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. and Ch. 4.6, 7.</p>
               <p>Now, tho' our Adversary has made a deal of Dispute and Quarrel with us about calling <hi>Christ's Flesh the Veil,</hi> as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. yet he is fain to grant, <hi>That Christ's Body is called a Veil in Relation to its Type, the Veil of the Temple,</hi> p. 182. but he'll have this <hi>not to be in the Quakers Sense. They call it a Veil; that is</hi> (saith he) <hi>a Garment, in contra-distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to its being Christ's Substance, and of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Whereas it's rather in contra-distinction to its Being, his Divine Nature, or to its Being in the first place, or <hi>principally</hi> or <hi>chiefly</hi> Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (who is the Son of God) for whom the Body was prepared, because he did pre-exist it, or was in Being before he took upon him that Body, even in his Father's Glory before the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, wherewith he is Glorified. However, <hi>the Veil,</hi> which was <hi>Christ's Flesh,</hi> (through which he set open the new and living Way) we never deny to be Christ's Body, or to be a real Body, but own it was; and never believed it be a Fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body, as I have often said; but that Christ the Son of God took upon him real Flesh and Blood of our Nature, yet pure and incorrupted in him. And as his Flesh was called <hi>the Veil,</hi> it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers its Type or Figure, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Veil of the most Holy Place, or Oracle where God gave Answers, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.20. and 8.6, 8. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.10, 16. And these <hi>Most Holy Places</hi> in the Tabernacle and Temple, being Places of Divine Service, then pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the High-Priest to enter into, their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype is in Christ Jesus, the New Covenant, where in Spirit and in the Truth, God is truely worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,


<pb n="506" facs="tcp:63041:267"/>
and meets with (and speaks to) his People, even by Christ Jesus their High-Priest, who is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the midst of his Church and Assemblies of his People, the true and Spiritual Worshippers, who meet in his Name, Spirit and Power, whose Light and Truth brings its Followers unto his Holy Tabernacles, <hi>Psal.</hi> 43.3.</p>
               <p>And as to Christ's Substance and Nature, what does our Opposer mean thereby? how has he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished in this Point? Christ has in him a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Man,</hi> which he hath also in the purest Sense. But which is the greatest? Is not the Divine Nature, the <hi>Deity</hi> in him, greater than the Manhood? As he said, <hi>My Father is greater than all, greater than I,</hi> John 10.29. Nevertheless, as our great and <hi>only Mediator and Intercessor,</hi> it was necessary he should be Man, as he is the most glorious, heavenly Man; and as the Christ of God he is Spiritually <hi>in</hi> Us, <hi>in</hi> the Saints and Members, in some measure, by his Spirit, Light, Life and Power, even as the <hi>incorruptible, immortal Seed</hi> in Man is of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; and therein all true spiritual Believers do in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure partake of the Divine Nature, being born again of this incorruptible Seed.</p>

               <p>THE very Entrance into the said Supplement consisting of divers Falshoods, I need take the less notice thereof, and spend the less time in its strict Examination, besides the Reproaches, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, Contempt and Scorn, cast upon my self, by the Author, are of less value or weight as to me, seeing the Rancour, Envy, and Foulness of the Spirit from whence they proceed. And I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought my self more obliged in Truth's Vindication, than my own Personal Reputation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having long been arm'd with so much of Christian Faith, Patience, and Good-will to my Enemies, as Patiently to endure Persecutions by Reproach, and cruel Mocking, as well as I have endured by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonments, and other Hardships.</p>
               <p>And now I do not believe the Author of the <hi>Snake</hi> says true, That <hi>he is very well pleas'd with the said Answer.</hi> I am persuaded the contrary, That he is very much vex'd, by having his Falshoods in many things so much detected, as they are in the Answer or <hi>Antidote.</hi> His following Reason for his being <hi>so very well pleas'd with the said Answer,</hi> is as notoriously false, as the rest of his Lies, <hi>viz.

evince the Falshood whereof, I refer the Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader to the said <hi>Antidote,</hi> for his Impartial Perusal. I doubt not but this Man's Purpose and Intent, in producing the Matters of Fact alledged against us, was chiefly, that they should be given Credit to, and that the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> (their Ministers especially) might lie under all his gross and foul Imputations and Defamations, of being <hi>Diabolically Inspired and Possess'd, Deluded, Bewitched, Blasphemers, Rebels, Traytors,</hi> &amp;c. How monstrous and improbable then is it, that I by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing these Matters of Fact charg'd, should write to confirm them against our selves?

Either he has read my said Answer, or he has not; If he has read it, he must be a shameful Man herein: if he has not, he must be guilty of great Folly and Injustice. And farther to Detect his notorious and foul Falshood in this, I'll produce a few Instances of his many more false Quotations, detected in my Answer, <hi>Antidote,</hi> p. 15.16. <hi>That one of the Orders given forth by their Yearly Meeting,</hi> 1693. Commands, <hi>that</hi> None <hi>shall carry Guns in their Ships.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Serious Reader,</hi> these few Instances of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries false Quotation (besides many more which are clearly Detected in my said <hi>Antidote,</hi> in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to him) I hope are sufficient to evince his Falshood, in Asserting, That <hi>Geo.

And if his Quotations, is <hi>in Effect the whole Cause</hi> (as he saith) then his Cause is fallacious, rotten and nought; 'tis of no value or credit. If his Quotations in divers principal Matters and Charges against us, be found false, partial and unjust (as they are) what's become of his whole Cause? whose Cause is it to belie, slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, defame, and foully misrepresent others, but the Devils Cause; which in the <hi>Snake</hi> in the Grass is strennously prosecuted against us?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="512" facs="tcp:63041:270"/>And so insulting and slighting he is of <hi>G. W</hi>'s Answer, casting his Contempt and Scorn upon both him and it, that a Body would think, 'twere below his Highness, Learning and Parts, to take so much notice of them, as he seems to intend. He tells us <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s <hi>Answer consists of bitter Railing and Threatning, of very poor and guilty Excuses for some things that are objected against them; and a total Silence or Forgetfulness of the most Material Points wherein they were accus'd of calling this a severe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution against them, of Pleading not Guilty to the Charge, without disproving any part of the Evidence,</hi> p. 361, 362.</p>
               <p>To Detect the Falshoods herein contain'd, I must refer the Impartial Reader to my said <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote,</hi> however invalid and impertinent he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders my Answer therein.

But if my Answer require such deep and exact Consideration, 'tis an Indication that it is of some weight and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, and that it does not consist of such Railing Threats or Evasions, as 'tis render'd, he must have leisure farther to study the Points in Controversie, and not to shift them off with false, partial, and curtail'd Quotations; nor with his using <hi>Railery,</hi> as he has confessed. If he makes Replication, he should write more cautiously, than to accumulate Lies against us, which he appears very prone to.</p>

kind of unnatural Inferrences against the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> I had reason to give my Negation against, as neither Just nor Reasonable, but altogether the contrary. And the Truth of it is, I looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his said 18th Sect. so extreamly Malicious, and so Repugnant to the Act of Indempnity; even that of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and divers others since (if any charged were culpable.)

               <p>And if no authority of <hi>Bugg</hi>'s be quoted at all, for the charges before mentioned, (as he saith) it is for divers others, which are very false.</p>

               <p>And as to my Answer to <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Christ's Lambs defended,</hi> &amp;c. However slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Adversary, as <hi>Impertinent Shuffling,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>And what tho' <hi>John Pennyman does not mention his large Quotations out of</hi> G. B's <hi>Works,</hi> Ibid.

               <p>It is very Remarkable how confident the <hi>Snake</hi> is in notorious Falshoods, as in what follows, p. 355. <hi>viz.

the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Hissing at, or against them on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, unless he can prove that God had no hand in that Judgment, and those Revolutions, and over-Turnings.</p>
               <p>That the then Clergy abetted <hi>Oliver,</hi> and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applauded him and his Son <hi>Richard,</hi> as their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi> &amp;c. He denies not, but saith, <hi>As for the then Clergy (as he calls them) let the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>and them reckon about their Equal Treasons and Rebellion. The Clergy of the Church of</hi> England <hi>are not herein concerned, they then suffered for their King and with him,</hi> p. 356.</p>
               <p>Observe here, 1st. In the first place the <hi>Quakers</hi> still without Exception are charg'd with <hi>Treasons and Rebellion,</hi> and the then Clergy charg'd Equally with them therein, so that those of his Brethren do not escape his foul hands, no more than the <hi>Quakers,</hi> tho' the latter cannot be justly charged with those high applauses which the other gave to <hi>O. C.</hi> and his Son.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> In the next place, he will not now own them for the Clergy of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> who were the Clergy in their time; but only those few that suffered <hi>for the King,</hi> and with <hi>Him:</hi> And what then does he think of the Clergy now? Who are the Clergy of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but those that have the Tythes, and get into the Pulpits, as did those in <hi>O. C</hi>'s time? But perhaps this Incendiary may have as much against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Clergy and Government, as against them; only he hides and dares not utter it as yet: What he and such Sowers of Discord may hereafter do (if they have opportunity) may be nearly gues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at by the course he now takes.</p>
               <p>He Quarrels with us now about Past-times and Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

help; if he were now more disposed to a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and charitable Mind, and Conversation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others; it would bespeak more of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, than to Quarrel and upbraid others about former Transactions and Revolutions, wherein Divine Providence over-ruled Mens Contrivances and Actions; considering, <hi>that the most high Rules in, and over the Kingdoms of Men,</hi> and he giveth them to <hi>whomsoever he pleaseth,</hi> Dan. 4.6. <hi>and none can stay his hand, or may say to him, What dost thou?</hi> None may charge him with <hi>Treason or Rebellion</hi>; neither do the Instruments (he makes use of) act merely of themselves, nor is it just to upbraid or condemn others unconcerned for their actions as this Incendiary does us.</p>
               <p>And 'tis observable what a Valliant Warrier this Author of the <hi>Snake</hi> appears, in his so severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cudgelling <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and Banging the Rump, and Paying off the Old Army, and Insulting over them, now so many Years after they are Dead and laid Aside; and not only so, but upbraiding the Living, and unconcerned with their concerns, when as he and his Brethren of the now Clergy, should rather be humbled, and humbly consider the Cause and Reason of those Revolutions, and of the Judgment of War, and Devouring Sword, why they came to pass, or were suffered, Had God no hand therein think they? Many Men of Judgment and Valour have other considerations thereof, than now to Boast and Insult over the Dead. I doubt not but some yet alive can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber upon what Principle, and for what end they acted, whom he bitterly commemorates and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs against, and how Religiously inclined in their way, I have had credible Information from some of that Old Army, and how they were often Preaching and Praying, when many of the other


<pb n="523" facs="tcp:63041:276"/>
were Drinking, Swearing, Cursing and Damning, and what Service did they thereby do for the King when they came to Engage? Were not such sometimes upon a Shout ready to run for it? Did God go forth with their Armies then? What was the cause of <hi>Israel</hi>'s Fleeing before their Enemies when they Fled? Was it not their having forsaken the Lord, that he went not forth with their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.9.</p>
               <p>But, saith the Man, <hi>The Clergy of the Church of</hi> England <hi>then suffer'd for their King, and with him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did they so; how many of them pray? Did not many of them turn Presbyterian, and from Episcopacy? And many of them since, from Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery to Episcopacy, to save their Benefices? Are such then steady Pillars, or Martyrs of Jesus Christ, under any Suffering? Or, did the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of some few, for and with the King, prove them such Martyrs? And if any <hi>Quakers</hi> have told <hi>the World they were always Loyal and True,</hi> I don't believe that they, as a People, are justly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with Lying or Dissimulation therein, but that they were sincere in their Minds and Intentions; and do bear no Ill-will, Hatred or Treachery, in their Hearts towards the King, or any Man else, but Love and Good-will.</p>
               <p>This Adversary thus Query's: <hi>But what means</hi> George <hi>by bringing me under the Lash of the Act of Indemnity? What Quaker, or Quakerly affected Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, drew up this Answer for him?</hi> p. 356.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I meant <hi>ad hominem,</hi> to shew this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Loyal Person, how disloyal he is, in viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Act of Indemnity,</hi> in case any among us were Indemnified thereby, from any former Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours: Let him retort as he pleaseth, I look on't as a very unwarrantable Act in him (without occasion given him by us) to violate that Act, and


<pb n="524" facs="tcp:63041:277"/>
the Reason and good Intention thereof, in his Strenuous Endeavours, to stir up Animosities against us, as a People, from those old Transactions and Offences (though not ours) which were Indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or Pardon'd long since.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And I had no Quaker, or Quakerly affected Counsel (as he scornfully calls it) in my Lashing him with the <hi>Act of Indemnity,</hi> but singly I argued, <hi>Secundum Hominem,</hi> to shew and check the Man's Presumptuous Folly and Envy against us, as a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when we had given no real occasion of Offence or Provocation.</p>
               <p>And as to his retorting, <hi>viz. But if past Faults must not now be so much as remembred, was it not as great an Incroachment upon the Act of Indemnity, for the Quakers to upbraid the other Dissenters, the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, Independents,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with their Treasons and Rebellions, fighting Principles, the</hi> Quakers <hi>being as Guilty in all these as themselves.</hi> &amp;c. p. 356, 357.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> still! he must needs shew his Spite and Venom against the <hi>Quakers</hi> still in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and without exception; suppose any one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, either upon some Provocation or Occasion of this kind given (as by some enviously charging the <hi>Quakers</hi> with <hi>Justifying the late War against the King</hi>) hath somewhat Retaliated upon them their <hi>Fighting Principles,</hi> &amp;c. This is not justly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> without Exception, neither do they own those Fighting Principles, nor do I allow of upbraiding others with those former Transactions of War, which are Legally Indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, unless it be upon occasion first given to stop their upbraiding others, when they themselves were more deeply guilty and concern'd; or upon occasion of their former Persecutions against us, and putting our Friends to Death in <hi>New-England,</hi> which Blood-sheding for Religion no Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity can justly Indemnifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="525" facs="tcp:63041:277"/>But <hi>First,</hi> As I deny that the <hi>Quakers</hi> do so up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid the other Dissenters with <hi>Treasons and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. So I deny that the <hi>Quakers</hi> themselves are guilty in all these (i. e. <hi>Seditions, Treasons, Fighting Principles,</hi> &amp;c.) as we are unjustly aspersed.</p>
               <p>Though his Beloved Confederate, Associate, <hi>G. K.</hi> in his <hi>Way cast up,</hi> p. 23, 52, 53, 54. In p. 23. He tells of <hi>Presbyterians so much using the arm of flesh and blood, to carry on that which they judged a Reformation. And how much Garments were rolled in Blood, by the Instigation of the Presbyterian Teachers, the whole Nation was a Witness; so that many thousands were made Widows and Fatherless, by that War they stirred up the People unto, expresly contrary to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Gospel.</hi> And in p. 52. he farther char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them thus, <hi>viz. And the Presbyterian, Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformist Teachers, have generally manifested base and unchristian Cowardize, in running away from their Flocks, through Fear of Suffering, and exposing them to those they judged Wolves, and some of them are fled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, others lurk in Corners here and there, and keep private Conventicles, where many times they Preach Sedition against their Lawful Prince, by Instigation of whom that Insurrection happened,</hi> 1666.</p>
               <p>And in p. 53. He further addeth, <hi>viz. And some of them have Printed Books in Defence of the Lawfulness of making War against the Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, in order to Re-establish the Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a way flat contrary to the nature of the Gospel, to the express Commands of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in p. 54. <hi>G. K.</hi> goes on with a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and very high Charge, <hi>viz. And in very Truth</hi> (quoth he) <hi>the Presbyterian Church will never be able to purge her self of the Iniquity of the Killing of many Thousands in the Three Nations, by the Occasion of a most bloody War, raised up through the Instigation of


<pb n="526" facs="tcp:63041:278"/>
the Presbyterian Teachers. I am fully persuaded of it, that the Presbyterian Church hath as much blood-guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness lying on her Head, unwashed off, as any People called a Church, that I know of, in the World, next unto the Bloody Church of</hi> Rome!</p>
               <p>Thus far <hi>G. Keith,</hi> against the Presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Church.</p>
               <p>However, seeing the <hi>Snake-Author</hi> does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but such kind of remembring former Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities and Offences, as are Indemnified by the Acts of Indemnity, must needs be to offend and incroach upon the said Acts: How then does he save him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from Self-condemnation, in the case for his own Presumptuous and Insolent Incroachment and Violation thereupon? Is not the <hi>Snake</hi> herein as deep in the Mire, as he thinks others are in the Mudd? but enough of this (as he says)</p>
               <p>As to that great Charge of the <hi>Snake</hi> against us, <hi>That the height of our Self-advancement, is to be equal even to God, to be one Person, Substance, and Soul with God,</hi> &amp;c. p. 357.</p>
               <p>To this he renders my Answer also defected, as <hi>not denying one of the Quotations</hi>; when he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no Quotations out of the Quakers Writings, that either say, <hi>they so advance themselves to be one Person with God, or one Substance with God, or that they themselves are one Soul with God.</hi> I asked him when did ever the <hi>Quakers</hi> so advance <hi>themselves</hi> to be <hi>One Person, Substance, Soul</hi> with God? We positively deny the Charge, [and the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, (but only as we are United or Joyned to the Lord) we are one Spirit.] This Parenthesis of my Answer, the <hi>Snake</hi> now leaves out, to make my Answer deficient, and his Charge seem good against us. But I further Challenge him to prove where we, the People, or Persons called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have so advanced <hi>our selves</hi> in these words, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,


<pb n="527" facs="tcp:63041:278"/>
that we <hi>our selves</hi> are <hi>One Person and Substance with God,</hi> (and by consequence <hi>Essentially Equal</hi> even to God.) I still in good Conscience deny the Assertion; and such <hi>self-advancement</hi> of the Creature unto such <hi>Equality</hi> with its Creator, whatever any among us has said of the Divine Spirit or Breath of Life, (which made Man a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul) as for the Equality thereof with God, and as of his <hi>Being.</hi> I deny that this was ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of the <hi>Creature Man,</hi> that he was either one <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Substance</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Essentially</hi> Equal with <hi>God</hi>; for that were to confound Created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the Increated: Tho' Man, as made a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul, and created in the Image of God, had in him something of that <hi>Divine Nature and Being,</hi> which gave Him, his Life and Being.</p>
               <p>I really think I have sufficiently and briefly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered this matter in my <hi>Antidote</hi> in divers places; being a reitterated charge of <hi>Blasphemy</hi> (falsly) against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they so advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as aforesaid, to be <hi>One Person and Substance</hi> with God. A body would think the Man should have proved these very words of the Charge upon us, or else not so often repeat it, with aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as he has shamefully done in such Expressions as these, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>he does not think that any humane Government can be secure of Men, in whose Power it is to scrue themselves up to such blasphemous heights of Enthusiasm,</hi> (which he deems the <hi>height of Madness</hi>) which I took notice of, and justly reprehended in my <hi>Antidote,</hi> p. 87, 88.</p>
               <p>And I dare further add, in order to clear our Principle of <hi>Sinless Perfection,</hi> as attainable through the Grace of God in Jesus Christ: That although we own an Essential Equality between our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, His Son and Holy Spirit, and not such an Equality between the creature Man and his


<pb n="528" facs="tcp:63041:279"/>
Creator; yet such a nearness and likeness between the Heavenly Father and his Dear Children, as perfection of Holiness and Purity, if they attain to the fulfilling of these Doctrines, <hi>Be ye Perfect,</hi> (or as some have it) <hi>ye shall therefore be Perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is Perfect,</hi> Matt. 5.48. <hi>And be ye merciful as your Heavenly Father is merciful,</hi> Luke 6.36. And every one that hath this Hope in him, purifieth himself even as he is pure, 1 John 3.3. And if any among us hath writ of them who are perfect in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, being led by his Spirit, as in that sense <hi>Equal</hi>; I understand <hi>Equal</hi> only as <hi>like</hi> unto God, or in <hi>Vnion</hi> with him, being united unto him by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit. Our own Principle and Distinction in these matters justly considered, I do not think that either my self, or any Friend, whose sense I explain, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves <hi>Bedlam,</hi> as the <hi>Snake</hi> would infer upon me, p. 358.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It's a positive falshood, <hi>that</hi> G. Fox, <hi>and the rest of us,</hi> do positively assert all these things char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on him and us before in the <hi>Snake</hi> (or assent to his pretended Proofs thereof) p. Ibid. Where does he or we positively assert of our selves, that we are <hi>One Person or Substance with God?</hi> I find not these words asserted, but the contrary.</p>
               <p>Neither is his Reprinting all his pretended Proofs in his Second Edition of the <hi>Snake,</hi> any full Reply to my Answer; wherein I detect his fallaciously Imposing such Words and Terms upon us, as are none of ours, nor agreeable to our Principles, as in the before-mentioned, and many others.</p>
               <p>And as positive a Falshood it is, <hi>That</hi> G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head <hi>has omitted all the Proofs in the</hi> Snake, <hi>that is almost of the whole Book.</hi> The Judicious or Serious Reader that shall peruse my said Antidote in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer


<pb n="529" facs="tcp:63041:279"/>
to the First Edition of the <hi>Snake,</hi> may clearly see the Contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But because</hi> (quoth he) <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>shall not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of being thus put off, I do intend to make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reply, and to follow</hi> G. Whitehead <hi>through every single Point that he touches for this End especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this being the last cast of the</hi> Quakers, <hi>and all the defence they have to make, I may so plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect it, as to leave them without Excuse, and by the blessing to convince all of them except those who are resolved not to be persuaded, though they were persuaded, but hope to disarm them,</hi> &amp;c. p. 358, 359.</p>
               <p>Upon all which 'tis observed, <hi>First,</hi> On the first part of these pretences, and boastings: How comes <hi>G. W</hi>'s Answer either to need or deserve such a particular Reply, or to be followed through every single Point that he touches. If his Answer (or said Antidote) <hi>be no Answer but the name of an Answer,</hi> and <hi>nothing to the purpose but shuffling,</hi> &amp;c. as he hath already given judgment, p. 355. tho' before conviction; it seems 'tis so much to purpose, that it will make him some work, if he still think it worthy to prosecute his intention upon, and that through every single Point too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He's Egregiously mistaken to conclude 'tis <hi>either the last cast of the</hi> Quakers, or <hi>all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence they have to make</hi>; neither may I take upon me the sole defence of the <hi>Quakers</hi> (so called) nor do I so abound in my own sense, as if no other were capable of making any further, or other defence: For God having diversities of Gifts, hath raised up many in defence of his Gospel and Truth, according to their several Gifts among us, blessed be his Name; and I hope he will raise up more faithful Witnesses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What detection or conviction this boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Person can make or work upon us by his falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble


<pb n="530" facs="tcp:63041:280"/>
and lying Spirit may be easily supposed! How shall we believe that he can work or effect such great matters upon us by his scoffing at us about the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as the <hi>Quaker Light</hi> and <hi>Quaker Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And by what Power or Force thinks he to <hi>disarm</hi> us of our Armour of Light, or our Spiritual Weapons? No, no, Neither he, nor the Devil his Master, the Prince of Darkness shall ever be able to disarm any one that believes in, and sincerely obeys the Light of Christ amongst us, who are true Children of the Light. These his empty Boastings, and fruitless Attempts will eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate and vanish like Smoak: <hi>Let God arise, and his enemies be scattered. Let them also that hate him, flee before him, as Smoak is driven away,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 68.2, 3. and 37.20.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. To his Alledging, <hi>G.

               <p>This is as frivolous and impertinent, as many other his Reflections are false; for he may see, that upon that Subject I have bestowed five leaves in the <hi>Antidote,</hi> p. 116, to 126. wherein his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are detected, and the Invalidity thereof; and the great Stress he lays upon the Type discovered, and the thing opened according to Scripture; but his sign of <hi>Sprinkling Infants,</hi> by him evaded, and left without defence.</p>

               <p>His pretending <hi>To speak in behalf of</hi> G.

               </p>
               <p>But now I think on't, I may suppose the Merits of this Author of the <hi>Snake,</hi> to the consideration of his Church, for whom he Advocates against Dissenters; as to what Gratuities or Compensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he has deserved for pleading his Church's cause, <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 42, 43.

               <p>
                  <pb n="536" facs="tcp:63041:283"/>Hence observe, his sorrowful complaint against those many Sects, and the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who, he saith, begat them, as what Injury they have done to the Church (as he calls her) <hi>That these, like Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers Spawn, have eaten into the Bowels of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (i. e. the Church) <hi>opposing their lawful Bishops, and tearing the Body of the Church by Schism,</hi> (as he hath) p. 41, 42.</p>
               <p>This is a sad complaint indeed, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison looks as black upon that Mother of his; by representing her a Mother of such a Brood of Vipers, as have eaten into her Bowels, torn her Body and destroyed her: Alas! Poor Mother, How art thou beholding to this thy Son and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, for representing thee as such a Mother of Vipers? What art thou then? Canst thou be Christ's Spouse, or the Bride, the Lamb's Wife? Or can the Mother of Vipers (as he renders thee) be any other than a Viper her self? How well art thou (Oh! Mother) helped up by this thy pretended Dutiful Son and Officious Agent? Will it redound to thy Good Fame, to allow such Agents for thy Advocates who thus Defame thee, or such to espouse thy Cause, or to Hiss and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel against all Dissenters on thy behalf? It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns thee and thy Reputation well to consider it, and either to discountenance this Advocate, or else his work may turn to thy greater Infamy and Disgrace.

               <p>As for that Christian Advice of <hi>W. P</hi>'s, in his <hi>Address to Protestants,</hi> p. 242. which this Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends to me; I have observed the matter


<pb n="537" facs="tcp:63041:283"/>
contained in it, before and without his Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of it, I wish he would better observe it himself, for it does not affect me, as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of being <hi>Angry for God, Passionate for Christ,</hi> or <hi>Calling Names for Religion,</hi> &amp;c. For one that is indeed a Malicious Incendiary, a Persecutor, a False Accuser, a Lyar, a Rayler, a Reviler, may be justly reprehended as such, and yet not in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Passion or Railery; such wicked Persons, who wrongfully Abuse, Defame and Disguise their quiet Neighbours or others, may be justly dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and lawfully reprehended, and duly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and that for Christ, and his tender Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion sake, and their own poor Soul's Good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dishonour to him, or the Christian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
               <p>And what names have I called Men for Religion, in telling a Malicious Person of his Malice, or a Persecutor that he is such a one? I don't look on them to be really Religious, who are short of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Civility, who will not live quietly by their Neighbours, nor suffer their Neighbours to live quietly by them; but will be Aspersing and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting of them, by Reviling, Reproaches and bitter Calumnies, as this <hi>Snake</hi> has shamefully done.</p>
               <p>And to his reminding <hi>W. P.</hi> and my self, of 1 Cor. 6.10. <hi>That Revilers shall not Inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> 1.26.</p>

               <p>He has with great Aggravations, passed severe Sentence and Condemnation upon us already, tho' very unduly and unjustly, as no People either Sincere or Sound in the Faith, but contrariwise, as <hi>Blasphemers, Hereticks, Diabolically Inspired and Possessed,</hi> &amp;c. yet now urges a <hi>Test</hi> to try whether we are Sincere or Sound in the Faith; thus he first condemns, then proceeds to Trial, and not only thus preposterously deals with us, but afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand concludes they (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Quakers) <hi>will not Answer so much as to one of these two short and easie</hi> Quaeries <hi>proposed,</hi> p. 365.</p>
               <p>So by this prejudicate Procedure, it seems we must remain under his severe Condemnation as Mutes.</p>

Greater Extravagance is not in</hi> Bedlam! <hi>And Men may be mad,</hi> secundum quid. p. 367.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="542" facs="tcp:63041:286"/>But <hi>Reader,</hi> his pretence of Praying in Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for me, as a <hi>mad Man,</hi> does not hang well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Reproaching and Vilifying of me, as he has often done, nor yet with his Intention to <hi>follow me</hi> (by Reply) <hi>through every single Point that I touch,</hi> &amp;c. as he pretends, p. 358. What! by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply follow such a <hi>Mad-man</hi> as he renders me: what Reputation will he gain by that upon his own Proposition, trow he?</p>
               <p>I hope his black Charge of <hi>Idolatry, and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Divine Attributes and Worship to themselves,</hi> (i. e. the <hi>Quakers</hi>) p. 379. As it is utterly rejected by us, 'twill be farther detected, and the Malice thereof. I supposing 'tis already Answer'd by another, I do at present forbear Publishing a Full and Particular Answer, I have to his Eighth Sect. about that Point, as I have <hi>so many others at large</hi>; besides, he being a Lurking Adversary, that lies hid, smiting in the dark, I am not willing to spend over-much time about him, he being also fallen into another hand to deal with, who I doubt not has traced the <hi>Snake</hi> in his crooked Windings and Turnings.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. In this last Article of his <hi>Specimen,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites these Words, as he saith, out of a <hi>Quaker</hi>'s <hi>Book,</hi> Intituled, <hi>The Sword of the Lord drawn,</hi> p. 5. <hi>viz. Your Imagined God beyond the Stars, your Carnal Christ, is utterly denied— That Christ is God and Man, in one Person, is a Lie.</hi> To which he saith, <hi>G. Whitehead does not deny the Quotation, but says,</hi> p. 145. <hi>We do not affect the Terms,</hi> Then he adds; <hi>Was not this a Terrible Rebuke; a full Condemnation of the Author, and such damnable Heresie,</hi> p. 357.</p>
               <p>See how grosly Abusive and Partial this <hi>Snake Author</hi> is; as if <hi>we do not affect the Terms,</hi> were my whole <hi>Answer</hi> to those fore-going Expressions quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted


<pb n="543" facs="tcp:63041:286"/>
by him, wherein he appears (as in many other things) very unjust and injurious; for I call them <hi>offensive Words,</hi> in my <hi>Answer (i. e.</hi> as quoted by him) saying,
<q>
                     <hi>As to those Offensive Words, your Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Christ, your Imagined God,</hi> &amp;c. we do not affect the Terms, neither are they proper to the True Christ, or Omnipresent God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antidote,</hi> p. 145, 146. (but his Falacy in the Quotation, I refer to the fore-going Treatise, p. 204.) I further add, That an <hi>Imagined God, and Imagined Christ,</hi> is not the true God, nor the true Christ, which all meer Imaginations fall short of; and of the true Knowledge thereof: However, I neither liked the said Offensive Words, nor the Person that wrote them (<hi>i. e. C. A.</hi>) for he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writ all he did in true Reverence toward God, neither did he abide in His Fear or Council, but was disown'd by us: Therefore the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation against me, <hi>That he was a Friend in saying of them, and had a good Intention</hi> (as if I would so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him, and his said offensive Words) is utterly false, for I never design'd to excuse or plead for him therein, or in any other rash or irreverent Expressions.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Snak</hi>'s Inferences against the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, <hi>As that all the World cannot excuse them from being the most Outragious and Blasphemous Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie! And that all Men must look upon the</hi> Quakers, <hi>as Monsters, and no Christians; and their Ancient Friends with Blasphemies, Heresies, Treasons, and damnable Doctrines,</hi> &amp;c. p. 368.</p>
               <p>Thus concluding with a Storm of Railery, when he has taken occasion to Calumniate and Condemn us all by Whole-sale, from a few rash and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Expressions of one Person, and perhaps from some other Words or Passages, which many <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands</hi> of us were never concerned in, besides his


<pb n="544" facs="tcp:63041:287"/>
many foul Perversions, and partial and false Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Citations. And lastly, he makes this Apology; <hi>He must not surfeit the Reader with a Breakfast, lest he lose his Stomach to his Dinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But should the Reader be so unwary, as to make his Breakfast of such Cookery as the <hi>Snake</hi>'s Raile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Foul Abuses, and dirty Stuff, as he has Cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against the People call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> 'twould be enough not only to Surfeit, but to Poison the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Now that I would not seem to conclude with harsh (but mild) Expressions, as well as Matter of Moment, I may a little farther take notice of his Profound Questionary <hi>Test,</hi> to try if we are <hi>sound in the Faith,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether they</hi> (i. e. the <hi>Quakers) believe in Christ, as without them, without all other Men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing our Adversary, and his Confederates, so much Insist upon the words <hi>without us, Christ</hi> as <hi>without us</hi> (and sometimes gives him the Character of an <hi>Outward Christ,</hi> as if he were not an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Christ,</hi> Inwardly Anointed) I may take leave a little to follow them in their terms; yet with a real Respect and Honour to the True <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Very <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Anointed,</hi> of God, of whom all his Holy Prophets gave Witness, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.4. namely, we believe and confess, that this very Christ of God, the Only Begotten Son of God, was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary without us,</hi> that he was Born in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Judea without us,</hi> that he liv'd an Innocent Sinless Life, preached most Blessed and Excellent Doctrine <hi>without us,</hi> that he wrought most Eminent and Wonderful Miracles <hi>without us,</hi> that he went about doing Good <hi>without us,</hi> that he was Crucified and put to Death, by wicked hands (without the Gates of


<pb n="545" facs="tcp:63041:287"/>
                  <hi>Jerusalem) without us,</hi> that by the Power of God, he revived and rose again the third day, <hi>without us,</hi> that after he was raised from the Dead, he shewed himself <hi>Alive</hi> after his Passion, by many Infallible Proofs, unto his Disciples, <hi>without us,</hi> being seen of them forty days, after which he Ascended into Heaven, being seen to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend <hi>without us,</hi> and a Cloud received him out of their sight who beheld him Ascend. Unto whom it was said, by the 2 Angels present, This same Jesus which is taken up from you into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, shall so come in like manner, as ye have seen him go into Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3, 9, 10, 11. and doubtless when he so comes, and all his mighty Angels with him; it will be in great Glory and open Triumph; and he will in that day be greatly glorified in his Saints, and admired in all them that believe, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>But now I must not stop here, we must not leave this same Jesus Christ all <hi>without us,</hi> we must humbly consider, and own him, as He is <hi>within</hi> us also.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Christ</hi> is the Word of God, that true Light, which enlightens every Man coming into the <hi>World, John</hi> 1.9. He is <hi>within us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men, He is <hi>within us</hi>; his Life, as the Light of Men is <hi>within us, John</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>As Christ is the Light of the World, given to lead Men out of Darkness, and to give the Light of Life to all who follow him, <hi>John</hi> 8.12. He is <hi>within Men, within us,</hi> to lead us out of that Darkness and Corruption that was in us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="546" facs="tcp:63041:288"/>As Christ is given for the Light of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and for a Covenant unto the People, and to be God's Salvation to the Ends of the Earth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.6. &amp; 49.6. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.47. He must be known as such <hi>within them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing his coming was, that we might <hi>have</hi> Life, and that we might <hi>have</hi> it more abundantly, <hi>John</hi> 10.10.</p>
               <p>This Life we must have <hi>within us. Jesus said, If a Man love me, he will keep my Words, and my Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make our abode</hi> with him, <hi>John</hi> 14.23. <hi>which must be within us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abide in me, and I in you</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>as the Branch cannot bring forth Fruit of it self, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me,</hi> John 15.4.</p>
               <p>Therefore if we abide in Christ, he abides <hi>in us.</hi> The Branches must abide <hi>in</hi> the Vine, to partake of the Life and Virtue thereof <hi>in them,</hi> to cause Fruit.</p>
               <p>John 14.18. <hi>I will not leave you comfortless, I will come to you</hi> (said Christ.) Ver. 20. <hi>At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore we must know Christ <hi>within us,</hi> if we be his true Followers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> 17.22, 23. Where Christ saith, <hi>And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and</hi> hast loved them, as <hi>thou hast loved me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Ver. 26. <hi>And I have declared unto them thy Name, and will declare it, that the love wherewith


<pb n="547" facs="tcp:63041:288"/>
thou hast loved me, may be in them, and</hi> I <hi>in</hi> them,</p>
               <p>What's more clear, than Christ's own Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for his Being <hi>within us</hi> i. e. <hi>within</hi> all his true Followers especially.</p>
               <p>2. Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine your selves, whether ye be in the Faith; prove your own selves: Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, they who are not Reprobates, but in the Faith, know that Jesus Christ is <hi>within them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Colos. 1.27. <hi>To whom God would make known, what is the Riches of the Glory of this Mystery, which is Christ in you the hope of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the Saints know Christ <hi>within them</hi> to be the Hope of Glory to them.</p>
               <p>Gal. 4.6. <hi>And because ye are Sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Son of God is therefore, by his Spirit <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us,</hi> who are Sons of God.</p>
               <p>Galat. 4.19. <hi>My little Children, of whom I Travail in Birth again, until Christ be formed in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rom. 8.29. <hi>For whom he did fore-know, he also did predestinate, to be conformed to the Image of his Son, that he might be the first-born in many brethren,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Rev. 3.20. <hi>Behold I stand at the door and knock, if any Man hear my Voice, and open the door, I will come In to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</hi>
