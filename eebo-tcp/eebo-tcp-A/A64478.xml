            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I enter upon the particular Heads
of the Enquiry, I shall premise some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in General; lay down certain
Theses and Positions, which, being
rightly understood, will much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you in your Proceeding, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
the Work which lyes upon
your hands; <hi>First,</hi> I shall shew you the Basis and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of Government, and the absolute indispensable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
with the Sacredness of it: <hi>Next,</hi> I shall shew
you our Happiness in this Nation, that we have not only
Government, but Monarchy, the best of Governments.
To begin with the first thing propounded; Now <hi>Gent.</hi>
That you may understand the Primitive Institution of
Government, I shall clear it up to you thus; Man, you
know, is a Congregative, a Sociable Creature <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
as it is well express'd
by the learnedst of the <hi>Jews, Moses Ben Maimon</hi> in his
<hi>Moreh Nebochim; Man</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath a Natural Propension,
and Inclination to joyn himself unto Company;</hi> And herein he
differs from other Creatures which stand not in need of
such Society; And therefore when God made Man, lest
he should be alone, he provided a Companion that was
meet and fit for him, namely one of his own kind, a
Woman; and this is a strong argument of the necessity
of this bond of Society, even by a kind of natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct.
Therefore 'tis, the Philosopher calls man <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>socium esse, associari.</hi> Now this Appetite of
Association in Man, did, very probably, instigate and
stir him up, not by any necessity of Cold, (as <hi>Vitruvius</hi>
fondly dream'd;) nor from the admiration of Eloquence,
(as <hi>Cicero</hi> imagined,) to excogitate and find out some
way for the Conservation of his Species, and that was
<hi>Order;</hi> which is <hi>Vinculum Vniversi,</hi> the bond of the
World, without which it would drop in pieces as a
Beesom un-bound: Now because Order could not consist
without Government, which is the strong fortress of all
Interests; therefore it came to pass that by the common
consent of all, Soveraignty and Supreme Power was
delegated, and devolved upon one or more that should
personate the whole Community; and they should have
power to make Lawes for the rewarding the good, and
punishing the bad, which might be a means to secure
them against all violence and oppression, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as <hi>Jamblichus</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Pythagorean</hi> Philosopher saith, for <hi>Men could not
live safe without a Governour;</hi> All which is pointed at,
though somewhat darkly, by <hi>Plato</hi> in his Dialogue of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
or Civil Government, where he makes a graphical
Description of the golden Age of the World under
<hi>Saturn</hi>'s Reign; who saith, That Men then being naked,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98821:4"/>
lived abroad in the open Air, and were nourished with
the fruits of the Earth which sprung up of their own
accord without any labour of Tillage in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;

the plenty of that time, which they made him
the Author of, as likewise the first Inventor of Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture

Then it was (to go on with the Relation) that Men had all
things in common, they were mutual Benefactors one to
another, and were free from all injury; they had as little
mind, as cause, to do any wrong; for there was no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
in the World at that time, but Men did (as <hi>Seneca</hi>
phrases it) <hi>aperto ostio vivere.</hi> Truth, Faith, Peace,
Concord, Amity, and Righteousness carried the whole
sway amongst men, and they were without Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Order, and without any Government, save only
Theocraty; for God himself, by a singular Providence,
did watch over them, and they were under his immediate
Gubernation: Now some Poets say, that when <hi>Jupiter</hi>
reigned, then began the Silver Age, being worse than
the former, Justice having then taken hir flight from
Earth to Heaven; Oppression, Fraud, Violence, Injustice,
Sedition, Impiety, Prophaneness, (and what-Vice-not?)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98821:5"/>
was practised <hi>cum licentiâ;</hi> and all things were counted
lawful, save what was lawful: and so by degrees the
World grew so bad, that it was called the Iron-age; a
Description whereof <hi>Horace</hi> gives us in the Sixth Ode of
his Seventh Book
<q>
                  <l>Aetas parentum, pejor avis, tulit</l>
                  <l>Nos nequiores, mox daturos</l>
                  <l>Progeniem vitiosiorem—</l>
               </q>
Then it was in this Age, that Government began to be
instituted, and Laws were made for the suppression of
Vice and Reformation of Manners: Now it is probable,
That this Theorem and notion of the golden Age, Poets
and Ancient Philosophers received, by Tradition from
the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> as some other opinions of their Religion:
Or else, they might gather it out of the Prophet <hi>Daniel.</hi>
There the first Empire of the World under the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
is represented under the form of a golden Image:
but however it is, we must not think it had its Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
from the great plenty of Gold, which was in that
time; No, <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Cratylus</hi> tells us, That was not the
reason, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith he, It was not so, in its
own Nature, but is to be taken Tropically or Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically;
for thereby was signified the happy and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Condition of Men in that Age. And <hi>Hierocles</hi> upon
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Verses, speaks to the same purpose in these
words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>We call it
the golden Age</hi> (saith he) <hi>because it was the best, and pure
Age of Men, taking the difference of Manners from the
property of Metals;</hi> so that, under this Mythology, it seems
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98821:5"/>
clear to me, that this Truth is covertly insinuated, that
the State of Man in the first Age of the World, was a
State of Innocency and Integrity: He was pure and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
not contaminated with the pollution and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Vices, but was in favour and well accepted with
God. The elegant and complete Volume of the Protoplast
<hi>Adam,</hi> in which was bound up the whole Species of Man,
was such an accurate correct Copy, and so exactly printed
by the Supreme Being, (that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as <hi>Plato</hi> calls God, <hi>The Father and Architect of
the World, and all things therein;</hi>) that there were no <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata</hi>
to be found, no blots at all: But though this Book
was put forth in so fair and legible a Character, and was
flourished with many Capital Letters, yet the Worm of
Sin did quickly get into it, and did so fret and corrode it,
that the whole Impression was utterly defaced and spoiled:
Man, I say, continued not long in his happy prosperous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
the Sun of his Glory was soon set, &amp; he was benighted
with a sad and disconsolate privation of his Native purity
and perfection; he did not abide in honour, he was but
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>the Son of a Night:</hi> nay, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
               <hi>he did not lodge one Night in Honour,</hi> (for so the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis
of the Hebrew Words imports) but he fell from
his primitive righteousness and holiness into the profound
Abysse of Sin and Misery, (I joyn both these together,
because, for the most part, they are Twins of the same
Womb, and, as it was with <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> the one catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the other by the Heel;) Then it was that all manner
of Villanies and Outrages were committed: Every man
became a Wolf and Beast of Prey to another, and the
Earth, as the Scripture-phrase is, was filled with Cruelty,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98821:6"/>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 11. or, as the <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphrase hath it, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> i. e.
<hi>rapinis</hi> with pillage and robbery, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is the word
in the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Version which signifies Oppression: And
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the <hi>Persian</hi> Translation, which is Violence;
all different words, though much to the same sense: yea,
it is said in another place, <hi>The wickedness of Man was great.</hi>
And it seems he was so habituated in an evil Course, and
in all manner of Debauchery, that he was grown obdurate
and hardned, and so the <hi>Arabick</hi> Translation glosses it,
when, instead of the <hi>Imagination of the thoughts of his
heart,</hi> it hath this word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> i. e. <hi>pervicacia eorum,</hi>
their Stiff-neckedness and obdurateness in Sin. And now
you will say it was high time some Course should be taken
for the reducing the World to some better Order, which
could not probably be effected any other way more than
by Government; so that the Summe of all, in one Word,
is; That the Corruption of manners was the generation
of Government. So, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I have given you the
best Accompt I can, (considering the un-beaten Path I
tread in) of the Golden Age and the first Institution of
Government: And now I shall proceed to the Second thing
I propounded to speak of, which I shall endevour to open
to you, with as much perspicuity and plainness as I can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Polit.</hi> saith, <hi>That the true reason of Civil
Society or a Common-wealth, consisteth principally in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of those that live well and virtuously;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is necessary that there should be some Governour
and Ruler to adaequate and square Mens Actions for them,
according to rule, which Rule is the Law: <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the aforesaid
<hi>Jamblichus</hi> saith, <hi>Which Commands those things that are
sit to be done, and</hi> contrarily <hi>forbids those things which
ought by no means to be done;</hi> The <hi>Heathens</hi> had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
that <hi>Phoroneus,</hi> whom they feigned to be the first
Law-giver, was likewise the first-man <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Nonnus</hi> calls him; as if all that lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him had not been Men for want of Government and
Laws. Government, why, 'tis the great <hi>Atlas,</hi> which
supports the vast Fabrick of the World; you may as well
imagine the Sun can be without a Principle of Light, as
the World without Government and Order, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> hath it: <hi>Order is the
Mother and Security of the Being of all things that have
a Beeing;</hi> were it not for this, the whole Foundations of
the Earth would be out of Course, and the world would
be resolved into its first principles of a miserable <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp;
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as the Scripture-Phrase is: It's Government which
Organizes, as I may say, and animates the body of the
World; draws it out of its rude and indigested <hi>Chaos;</hi>
and quickens it into Action and Usefulness. It's the Sun
of the Political World, without which the World would
be as a dark Dungeon; This is that which refines Men
and makes them sit for Converse, who otherwise would
be like irregular Stones in a Building, which are full of
roughness and corners, and so take up more room than
they fill, and, till they be polish'd and made eeven, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
too cannot lye neer them; Government is that, which,
<hi>Orpheus</hi>-like tunes men into a Common-wealth-frame as,
he is fabled to do, when by the sweet Melody of his
Harp he drew after him Wilde Beasts, Woods, and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98821:7"/>
that is, Men that were wilde and savage by Nature
became tame and were charmed into obedience: What
a <hi>Jewish</hi> Author saith of the Divine Law, in that Ancient
Book called <hi>Zohar,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> believe was writ long
before our Saviour's Coming, is true too concerning Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Law; namely, <hi>Lex assumpto Corpore venit in mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi>
that <hi>the Law assumed a Body when it came into the
World;</hi> that is, it was assimilated and made like unto us,
it is accommodated and fitted to our necessities and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections;
Government is that which sounds a retreat
to the Sons of Rebellion, who otherwise by their despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
wickedness would every moment <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Confront God Almighty.</hi> Your ranting <hi>Beliallists,</hi> they are
absolute <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and wish that all Law and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were banish'd out of the World, that they might
sin more freely; this is that which puts a restraint upon
them, in their wicked Courses, and causes them to walk
more regularly: Laws you know have generally in them a
double power, Directive and Coercive; the first sets down
the duty, the second appoints the penalty for non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the duty. Now 'tis the latter only which lewd
and licentious men are affected with; the fear of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is that which scares them into some handsome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Conformity, when-as they have no principle of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
from within inclining them to it; The penalty I
say, of the Law is that which hales them like a Bear unto
the Stake, out of the broad way of destruction, wherein
they were posting apace, into the narrow Street mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> called <hi>Strait,</hi> I mean
Goodness and Virtue; Government, 'tis the Pruning hook
to lop off all the luxuriant excrescencies of Vice, and to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98821:7"/>
pare away the superfluity of naughtiness: The Sons of
<hi>Anak</hi> Men of Giant-like Lusts, the mighty <hi>Nimrods,</hi> that
are grown so audacious and incorrigible in their wicked
practices, that like a <hi>Titan</hi>-brood they even threaten Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it self with an over-daring impudence, and would,
if it were in their power, dethrone God Almighty; were
it not for these Manacles of Government and Law where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
these unruly persons are tyed, they would run up
and down, and make havock of all good men: yea,
these prodigies of Impiety, (Devils incarnate I may call
them) would so rage, and so fearfully terrifie and haunt
good men, that, were they not bound down by the strong
Cords of the Law, there would be no place of safety for
men in the world, no rest for the soles of their Feet, no
more than there was for that winged <hi>Mercury, Noah</hi>'s
Dove I mean, the Emblem of Innocency, which was sent
out by him to make a discovery of the drowned World,
in the time of the Flood: I say, were it not for this Curb
of Government; Murders, Adulteries, Incests, Rapes,
Robberies, Perjuries, Witchcrafts, and Blasphemies;
would ride in Triumph up and down in every Town of
the Country, and thorough-out the Kingdome, so as it
might be said of them as of <hi>Gad, Behold a Troop cometh:</hi>
yea, all kind of Villanies, Outrages, and savage Cruelty,
would overflow the Nation; and the face of the Earth
would be covered with blood as it was once with water:
Were it not for Government, I say, we should all be a
Company of <hi>Ismaels,</hi> Wild-men; our hands would be
against every man, and every mans hand against us; all
the several Counties of the Kingdome would be but as so
many Dens of Wild Beasts; Cruelty would insolently
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98821:8"/>
strut it up and down in every place, with her Writ of
Privilege in her hand: No mans Life, Goods, or Wife,
could be secured; What, I pray you, do you think
would become of Propriety, the Guardian and Tutelar-Angel
of Commerce and Traffick, were it not for this
Enclosure? Would not all things lye wast and common?
Would not every Mans Lands and Goods become the
possession of the strongest? So that our Patrimony, and
all that we enjoy in the World, if we sold it but for a
Mess of Pottage, the price of <hi>Esau's</hi> Birth-right, we
should hardly think we made an ill bargain; And, as St.
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith well, <hi>Talle Jura Imperatorum, &amp; quis au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det
dicere, Mea est illa villa; aut, Meus est iste servus; aut,
Domus haec mea est;</hi> Take away Government, and none
dare say, These Lands are mine, this Servant is mine, or
I have right to this house; And as for Women, what think
you of them? If they be such as resolve to preserve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably
the choise Jewel of their Chastity, who would
rather choose to dye than live an Example of dishonour
to the rest of their Sex; What rage and fury would beastly
libidinous men exercise towards such, who, like Lightning
would rend most, where they find most resistance, and
would vent their angry passions upon them in as high a
manner as Cruelty could invent; and at last bereave them
of their Lives whom they could not bereave of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
The men of <hi>Gibeah</hi> will abuse the <hi>Levite's</hi> Wife,
yea, and professedly too, abuse her to Death. And
what do you think of Life it self, if there were no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?
Would it not be a Burthen to us, for to live?
and, to be born, a Misfortune? Life certainly would be but
an empty flat Parenthesis of time, a very Wilderness;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98821:8"/>
we should be in continual fear of being assassmated, Men
would be afraid to abide in their own houses for fear that
ravenous savage Beasts, should come and become Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throats
and Cannibals to them; much less durst they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
abroad; or if they did, What pannick fears would
seize upon them; every step they took, how would they
tremble and quake, as if they trod upon Ice, or as if
they were doomed to the old Tryal of <hi>Ordeel.</hi> Our Lives
would but, as the Scripture phrase is, hang before us just
as <hi>Dumaris</hi> his pointed Sword, which hung over his head,
while he was at his Banquet, only by a single hair, so
that there would be no comfort at all in ones Life. And
indeed, I know not how there should: for, as the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Proverb is, <hi>Que Quien teme la muerte, no goza la vida,</hi> He
that fears Death, doth not enjoy his Life: And, in fine,
to say no more, Were there no Government, there would
necessarily ensue a general Confusion of all things: we
should be as the Fishes of the Sea, the greater destroying
the smaller. And, as it is said by that <hi>Rabbi</hi> in <hi>Pirke Avoth,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Vnless there were
Magistracy, one would devour another alive.</hi> But I shall not
need to dilate further upon this Subject; The rise and
ground of Government, and likewise the necessity of it,
you do, I suppose, fully understand. Blessed be God, we
here in this Nation have Government, and that the best
too, which is the next thing, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that I would
make appear to you, as that which may be of use to you,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by way of preparing you, to the main and
principal business I aim at: Now, that Monarchy which is
the Establish'd Government among us, is the most Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Government; God, Nature, Art, and Experience,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98821:9"/>
will sufficiently demonstrate. <hi>First,</hi> I say, God. He is
the sole Monarch of all the World, he is the <hi>King of Kings,
and Lord of Lords,</hi> as the Scripture styles him. He ruleth
in the Kingdom of Men, and giveth it to whomsoever
he will. Monarchy was the Government which God made
choice of to set up, among his people: First in <hi>Moses,</hi>
then in the <hi>Judges,</hi> then in the <hi>Kings.</hi> In the several Changes
of the Names of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Government, God still avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Polyarchy. When Captains, but one <hi>Moses</hi> in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals,
one <hi>Aaron</hi> in Spirituals: when <hi>Judges,</hi> but one
<hi>Othniel:</hi> when Priests, but one <hi>Eli:</hi> when Prophets, but one
<hi>Samuel:</hi> and, when for their own ease they joyned others
in Commission with them, they presently degenerated and
became corrupt; for the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> complained that
they turned aside after Lucre, took Bribes, and perverted
Judgment. Divine <hi>Plato</hi> saith, God doth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
Which he meant in this sense; because, The Geometrical
proportion was more agreeable &amp; suitable to Regal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
because this makes no Confusion of all-together, but
giveth unto every one according to his desert and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness;
whereas the other, <hi>viz.</hi> Arithmetical proportion,
giveth equally unto all, according to number: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> chased out of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical
proportion, as a popular thing, turbulent and apt
to make Commotions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nature shews it: The Image of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to be seen in Sensitive and Inanimate Creatures:
there are in them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
calls them, some faint <hi>adumbrations and resemblances
of this Polity;</hi> as for Example, There is but one Sun, in
the Firmament. Among Birds, the <hi>Eagle</hi> hath the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98821:9"/>
and therefore, because of his Dominion and
Soveraign'ty over other Birds, you will find in Scripture,
Kings are compared with it; particularly the King of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> is shadowed out under the similitude of a Great
Eagle: Among Beasts, the <hi>Lyon</hi> is Lord Paramount; if
you dive into the Sea, there you will see a King of Fishes;
In the Common-wealth of the Bees, there is one that is the
King: In the Microcosm of Man, you may observe the
same thing; Several Members do their homage and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to one Body, the several Senses of the body are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by one Mind; and one Reason moderates all the
various and manifold Affections of the mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Art, which imitates Nature, doth affect this
political frame: In a Family, you know, there is but one
Master; in an Army, but one General; in a Ship, but one
Governour: And so, One King amongst the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Last of all,</hi> Experience doth irrefutably evince the
truth of this Assertion; Consult all Authors that are most
skilful in Politicks, and they will all tell you that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
doth excel all other Governments; To begin with
<hi>Homer,</hi> doth not he say <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Hear
what <hi>Aristotle</hi> speaks, that <hi>Lynceus</hi> of all political Science,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Monarchy,</hi> saith he, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
as <hi>the most Divine Government;</hi> and, to name no
more, although I could heap up infinite testimonies in
this kind; take, in the last place, that lofty <hi>Athenian</hi> Poet
<hi>Euripides,</hi> doth not he sing to the same Tune? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Two Governours</hi> (saith
he) <hi>cannot stand together in one Kingdome,</hi> for it would
be an occasion of Sedition and Commotion: But why do
I spend time in giving you proofs in this kind? when
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98821:10"/>
Holy Writ it self, doth so pregnantly conclude the same
thing? You read <hi>Judg. 21 In those dayes there was no King
in</hi> Israel, and what follows? <hi>Every one aid what was right
in his own eyes.</hi> Observe the words, for they are very Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical;
It is not said, There was no Government in those
dayes, but they wanted Monarchy the most excellent
Government, and this was the cause of all disorder both
in Church and State; for the words, without any streining,
will bear that Construction, <hi>viz. Every one did what was
right in his own eyes,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> So the <hi>Arabick</hi> Translation
renders it, that is, <hi>Quod libebat, Every man did what he list;</hi>
Mary, (may some say) there was a brave time indeed; that
was a great privilege, For a man to be <hi>sui Juris,</hi> to act
without control; Alas! that which you call priviledg is
a great and sad Judgment, as you may see by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this place with the 78 <hi>Psalm,</hi> where it is said,
<hi>God gave them their own desires,</hi> speaking of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Israel;</hi> and what followed? In the 31 Verse,
you shall find, that <hi>The Wrath of God came upon them
and slew them;</hi> Such a Liberty as this, for a Man to have
his full Swinge in a Licentious Course, is worse than bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage;
for, the greatest freedom in the World is to be able
to do nothing but what we should do: Again, the Tryal that
hath been made of other Governments both abroad and
at home, will abundantly commend the excellency of
this above any other: for, <hi>Contraria juxta se posita magis

                  </gap>unt,</hi> is a Rule in <hi>Logick, Contraries do best appear,
when most directly opposed.</hi> Travel into the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
and you will find it verified there: The <hi>Romans</hi> when they
shook off their Government by Kings, History testifies,
they had so many Changes, that in the space of 600 years,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98821:10"/>
they tryed all forms and kinds of Government in the
world: Of Two, by their Consuls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Three, by their Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate;
of ten thousand, by their Tribunes: But when
they found that the further off they departed from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
they lost themselves, and were involved still in
greater mischiefs and dissentions, at last they set up One
<hi>pro unâ vice unoque anno.</hi> These were their Dictators, and
in time they grew to be Perpetual: which Perpetuity
begat Monarchy. But what need we travel so far, when
we here in this Nation, have had such sad and woful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the truth thereof, in our late miserable confused
Anarchy? when that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Plato</hi> calls the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
Multitude, The many headed <hi>Hydra,</hi> did reign, shall
I say, or rather rage? when, like the great <hi>Leviathan</hi> it
played his pranks among us. Truly did, that Glorious
Martyr of ever-blessed memory, K. <hi>Charles</hi> the first, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy
concerning this Government, in that incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Treatise of his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>As it makes a shew,</hi> saith
he, <hi>to the People to have more eyes to sorcsee, so they will find
it hath more mouths too, which must be satisfied;</hi> and, at best,
is rather a monstrosity than any thing of perfection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
that of right Monarchy; where Counsell may be in
many as the Senses, but the supreme power can be but in
one as the Head. But I shall not need to labour in such a
plain thing, which carries its Evidence with it: You
have heard, We have Monarchy the most excellent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
Now, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> give me leave to tell you,
as a further degree of our happiness, That the best kind of
Monarchy obtaineth in this Kingdome: Bear with me a
little, if I be too long in these things, I shall be very short
in the other part of the Charge touching your Enquiries;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98821:11"/>
But I would fain speak something to this Point, because it
may be of no little use to you and others, to establish
them in an obediential frame of Spirit. For as it is in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
matters, so it holds in Political too; that one which
is not well grounded in the Fundamentals of polity and
government, will quickly fall away, and become a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
to his King; as he that is not well rooted and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the first Principles and grounds of Religion, will
prove an Apostate, and fall away from the Truth which
he prefessed: We have, I say, absolute Monarchy, and
herein we differ from the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi>-Kings, who were
subject to their <hi>Ephori,</hi> which had a power above them:
No, Oursagrees with the <hi>Persian</hi>-Government; for, their
King had plenary power in all things, not subject to be
called to account by any person whatsoever: and so is ours,
if you will believe <hi>Cambden,</hi> a famous Antiquary; who
saith, That the King of <hi>England, supremam potestatem,
&amp; merum imperium habet, He hath supreme power and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Command in his Dominions;</hi> and So <hi>Bracton,</hi> a sage
profound Lawyer, in ancient time, speaks to the same
purpose, <hi>Omnis quidem sub Bege, &amp; ipse sub nullo, sed tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
sub Deo:</hi> So that it is an unquestionable truth, that
the King is subject to no over-ruling power of man, and
that he is free from all humane Coercion and Restraint,
I do the rather insist upon this; because of those sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
jesuitical Principles, that were infused into the minds
of the Credulous vulgar, in the times of Confusion, by
some Ambitious Democratical, Antimonarchical men;
namely, That, <hi>Constituens est prius Constituto, Rex singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
major, universis minor;</hi> that <hi>The King is greater than
any particular single man, but less than the whole Body of men
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98821:11"/>
in a Nation.</hi> What an absurd Tenet this is, will easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
if it be duly examined; I would fain know of these
men, whether the King is not bound as much to protect
all his Subjects universally, as to protect any one singly;
and are not all then bound no less universally than singly
to honour the Kings Sacred Person, obey his Commands,
and assist and defend him in all dangers? And another
new devised State Quirk they had, to wit, That the
King cannot be without the People, but the People may
be without a King; and so conclude hence, The People
are more excellent than the King. If there be any force in
this way of arguing, by the same reason it will follow,
that a Flock of Sheep are more Excellent than a Man,
because the Shepherd is found out for the Sheep, and
not the Sheep for the Shepherd; for if there were no
Flocks of Sheep, there would be no need of a Shepherd.
What a strange Inconsequence there is in this kind of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
you may easily discern. This makes as much to
the purpose, as that Parson's argument, who would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to prove the Parish must pave the Church and
not he, because it was written in the Prophet, <hi>Paveant
illi, Ego non paveo;</hi> or, that no man ought to have the
Sign of the <hi>King's-Head, Queens-Head, &amp;c.</hi> hanging at
his Dore, because the Scripture saith, <hi>There shall be no
sign given but the Sign of the Prophet</hi> Jonas: We had need
be careful, we be not infected with such <hi>Sectarian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
these are dangerous Sophisms that lead the way
to Rebellion, and tend to the Alteration and Subversion
of Government; therefore as an Antidote and Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
against such poysonous Positions as these, I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
you to take the wholsome Advice, which <hi>Solomon</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98821:12"/>
gives: <hi>Fear God, and Honour the King, and meddle not
with them that are given to change:</hi> or as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath
it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, <hi>with Rebels and Seditious persons,</hi>
for the word in that language signifies both the former and
latter.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Gent.</hi> that I may come up closer to the business in
hand, you have heard how necessary Government is: and
the Excellency of Monarchy above any other kind, hath
been fully demonstrated to you. Now you must know,
as to the Exercise of this Government, that it is in the
body Politick, as in the Natural body, every Member
hath its proper Office and place assigned it; and all the
Members do conspire together for the safety of the whole
Body. You <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> are called here this day to bear a
share in the Executing the Laws of this Government, in
your Capacities; Now as Government cannot consist
without Laws, so neither is Law of any validity or force
without Execution, which is the life thereof: And here
I desire to press this point of Execution, because I perceive
there is a great defect in that particular: And I would not
only speak to you <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> but to my self, and to you
(<hi>pace quod fiat vestra</hi>) my noble and worthy Co-adjuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
to whom the sacred Oracles of Justice are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
that we may be all stirred up, and quickned to
the performing of the Duties of our several places; It
is commonly said in reference to the Preaching of the
Gospel, that Application is the Life of Doctrine. It is so
in respect of the Law too; for all those great Privileges,
and rich Commodities, which the Law is pregnant with,
will all prove abortive without this. The Law, I say,
hath no strength of it self to bring forth, unless the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98821:12"/>
Magistrate obstetricates, and puts-to his helping hand by a
diligent and serious Application. The Law without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
is like a Cloud without Rain, which promises
Rain but gives none; The Law, 'tis a deep Well of all
things necessary for the support of our well Beeings, but
the Magistrates are the Buckets, wherewith the people
draw out the Waters of all their comfortable Enjoyments:
As a Magistrate without Law, is a Workman without
his Tools; so the Law without a Magistrate is but a dumb
Idol. He it is that is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>A Living Law. Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>As good no
Law at all as not Executed:</hi> The whole body of the Law,
without the Soul and Vital heat of Execution to animate
and enliven it, is but as a Dead Carcass, and exposed to
Contempt, therefore we must do by the Law, as we read
<hi>Elisha</hi> did with the Child of the <hi>Shunamitish</hi> Woman;
Holy Writ saith, that <hi>he lay upon the child, and put his
mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and
his hands, upon his hands, and he stretched himself upon
the child, and the flesh of the Child waxed warm;</hi> So
we must do by the Law, <hi>incumbere legi,</hi> stretch our selves,
&amp; lay out our utmost improved abilities upon it, pour into
it the <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> of Impartial Justice, which may Cause
it to speak and revive, then move it up and down by a
Spirit of activity, and by our nimble diligence, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
are styled <hi>Cods</hi> in Scripture, but if they do not
use industry and assiduity in the Execution of the Law,
these <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> will be but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> meer Idol-Gods, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
Nothing. The Law of it self is like <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi>
lame, and cannot go, unless it leans upon the Staff of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98821:13"/>
Magistrates Authority. Or, it is like the Pool of <hi>Bethesda</hi>
which we read of in the Gospel, where every diseased per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that is infected with any ulcerous sore, or Contagion
of Vice, may be washed from his filthiness and healed;
but first the Angel must stir the water, I mean the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
that is the Tutelar Angel of the Law, he must
be active and stirring in putting of it in Execution, or
else it will be of no efficacy. Although we stand up to the
Chin in the waters of Privileges contained in the Law,
have never so great a Confluence of them; yet we shall
but Tantalize, and never be able to taste of the fruit
thereof, unless the Magistrate plucks it for us, and hands
it out to us. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> by what I have said, you may
perceive the necessity of the Laws Execution; and oh
that you would be perswaded to Contribute towards its
necessity! Oh that we would all in our several Spheres
resolve to lay out our diligent endevours, for the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Carrying on of this laudable and excellent work. You
may be sure it will quit Cost, for we shall have plentiful
Comings in; it is that which you and we are called to this
day, let us jointly bend our forces this way. It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the Serpent <hi>Amphisbena</hi> that it hath an head at ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end, neither of which can move without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the other; and if they strive, they tear the body
in pieces. How true this is, I know not; but I am sure,
it is so with us, who are the Ministers of Justice in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Law; That can never be practicated and
drawn out into use, unless we, that are Commissionated
for the Keeping the Peace, and you Jury-men, and other
subordinate Officers of the Court, in our several Orbs,
do concurr and conspire for the promoting the ends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98821:13"/>
If there should be any Contention among us, so as
one should draw this way, another that way, there
would be an Obstruction of the Streams of Justice, so as
they would never run freely to our refreshment: and
then that great Voluminous body of the Law, had as
good be torn in pieces, for any benefit we shall have by
it: It will be with us in this Case, as it was with those two
Pitchers floating upon the water, which the States of the
<hi>Vnited-Provinces,</hi> upon some difference between them
and our Nation, gave for their Impress with this Motto,
<hi>Si collidimur, frangimur, If we once fall a dashing, we shall
all fall in pieces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> You ought to lead the way in this business,
you being the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> in it; you are our Eyes and
Ears, and the Countries Mouth, we know nothing but
what you present; and the Country, whose Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
you are, relye upon you for the discovery of their
Grievances. If things amiss be not reformed, you may
thank your selves for it; if you would have your Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Cured, discover them: You, I say, must lead the
way, and not stand off to see who will begin first (as the
fashion of some is); that is a piece of ill-placed good
manners: Even as the <hi>Rats</hi> in the <hi>Fable,</hi> they all agreed
it was fit the <hi>Cat</hi> should have a <hi>Bell</hi> about her Neck, that
they might have warning of their Enemies Coming; but

was to <hi>Cry out:</hi> So your Office is to Enquire, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Offences; and if you conceal them, your Silence in
this kind is a Crying-Sin. You are so many political Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions,
and your duty is to launce the publick Sores of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98821:14"/>
the Country, and to search the depth of those wounds that
the Corrupt manners of Licentious men, have made in
the Body Politick, by the Probe of your Inquisition, and
to lay them open; and therefore, me-thinks, Your Name is
sitly adapted to your Employment, You being called
<hi>The Grand Inquest:</hi> But, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I shall now deal more
particularly with you, and give you some Directions that
you may Steer your Course aright, in the Business you
are Embarqued in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the first place,</hi> You must be Careful to present No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what you know; for a Rumor or Hear-say, is
not a ground sufficient for your Presentment. As God
said in the Destroying of <hi>Sodom,</hi> so should ye say, <hi>I will
go down and see.</hi> And <hi>again,</hi> You ought to Present all
you know; you must avoid Partiality, and not be like
the <hi>Badger</hi> that naturally halts on the one side, unless the
Ground be rising to its advantage; neither Fear should
drive you, nor Love draw you, so as to swerve from
Truth and Right. You must deal Impartially with all
Offenders; Spare not any, though never so much your
Friends, and make never such large Proffers to Bribe your
Judgment; Admit no Parley with them, but, as the
<hi>Poets</hi> fable <hi>Vlysses</hi> to have <hi>stopp'd his Ears at the Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Voyces of the Syrens;</hi> So be ye, as the <hi>Deaf Adder</hi>
to such Charmers. Be not Consenting and Complying
with any Offender, lest you bring Guilt upon your selves.
It was the Speech of an Advocate to a Judge in <hi>Germany,</hi>
who was very much aggravating the fault of a Murderer
that had killed Six men: <hi>No, my Lord,</hi> (saith he) <hi>he
hath killed but one; you are Guilty of the Blood of the other
Five, because you let him escape upon the first Murder,</hi> Spare
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98821:14"/>
no Malefactor (I say); for Clemency in that kind will
Commence <hi>per saltum,</hi> and take its Degree at last in
Cruelty to the Innocent Person, according to that <hi>Italian</hi>
Proverb, <hi>Perdonando troppo à chi falla, si fa ingiuria a chi
non falla: By pardoning too much the Offender, there is an
Injury offered them who offend not at all.</hi> Let not the Bows
of your Compassion yearn towards any obstinate Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
for there is no more pity to be taken of such a one,
than to see a Goose go bare-foot. In this Case you must,
<gap reason="foreign">

               <q>—non parcit ut parcat, crudelis est ut misereatur.</q>
As St. <hi>Hierome</hi> saith. But, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I look upon you
as Knowing and Conscientious Men, and such as are well
acquainted with the serious Nature of your Employment,
and so shall not need to Enlarge further upon this Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Subject: Therefore, I shall now come briefly to the
particular matters of your Enquiry, which I shall rank
under two Heads: Namely, <hi>offences against the Church,</hi>
and <hi>Offences against the State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> therefore, To begin with <hi>Offences against the
Church;</hi> those that Concern Religion, because the Civil
Society is subordinate to the Religious; the Religious
Society, or the Church, being far more Excellent and
Worthy than any Civil Society: for therefore it is, That
Men live together in Order, and be Governed by Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98821:15"/>
and Laws, to the end they may the better perform
Acts of Religion, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
as <hi>Suidas</hi> saith, <hi>The first thing that is provided for by
Law amongst all Men, is the Worship of God.</hi> And, <hi>Gent.</hi> You
cannot be ignorant that Order is an Essential Ingredient in
God's Worship; for, the Welfare and Happiness of the
Church, as well as the State, Consists in Order. The
Church is made up of many persons, and without Order
they could not meet together, but they would justle one
another, and there would <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rise many Contentions. One
would say, I am of <hi>Paul;</hi> another, I am of <hi>Apollo;</hi> a
third, I am of <hi>Cephas,</hi> that is, of <hi>Peter;</hi> for it is <hi>Nomen
Hebraeo-Syrum,</hi> and signifies so: Nay, it may be, some
may be as fondly ridieulous in their Concertations, as
those in <hi>Luther's</hi> time; when one said, I am of <hi>Martin;</hi>
another, I am of <hi>Luther;</hi> whereas they did but divide
<hi>Martin Luther,</hi> for they were both of his Religion. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
The Eucrasy and good Constitution of the Church,
consists in a due Symmetry and Agreement of all the parts
in reference to the whole. But <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> now that I
am speaking of Order, lest there should be an Ataxy and
Confusion in my Discourse, you are to know, there are
two principal Pillars which bear up the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Discipline; Doctrine, that, is as essential to
the Well-Beeing of the Church, as the Foundation is to
a Building. Discipline, that is the Cement of it, for it
Cements the lively Stones of the Church, to wit, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
for they are meant by that Allegorical Phrase in
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and joyns them close together. Order and
Discipline are as the Ligaments in the Natural Body, they
knit every Member fast to the Mystical Body of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98821:15"/>
Church, by one Uniform way of Worshipping God;
therefore you have Uniformity Emphatically represented
under the Notion of Bands in <hi>Zechary,</hi> because it tyes
Christians fast together in Love; thereby we come to
serve God <hi>with one consent,</hi> as it is phrased in <hi>Zephany</hi> 3.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is the Expression in <hi>Hebrew;</hi> that is, with one
Shoulder, <hi>viz,</hi> jointly; 'Tis a Metaphor taken from
Oxen, that draw equally in the same Waggon. And
therefore the <hi>Syriack</hi> Version, is very significant, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
are the words, <hi>i. e. pari jugo:</hi> This is a Blessed thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and becoming the People of God, when they
with one Mind and one Mouth Glorifie God. <hi>Munster</hi> in
his Exposition upon that place in <hi>Levit. 19. Thou shalt not
let thy Cattle gender with a divers kind;</hi> quotes a certain
<hi>Jew,</hi> who saith, that <hi>God by this precept shews that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes

                  </gap> any heteregeneous Mixture amongst People in his
Worship: But he would have <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> a perfect Vnity
and Concord in Professors of the same Religion.</hi> For God,
as he would not have the several Species of things to be
Mingled and Confounded; so, neither would he have
Men of the same Church, to be Schismatically divided.
<hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> are like the Two Pillars which
you read of in the first of <hi>Kings, Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boos,</hi> called
so from their strength, for both Names signifie the
same thing. These, I say, are the Chief Suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Church: But there are some Persons, That,
were they as Powerful as Malignant, would (<hi>Sampson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>)
pull down these Pillars, although they ruined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by it. The Idolatrous <hi>papist,</hi> he, labours to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
the Foundation, The Doctrine of the Church.
The Schismatical Separatist, he pulls with all his might
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98821:16"/>
and main, at that of Order and Discipline: They are
both dangerous Enemies to the Churche's Peace: <hi>These
Foxes (as Luther speaks) are tyed together by the Tails,
though by their Heads they seem to be contrary.</hi> But, as for
the former of these, The <hi>Papist:</hi> Some, may haply
say, <hi>He is no such great Enemy, he is not irreconcileable; for
we have heard, That, there is no such great distance between
Vs and</hi> Rome, <hi>but that we may meet together, shake hands,
and become friends.</hi> For my part, I am not of that Faith:
and it is not unknown to me, That, many Divines of
great Fame for Learning, are of another opinion; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
whom, hear what a Reverend Father of our
Church, Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> saith, in his Treatise,
Entituled, <hi>No Peace with</hi> Rome: <hi>The Church</hi> (saith he)
<hi>is at once one, in respect of the Common Principles of Faith;
and yet in respect of Consequences, and that rabble of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which they have raked together, so opposed, that,</hi> nullo
Concordiae glutine aut Unitatis vinculo copulari possint,
<hi>It cannot by any glue of Concord (as Cyprian saith) nor bond
of Vnity be Conjoyned.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Worship</hi> upon the same
subject expresseth himself thus; <hi>There is</hi> (saith he) <hi>such
an Antipathy between a Protestant and a Papist, as is between
the two Birds, the Siskin and the Muskin; which will sight
eagerly alive, and, being dend, if you mixe their Blood,
it will run apart, and dissociate. They are like the two Poles
of Heaven</hi> (saith another) <hi>which stand for ever directly
and diametrically apposite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the second sort, The <hi>schismatical separatist,</hi>
under which Sect may be comprehended <hi>Fifth-Monarchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mon,
Anabaptists, Brownists, Familists, Quakers,</hi> or
any others of the same stamp, by what Names or Titles
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98821:16"/>
soever they are notified and distinguished: These do
all strongly oppose the Discipline of the Church; but now
light soever these Men make of it, this is no smal Offence,
to rend themselves from the rest of the Body by their
Separation. <hi>Aquinas affirms,</hi> Schism to be the greatest
of all Sins against our Neighbour, and that, not only in
respect of the many Circumstances which attend it, but
like wise in respect of its own Nature, because it is the
most contrary to Charity, and the Love of our Neighbor,
for it is, <hi>Contra Spirituale bonum multitudinis, Against
the Spiritual good of a Multitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, besides, this is an undoubted Truth, That, we
can never gratifie the Divel so much by any thing as by
our Dissentions; There is no Musick sounds so melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
in his Ears, as that which is made up of Discord:
he will tripudiate for Joy, and Dance at such Musick:
And this also you may be confident of, <hi>viz.</hi> That subtle
Old Serpent, the mischievous Agent of Darkness,
doth no less easily than slily insinuate and winde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
into such persons, whose ignorant minds are obnubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
and darkned with Erronious Principles. Now,
Separation is a fruitful Mother and Nurse of all Errours,
and the Source and Sluce of all Heresies, and it hath this
Evil evermore accompanying it, That the Ring-Leaders
thereof, have a strong and vehement Appetite of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
their Factious Tenets, and endevour after nothing
more, than to have their Names and Opinions, serve to
the same end as <hi>Zisco,</hi> when he dyed, appointed for his
Skin: who being Leader of the <hi>Taborites,</hi> a Faction in
<hi>Bohemia,</hi> commanded, That a <hi>Drum should be made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
(as Dubravius</hi> saith) <hi>that something of</hi> Zisco <hi>might
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98821:17"/>
still be heard to sound in the Ears of his Followers, and their
Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> That you may the better know
these <hi>Sectarian</hi> Persons when you meet them, give me
leave a little to describe them to you. They are the
very <hi>Antipodes</hi> of <hi>Authority,</hi> a giddy wild Generation of
Men, that are impetuously carried out, and ravished, as
it were, with every Novel-Opinion, and <hi>Narcissus-like,</hi>
they fall in Love with their own Speculative Shadows,
and court frigid Sceptical Controversies, instead of the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>The Radical Fundamental Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
The old way of Serving God is loathsom to them,
and they are only taken with new things in Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like unto <hi>Materiae prima,</hi> which always desires and
seeks after New Forms.</p>
            <p>They will Espouse nothing about the Worship
of God that is Established by Authority, but would
be left to their own wanton and lascivious Liberty,
that they might embrace their own wild fantastick Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Enthusiastick delusions; They are Swelling
Bladders, of restless Minds, and as Unstable as Water;
<hi>tanquam Figura Sphaerica in Corpore plano,</hi> like a Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Figure in a plain Body; Their several ridiculous and
fond Conceits, they interpret, to be the Various Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
and Clear Manifestations of Truth, which spring
from the light within them (as some of them call it); al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though,
indeed, it is nothing else but an <hi>Ignis Ja<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uus,</hi>
which <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who aspired to be an <hi>Independent</hi>-Light,
hath set up in their blind and ignorant minds, on purpose
to lead them into the Cimmerian Darkness of a Myriad of
pernicious Errors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:98821:17"/>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> by this Character I have given, you may
come to know them; and knowing them, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but look upon them, as great Disturbers of the
Church's Peace; For, this is an Undeniable Truth,
That, if once the Hedge of Ecclesiastical Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
be broken down in the Church, The <hi>Abaddon</hi>
or <hi>Apollyon</hi> will quickly lay it waste; as appears by <hi>Psalm
80. v. 12. 13. why hast thou broken down her Hedges?</hi> And
mark what follows, <hi>The Bore out of the Wood doth waste it,
and the Wild Beast of the Field doth devour it.</hi> But, let
such Hedge-breakers as these, know, that they shall not
pass with impunity. For as it is writ in <hi>Eccles. 10. v. 8.
Who so breaketh an Hedge, a Serpent shall bite him;</hi> that is,
as some Expositors say, <hi>A sudden and unexpected punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall over-take them:</hi> which they gather from that
Phrase of the <hi>Biting of the Serpent;</hi> for, a Serpent doth
usually lurk in the hollow place of some Hedge, and when
it is broken down, then they rush forth upon a Man una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
and fastning their venemous Teeth upon him, do
give him his deadly wound. R. <hi>Solomon</hi> interprets the
Biting of the Serpent to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, <hi>Death
coming upon a Man immediately by the hand of God.</hi> What
an Havock these Fanatical Hedg-breakers made, in the
times of the Nefarious Usurping Regicide, you cannot
but be sensible of. The Solemnity of God's Worship in
a decent orderly manner they stigmatized with Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and they affected no other Service of God, but
such as was <hi>tumultuarie Compositus;</hi> these men, though of
ordinary Vocations, yet, were of extraordinary Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
for they would have the Brother-hood and Sister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
believe, That they had an Especial Call of God to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98821:18"/>
reform Abuses and Corruptions, (as they termed it)
which were crept into the Worship of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
out of a great deal of Zeal, abolished the Service
of God, for the Upholding of Religion. Places that
were set apart for God's Worship were so distastful to
them, that to shew their Dislike shall I say, or rather their
Abhorrency of them, by a strange Antistrophe, they
turned them into Stables, as they did by the stateliest
Structure for a Church that this Land afforded, namely,
St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> which they made a Receptacle for their Horses;
taking more delight, it seems, to behold the silthy Ordure
of Beasts, than the Comely Order of God's Worship in
the Beauty of Holiness, as it is phrased in <hi>Psalm 29. v.</hi> 2.
or as the <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Translation renders it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
i. e. <hi>in Aula Sanct a ejus:</hi> So, That by this Beauty of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
is meant the place where God was worshipped,
where God's Honour is said to dwell, yet upon this place,
did they cast such foul Contempt as I have told you, to
the great Reproach of Religion. It was such a piece of
prophane Beastliness, and beastly Profaness, that I want
terms to express it: But I am not ignorant that these men
that are so opposite to the Discipline of our Church, and
turn their backs upon the publick Ordinances do pretend
tenderness of Conscience, that they cannot joyn with us,
because there is such a Corrupt mixture of humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Worship of God.</p>
            <p>As for that Common Plea of Conscience, (although
I should be loth to Censure all Persons that use it) neither
on the other hand am I so great a Latitudinarian in Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that I can extend it so far, as to believe that all those
who do separate themselves from Publick Worship, are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98821:18"/>
led to it out of such Principles. Some there are that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Scruples, and yet have not one Dram of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
They that would delude and catch the credulous
Vulgar, who only look to the superficial Appearances of
things, whereas <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they need no other
Bait than the Name of Conscience; It is a Word of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment,
a kind of Legerdemain to couzen simple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with: but Intelligent persons are not caught so; they
are like the Chiromancer, they will see the Hand to judg
the Heart, and seem to say with him in <hi>Plautus,</hi> with a
little difference, only Changing <hi>Manus</hi> into <hi>Aures: Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latae
nostrae sunt Aures, credunt quod vident.</hi> What ever
fair Shews some Men make of Conscience, as if by their
feigned Strictness and Purity of Life, they meant to be
matriculated in Piety, yet if they be narrowly searched
into, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
saith, <hi>They would be found to have a Wolve's heart, under a
Sheep's Skin;</hi> Their Eyes for the most part are directed
to the North-Star of their own proper Interest, and
their Course is shap'd by the Compass of their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
ends; Like unto the Labourer who lifts up his Arms
to Heaven, but strikes his Mattock into the Ground.
Conscience oft times is the great Palladium of Sedition
and Rebellion, and all wicked treasonable practises have
been Gilded over with that specious plausible pretence.
You remember, I doubt not, how it was with those hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Miscreants, those <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Men of Bloods,</hi> (as the
<hi>Idiom</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>-Tongue is): who, when they had
devested an Innocent and most Glorious King of His Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Robes of Majesty and Power, and covered him with
the Raggs of Contumely and Disgrace, at last, they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98821:19"/>
brought him to the Block; But alas! why name I that
Accursed thing, which speaks nothing but Blood and
Wounds, and brings forth nought but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Death?</hi> But name it I must, The Block, I say,
where he was; He was: oh!—No marvel, <hi>Gent.</hi>
I hesitate thus, for not my Tongue, no, nor if my Heart
were turn'd to Tongues could it sufficiently express the
Horrour of that dismal Spectacle:<note n="*" place="margin">It being a very dark day, and the sua not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all day.</note> The Sun, drew
Clouds up to hide his Face, as not being able to behold
so pitiful a sight, had you been there where this Bloody
and Stupendious Tragedy was acted: What said I, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy?
(nay, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> what he
suffered did exceed any, the most lamentable and doleful
Tragedy.) You might, I say, if you had been present,
have plainly read the Original of Mens Sorrow, in the
Copy of their Countenances; their Lips were hung with
Black, as if their Tongues were to pronounce some Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
and the Universal Lamentation that was made for
his departed Royal Presence, did loudly proclaim his
present Royal departure: And yet these men shall I say,
or rather Monsters of Men, were so impudent, as they
publickly justified in the Face of Death and Judgment,
so horrid and detestable a Crime, from the Dictates of
their private Conscience, and their following of God, as
they term'd it. O horrid Blasphemy! Who can hear this
and not stand astonished? If Conscience should be held a
sufficient Plea, it would open a Gap to all manner of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness;
for, why may not such a one that hath a
plausible Knack of cheating the common sort of People
with the fair Shew of Conscience, under the pretence
thereof, make Claim to a Liberty for to run into Excess
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98821:19"/>
and Riot, and to commit all kind of Wickedness with
greediness, and think they are very hardly dealt with,
if they be denyed it; and therefore it's no great wonder,
that in those times of Anarchical-Confusion, some men,
who were intoxicated with Principles of Libertinisme,
should make this Proposition, <hi>viz. That nothing might be
Punished with Death but Murder;</hi> A thing, that I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
think of, without Horrour and Amazement, that
Men should be so loose, and given over to such a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
sense, as to Contend to have Iniquity established by
a Law. It is confess'd by most Men that are the strongest
Assertors of Liberty of Conscience, that men, which
are guilty of Offences against the Second Table, should
be restrained by Punishment; and, What satisfactory ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Accompt can be given, why the same Care should
not be taken, for the preventing the Breach of the First
Table, which hath respect unto those Duties which we
owe unto God? Hath not Conscience Influence upon both?
Is not Gods Glory concerned in one as well as the other?
Or are the things of God less precious than the things of
Men?</p>
            <p>But I know, it will be objected, <hi>That no Man hath Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over the Conscience but God alone,</hi> &amp; <hi>'tis he only that
exercises Soveraignity therein.</hi> But in Answer to this, I would
fain know, Whether the Supreme Lord, hath not delegated
power to some men, and invested them with Authority
to Check and Control the Exorbitant Practises and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of such persons, who break out in things which
manifestly tend to the dishonour of His Name, and the
Peace of the Church: Or otherwise, all Ordinances,
Order, and Government, would be trampled under
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98821:20"/>
foot, Religion would be Banished quite out of the Land,
and the habitable World turned into an Hell: And if this
were not so, how comes it to pass, that under the Law,
the false Prophet, and the Brother that spake to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to turn them away from the Lord their God, were
put to Death? <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. And was not the Blasphemer
stoned to Death? <hi>Levit.</hi> 24. 14. God, you know, many
times Plagued <hi>Judah,</hi> and at last carried it into Captivity,
because of their tolerating of Errour, and Idolatry;
and, if you consult <hi>Josephus</hi> the <hi>Jewish</hi> Historian, you
will find that the toleration of divers Sects among them,
was the Procatarctick Cause of their utter Overthrow.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> You have another sort of Men that can
find in their hearts to come to Church, but they are afraid
lest they should be too curious in matters of God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and should be thought to Complement with God
Almighty, who is a Spirit, and looks for the heart in
such performances: <hi>Crassam rusticitatem pro sanctitate habent,</hi>
as those did, that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> complains of in his time,
they think God is best served in a slovenly manner; they
deal by God Almighty as they do by some of their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
friends, whom they meet with as they are walking
abroad, they do not stop their Course, to give them a
formal Salutation by Crindging, Bowing, and putting off
their Hats, but only give them a nod as they pass along,
or haply may mutter out that trite and thredbare Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of, <hi>Your Servant,</hi> in that Transitory posture;
So, I say, you shall have them do with God; when they
come into his House to Worship him, they think a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Dress or Address of themselves is best becoming, and
so serve God hand over head, as I may say; or as you
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98821:20"/>
have it <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 21 <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>at all Adventures,</hi> for the
Word signifies so, as well as <hi>Contrary,</hi> which our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
renders it: But you shall have these men plead for
themselves, and say, that External Devotion doth not
suite with these Evangelical times. But were they tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
acquainted with the Gospel, which they so much
talk of and so little practise, they would find that this
fond Conceit of theirs is sufficiently Confuted by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
Practice. Did not he lift up his Eyes to Heaven
when he prayed for <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and fell on his Face when
he prayed in his Agony? St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as himself saith
<hi>bowed his Knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ:</hi>
But these men, when they come into God's House, the
Place of His Sacred Presence, you shall have them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
Clap on their Hats, and sit on their Breeches in
Time of Prayer. What a shame is this? The very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
shewed more reverence in the Worshipping of their
Idol Gods: for I read in <hi>Plutarch, That they adored the
Deity that beareth the Name of Honour with the head bare;</hi>
And how rude those Sedentary persons are, who cannot
find in their hearts, to kneel or stand in time of Prayer,
will sufficiently appear, if you consider, what you read in
<hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 32. viz. <hi>Thou shalt rise up before the Hoarie-head;</hi>
If such Honour is required to be done to Old Men, then
sure it will follow, We should much more rise up before
the Ancient of Dayes, when we are Worshipping of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Religion would lose that Native Veneration that is due to
it, if it were not Accompanied with outward decent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
of the Body. But me-thinks, I may speak to these
Men that are so irreverent and profane in their Carriage to
God, in the words of the Prophet <hi>Malachy; offer it now
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98821:21"/>
unto thy Governour, will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy
Person?</hi> No, I warrant you. I durst Appeal to these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Whether they would do the same in their Addresses
to any of us that are in Commission of the Peace? And
yet are they thus sawcy with God Almighty, who is the
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, as if they were hail
fellow well met with him. I speak the more vehemently
concerning this Miscarriage, because such persons deserve
a severe reproof, and if any such be here present, I shall
only say this to them, which is a certain Truth, although
it be <hi>pungens,</hi> and not <hi>ungens; viz.</hi> That the Covering
of their Heads, is a Discovering of their Singularity and
Folly, or rather their foolish Singularity.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Gent.</hi> I shall now speak more particularly to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
you are to enquire of, though I shall not spend time
in Enumerating of them all, for, I conceive that to be
uunecessary, being ye hear them repeated every Sessions;
and besides, you may find them almost in every Printed
Justice of Peace Book; I shall only therefore name some
of the most notorious and principal Offences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> If you know any person, Man or Woman, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Age of Sixteen years, not having some lawful
Excuse, that do not come to Church or Chappel upon
every Sunday, to hear Divine Service; you are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Offence, and the time how long they have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
themselves. You ought to have an especial care
to discover such, that a Mark may be set upon them as
upon <hi>Cain,</hi> who is said, to <hi>goe out from the presence of the
Lord, Gen.</hi> 4. 16. that is, he turned his Back upon the
Church of God, the Place in which his Parents Worshipped
God; called the Presence of the Lord, because God in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98821:21"/>
an especial manner is present there. Such stragling Sheep
as these, it is necessary the Law, as the Shepherd's Dog,
should take hold of them and bite them, which may be a
means to reduce them and gather them into one Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
            <p>You are to make Enquiry if any have blasphemed the
Name of God by Swearing.</p>
            <p>If any shall Profane the Sabbath-day, you are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
such: and there are two sorts of Persons that are
guilty of this Offence; either such as use unnecessary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
as <hi>Pedlers, Carriers, Hucksters,</hi> &amp;c. Let such know,
that if they neglect to sanctifie God on that Day, God
will be sanctified upon them by his Justice. He that did
but gather Sticks on the Sabbath-day, paid soundly for
it; he heard of his fault, on both his Ears: and, because
he rested not from his labour, on that day, was arrested
by a multitude of Stones, which flew like Bees about
him, and rounding him in the Ear, brought the sad mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of Death to him.</p>
            <p>Another sort of Men you have, that are so far from
the Religious Observation of the Sabbath, that they
make a sport of it, they devote themselves to all kind of
Pleasure and Harmless Recreations, as they very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly
term Bowling, Dancing, Wrestling, I had almost
said Cards and Dice too: They do indeed, call the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
<hi>a Delight;</hi> as the Phrase is in the Prophet <hi>Isaiah;</hi> but
in the same sense the <hi>Jews</hi> take it, who spend the day in
Mirth and Jollity, put on the richest and costliest Clothes
they have, eat freely of all variety of Dainties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
their Tables are richly deck'd; and, in a word, use
all things that make for the delight of the Body. So,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98821:22"/>
these men they are wholly immers'd in Carnal Sensual
Pleasures, and make no more use of that day, than the
<hi>Leviathan</hi> doth of the Sea, only to take their pastime
therein.</p>
            <p>You shall present, &amp;c.—But I shall say no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Religion and matters of the Church, but shall
come briefly to Offences against the State: And herein
first, of those that are Committed against the King, and
then of those Committed against the King's People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> As to the King, If any one have Conspired
against the Life of the King's or Queens Majesty, or of
their Eldest Son and Heir, the very Compassing and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
thereof is High Treason, if it can be proved by
any Overt Act.</p>
            <p>But all Matters of Treason are only Inquirable here,
but not Punishable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If there be any that Revile the King, and
speak Contemptuously of him, or use any Invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him or his Government, you are to present them:
This is a greater Offence than People are aware of; St.
<hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>That such as despise Dominion, and speak
evil of Dignities, are in an especial manner reserved to
Judgment.</hi> We read in the Epistle of <hi>Jude,</hi> That <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi>
the <hi>Archangel,</hi> when he Contended with the Divel,
did not bring a railing Accusation against him, he did not
revile him, no not in the heat of dispute: But some Men
are so impudently vile as to revile the Gods, I mean Kings,
whom Truth himself calls Gods; for <hi>Elohim</hi> in Scripture,
which is Translated God, is an Equivocal Word, and
is Competible both to Angels and Governours as well as
God.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:98821:22"/>
Next, As to those Offences which concern the King's
People, they are of two sorts; either such as Concern
their Life: or Secondly, such as Concern their Estate
and Possessions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> As to Life, And the highest Offence against that
is Petty Treason, which is, where one is killed unto
whom the Offender did owe Obedience; as, The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to the Master; The Wife to the Husband; The
Clerk to the Prelate.</p>
            <p>The second Degree, as to Life, is Murder and Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide.
The Spilling of Blood (<hi>Gent.</hi>) is an Offence of
a Scarlet die, a Crying Sin, and you ought to take es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial
Care of finding it out. There are a sort of Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Roaring Blades, Gallants, they would Christen
themselves, that make nothing of Stabbing and Killing
for every petty Conceived Affront; it may be, for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Lye; for taking the right Hand, or the Wall
of them, or not pledging a Carouse or Health, which
is to be drunk by a stated Measure and Proportion, (as
those that make Profession of Skill in the Harmony of
<hi>Bacchus</hi> know full well) but <hi>Novum genus hoc mensurae,
ubi nullus est mensurae modus,</hi> as St. <hi>Basil</hi> saith, <hi>This is a
new kind of Measure, where no Measure is kept:</hi> Such
fiery hot Spirits as these, or, as they are commonly called,
Sparks, ought to be quenched, lest the whole Country
be set in a Combustion; Blood-shed with them, is held
but the Cognizance of noble Resolution. The Clipping
of the King's Coyne, is more odious and dangerous in
their Accompt, than the Destroying of God's Image.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Sort of Offences against the King's People,
are such as Concern Mens Possessions and Estates. And

here you are to Enquire of all Burglaries, Robberies,
Cutting of Purses, and generally of all other Stealths. This
Offence of <hi>Stealing</hi> is grown so Epidemical, that those Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
which use it, seem to plead Prescription for it, and are
ready to Count it a lawful Calling. <hi>Luther</hi> tells of a Thief
at <hi>Wittemberg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that had Continued his Stealing Sixty years,
and being apprehended in the Fact, was asked by the
Maior, <hi>How it went?</hi> He answered, <hi>As I drive, so it
goeth.</hi> Some Persons have Contracted such an Habit by
the frequent Repetition of Thievish Acts, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leave their Stealing till it hath brought them to the
Gallows; whereas, did they meet with a Check at first,
it might prevent their fatal Over-throw, although it were
but some slight punishment that was Inflicted upon them;
as that Conceited one was, that I have read of, which
was after this manner. <hi>The Delinquent had a Coller of Iron
clapp'd close about his Neck, which was riveled so fast with
an Iron Pin, that it could not possibly be taken off, and a
little Bell was hanging thereat, to the end that the ringing
thereof, as often as he did stir or move, might give the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
warning to take heed of him.</hi>
