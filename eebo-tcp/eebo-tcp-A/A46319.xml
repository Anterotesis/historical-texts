         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>THE Prieſts and Elders that pernicious Seed</l>
               <l>Of Rebel <hi>Jews,</hi> as we in Scripture read,</l>
               <l>Oppoſing Chriſt, did with Conſent prepare</l>
               <l>A Law to trap him, and his life enſnare:</l>
               <l>Upon the Trial, he doth make demand,</l>
               <l>What Precept he hath broke, or juſt Command?</l>
               <l>For want of Crime, the <hi>Jews</hi> make this Reply,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>We have a Law, and by it thou ſhalt die:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>A curſed Sentence, and to be abhor'd,</l>
               <l>Imbrac'd by none, but Murderers of the Lord.</l>
               <l>The making Laws for to enſnare the Juſt,</l>
               <l>Of God is hated, and to be accurſt.</l>
               <l>They murdered Chriſt, regarding not his loſs,</l>
               <l>Nor 'ſwag'd their Malice, tho' he on the Croſs,</l>
               <l>But then proceed againſt his own Elect,</l>
               <l>By Means prepoſterous and indirect;</l>
               <l>Nay, ever ſince, the Wicked in their Rage,</l>
               <l>Have murdered Righteous Men in every Age:</l>
               <l>But Innocency, that no Ill doth fear,</l>
               <l>Hath worn out Tyrants wrath, do what they dare.</l>
               <l>This Time, with ſober Men does ſeem to be</l>
               <l>A Parallel with the Apoſtacy.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> is alike for Crime,</l>
               <l>Unto <hi>Judea,</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus' Time:</l>
               <l>Here Laws are extant, that doth terrify</l>
               <l>Well meaning Men, and Liberty deny</l>
               <l>In ſerving God, except in their own way.</l>
               <l>In their own Method, and on their made Day.</l>
               <l>Here Innocents are fined, whipt, and branded,</l>
               <l>Ears cropt, ſome ſold for Slaves, ſome ſlaſht, ſome hanged;</l>
               <l>Whoever is contrary to them found,</l>
               <l>Though in his Spirit their Fine muſt be Five Pound,</l>
               <l>Or elſe three Days in Goal, e'er a diſcharge,</l>
               <l>And with a ten laſht whiping be enlarg'd:</l>
               <l>Such Cruelty forbore in other Parts,</l>
               <l>Doth now poſſeſs <hi>American's</hi> brutiſh Hearts.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Lament, <hi>Newengland,</hi> like a tender Mother!</l>
               <l>To ſee thy Children one deſtroy another:</l>
               <l>The humbleſt ſort, and none but ſuch as they,</l>
               <l>Unto the fiery Zealous are a Prey:</l>
               <l>Thoſe that in Conſcience cannot wrong a Worm,</l>
               <l>Are fined and whipt, becauſe they can't conform;</l>
               <l>And time hath been, which ne'er ſhall be forgot,</l>
               <l>God's Servants have been hang'd, none knows for what,</l>
               <l>Except for ſerving of their bleſſed Lord,</l>
               <l>For Quaking and for Trembling at his Word.</l>
               <l>Let thoſe black Days, like the fifth of <hi>November,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Be writ in Red, for Ages to Remember.</l>
               <l>And thou, <hi>July,</hi> forbear thy round delays,</l>
               <l>Inſtead of Mirth, let Mourning end thy Days.</l>
               <l>Twelve Innocents, without e'er Guilt or Crime;</l>
               <l>With cruel Whips were ſcourged at one time;</l>
               <l>And ſix Days after, fifteen more by Force,</l>
               <l>Were like the firſt twelve, beaten without Remorſe</l>
               <l>Seven tender Women, young and old, were ſtript,</l>
               <l>All naked to the Waiſt, and cruelly whipt.</l>
               <l>Immodeſt Action! greateſt Wrong with Shame,</l>
               <l>Which never will be clear of Guilt or Blame:</l>
               <l>And twenty Men, well bred, of good Deſcent,</l>
               <l>Fit for Aſſiſtants to their Government,</l>
               <l>Each of ſuch good Report and high Repute,</l>
               <l>Their Foes could not accuſe them, but were mute,</l>
               <l>Only a Law unjuſt forbid their meeting</l>
               <l>To ſerve the Lord, and Whips muſt be their Greeting.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Admire, O Heavens! be Earth aſtoniſhed</l>
               <l>At this profuſe Expenſe of guiltleſs Blood!</l>
               <l>In ſuch a Caſe where nothing is concern'd</l>
               <l>But a Religion, they in Scripture learn'd;</l>
               <l>Chriſt's own Command, the Apoſtle's Approbation,</l>
               <l>All good Men's Care, our wiſe Kings Toleration.</l>
               <l>Why ſhould Men's Liberties be thus abridg'd,</l>
               <l>And Conſcience hinder'd in what's privileg'd?</l>
               <l>Why ſhould a petty Government conſtrain Men to</l>
               <l>What Acts of Parliament doth ſcorn to do?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>CHARLES</hi> is not forgot, that bloody Spirit</l>
               <l>Doth in their angry Humours ſtill inherit.</l>
               <l>Amongſt the <hi>Heathens, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Catholicks,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Are no ſuch cruel and unchriſtian Tricks.</l>
               <l>Had they complyed with a wicked Law.</l>
               <l>And of a whipping ſtood in common Awe.</l>
               <l>Five Pounds their tender Backs had ſaved, ſo</l>
               <l>They had been free'd from Stripes, to ſtay or go;</l>
               <l>Nay, were they criminal, inlarged they had been.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Newengland's</hi> Law admits of buying Sin:</l>
               <l>But for obedient Service to their God,</l>
               <l>Thus to be beaten with the ſcourging Rod.</l>
               <l>And from their Meetings to be dragged off,</l>
               <l>By mercileſs Men, and made a common Scoff.</l>
               <l>To <hi>Iſhmael's</hi> Race, and unto Priſon ſent,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cain</hi> may his Purpoſe on meek <hi>Abel</hi> vent,</l>
               <l>It is ſo ridiculous, and ſuch a ſnare,</l>
               <l>All wiſe and ſober Men a Judgment fear.</l>
               <l>Their Blood doth cry, and loud for Vengeance call,</l>
               <l>Tho they do heartily forgive them all.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Regard, O Lord! thou powerful God of Hoſt,</l>
               <l>The Goal, the Gallows, and the whipping Poſt!</l>
