            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>AT Juſtice-Hall in the Old-Bayley, the laſt Seſſions, <hi>Peter Ceſar</hi> a <hi>Portugeſe</hi> was called to the Bar, to anſwer an Indictment exhibited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for killing of his own dear Lord and Maſter, <hi>a most barbarous and cruell Act; but the miraculous Effects, in Diſcovery thereof, is worthy of Remark, by the Judicious Reader: For no ſooner had this bloudy Villain contrived the Diſſolution of his Maſters life, but Terrour poſſeſſed his guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the Grand Serjeant Death appeared ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious for a high Arreſt; but</hi> Ceſar <hi>thinking to make his Eſcape, was prevented: Notwithſtanding his fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from</hi> Hart-ſtreet <hi>near</hi> Covent-Garden, <hi>where his Maſter lodged: Who ſending his Servant from thence, after he had been abroad at his Devotions, to provide him ſome Fiſh for his Dinner, and being dreſſed, and ſerved up, this</hi> Judas-like Wretch, <hi>when</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:105467:3"/>
               <hi>his Maſter was ſate down at the</hi> Table, <hi>and ſtanding with a Trencher and Napkin to wait upon him, took that bloudy Reſolution, having a Piſtoll ready fixed and charged, to diſcharge it against his Master, and ſo ſhot him through the head, as he was eating of his Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: the Report of which Piſtol was heard by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the houſe; but he uſing to fire it in Jest, in his Maſters abſence, againſt ſome</hi> Taylors <hi>that wrought oppoſite againſt them, they took no further notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And about an hour after, this bloudy Executioner came down into the Kitchin, and ſeated himſelf to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with the people of the houſe, where he ſtaid the moſt part of the Afternoon; and then went abroad, and came in again; and toward the Evening he went forth again, and cauſed a Porter to bring home a large Chest to his Lodging; and cauſing the ſame to be carryed up ſtairs, the Porter was diſcharged, and the bloody Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain himſelf drew it into his Maſters Chamber: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hours after, he called the Porter again to help him down with the Cheſt, which he did accordingly: and the Miſtreſs of the houſe meeting him upon the Stairs, ſaid,</hi> Where are you going <hi>Peter,</hi> what have you got in this Cheſt? <hi>He anſwered,</hi> Goods for my Maſter, <hi>Landſlady,</hi> Me Maſter is to have a boon Collation in the Strand, with many Gentlemen of quality lately come from beyond the Seas. <hi>But</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:105467:3"/>
               <hi>bringing the Cheſt down, it proved too heavy for him and the Porter, ſo that another came to their Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and away they carryed it to the Water-ſide, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning for the</hi> Faulcon, <hi>this bloudy</hi> Peter <hi>pretending,</hi> That he was to meet a Gentleman there, to receive money of him for the Goods in the Cheſt. <hi>But theſe ſpecious Pretences, ſoon took period in a deceitful Errand, for croſſing the Water, he had no power to land there, but commanded the</hi> Water-men <hi>to Row him back again towards the</hi> Temple ſtairs <hi>coming near the Shoar, he cast the Cheſt over-boat, which the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-men admiring, askt him his Reaſon,</hi> To which he ſaid, there was a Trick put upon him, and that the Cheſt was onely filled with Traſh, Trumpery, and Garbage, which he would not beſtow the pains to carry any further. <hi>And landing, ſeemed to go away in a Rage to his Lodging; but the next morning ſome blood being diſcovered upon the Stairs, and diligent Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made thereinto, he endeavoured to make his eſcape, but was immediately apprehended, and committed to</hi> Newgate, <hi>where he continued till the laſt Seſſions; Right then taking place, and</hi> Real Juſtice <hi>ſtreaming forth, even like unto Streams deſcending from the Mountains.</hi> For upon bringing of him to the Bar, he confeſſed the Fact, acquitting all perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever from having any hand therein; but that it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105467:4"/>
was his own Contrivance, and that not ſuddainly, but deliberately, having many days before reſolved to attempt it, but had no convenient Opportunity, till that time his Maſter was eating of a Diſh of Fiſh, at which time he ſhot him through the head, being tempted for many days, and much perplexd in mind till he had effected it; for which he was not onely ſorry, but alſo confident, that nothing could expiate the Guilt thereof, but to ſhed the bloud of him, who had in ſuch a moſt barbarous and inhumane manner, ſhed the bloud of his Dear Lord and Maſter. And all this, through want of Grace, meerly for the gaining of his Maſters Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and Rings, together with the three hundred pounds in Gold, which his <hi>Maſter</hi> wore about him in a Liſt to ſupply his Occaſions. For which hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Fact, he was Arraigned and Condemned, and merited that Juſt Sentence, to be drawn upon a Hurdle from Newgate to the place of Execution, and there to be hangd till he was dead.</p>
            <p>The two <hi>French-men</hi> alſo, who committed that inhumane Act againſt a Citizens Wife near <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born;</hi> as firſt to Raviſh her, and then to run up a Flaming Torch into her Body, were alſo Arraigned and Condemned: But <hi>Mary Smith,</hi> who cut off
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105467:4"/>
her Childs Head, was Reprieved from publique Juſtice, by the Grand Sergeant <hi>Death,</hi> who catchd her from thence to another place, before the time of her Tryal. But tis obſervable, that never came a more penitent Soul within the Walls of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, than his poor Creature; for when one of the Officers told her, ſhe muſt prepare her Self for her Tryal, for the time was near approaching ſhe muſt give an Account at the Bar: To which ſhe replyed, The Inviſible Bar, to mortal Eyes, was her deſire to ſtand before, where ſhe did not doubt to find Eternal mercy; and that ſhe hoped the Thread of her Life was ſpun to the very end, ſo that her penitent Soul ſhould not long be Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated within that Sinful Body, the Priſon of ſo precious a Jewel; for, ſayes ſhe, I queſtion not, but theſe <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               </gap>rance therein. This much ſympathiz'd with what ſhe confeſſed before Juſtice <hi>Swallow,</hi> when ſhe was firſt Apprehended: for then ſhe ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously confeſſed, That it was her ſad Fate and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be overcome by One young man, whom ſhe had a great Affection for; but he having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his will, and ſhe conceiving with Child, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to marry her: Wdereupon ſhe reſolved to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105467:5"/>
forſake Friends and Relations, and to tranſport her Self to ſome Forreign Plantations: In order whereunto, ſhe made Application to a Maſter of a Ship, and obtained leaue to be Tranſported: But before the time came to begin their Voyage, ſhe had a Secret Delivery a Ship-board, and very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure under Deck; where, contrary to all Humane Reaſon, the Infant became headleſs, for ſhe quickly ſevered the Head from the Shoulders, throwing the Body into the River, out at a Port-hole, and the Head behind the Casks: Which being quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered, the Bloody Mother was ſoon appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and carryed before the Juſtice as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: from whence ſhe was committed to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> where ſhe departed this Life, making a very penitent <hi>End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like did the <hi>French-</hi>man and <hi>Portugeſe,</hi> the one Executed in <hi>Holborn,</hi> and the other at <hi>Tyburn, Wedneſday</hi> the 27. who confessed his Fact, and very much bewailed the horroudneſs thereof, for that his <hi>dear Maſter</hi> had bin inſtrumental, to ſave his life in <hi>Portugal,</hi> where he had killed a man, and ſhould have bin burnd, had not <hi>Mercy</hi> tranſcended Juſtice.</p>
