            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
TRIP
TO
New-England, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BISHOPS, Bailiffs, and Bastards, were the three Terrible Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which chiefly drove our unhappy Brethren to seek their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
in our Forreign Colonies. One of these Bug-bears, I confess,
frighted me from the Blessings of my own dear Native Country; and
forc'd me to the Fatigue of a long Voyage, to escape a Scouring.</p>
            <p>But whether <hi>Zeal, Debt,</hi> or the sweet Sin of <hi>Procreation,</hi> begot in my
Conscience those Fears, which hurried me a great many Leages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my <hi>Senses,</hi> I am as unwilling to declare to the World, as a <hi>Romish</hi>
Damsel that has lost her <hi>Maiden-head,</hi> is to confess her Frailty to the Priest.</p>
            <p>For many Years my <hi>Mind</hi> sat as Easie in my <hi>Breast,</hi> as an <hi>Alderman</hi> in
an <hi>Elbow-Chair,</hi> till the Devil envying my Felicity, flung so many <hi>Crosses</hi>
and <hi>Losses</hi> in my way, that every Step I took in my Occupation, I was
timorous of Tumbling.</p>
            <p>I thought it then high time to seek for Balm, but finding none in
<hi>Gilead,</hi> I was mov'd by the Spirit of Necessity, to forsake Ungodly <hi>London,</hi>
for Religious <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England;</hi> hoping to <hi>Purifie</hi> my self by the
way in an <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Brine,</hi> That when I got thither, I might find my
<hi>Condition,</hi> as well as my <hi>Conscience,</hi> in a tollerable <hi>Pickle,</hi> fitted for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
of the <hi>Saints</hi> in so <hi>Holy a Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pack'd up my Auls in order for my Voyage; and Embarked the
Ship the <hi>Prudent Sarah,</hi> at <hi>Gravesend,</hi> who was weighing Anchor, with
a fair Wind for the <hi>Downs,</hi> That I had no leasure to step back to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
to satisfie my <hi>Creditors;</hi> but, like a Girl that's <hi>Ravish'd,</hi> was forc'd,
with a very good will, to do that which I intended.</p>
            <p>To entertain this Merry Town, with an exact <hi>Iournal</hi> in <hi>Tarpaulin Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,</hi>
is like reading the <hi>Revelations</hi> to an establish'd <hi>Atheist,</hi> or repeating a
<hi>Welsh Commedy</hi> to a <hi>Highlander.</hi> I shall therefore omit all such accustomary
Fustian, and divert you with some Thoughts of my own in the time of
my Passage.</p>
            <p>When I first came on Board, I fancy'd a <hi>Ship</hi> to be like a <hi>Country
Village</hi> with two or three <hi>May-poles</hi> in't; and the Fellows running about
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64752:3"/>
Deck in Red and White-wastcoats, to be the Young Men of the Town
engaged in a match at <hi>Foot-ball.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes I consider'd them as a <hi>Pack</hi> of <hi>Hounds,</hi> and the <hi>Pilot</hi> to be
the <hi>Hunts-man:</hi> For, like Dogs upon a Scent, they keep a heavy <hi>Yelping</hi>
at their Business; but in every interval, were as silent as a <hi>Beagle</hi> at a <hi>Loss.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At other times, I have fancy'd a Ship to be a floating <hi>Hive,</hi> instead
of <hi>Bees,</hi> posses'd by <hi>Drones,</hi> who make more <hi>T—d</hi> than <hi>Honey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Vessel, whilst the <hi>Pilot</hi> is on Board, is an Emblem of Feeble <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;</hi>
where the <hi>King</hi> has a States-man in his Dominions Greater than
himself, That the <hi>Prince</hi> only bears the <hi>Title,</hi> but the other the Command.</p>
            <p>A Man on Board cannot but be thoughtful on two Destinies, <hi>viz.</hi>
Hanging and Drowning: For withinside you have <hi>Rope,</hi> and without
<hi>Water</hi> enough to effect either. So that it often put me in mind of the old
Proverb, <hi>The Sea and the Gallows refuses none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Commander when at Sea, is a Marine Deity; his <hi>Will</hi> is his
<hi>Law,</hi> and the Power of Punishing soly in his own hands. He has a
Wooden World at his Mercy, wherein there is no way to be Happy,
but by due Obedience: For he that knoweth his Masters Will, and doth
it not, shall be beaten with many Stripes.</p>
            <p>When out at Sea, I thought the World was Drown'd, because no
Land was to be seen. The <hi>Captain</hi> and his <hi>Mess,</hi> I compar'd to <hi>Noah</hi>
and his <hi>Family;</hi> but as for the rest, they were the <hi>Beasts</hi> of the <hi>Ark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were very good <hi>Christians</hi> when we'd nothing else to do: All
Hands in a <hi>Calme</hi> to <hi>Pray</hi> or Pick <hi>Okum;</hi> but to work in a <hi>Storm,</hi> serve
God serve Devil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brandy</hi> and <hi>Tobacco</hi> are the Soul of a <hi>Seaman;</hi> he that wants either, is but
half himself; and he that has neither, wants every thing that's needful;
and must, in his own defence, turn <hi>Thief</hi> or <hi>Beggar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mariners,</hi> like <hi>Parsons,</hi> are much given to look Upwards; but never
consult Heaven beyond the <hi>Pole,</hi> or the <hi>Pointers.</hi> At Sea they are a kind
of <hi>Persians,</hi> trusting to the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> for Bodily Salvation.</p>
            <p>They seldom take notice but of one Miracle since <hi>Adam,</hi> and that is
of <hi>Noah</hi>'s guiding the <hi>Ark</hi> to a safe Harbour, without the help of a <hi>Sail,</hi>
or the use of a <hi>Rudder:</hi> Which (forgetting Providence) they urge to be
Impossible.</p>
            <p>A foul Wind makes scanty Messes; for it's a chearful saying among
Seamen, <hi>Large Wind, Large Allowance: Starving</hi> and <hi>Drowning</hi> being to
them equally terrible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Facetious Ignorance</hi> is an excellent Tallent to win the Captains Favour.
Reason at Sea, without the Rules of Navigation, is as dangerous to be
talk'd as Treason: For nothing galls the Ambition of a Commander more,
Than to hear any Body on Board seem Wiser than himself.</p>
            <p>They generally bestow their <hi>Favours,</hi> as Fortune does her <hi>Benefits,</hi> as
if both their Heads were in a Bag; and for want of <hi>Sense</hi> or <hi>Sight,</hi> choose
<hi>Dunces</hi> for their <hi>Minions,</hi> and <hi>Fools</hi> for their <hi>Companions:</hi> Dreading <hi>Ingenuity,</hi>
and slighting <hi>Merit.</hi> Being possitive in <hi>Errors,</hi> hateful to <hi>Instruction,</hi>
proud of their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Wise</hi> in their own conceits.</p>
            <p>A Violent <hi>Storm</hi> at Sea, to me, seem'd the Minute resemblance of a
general <hi>Conflagration:</hi> When Jarring Elements for Power contended; and
angry Heavens belch'd out flakes of its consuming Fire on the reflecting
Ocean; follow'd with dreadful Claps of rending Thunder, rattling
from Cloud to Cloud, thro' Rains and Hurricanes, till the Conquering
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64752:3"/>
Wind had blown his Sable Enemies beneath our Horizon, and clear'd
the Skies of his affrightening Rivals.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Calm</hi> to me was an Effeminate acquiescence of the <hi>Elements;</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant
to a manly disposition: The World look'd as if Nature was a
Sleep; and, careless of her charge, had suffer'd (thro' Neglect) the whole
Universe to be Idle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could compare our Ship to nothing in so smooth
a Sea, but to an <hi>Egg</hi> upon a <hi>Looking-glass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Idleness at Sea is the worst of Slavery; and he that has nothing to
do, is Buried Alive in a <hi>Cabbin</hi> instead of a <hi>Coffin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With these sort of Cogitations I past away my Time, being tost about
by the Waves like a <hi>Dog</hi> in a <hi>Blanket,</hi> till we got Sight of the <hi>Promis'd
Land,</hi> and Arriv'd at our desir'd Port, <hi>Boston.</hi> Of which I shall first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to give you an Account, free from Prejudice or Partiality.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of Boston, and the Inhabitants.</head>
               <p>On the <hi>South-west</hi> side of <hi>Massachusets-Bay,</hi> is <hi>Boston;</hi> whose Name is
taken from a Town in <hi>Lincoln-shire:</hi> And is the Metropolis of all <hi>New-England.</hi>
The Houses in some parts joyn as in <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
like their <hi>Women,</hi> being <hi>Neat</hi> and <hi>Handsome.</hi> And their <hi>Streets,</hi> like
the <hi>Hearts</hi> of the <hi>Male Inhabitants,</hi> are Paved with <hi>Pebble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Chief, or high Street, there are stately Edifices, some of which
have cost the owners two or three Thousand Pounds the raising; which,
I think, plainly proves Two old <hi>Adages</hi> true, <hi>viz. That a Fool and his
Money is soon parted;</hi> and, <hi>set a Beggar on Horse-back he'll Ride to the Devil,</hi>
for the Fathers of these Men were <hi>Tinkers</hi> and <hi>Peddlers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Glory of Religion, and the Credit of the Town, there are four
<hi>Churches,</hi> Built with <hi>Clap-boards</hi> and <hi>Shingles,</hi> after the Fashion of our <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houses;</hi>
which are supply'd by four Ministers, to whom some, very
justly, have apply'd these Epithites, one a <hi>Scholar,</hi> the Second a <hi>Gentleman,</hi>
the Third a <hi>Dunce,</hi> and the Fourth a <hi>Clown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Churches are <hi>Independent,</hi> every Congregation, or Assembly, in
<hi>Eclesiastical</hi> Affairs, being distinctly Govern'd by their own <hi>Elders</hi> and
<hi>Deacons,</hi> who in their Turns set the Psalmes; and the former are as busie
on <hi>Sundays,</hi> to excite the People to a Liberal Contribution, as our Church-Wardens
at <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Christimas,</hi> are with their Dishes, to make a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
for the Poor.</p>
               <p>Every Stranger is unavoidably forc'd to take this Notice, That in
<hi>Boston,</hi> there are more <hi>Religious Zealots</hi> than <hi>Honest-men,</hi> more <hi>Parsons</hi>
than <hi>Churches,</hi> and more <hi>Churches</hi> than <hi>Parishes:</hi> For the <hi>Town,</hi> unlike the
<hi>People,</hi> is subject to no <hi>Division.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inhabitants seem very Religious, showing many outward and visible
Signs of an inward and Spiritual Grace: But tho' they wear in their
Faces the <hi>Innocence</hi> of <hi>Doves,</hi> you will find them in their Dealings, as
<hi>Subtile</hi> as <hi>Serpents. Interest</hi> is their <hi>Faith, Money</hi> their <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Large Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssessions</hi>
the only <hi>Heaven</hi> they covet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Election, Commencement,</hi> and <hi>Training-days,</hi> are their only <hi>Holy-days;</hi> they
keep no <hi>Saints-Days,</hi> nor will they allow the <hi>Apostles</hi> to be <hi>Saints,</hi> yet
they assume that Sacred Dignity to themselves; and say, in the Title Page
of their Psalm-Book, <hi>Printed for the Edification of the Saints in</hi> Old <hi>and</hi>
New-England.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64752:4"/>
They have been very severe against <hi>Adultery,</hi> which they Punish'd with
Death; yet, notwithstanding the Harshness of their Law, the Women are
of such noble Souls, and undaunted Resolutions, that they will run the

               <p>If you Kiss a Woman in Publick, tho' offer'd as a Curteous Salutation,

               <p>Publick <hi>Kissing,</hi> and single <hi>Fornication</hi> are both of a Price; for which Reason
the Women wisely consider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the latter may be done with more safty than

               <p>A Captain of a Ship who had been a long Voyage, happen'd to meet
his Wife, and kist her in the Street; for which he was fin'd Ten Shillings,

in <hi>Old-England,</hi> that can not only Kiss our own Wives, but other
Mens too without the danger of such a penalty.</p>
               <p>Another Inhabitant of the Town was fin'd Ten Shillings for Kissing
his own wife in his Garden; and obstinatly refusing to pay the Money, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
Twenty Lashes at the <hi>Gun:</hi> Who, in Revenge of his Punishment,
Swore he would never Kiss her again, either in Publick or Private. And
at this rate, one of the delightfulest Customs in the World, will in time
be quit thrown out of Fashion, to the Old Folks satisfaction, but to the
Young ones Lamentation, who love it as well in <hi>New-England,</hi> as we do

with a Friend, opposite to the <hi>Zealots</hi> dwelling, who got out of his Bed

having oft been serv'd so, had left unbolted his Cellar <hi>Trap-door,</hi> as a <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall</hi>

               <p>I was mightily pleas'd one Morning with a Contention between two

One Jostled the other from the Handle, and he would fill his Bucket first,
because his Master said <hi>Prayers</hi> and sung <hi>Psalms</hi> twice a Day in his Family,
and the others Master did not. To which the Witty Knave made this

reply, <hi>Our House stands backward in a Court: if my Master had a Room next
the Street, as your Master has<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he'd</hi> Pray <hi>twice to your Masters once, that he
wou'd, and therefore I'll fill any Pail first, Marry will I;</hi> and did accordingly.</p>
               <p>Some Years Ago, when the Factors at <hi>Boston</hi> were Credited with large
Stocks by our <hi>English</hi> Merchants, and being backward in their Returns,
and more in their Books then they were willing to satisfie, contriv'd this
Stratagem to out-wit their Correspondents. As 'tis said, They set Fire
to their Ware-houses, after the disposal of their Goods, and Burnt them
down to the Ground, pretending in their Letters, they were all undone,
their Cargos and Books all destroy'd; and so at once Ballanc'd their
Accounts, with <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of their Factors, who had three or four Thousand Pounds worth
of an <hi>English</hi> Merchants Goods in his Hands, sends him an Account of
this Lamentable Mischance, to the purpose he was quite Ruin'd, and had
lost all but a small Cheese of four Pound Weight, which he sent him
for a present. The Merchant having had some Intelligence of the Roguery
of his Factor, invites several Eminent Merchants (that dealt to <hi>New-England</hi>)
to Dinner with him, who came accordingly, he having prepar'd
an Extraordinary Feast to entertain them. They mightily condol'd his
great Loss, (he making slight of it) and blam'd him for the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
of his Treat, after he had sustain'd so considerable a Misfortune.
<hi>Ah! Gentlemen,</hi> says he, <hi>this is nothing to what I have provided you:
I have one Dish still to come up, which cost me between three and four Thousand
Pounds; and, notwithstanding its costliness, I think it not Good enough for such
worthy Company.</hi> The Gentlemen look'd one upon another, and thought
he was Frenzical. In the interim, up came his <hi>New-England</hi> Present, under
a cover. <hi>That's the Dish,</hi> says the Master of the Feast, <hi>that stood me
in so many Thousands. 'Tis but a small Morsel, considering the Price.</hi> The
Company all wondering of what delicates the Cook must have compos'd
this Extravagant Kickshaw, lifted up the Cover, and finding nothing but
a <hi>Cheese,</hi> laugh'd as heartily at their Disapointment, as the <hi>Mob</hi> in the
Fable at the <hi>Mountain-mouse.</hi> Then he continued their Mirth by unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Riddle: And Swore, if ever he trusted a <hi>New-England</hi> Saint again
for three Pence, the Devil shou'd have a Title to him and his Heirs for

               <p>Husking of <hi>Indian-Corn,</hi> is as good sport for the Amorous <hi>Wag-tailes</hi>

<hi>Rich Men</hi> without <hi>Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They all pretend to be driven over by <hi>Persecution,</hi> which their Teachers
Roar out against in their Assemblies, with as much bitterness, as a double
refin'd <hi>Protestant</hi> can belch forth against the <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon:</hi> Yet have
they us'd the <hi>Quakers</hi> with such severity, by <hi>Whipping, Hanging,</hi> and other
Punishments, forcing them to put to Sea in Vessels without Provision,
they flying with Gladness to the Merciless Ocean, as their only Refuge
under Heaven, left to escape the <hi>Savage Fury</hi> of their <hi>Vnchristian Enemies,</hi>
till drove by <hi>Providence</hi> upon <hi>Rhoad-Island</hi> (so call'd from their accidental
discovery of it in their Stroling Adventure) which they found full of <hi>Fruits</hi>
and <hi>Flowers,</hi> a <hi>Fertile Soil,</hi> and extreamly Pleasant, being the Garden of
<hi>America;</hi> where they happily Planted themselves, making great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:

with that Reverence and Humility as they ought to do, but tell them
'tis <hi>Popery</hi> to uncover their Heads in the House and Presence of the <hi>Deity;</hi>

               <p>If you are not a Member in full Communion with one of their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,

               <p>An Eminent <hi>Planter</hi> came to me for an Ounce of <hi>Venice-treacle,</hi> which
I would have sold him for a Shilling; he protested he had liv'd there
Fifty Years, and never see in the whole Term, Ten Pounds in <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Money</hi>
of his own; and yet was Rated at a Thousand Pounds, and
thought the <hi>Assessors</hi> us'd him kindly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But gave me for my Medicine
a Bushel of <hi>Indian-Corn,</hi> vallued at half a Crown, and Vow'd if a Shilling

               <p>They have a <hi>Charter</hi> for a <hi>Fair</hi> at <hi>Salem,</hi> but it Begins, like <hi>Ingerstone</hi>

Twelve: For I never see any thing in it but by great Accident, and
those were <hi>Pumkins,</hi> which were the chief Fruit that supported the <hi>English</hi>
at their first settling in these parts. But now they enjoy plenty of good
Provisions, <hi>Fish, Flesh</hi> and <hi>Fowl,</hi> and are become as great <hi>Epicures,</hi> as ever
Din'd at <hi>Pontack</hi>'s Ordinary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lobsters</hi> and <hi>Cod-fish</hi> are held in such disdain, by reason of their Plenty,
'tis as Scandalous for a poor Man in <hi>Boston</hi> to carry one through the streets,
as 'tis for an Alderman in the City of <hi>London,</hi> to be seen walking with
a Groatsworth of <hi>Fresh-Herrings,</hi> from <hi>Billings-gate</hi> to his own House.</p>
               <p>There were formerly amongst them (as they themselves Report) abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of <hi>Witches,</hi> and indeed I know not, but there may be as many now,
for the Men look still as if they were <hi>Hag-ridden;</hi> and every Stranger;
that comes into the Country, shall find they will Deal by him to this
Day, as if the <hi>Devil</hi> were in 'em.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Witchcraft</hi> they Punish'd with Death, till they had Hang'd the best Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the Country, and Convicted the <hi>Culprit</hi> upon a single Evidence:
So that any prejudic'd person, who bore Malice against a Neighbour,
had an easie method of removing their Adversary. But since, upon better
consideration, they have Mitigated the severity of that unreasonable Law,
there has not been one accused of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> in the whole Country.</p>
               <p>Many are the Bug-bear storys reported of these suppos'd <hi>Negroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi>
but few Believ'd, tho' I presume none True, yet all Collected and
already Printed, I shall therefore omit the relating of any.</p>
               <p>They have one very wholesome Law, which would do mighty well
to be in force in <hi>Old-England;</hi> which is a Peculiar method they have of
Punishing <hi>Scolds.</hi> If any Turbulent Woman be Troubled with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
Member, and uses it to the Defamation of any Body, or disquiet
of her Neighbours, upon Complaint, she is order'd to be <hi>Gag'd</hi> and set
at her own Door as many Hours as the Magistrates shall think fit, there
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64752:7"/>
to be gaiz'd at by all Passengers till the time's expired. Which, to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
seems the most Equitable Law imaginable to Punish more particularly
that Member which committed the Offence.</p>
               <p>Whipping is a Punishment so Practicable in this Country, upon every
slight Offence, that at a Town upon the <hi>Sound,</hi> call'd <hi>New-Haven,</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
do confess, that all the Inhabitants of that Place, above the Age of
Fourteen, had been Whip'd for some Misdemeanour or other (except two)

               <head>Of the Beasts.</head>
               <p>They have most sort of Four-footed Beasts that we have here, only
something different in either Sise or Colour, but of the same Species.
I shall only mention those which are Natives of that Country, and to us
uncommon; for to Treat of Creatures dayly to be seen, or heard of in
our own Climate, will afford the Reader but little Satisfaction.</p>

                  <p>Of all the Creatures that inhabit these parts of <hi>America,</hi> the <hi>Moos-deer</hi>
makes the most Noble figure: He is shap'd like an <hi>English</hi> Deer, only
round Footed; but of a stately Stature, seldom so low as the biggest of
our <hi>Oxen.</hi> His Head fortified with Horns proportionable, whose Palms
are very broad, full of indented branches, and are commonly two Fathom
distance from Tip to Tip. His Flesh is not dry, like <hi>Venison,</hi> but moist
and Lushious; extreamly palatable, and very wholesome. The flesh of
their <hi>Fawns,</hi> is also delicious Food; highly commended by all such who
are more than ordinary Nice in obliging their Voluptuous Appetites.
There is much said by the Phisicians of that Country concerning the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Virtues of the Horn of this Creature: Being look'd upon as an
incomparable Restorative against all inward weaknesses; and in all Cases
where <hi>Harts-honn</hi> is prescrib'd, the <hi>Moos-horn</hi> they look upon to be a far
better Medicine; half the Quantity being more powerful in effect.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Bears</hi> that Inhabit this part of <hi>America,</hi> are generally of a blackish
Colour during the Winter season, which is much colder than in <hi>England.</hi>
They defend themselves from the hardship of the weather, by retiring into
Caves, where they continue for about four Months; in which time their
Snows are pretty well dissolv'd, and the severity of their Frost over. They
are commonly very Fat in the fall of the Leaf, by feeding upon Acorns, at
which time the <hi>Indians</hi> destroy a great many; looking upon 'em then to
be incomparable <hi>Venison:</hi> But the Head, I believe, is but a sorry dish,
because they hold the <hi>Brains</hi> to be Venomous. They are very fierce in
<hi>Rutting-time;</hi> and then walk the Country round, thirty or forty in a
Company, making a hedious roaring, which may be heard a Mile or
two before they come near enough to endanger a Traveller. They will
never injure a Man at any other time of the Year, except you attempt
to hurt them first; But if you Shoot at one, and miss him, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
destroy you; which makes the <hi>Indians</hi> sure of their Mark be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ever they discharge their Piece. Their Skins they sell to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>

but the Flesh they Cook sundry ways, Salting and Drying some,
of which they make extraordinary Bacon, no Hogs-flesh in the world

the Appetite.</p>

Its Furr is of a dark colour, and in good esteem, tho' something course. He
is of an <hi>Owlish</hi> disposition; and chooses for his <hi>Mansion-house</hi> a <hi>Hollow-Tree.</hi>
They are meer Gluttons at <hi>Indian-Corn;</hi> and feed themselves in <hi>Autumn</hi>

from the Branches upon the Back of <hi>Horse, Cow, Deer,</hi> or any Creature
that is feeding under it; clinging close with their Tallons, knawing a great
hole between the Shoulders of the Beast, who runs full speed till he drops

work thro'. The <hi>Indians</hi> use these Quills to adorn their Birchen Dishes.

                  <p>This is an Amphibeous Creature, rather larger than an <hi>Otter,</hi> Hairy all
over but his Tail, which is Scaly like a Fish; and is of an admirable
Instinct, as is observ'd by their artificial Dam-heads, by which, in dry
Seasons, they raise the Water to their Houses, when the Pond, upon whose
brinks they dwell, is sunk from it's usual Edges. Their Nests or Burrow
which they make, are three Stories high, that in case excessive Rains should
over-flow their first and second Floor, they may mount into their Garrets,
there Sleep in a dry Skin till the Floods abated. They have two pair
of Testacles, one soft and Oily; and the other pair hard or solid. The
Women dry the latter, and grate them into Wine, to further Generation,
remove the causes of Barrenness, prevent Miscarriages, and to strengthen
Nature against, and also moderate the Pains of Delivery. They Eat no
part of this Creature but the Tail, which they flea and boil, accounting
it rare Victuals. It's very Fat, and Eats like Marrow, being an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Supper for a <hi>Bride-groom,</hi> or good Food for that unhappy Man who
has Marry'd a Wife much Younger than himself: Of their Furr, mix'd

                  <p>These are very numerous in <hi>New-England.</hi> They are the colour of a
Grey <hi>Rabbit;</hi> something less than a <hi>Fox,</hi> having much the same Scent,
but not so strong. This is the Creature reported to hunt the <hi>Lyons</hi> prey,
which make some suspect there are <hi>Lyons,</hi> but there never was but one
seen as we have any account of; and that was shot by an <hi>Indian,</hi> with
Bow and Arrow, Sixty Years ago, as he lay Dormant upon the Body of
an Oak, by a <hi>Hurricane</hi> blown up by the Roots. The <hi>Iackall</hi> is sometimes
Eaten by the <hi>Indians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wolves there are abundance, of two sorts, one like a <hi>Mungril,</hi> which
kills <hi>Goats, Sheep,</hi> &amp;c. And the other shap'd like a <hi>Grey-hound,</hi> which
preys upon <hi>Deer.</hi> They are very shy and difficult to be Shot or Trap'd.
Their manner of distroying them, being by four <hi>Maycril-hooks,</hi> which
they bind together, with their Beards revers'd, then hide them with a
Ball of Tallow, and tie it to the Carkass of any thing they have just kill'd,
from which you have scar'd them, and when he comes to make up his
Meale, being a lover of Fat, he certainly takes your Bait, and becomes
your Prisoner.</p>
                  <p>Besides what I have above mentioned, they have a great deal of good

                  <p>They acknowledge a God, whom they Worship for his Benefits. They believe a

                  <p>Upon the breaking out of a War, or such extraordinary Occasions, as the old

they may be sure to have their Bellies full. When they get <hi>Drunk</hi> they are very
Mischievous one to another: But are never known to offer any Indignity to their
