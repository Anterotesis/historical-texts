            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE outward ornaments of Youth are
Beauty, Tallness, and Strength of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but Grace and Wisdom are the ornaments of
the Soul and Mind: But Beauty without
Grace, is but like a fair sign that hangeth at the
door of a foul house; and Witt without Grace,
is but like meat that tasteth sweet in the mouth,
and breedeth ill blood in the Veins: and bodily
strength, and comliness of Stature without
Grace, it is but like so much Moss upon the body
of a Tree, when there is no fruit upon the boughs.
<hi>Absalom</hi> had a fair body, and a defiled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<hi>St. Augustin</hi> receiving a witty Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
from <hi>Licentius,</hi> a young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Man,<note place="margin">August. <hi>Epist. ad</hi> Licent.</note> and perceiving he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
it too loosely, returneth this
answer to him. If thou hadst found
a Golden Cup, wouldst thou not have
given it to some Publick use? God hath given
thee a Golden Witt, a Soul of Gold, and yet thou
usest it an Instrument of Sensuality; take
<pb facs="tcp:32977:4"/>
heed of making it a vessel of abomination, and
of presenting thy Soul as a Sacrifice to Satan,
<hi>Diabolus cupit a te ornari,</hi> the Devil desireth
to make thee an ornament to him, and thy witt
and parts, the credit of his Court and Cause:
Young Men many times have sharp Witts, but
as the fire, in green wood is smothered by the
vapours, that it cannot shine brightly; so holy
Wisdom in youth is often smothered by Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Concupisences.</p>
                  <p>Naturalists say, That the <hi>Butterfly</hi> spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the most part of her Life in painting of her
Wings, so do many young men in guilding of
their Brains. Youth is, (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word
signifieth) the choice age of a Mans
Life:<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> and a young Man is called, a
choice or chosen one. 1. Because a
Young man was rather chosen than an Old,
chosen to most employments of action, and Youth
is the time which a man would chose to live in.
2. Because youth is a time wherein a Man is to
chuse what course to take, and it is the choicest
time for the service of God. <hi>Remember thy
Creatour in the daies of thy youth,</hi> or of thy
choice, saith <hi>Solomon.</hi> That is, in such daies,
as either thou wouldest chuse, or else, such daies
wherein thou art best able to make thy choice;
then are we called upon to remember God.
Take it in that double variation. 1. In such
<pb facs="tcp:32977:4"/>
daies, as a man would chuse, whilst things yet
go well with him, before the evil daies come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Flourishing Youth and true Devotion, are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
companions: Youth, (unless sanctified) is
full of vanity, serious in trifles, and trifling
in serious things. Or, 2. In such dayes as we
are yet able to make our choice, Death bed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
proveth but little worth; then do we rather
dream of God, than indeed do remember him.</p>
                  <p>Good reason it is that the Young Man should
remember his Creatous. 1. Because uncertain
of the future of his own life, uncertain whether
he shall ever live to old age; a Soul should not be
hazarded upon such uncertainties. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the young man commonly forgetteth God,
is most tempted by Satan, most violently hurried
away with Passions. Youth is full of folly,
falsehood, frowardness, of high conceits of their
own worth and sufficiency; full of inordinate
and excessive love of liberty; full of wantonness,
it is carried with strong affections upon weak
grounds; it is stubborn, impatient of counsels,
and just reproofs, <hi>Jerem. 31. 18, 19.</hi> It is
given to Prodigallity, <hi>Luke 15. 12, 13.</hi> It is
impudent and shameless, addicted to sensuality.
It is the Emblem of a Young Man, to have a
wing on one Arm, as if he had a desire to fly up
to Heaven: but a clog on the other arm, to shew
how the vanities and pleasures of the World do
<pb facs="tcp:32977:5"/>
clog his desires of Heaven. 3. Or it may be Young
Menare called upon to remember God, because
riper age is furnished with most abilities; a strong
body, a pliable mind, a riper judgment, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
free: Religion is not of so easie a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
but it will ask a man his best. Or 4.
it may be, what is gotten in Youth, sticks fastest
by us, as a Vessel retaineth a long time, that
odour where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>with at first it was seasoned. God's
service should never be given over, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
learned betimes. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> would
have young Men stand before him, the King of
Heaven much more. Thy Creatour will not
highly value thee, unless thou hast been bred
up in his presence even from thy youth.</p>
                  <p>It is a most commendable thing for Young
Men to be couragious, and resolute in resisting
Sin. Some <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> have been

                     </hi> thus speaking. I
was a <hi>Gentile, (saith she)</hi> bred in the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an age, where vertue was declining,
and vice on the top of the Wheel: I was endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an excellent Beauty, which by right of
natural force gave me the key of Hearts; and
I seeing it was too much affected, courted by
wanton eyes, and served for a stumbling-block
to chastity; I purposely made scars in my face,
extinguishing with my Blood the flames of those
that sought me; for I loved better to seal my
innocence, as, with the seal of voluntary defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
than to possess a Beauty that served only
as a bait for anothers Lust. How may this
give a check to the vanity of those women a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, who in their youth paint themselves
with an ill intention, seeking to gain that by
Imposture, which they cannot gain by truth?
and not satisfying themselves by adulterating
their Beauty, spare not to discover in their
Breasts and Faces the Impudence of their
<pb facs="tcp:32977:6"/>
Fore-heads. Oh! what will such with all their
curiosity, answer to this <hi>Paynim,</hi> when her
Blood and Scars, her Beauty disfigured, which
served as a Sacrifice to her Chastity, shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
them before the Tribunal of Christ!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cassian</hi> commendeth a Christian young
Man, who having renounced worldly vanities,
and betaken himself to an austere kind of Life,
having received a packet of Letters from his
Father, and diverse of his dear
Friends,<note place="margin">Cassian <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit.</hi> Lib. 5. ca. 32.</note> he durst not look upon
them but threw them into the fire
with these words: Be gone ye

burn for company, for fear lest ye tempt me to
look again toward the things which I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken:
He feared (as the story saith,) that
by the reading of their lines, and the sight of
their Names, he should have been perswaded,
to warp towards their Company, and the
vanities of the world again.</p>
                  <p>Oh how ought all young men, that have had
good education, to take heed how they abuse it,
and the many instrumental means which God
hath granted them for the exercise of vertue;
otherwise they shall pay the loss thereof in the
length of a corrupt and miserable Life, and
their bones in old age, shall be filled with the

much evil in the time of youth, adding sin to
sin: but (as one saith) youthful sins may prove
ages terrours. Many prophane young men that
drink and quaffe, play and make sport, and
further one another in sin, what do they therin,
but as <hi>Abner</hi> said to <hi>Joab,</hi> 2 Sam. 14. <hi>Let
the young men arise, and play before us?</hi>
Observe what play this was. <hi>Then there arose
and went over Twelve Men of</hi> Benjamin,
<hi>which pertained to</hi> Ishbosheth, <hi>the Son of</hi>
Saul; <hi>and Twelve of the Servants of</hi> David,
<hi>and they caught every one his fellow by the
head, and thrust his Sword into his fellows
side; so they fell down together.</hi> This was
their play. So it is with young men many-times,
when they come into company, by their licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness,
and drawing one another to sin, what
do they but take the Sword, and thrust into one
anothers bowels? and Labour (what in them
lieth) to destroy each other for ever?</p>
                  <p>Oh how careful should Parents be, in the
well nutring and educating of their Children,
who are not only the living goods, but also
pieces of their Parents? In <hi>Athens</hi> it was a
custom, never to pole their Children till they
were taught, and then to burn their hair, as a
<pb facs="tcp:32977:7"/>
Sacrifice to <hi>Apollo.</hi> How should Parents
take heed of cockering their Children in sinful
wayes: Indulgence of Parents, is the refuge
of Vanity, the bawd of Wickedness, and the bane
of Children. Look well to it ye Parents,
(saith <hi>St. Hierome</hi>) That your Children ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse
not in the cups of <hi>Babilon.</hi> The Sin
and evil examples of Parents, is like rust
which cleaveth close to their Children, and the
greater they are upon Earth, so much the more
malice and precipitation it hath; such children
will one day complain at the Tribunal
of God,<note place="margin">

God will make this day, a Theatre of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy;

                  <p>Memorable is that story of <hi>Polycarp,</hi> that
constant Martyr of Christ, and Disciple of
<hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> as he was brought to the
fire to be burnt, the <hi>Proconsul</hi> having most
earnestly solicited him to recant, and renounce
his Faith with promise of liberty, I have (said
he) these Fourscore and six years served Jesus
<pb facs="tcp:32977:8"/>
Christ, and I ever found him a good Master;
therefore, I will not now Blaspheme my King
and Lord; I will never do it. Many other
words of admirable constancy and fortitude
were uttered, then by this old Disciple, and
faithful Martyr of Jesus Christ, which made
him regardless of his Life, and resolutely to
suffer Death for his Name.</p>
                  <p>Let none of us then offer the blind and the
lame in sacrifice to God, nor offer that to him,
which we would not offer to our Prince, <hi>Mal. 1.
7. 8.</hi> This were to make God's Service a Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-House
or Hospital, to maintain us in our
age, when we have spent our strength in the
service of Sin and Satan. This is not to leave
sin, till sin leve us. What Noble Man would
be willing to give entertainment to an old serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man,
that hath spent his strength in the
service of his Enemy? Why then should we
think, that having given the flower of our
youth to the Devil, that God will accept of the
bran of our old age? Therefore every one
like young <hi>Timothies,</hi> and <hi>Josia's</hi> should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to serve God betimes: and all parents
should present their Children to God betimes,
even as <hi>Samuel,</hi> whom his Mother offered to the
Lord very young, who ministred before the
Lord in his side-coates. Youth is not only more
capable, but more curable than old age, If sin
<pb facs="tcp:32977:8"/>
get hold of youth, it is more easily cured in youth,
than in men that are old; as a green wound
is more easily healed, than an old festered sore,
which hath dead flesh in it. A man may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
aswel give Physick to a dead man, as

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>sel to many an old man. If sin grow to an
habit and custom, custom being another nature,
makes it as ordinary to men as to eat and drink.
But if any of us have spent the flower of our
youth in vice and vanity; Let the fruit of our
age only savour of vertue. Indeed an old man
of youthful behaviour, is more ridiculous
than a wanton toying young man: Let every
man then (especially old men) put their houses
in order and prepare for Death: when Death
is between their teeth, it is too late to provide
remedies for the Terrours thereof.</p>

Youth; both shewing, that younger
men are the choycest of men, or should be so;

                        <p>2. That young men ought especially to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
their Creatour.</p>
                        <p>The first of these is certainly implyed; the
second plainly expressed in the words of
the Text.</p>
                        <p>Of the first; the wise man seemeth of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to have deferred this <hi>Memento</hi> until the
latter end of his discourse, as knowing how
apt the younger sort are to fail in this art of
memory, concerning the best things; and
hoping that of all others, a speech of fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
would make some notable impression.</p>
                        <p>In this point I will shew. 1. Wherein this
forgetfulnes consisteth. 2. I will prove it to
be, especially incident to youth. 3. I will
shew the reasons or causes of it.</p>
                        <p>I. Now for the first, that I may shew
wherein forgetfulness consisteth; both reason
and our own experience in the working of the
powers of our Souls, shew us, That memory
is properly seated in the brain; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32977:13"/>
that forgetfulness, is a kind of emptiness
in the same place. But we must attend to
those Idiomes of the Holy Ghost, who by
reason of that, near knitting of all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Soul in one single root of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and Intellectual Being, doth promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
translate the name of the one to the
other, and oftentimes include all in one. <hi>Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God</hi> (saith our Saviour)
<hi>with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Math. 22. 37.</hi> Why? All the powers of
the Soul are not love: There is knowledge,
memory, imagination, will, fear, joy, sorrow,
hatred, courage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are all distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
both in their Beings, and Effects from
Love. But He, in whom all the Treasures
of Wisdom were hid, knew well, that when
the heart by love did truly close with God,
and cleave unto him, it could not leave any
of its effections behind it, but all must be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up unto him.</p>
                        <p>The Lord complaineth, <hi>Isa. 1. 3. Israel
doth not know, my people do not consider.</hi> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
was not the only sin, whereof the Lord
held them guilty: but in this was included,
as well want of love, of fear, of delight in
God, as of knowledge of him. Not to go
too far about; This forgetfulness which now
we have in hand, you shall find to have the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32977:13"/>
same force in the Scripture. <hi>Psal. 137. If I
forget thee O Jerusalem, let my right-hand for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
her cunning.</hi> ver. 6. <hi>If I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thee, let my Tongue cleave to the roof of my
mouth, &amp;c.</hi> The course of the words shew
manifestly, that it was not simply to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
this City and Temple which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took,
but to be deeply affected with its cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;
for he preferred <hi>Jerusalem</hi> above his
chiefest joy.</p>
                        <p>But most plainly doth <hi>Moses</hi> expound this
word unto us, <hi>Deut. 8.</hi> ver. 11. <hi>Beware that
thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping
his Commandements, and his Judgments, and
his Statutes, which I command thee this day.</hi>
Where to forget, is as well not to embrace in
affection, and not to observe in practice, as
not to keep in memory. Many other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
we have of like nature, in <hi>Psal. 119.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
many other Texts of Scripture. So that
in a word, Forgetfulness of God, is a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing,
declining, and turning aside of the
Heart and Soul from God, upon Earthly
things, manifested in a course of neglecting
God's Service and his Commandements, and
running after the vanities of this life.</p>

the younger sort, I wish the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
experience of all times, and of this espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
did not too much ease me of the labour
in proving; yet something must be said for it
according to promise. The wise man in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth the impudency of a graceless Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
sheweth, that young men are especially
apt to forget God, and to be ensnared by
her, <hi>Prov. 7. 6, 7. At the window of my house
I looked through my casement, and behold
among the simple ones, I discerned among the
youths, a young man void of understanding,
passing through the street near her corner, and
he went the way to her house, &amp;c.</hi> These are
the men, who in the pride of their youth, and
heath of their Blood, value their own witts at
an high rate, and think themselves the wisest
in the Countrey, despise the dulness of elder
years, and more setled spirits; as if wisdom
were born, and should dye with them: Yet
here ye may see, how the wisest of men doth
censure them for <hi>fools, simple ones, void of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;</hi>
men especially forgetful of God,
of his Word, and Will: such a one was seen
going toward the house of a strange Woman,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32977:14"/>
toward a Whore-house: and such are some
Ale-houses frequented so much by young
men; for I know none so fit to keep a Stews,
as those who professedly without regard of
Magistracy, Ministry, Credit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do keep
common shops for Drunkenness. But mark
the Wisdom of our young man, 21. 22, 23.
<hi>With much fair speech she caused him to yield,

he giveth us an excellent description of the
brutish and sensual forgetfulness of the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
sort, minding present things with the full
bent of their Souls, and never seriously look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards the things that are above. But
what is the issue? <hi>but know thou, that for all

                        <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
                        <p>III. IN the next place I am to shew the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of this forgetfulness in the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
sort, and here it were but an idle piece of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32977:15"/>
Philosophy to ascribe it to the natural moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
and fluid temper of their brains, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the impressions of things are presently
dissolved, like letters written in the water.
No; this forgetfulness is as well in the heart
as in the brain, and requireth a further search
into it's causes.</p>
                        <p>1. In the first place then, one special cause
is, a fleshly confidence in the natural strength
of body, and hope of long life. They look
at Death as a thing afar off, even out of sight;
and therefore suffer not the apprehension of it
to make any such impression upon them, as in
any degree to lessen that carnal, sensual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
which they take in the glut of earthly
Vanities. The blind Worldling, when his
barnes were full, blessed himself in his own
conceited happiness; <hi>Soul take thine ease,
thou hast goods laid up for many years.</hi> But
these persons think they have the advantage
of him; for whereas his Soul that night was
to be taken from his goods; they think they
have life in store for many years, an so with
the unfaithful servant conclude, that their
Master will defer his coming, and they may
safely delay their Repentance, and put him
out of their remembrance. As <hi>Gaal,</hi> and the
men of <hi>Shechem,</hi> could eat and drink, and
curse <hi>Abimilech,</hi> because they thought he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32977:16"/>
was not near them, though he was nearer
than they were aware: so the younger sort
can satisfy their lusts, and please themselves,
and do what they will, scorning all admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or threatnings of Death; because they
think it not neer unto them: Whereas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Death (as the punishment of Sin) lyeth
at their door, and will be found to have way-laid
them in the midst of their vanities; and
to cut them off in the midst of their strength
and sins. Strength, Health, abundance of
Spirits, freedom from aches, pains, and bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distempers, do put Death out of their
thoughts, and they will leave crooked and
way-ward old age to vex it self with pensive
remembrances of the Grave.</p>
                        <p>2. The lively vigour of youth, filleth
them with a kind of carnal self-content, and
maketh them please themselves in themselves,
and so to feel no need they have of happiness,
and of delighting themselves in the Lord; and
therefore to neglect and forget their Creatour.
Oh they think they are absolute men, they are
as they desire to be, and cannot wish to be
better; their blood hath free passage in their
veins, their Spirits in their Arteries without
obstructions, they are lively, amiable, merry,
jovial, free from wants, fears, sorrows, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:
and (as <hi>Job</hi> describeth the young gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallant)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32977:16"/>
                           <hi>His Breasts are full of milk, and his
Bones are mositned with marrow:</hi> thy are
wholly at ease and quiet, and therefore God
is not in all their thoughts.</p>
                        <p>3. This lusty youthful temper makes them
every way more sensible, and capable of
earthly delights, and pleasures, and so more
apt to forget their Creatour and his service.
Old <hi>Barzillai</hi> knew not what to do at Court,
<hi>2 Sam. 19. 35. I am this day Four score years
old, and can I discorn between good and evil?
Can thy servant</hi> (saith he to King <hi>David)
Taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear
any more the voice of singing men and singing
women? wherefore then should thy servant be
yet a burthen unto my Lord the King?</hi> Old
Age is not sensible, nor capable of many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
which younger persons take in with
greediness. No carnal pleasure but it suiteth
with their dispositions, they have a temper fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to all fleshly delights, and so can please
their wanton appetites with variety of dishes;
that is, their diverse lusts with variety of flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delights, and in this case, no wonder though
they forget their Creatour, when by reason of
the constitution of their bodies peculiar to that
age, they can so many wayes please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Creature. Men naturally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
God, untill they need him: But the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32977:17"/>
young man in his prime, finding so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in the earth, which ministreth matter of
contentment to him, apprehendeth no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
need of him that made him, and so mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him not, unless the Lord open his eyes,
and cause him to see the emptiness and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of these things, and his own miserable fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in resting his Soul upon them.</p>
                        <p>4. A Fourth cause is, want of experience
in the uncertain condition of earthly things.
Young Men are in the Spring of their lives
and pleasures, and know not yet what a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
meaneth. They have not yet (for the
most part) been beaten off from their pleasing
folly by any notable change of estate; they
know not what sorrow meaneth, and so they
securely promise themselves a continuance of
this seeming happiness, and forget God; as
not perceiving any special need of him. They
hope to speed as well as they have done, and
so long they care not. Those crosses which
sometime befall the younger sort, may for the
present make them exceeding passionate, but
they are soon vanished, and no print of their
foot-steps remaineth behind them; their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
are after a while, never awhit embitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by them: and thus forgetting their crosses,
they become forgetful of their God, and that
account which must be rendred to him: you
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32977:17"/>
see how easie it is for youth, to spin a snare
wherein to entangle it self, even out of its
own bowels,</p>

                        <p>BUt left this should not hold them fast
enough, <hi>Satan</hi> hath other instruments
to help twist the threds; many wicked
wretches there are in the world, who help
them forward in their misery.</p>
                        <p>1. Want of care, and conscience in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
not obeying the charge of the Apostle,
which is to <hi>bring up their Children in the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and admonition of the Lord,</hi> Ephes. 6. 4.
Not imitating the Father of the Faithful in
the fruits of his Faith, <hi>Gen. 18. 19. In
commanding their Children, and houshold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, that they may keep the way of the
Lord, to do Judgment and Justice:</hi> Not tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>to teach their Children in the trade wherein
they should go,</hi> and giveth an hopeful promise
for encouragement, <hi>That they will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from it when they are old,</hi> Prov. 22, 6.
Not looking with a single eye, at the glory of
God, nor with a tender eye, on the poor souls
of their Children; to whom deriving mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
from their own Loyns, they take no care
to cure them of it.</p>
                        <p>2. The evil examples which even Parents
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32977:18"/>
themselves give unto their Children, many of
them in their ripest, yea in their rotten years,
returning to the sins of youth, or (at least)
glorifying in them, even in the hearing of their
Children. How many young men are Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
Swearers, Unclean Persons, Scoffers at
Holiness, Contemners of the Word even by
Succession and Inheritance? The Son hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Father Swear, he heareth him use fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
communication; he seeth the old Beast
come home Drunken, and who can wonder,
though he forgeteth his Creatour, whom he
hath not seen, whiles he findeth such wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in his Father whom he daily seeth? or
if they scorn such boys-play, yet many times
by that aged Sin of Covetousness, they
shewing themselves dead-hearted towards
God, cold, careless in his services, not fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
and zealously mindful of his glory,
teach their Children to forget him that made
them, though they differ in those things,
which they embrace. The very example of
a coveous Father, may make a Son riotous,
by teaching him to fall off from God; and then
his heart will cleave to that which is most su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itable
to it. The Father's example setteth
him out of the right way; and his own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
lusts, and distempered passions carrying
him in such a by-path, as best fiteth his own
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32977:18"/>
foot; whereas, many times the Father is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased,
not because it is a wrong way, but
because it is not his own; not because it is
contrary to the wayes of God, but because it
crosseth his wayes: no because it is more
sinful, but more chargeable than his own
course, which is most pleasing to him.</p>
                        <p>3. The neglect of Religious duties in the
Fathers Family, is the ready way to make the
Son unmindful of him that made him.
When Christ hath no Church, but Mammon
hath his Chappel in the house; when there
is no serious remembrance of God from one
end of the year to the other in effectual
prayers, in constant reading of the Word,
in whetting it on (as <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh) by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions,
pious and seasonable admonitions,
when the Lord hath no entertainment there,
it is no marvel to find the younger sort for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful
of God.</p>

                           <hi>Observ.</hi> That young men ought especially,
to <hi>Remember their Creatour in the daies of
their youth.</hi> What it is to remember, (in the
language of the holy Ghost) you may gather
by that which I spake of the contrary, in
opening the former point; where I shewed
you, That this remembrance is not only of the
brain, but of the heart, together with the
head, implying affections as well as memory,
and such as are powerful, Manifesting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in answerable Practices. So that, as
to forget God, is a with-drawing, declining,
and turning the heart aside from God; so
to remember God, is a cleaving of the heart
to him in love, whereby all the Powers of
the Soul are given up to him, waiting upon
his Will in an holy attendance upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
of his Word, readily practising what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he commandeth, and carefully shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whatsoever he forbideth. We read
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32977:23"/>
                           <hi>Num.</hi> 15. 38, 39, 40. That the Lord would
have the people of <hi>Israel</hi> to have fringes
on their Garments, that they might remember
his Commandments: but not barely to keep
them in their memories, but (saith he). <hi>That
ye may remember, and do all my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and be holy unto your God.</hi> An effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
remembrance that should work upon the
affections, and make them holy, that should
shape them out an holy course of Life, and
make them do all that the Lord had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
This doth the Scripture in speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
manner require of young men. <hi>Psal. 119.

his way? by taking heed thereto, according
to thy Word.</hi>

                        <p>THis Point may be made more plain by
Reasons.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reason 1.</hi> The former Point shall be a
Reason of this: Young Men are especially
apt to forget their Maker; and therefore,
young Men ought to be especially careful to
remember him. The greater defect there is
in any, the greater care is required in supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that defect. The stronger inclination
there is to any sin, the greater watchfulness
there ought to be in resisting and subduing
that sin. The more unapt and sluggish we
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32977:23"/>
are towards any duty, the more careful should
we be to quicken and encourage our selves to
that duty. The weakest parts of a City have
special need of guarding. Men that have
but weak memories, and have much dealings
in the World, are so much the more careful
to use their Pens, and commit such things to
books and memorials; with which, if they
should trust their memories, they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them. So especially in heavenly things;
the more apt young Men are to forget their
Creatour, the more careful should they be to
remember their Maker, because their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are violent; because they are apt to be
blinded with a fleshly confidence in youth
and strength of body: because they are apt
to doate with a carnal complacency upon the
natural vigour of their youthful temper; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are more capable of carnal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
than the elder sort: because there are
so many snares laid for them, above others;
by all which means, they are apt to lose the
best and happiest use of their memories, and
to live in a sensual forgetfulness of, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of their God, and Creatour: therefore,
should they with a double care and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
endeavour to stirr up their hearts to a
conscionable, and affectionate remembrance
of their Maker.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="28" facs="tcp:32977:24"/>
2. We may also gather a reason from the
second word in my Text.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>[Now] Remember now &amp;c.</hi> which noreth
a special excellency of this time above others.
As if he had said; Now is the chief time
wherein thou mayst do God best Service,
So then young men ought especially, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
their Creatour, because, <hi>Now</hi> in
their young daies, is the chiefest and choyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
time, wherein they may glorifie their
God, and do him acceptable Service. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
now,</hi> while sin is but budding, whiles cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
are but twiggs, while lust is but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving;
while passion and anger is but a
green wound, not festered and turned into a
setled and cankered malice, and revengeful
disposition. <hi>Now,</hi> whiles thy senses are quick,
thy spirits lively, thy temper healthy, thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
strong; while thy blood is warm, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part is fit for that imployment, for which
it was ordained. <hi>Now,</hi> shew they self mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of thy Creatour, careful of his service,
respectful of his Glory. <hi>Now,</hi> thou canst
do something for him, <hi>Now,</hi> is the time
wherein thou art able, and therefore <hi>Now</hi>
especially thou must remember him.</p>
                        <p>3. This word <hi>[Now]</hi> may seem to imply
somewhat more, <hi>viz.</hi> That this which is here
required must be done, now or never. True
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32977:24"/>
it is, some few may be converted in their
elder years, who in their youth, were forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of their Maker; but ye must observe, that
here the Lord requireth of every one, that
he should give up the strength, the morning,
the freshest and principal part of his life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and his service. <hi>Now,</hi> this can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be done but in youth; and he that spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his youth in sin and impenitency, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perform this work; he can never give up
his strength, and the best of his time to God.
The Lord saith, <hi>Remember ye keep holy the
Sabbath day;</hi> this should be presently done
without delay; but yet, some who have been
careless prophaners of the Lords day, have
afterwards been conscionable observers of it.
But when the Lord saith, <hi>Remember your
Creatour in youth,</hi> this cannot be done but in
youth. He that spendeth his youth in impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency
and ungodliness, can never afterwards
give up his youth, and the strength thereof
unto God. Under the Law, the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the best of the Flock for Sacrifice;
<hi>Now,</hi> he that should sell or kill all the best,
and leave none but the old, the starveling, the
blind, the lame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That man could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
obey the Commandment; so when the
Lord biddeth us to remember to give up our
youth to him; if we spend this and our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32977:25"/>
strength in sin, we can never obey this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
for that time and strength is gone,
and our importent time, crazy, drowsy old age
is left.</p>
                        <p>4. From this Word <hi>[Creatour]</hi> God made
all things for his glory, and the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
any Creature is, either in regard of its
specifical nature or kind, or in regard of its
particular qualities and excellencies, the more
is it tyed to glorify God that made it such.
So among all earthly Creatures, Man being
made of the most excellent nature, is most
straitly tyed to glorify God the <hi>Creatour.</hi> And
among Men, such as are in their youth and
strength, being endowed with the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
abilities, ought more especially to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
him.</p>
                        <p>5. Consider these Words, <hi>[Thy Creatour]</hi>
God is the <hi>Creatour</hi> of young Men, as young
Men. He did nor only give thee the being of
a Man, but the years, the life, the health, the
strength, the vigour of a young Man. He is
the Author of thy youth, the <hi>Creatour</hi> of thy
strength, he is thy Creatour in special; he
hath now <hi>Created</hi> that strength, and ability in
thee, which he hath not yet <hi>Created</hi> in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that which he hath taken from old Men.
Thou hast that work of his now wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>ing it self in thee, which is not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32977:25"/>
in others; and therefore, <hi>Remember thy Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour,</hi>
that hath Created that hot Blood, that
warmeth thy heart, that quickness of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
and those lively Spirits that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thee.</p>
                        <p>6. Consider these Words <hi>[In the dayes of
thy youth,]</hi> daies and not years, daies and not
nights. Thy youth is but a few <hi>May-daies,</hi>
it will presently be gone; and therefore in
those few daies, that short time, thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
give up thy self to thy <hi>Creatour. Could not
ye Watch with me one hour?</hi> a just reproof of
our Saviour to his sleepy Disciples. Could ye
not afford me a few daies? a just reproof of
all silly souls, who are not wise unto Salvation,
and think their youth too good, too much to
be given up to God. It is not three hundred
years that the Lord asketh at thy hands, as at
<hi>Henoch</hi>'s; nor Nine hundred and upwards, as
he required of other <hi>Patriaches,</hi> but a few
daies of youth. <hi>Dai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>â€¢</desc>
                              </gap>s,</hi> and not Nights.]
The times of youth, consist of <hi>Daies;</hi> then is
the Sun-shine, the Night follow, dark times
of old age; aches, weakness, sickness, sleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Now because these are <hi>Daies,</hi> they
must be given up to God, who is <hi>Light;</hi> and
not to the Devil, who is the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
not to sins, which are works of
Darkness. This is gross folly to give the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:32977:26"/>
Days of youth to Satan, and to leave the
dimme evening of our old declining age to
God; to give the good, the best daies to Satan,
and the evil daies (as they are called after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards)
yea the worst to God.</p>

young, yet could he get no release of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
but he goeth away with a sad and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful

Saviour to every young Man; sell all that
thou hast: do away thy Lusts, put away thy
Drunkenness, cast off Lying, Swearing, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Pride, Vanities, and follow me. The
way of Christ is the strictest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>

will have young Men follow him, and keep

their feet in the narrow way which he hath
gone before, and tread in his steps. I hope
none will be so Blasphemous, as to say, that
Christ did take this licentious course, which
young Men think they may take. Well then
if thou wilt enter into life, thou must follow
him, and go in that narrow path wherein he
walked. It is to be observed, that Christ
was young, and dyed young; therefore if
ye that are young, look for Salvation by
him, ye must follow him, in those waies of
his youth. All those good works, all that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whereby he fulfilled all righteousness,
these were the practises of his youth; if then
ye will have him for your Saviour, who walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thus in his youth, ye must follow him in
your youth. Christ went about doing good,
and thinkest thou, that thou maist go about
doing evil, that thou maist run about hunting
after idle meetings, and ill company because
thou art young, and in the flower of thy
youth? No, Christ was young, when he
went about doing good, <hi>Act. 10. 38.</hi> And
therefore if thou takest liberty to go about
doing evil, because thou art young, thou art
no Disciple of Christ.</p>

to God. <hi>Levit. 23. 10.â€”14.</hi> And they
might eat no bread until the Lord had the
First-Fruits offered unto him. So that he
who should presume to eat any of his Corn,
before the Lord had his portion, even a
sheaf of the first-fruits, he was no better
than a Sacrilegious intruder upon the Lord's
Possession. So the Lord requireth of thee,
O young Man! the first-Fruits of thy Life,
even thy youth and strength; and if thou dost

                        <p>2. Consider that God loveth cheerfulness
in his services; so many places of Scripture
shew. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will run
the wayes of thy Commandments;</hi> saith <hi>David,
Quicken me O Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Now youth is the
most cheerful part of a mans Life, then the
heart is in the liveliest temper, then the spirits
are freshest, and quickest; and natural
cheerfulness being Sanctified, is a furtherance
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:32977:30"/>
of spiritual joy. The quickness of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
temper (which is in youth most vigorous,)
is a good servant to quickning grace. Think
not, that God is best pleased with the lumpish
old age, which many times is little more than
a dead piece of Earth, with a little portion,
a small remainder of life abiding in it. God

a Man did burn the prime of his Beast in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
it was accepted: yea, when it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
consumed, even the remainders that
were half burnt, did yield a sweet savour to
the Lord: because the best was burnt also
upon the Altar of the Lord. So let a Man
consecrate the prime of his daies, his youth
to the Lord; offer up this as a living Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and then, even his worn old age, which
is like a Sacrifice half burnt and spent, shall
be exceeding sweet and pleasing to the Lord,
because the best was given up unto him:
whereas on the other side, should any of the
Priests have burned a Sacrifice upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
of <hi>Baal,</hi> and then when it was half burnt
should have brought the gleanings and laid
them upon the Altar of the Lord, this would
have been a grievous abomination in the sight
of the Lord. So in this case, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh then,
<hi>Remember thy Creatour in thy youth,</hi> lest he

him in thy youth, that thy hoar head may

so may be a Crown of Glory, and not a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Reproach and Contempt unto thee.</p>
                        <p>3. Consider especially, the unspeakable
danger of Sin, confirmed and rooted with
time; wrought and wreathed into the heart,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:32977:32"/>
and clasped in the affections, by long custom
in sin. Oh when sin hath been thirty or forty
years in growing, and taking root, it cleaveth
like the skin to the bones; like the Leprosy
that was rooted in a wall, which could not
be taken away, untill the wall were pulled
down. That sin which is in growing the
whole time of a Mans youth, during the
best of his strength, it is even a Wonder, if
it doth not accompany that Man to his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
yea, to the Judgment-seat of God. I
know, the mercy of God is infinite, and he
calleth at the Eleventh hour: but I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
those are very few which are so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
and especially very few, (if any) of
those who have had the means of Grace in
their youth, and regarded them not. Oh
this willful hardning of the heart is dreadful.
This continuing in sin against knowledge;
this with-holding the truth in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
moveth the Lord to give men over to a
Reprobate sence; <hi>Rom. 1. 21, 24, 25, 28.</hi>
Into such a state, that he becometh uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
unteachable; that neither blessings, nor
crosses; neither the Rod, nor the Word;
neither sickness, nor health; neither gray
haris, nor the approach of Death, can work
him to to sound Conversion. Ah poor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
Soul! such a one may come to say

with <hi>Saul, God hath forsaken me!</hi> A speech,

ye to season the very Child-hood of your
Sons and Daughters with the true knowledg
and fear of God; pray over them daily, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct,
exhort, rebuke, and use all good means,
that the prime of their daies may be given up
to God: Teach them to Remember their
Creatour in their Childhood, that they may
neither forget him in their youth, nor forsake
him in their old age. I fear that most Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
among us, by neglecting their Duty
herein; are guilty of their Childrens De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
                        <p>2. To the Aged: Ye that are grown old,
and have not remembred your Creatour in
your younger daies, whose bones are full of
the sins of your youth; Oh know that your
case is exceeding dangerous! therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
your lives, whereby ye have so much
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:32977:33"/>
dishonoured your Maker: humble and judge
your selves in the bitterness of your Souls;
cry continually, and importunately in the
ears of the Lord, that (if it be possible) the
sins of your youth, and the long continued
wickedness of your Lives, may be forgiven
you, that the often resistance which ye have
made against the spirit of God may be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
if it be possible, that the frequent casting
of the Word of God behind thy back may
be forgiven. Oh how odious and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
is the hoary head, found in the way of
wickedness, in a state of impenitency? What
is an old Drunkard, or Adulterer, a gray-headed
Swearer, an old Covetous World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
an hoary headed impenitent person, but
even a monster among Men? What dost thou
not yet remember thy Creatour? not in old

Oh wreched security! Awake! awake unto
Righteousness, unto Repentance, ye old ones
that sleep in sin, lest ye sleep the sleep of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting

                           <hi>Observ.</hi> That Grace and Holiness are
exceeding fit, and no way unseemly for the
younger sort. Man's Life hath in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
been compared to a Comedy, or Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
Acted upon the Theatre, or Sage of this
World; and the truth is, many a Mans life
is but a Play; and many in their courses do
but act other mens parts, not in sincerity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
their own inward dispositions. And
therefore that <hi>decorum,</hi> which they suppose
may grace them in the eyes of Men, is the
thing they most of all affect and aim at. But
this is Man's misery, that his Eye is now not
single, nor can he rightly discern what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
him; so that many times he shunneth
those things as unseemly, which would be his
greatest ornaments, and goeth about to deck
himself with such things as do but lay open
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:32977:34"/>
his nakedness, and discover his shame. The
Apostle saith, that long hair (which is a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
ornament,) is a Man's shame, <hi>If a
man wear long hair, it is folly and shame to
him, 1 Cor. 11.</hi> And yet many men account
this a special ornament; whereas indeed, it
doth as ill become them, as a Distaff doth; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as ill as a womans Garment. Thus it
is in many other things, disguised fashions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But besides these, there seemeth to be
a conceipt among Men, that a licentious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
an unlimited looseness of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
becometh the younger sort in the daies of
their youth; and that nothing is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly
for that age, than an humble, holy
subjection and obedience to the Gospel of
Jesus Christ. But here ye see the wise Man,
who was a Man that did much affect <hi>decorum,</hi>
whilst he continued in his integrity, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by that which the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi>
observed even to an extasy, <hi>I Kings 10. 4,
5. And when the Queen of</hi> Sheba <hi>had seen
all</hi> Solomon<hi>'s Wisdom, and the House that he
had built, and the Meat of his Table, and the
sitting of his Servants, and the attendance of
his Ministers, and their Apparrel, and his
Cup-bearers, and his Assent by which he went
up to the House of the Lord, there was no
more Spirit in her.</hi> And so ye may gather
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:32977:35"/>
by many passages of his story, how exact he
was in observing <hi>decorum,</hi> and shewing forth
his Royal Magnificence according to his
place.) He I say, that best knew, what was
comely, and seemly for young Men: Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
here, that it is not only good, but seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for them, even in the daies of youth, to
be seriously mindful of their Creatour, and
so in all things to shew themselves as Men,
that have him, and his fear before their
Eyes.</p>
                        <p>For (to omit this, that whatsoever is good
is also comely, being suitable to the holiness
and purity of God, who is most glorious and
beautiful) it is plain here by the opposition
that is made between the daies of youth, and
old age; that he commendeth it to them in
special, as a thing exceeding fit, and seemly
for the younger sort. <hi>Remember thy Creatour
in the daies of thy youth, whilst the evil daies
come not.</hi> As if he had said, It is a most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and unseemly thing, not to be truly
mindful of him that made us in our best
daies, but then to begin, when the evil daies
come. And (if you mark,) it is plain by
those passages that follow, That he still fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens
a notorious absurdity, and unseemliness
upon this carriage of Men who defer till
the last. <hi>The years draw nigh, when thou
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:32977:35"/>
shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.</hi> How
absurd and unseemly then to give up thy self
to God, when thou art weary of thy self;
and not before? while the Sun, or the Moon,
or the Starrs be not Darkned, and the Clouds
return after the Rain. A most absurd thing,
to give all the cleer Sun-shiny daies of youth
to sin, to lose all thy good daies, wasting and
wearing them out in vanity; and then in the
dull, cloudy, rainy times of old age, which
are most unfit for employment, to begin to
serve the Lord; and so in the verses follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
So that it is <gap reason="foreign">

to leave him nothing but the Lame and Blind

Wherewithal shall a young Man cleanse his

comely: Now the <hi>Psalmist</hi> sheweth, that
if they that be young will walk in clean

God, and follow the light of it. Ye know
that a fair clean way is more pleasant and
comely by farr, than a foul, deep, miry way:

and it is more comely for a man to walk in

to learn that wisdom which is from
above. There is no knowledge can so well
become the best witt and understanding, as
the best and most excellent knowledge, and
that is the true saving knowledge of God,
of Christ Crucified, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> esteemed
incomparably better than all his other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
This will beautify the freshest, and most
sparkling witt, it will make the very Spirit
of a Man shine within him. This was young
<hi>Timothy's</hi> ornament. <hi>2 Tim. 3. 15. From
a child thou hast known the holy Scriptures,
which are able to make thee wise unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</hi>
That wisdom must needs beautify a young
Mans mind, which maketh him wise unto
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:32977:38"/>
Salvation, wise for Heaven, which putteth
such a light into him, as is suitable to Heaven
and Everlasting light, which is like the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Saints and Angels above; of
which knowledge St. <hi>Paul.</hi> saith, <hi>2 Cor. 4.
6. God who commanded the light to shine out
of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give
the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
in the face of Jesus Christ.</hi> The Sun-beams
do as it were guild things whereon it shineth,
and make them look bright and pleasant,
whereas they looked dull before without any
such lustre or comeliness. This Heavenly
Knowledge is a shining knowledge, it bright<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>
ens and beautifies the Mind and Soul: and
the more fresh and nimble the witt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is, the more it is adorned by it:
no skill, no knowledge; no learning is so
comly for a young Man, as this true saving
knowledge of God in Christ.</p>
                        <p>II. Hath the young man some strength of
memory? what can become this Treasury
or Store-house so well as Gold, Silver, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious-Stones
(as the Apostle calleth holy
Truths:) what should hay and stubble, trash
and dirt do in so pretious a Cabinet? what is
more unseemly, than to have it filled with
wanton idle Songs, with scurrilous jests, with
airy vain conceits, foolish balla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>s, legenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:32977:38"/>
tales, or the like? that which is fit for
the Dung-hil is not seemly for a Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>III. Is youth full of lively and stirring
affections? what is more seemly than for the
quickest affections, and for the most lively
motions of the Heart and Spirit to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
about Heavenly, and Spiritual things.
The <hi>World</hi> is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                           </gap>, because of
its comliness which God gave it in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
Now God hath thus ordered the
World in its several parts, that the quickest
and nimblest, should be highest in their rank,
and the slowest and dullest, should be lowest.
So the Heavens which are of a most strange
and wonderful swiftness, are highest; and
of other things the quickest in motion are
nearest Heaven; so the Air, and in the Air
the Birds: whereas the Earth being slow,
and without Motion, lyeth below all the
rest, and is farthest from Heaven. So what
is more seemly, than for those winged affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of young Men and Women to mount
up to Heaven, and the quicker and swifter
they are in their Motions, the higher it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
them to fly; what should they do
creeping on the Earth like Snailes, or earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves in the Earth like Moles, or
mudding these lively affections in sinful flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleasures? Why rather should they not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:32977:39"/>
in their daies of youth cast their Souls upon
the wing, earnestly desiring God to draw
them, that they may run after him. Is it a
seemly thing to see a <hi>Lark</hi> or an <hi>Eagle</hi> to
make her self a burrow or nest under ground,
or to plunge her self in the Mud? No, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
her to be aloft: so it becometh not
the winged affections of the younger sort to
bemudd themselves with sinful pleasures,
but to be lifted up in the power of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and to converse with him who is invisible.
The dullness of age hath more affinity with
Earth, than the vigour of youth: which yet
must not perswade old Men to follow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of age, and because their backs are
bowed with years, to think themselves war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
to debase their Souls to earthly
affections, but rather to conceive themselves
directed to look themselves out a burying
place; entring into a serious Meditation of
the Grave, whiles their bodies by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caies
of age, are daily preparing for their
last dissolution, into those first earthly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of which they were compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>IV. And as the quickness of young
Mens affections should thus set them in a
course of holiness; so the quickness of their
Spirits (which is one cause of the quickness
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:32977:39"/>
of their affections) doth exceeding well suit
with true grace and holiness. The Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and (as the Country-word is) the Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
that is in the younger sort is very suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to an holy Conversation. This is one
thing which maketh many men falsely to
think, that Religion is not seemly for youth;
but these are such as know not the power of
godliness, and therefore think it to be a lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
dulling thing. But what blindness is
this to imagine, that the blessed Spirit of
God is a duller to the Spirit of a Man, when
he worketh upon it by his sanctifying power
and vertue! No, it is enough indeed to put
life into a dead heart, when the blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
affordeth his gracious Influence unto it.
If the Sun doth dull and dead the Earth, the
Trees, the Herbs in the Spring-time, then
may ye imagine, that the Spirit of God doth
dull the Spirits of Men by Sanctifying and
Quickening them. It taketh away indeed
their wildness and madness, that is to say,
their untowardness, unseemliness, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comeliness;
but it rather encreaseth and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth
their kindly vigour, and giveth them
yet a greater and an higher life, and maketh
them more lively than before; but with a
sweet, spiritual, and heavenly kind of Life.
It is true, that in the beginnings of grace
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:32977:40"/>
there is some drooping and dejectedness, but
that is but in the turn when they are coming
out of their natural estate from under the
Curse and Wrath of God. But if once they
be indeed set in a course of holiness, and find
the comfort of Gods love in Christ, they
shall find themselves more enlivened and
quickened by the Spirit of God than they can
be by nature only. <hi>Where the Spirit of the
Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> saith the Apostle.
The Spirit of Christ enlargeth the heart,
striketh off the fetters of Corruptions, and
maketh it more free and full of Life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>David</hi> often calleth upon God to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
him. He was a man naturally of a quick
temper, of a fresh lively Spirit, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by that Description given of him. <hi>1 Sam.
16. 12. He was ruddy, and withal of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
countenance, and goodly to look to.</hi> But
he knew, that grace would quicken him
more, and give him a heavenly activity of
Spirit, and therefore desired to be more and
more quickened by it. And how can the
vigour and quickness of youth be better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
than in the work and service of God?
Is not the Service of God a race? And who
are so fit to run, as those who are young, and
of nimble Spirits? <hi>Let us run with patience
the race that is set before us:</hi> and else-where;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32977:40"/>
                           <hi>so run that ye may obtain.</hi> Which as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth,
a winged swiftness, and quickness of
stirring affections in the service of God; so
also a ready diligence, and active chearfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in any work of his, to which the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of old age is a clogging hinderance;
and which doth exceeding well become the
liveliness of youthful Spirits.</p>
                        <p>V. Are young Men strong, and of able
Bodies? What is more comely for them,
than to serve the Lord with all their Strength?
The weakness of the Body, doth even make
the Spirit fail and faint, and hindereth it
many times in the Service of God. Strength
is an help in the worship of God; and the
Spirit in a strong Body, is like a work-man
standing upon firm ground; which is an help
and furtherance in the work.</p>
                        <p>VI. Are they full of courage, and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
as well as strong? They can never with
so much honour follow any other Captain,
as they may fight under the Banner of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, the Prince and Captain of their
Salvation. No Victory so honourable for a
young Man as to kill pride, and lust in
himself, and to get the old red <hi>Dragon</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his feet. To shed an enemies blood,
is no way so honourable, as to Triumph
over <hi>Satans</hi> malice. One Mastiff can tear
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:32977:41"/>
out another's Throat: one Bull can goar
another's side: one desperate person can shed
another's Blood: but where is that glorious
valour in a young Man, that (like <hi>Josuah's</hi>
followers) setteth his feet on the necks of
five Kings of <hi>Canaan</hi> at once, that subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his five Senses, and overcometh all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
that enter in at these? He that can
strongly guard these Cinque-ports, and
stands out against all approaches in his youth,
he is an honourable Souldier of Jesus Christ.
And if he go on, and overcome, He shall
sit down with him in his Throne, as he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
and sate down with his Father in his
Throne, <hi>Rev. 3. 21.</hi> They that fight this
good Fight, may assure themselves, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                           </gap>
Crown of Glory is laid up for them, which
they shall wear, when many renowned Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the World, who have been Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
over their Enemies, Shall lye down
in sorrow and confusion. But as the Apostle
saith concerning Marriage, <hi>If any man think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that he behaveth himself uncomely toward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>â€¢</desc>
                              </gap>
his Virgin, if she passe the flower of her
age, and need so require, let him do what he
will he sinneth not, let them Marry.</hi> 1 Cor.
7. 36. So if any man thinketh that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haveth
himself unseemly toward the courage,
strength, and valour of his Body and Mind;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:32977:41"/>
if he wear out his youth in Peace, and do not
shew himself in the Field, let him know,
that Religion doth not disarme him, if the
Cause be good, and the Warr necessary;
otherwise to fight in Publick Warrs, is no
more honourable, than it is to assault men
on the high-wayes side. And when a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
hath a just Call to fight the Lords Battles,
Religion doth not daunt, but double his
courage. True it is; Religion takes from
him the Sword of Revenge, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him to put it up into its place: it allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him not to answer every desperate
Ruffians Challenge, which is as uncomely for
a wise young man, as it is to fight with every
Dog that barketh at him.</p>
                        <p>VII. Is youth accompanied many times
with health? what is more seemly for him
that is well, than to do well, and to serve him
faithfully who giveth him every hour of
health which he enjoyeth? The sickness and
craziness of old age is many times a great
distraction and discouragement to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God: therefore they are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
who make Repentance the work of
the Sick-bed, and think that the fittest time
for that work.</p>
                        <p>VIII. Is youth enclined to love? Christ
commandeth nothing but love, and that which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:32977:42"/>
love, supposeth and inferreth: only it requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a more noble, divine, and excellent
kind of love, and turneth it upon a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
object, upon which it is better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
than upon the common objects of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
love, <hi>Viz.</hi> upon God the chiefest good,
and upon such things as are subordinate to
him.</p>
                        <p>IX. Is youth disposed to Mirth? Grace
is so farr from depriving it of this, that he
which never felt true Grace, never came
where sound joy was. The heart is filled
with peace and joy in Believing; and <hi>the
peace of God passeth understanding.</hi> Yea, the
Word of God calleth for joy. <hi>Rejoyce in
the Lord; again I say rejoyce.</hi> It bettereth
and encreaseth our mirth, it doth not take it
from us.</p>
                        <p>X. Consider the young man in Relation
to others, and you shall find nothing so
seemly for him as grace and holiness, and a
conformity to the Word of God. Nothing
more comely for a young man than so to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
himself toward his Superiours as the word
of God directeth him. What more seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the younger sort, than to give that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
reverence, respect to Parents, Masters,
Aged People, which the word enjoyneth them?
A proud, undutiful, contemptuous carriage
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:32977:42"/>
in the younger sort towards their betters, doth
worse become them than any deformity or
blemish in the body. A young man is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more out of fashion, than when he is
careless of his duty in this behalf: and again,
never more comely, than when he adorneth
his life with that modesty and dutiful respect
to which true grace directeth younger years.
It is a singular ornament to a young man to be
one of those few which find out, and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
walk in the narrow way in their youthful
daies.</p>

and want of true holiness. Nothing can
worse become such an one, than to forget or
disobey him that made him. No blemish in
the face is so unseemly, as an unruly tongue,
full of vain and idle oathes, full of prophane
swearing, full of cursing and bitterness, full
of wanton, rotten communication, full of

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:32977:43"/>
Age; or as a loose lustful eye which is rove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and wandring after vanity, or an ear
listening after idle tales, and greedily taking
in false reports, such as tend to the undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
disgrace of others. A violent hand, a
stragling foot, they are the blemishes and
reproaches of the younger sort. And what
is Drunkenness, but the shame and stain of
that green and flourishing age? when the witt
in its prime and best time shall be besotted,
and brought to a brutish dotage by the abuse
of Gods good Creatures, and excess of drink,
what is more unnatural and unseemly? The
stupifying of the senses, the faultring of the
feet, are they not the symptoms of old age?
yes. What then is more unseemly for youth,
than to over-burthen it self so with drink,
as to lose for the time its witts and leggs?
Oh do not count this a matter of credit thus
to keep company! this is your shame. The
sin of Whoredom, which is the young Man's
<hi>Zoar,</hi> he counts it a little one, and hither
he would fly for contentment, when the
Word threatneth Fire and Brimstone, against
this sin from Heaven. It is his <hi>Dalilah,</hi> in
the lap of which sinful pleasure he thinketh
he may sleep securely by the priviledge of
youth. But the Scripture saith, <hi>It is a deep ditch</hi>
Prov. 23. 27. And therefore most dangerous.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:32977:43"/>
And as it is dangerous, so most shameful and
unseemly. It is the defilement, the blasting
of the flower of youth: it is the very snare
of the Devil, whereby many young ones are
held Captive by him at his will.</p>
                        <p>The sin of stubbornness, and contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
carriage towards Superiours in years, or
otherwise, it is most unseemly for those of
the younger sort; it layeth open the shame
of their folly; and when they think highly
of their own witts, and (perhaps) scorn the
advice of their Auncients, they make it known
to the World, that through the greatness of
their folly, they know not themselves, nor
their places aright, nor what becometh them.
Idleness, and Vanity are most unseemly for
them; the loss of these precious daies of
youth; to sleep away these best daies, or to
triffle them away, whiles the Sun shineth upon
them, it is most unseemly.</p>
                        <p>Finally, to live in impenitency and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
not to seek the love and favour of God in
Christ; to put off Repentance till old Age is
most unseemly and uncomely. To sleep all
the day and put off a man's main business un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
night, is most foolish and uncomely. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
to God, it is thy main work, and the
beginning of all the work and service, which
thou doest for him that made thee, and gave
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:32977:44"/>
thee thy life, and continueth it to thee every
hour. Thou dost never truly put thy self
into his Service, until thou art truly convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and turned unto him. All that thou dost
in the Worship of God before, is no true
Service, no work of a faithful Servant, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
unto God: therefore to give him
that gave thee all thy daies, no part of these
best daies of youth: to give him that gave
thee all thy strength, no part of thy strength:
to give him that gave thee all thy witt and
understanding, nothing but the ruines and
decays of witt, memory and understanding
in old age, or sickness, is most unseemly;
and such as cannot any way become any one
that would be called a Christian: especially,
if thou considerest, that when thou deniest
thy best time to God, he may justly deny
thee the rest of thy time which thou hopest to
enjoy, and cut thee off in thy sins.</p>

heartily and speedily of the sins of Youth;
and yet whiles thou maist do somewhat for
the Lord, hast some strength and abilities
for his service, let him have thy heart and
hand, thy body, thy soul: sacrifice thy self
to him, consecrate thy whole man to his
worship and service even in thy middle-age.</p>

the ways of folly? What is this but to be
a spectacle of reproach among men? How
many years hast thou lived an enemy to
God? Couldest thou find no time for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
in thy Youth, nor in thy middle
age, nor yet now thou art thus far gone in
years? What is an impenitent old man, but
a kind of monster among men? What a
shame is it to see a gray-head quaffing by the
fire-side in an Ale-house; a man of fifty or
sixty years haunting the Ase-house, and
wanton dallyance. A profane Oath in an
old mans mouth, how odious and shamefull
is it? Is it not a double shame for old men
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:32977:47"/>
to be more and more covetous the elder they
are, to cleave more and more close to the
world? As one that is to be executed, if he
hath his hands at liberty when he is turned
off the Ladder, will catch hold again, and
cling fast unto it, being loth to let go his hold:
so such a one being summoned by death to
leave the world, catcheth hold again, fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his very heart unto it, and cleaving more
strongly and more closely thereunto. How
much better were it to have loosened the
heart from the world by unfeigned repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that the world and it may part with
ease? For part ye must, though thy heart
should be pulled in pieces in parting. How
ill doth it become an old man, that all this
while he hath not learned to see into the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the world, which a wise man in a
little time of experience may easily discern?
O thou old sinner, learn greatly then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
the sins of thy Youth, that length of
time wherein thou hast gone on in sin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou hast hardened thy heart, and resisted

with the Father of mercies, to pass by the

Now is the Spring, now is the time of sowing
in tears, even in your Youth: and if ye sow so,

Now is the day, and therefore work

reprobate sense may come, when none can
rightly work the works of God. Oh then! what
an extreme folly is it for you now to sleep in
Sin whiles it is day, and whiles mercy is
offered, and the way of life is shewed, and
the works which God hath ordained for his
people to walk in, are laid before you? Now
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:32977:48"/>
then it becometh you to flee youthfull
lusts, and not to stay till they flee you: Now
learn to hate all sin, (and especially the sins
to which your age enclineth you) even as
Death, as Hell. Do not think that the sins
of Youth will become you, because Youth
is enclinable to them, but rather think they
are so much the more unseemly, because na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
corrupted, enclineth Youth unto them.
Sin is so contray unto that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                           </gap>, and right
order of things whch God hath made, that
it enclineth men to those things whch are
most unseemly for them. And this must
needs be so, for Sin is most contrary unto
God; now God by his work enclineth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Creature to that which becometh it: and
so by his work upon man in the Creation, he
did frame in him a propension and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to that which did every way become
him best. Now Sin being quite contrary
unto God, and seizing upon man's nature,
did so corrupt it, as to encline it to that
which is most unseemly for it. So man in
general is enclined to earthly, to bodily, and
sensible things, sutable to the body, and to
neglect heavenly and spiritual things, which
are sutable to his Soul and inner man, which
(considering the nature and creation of man)
is most absurd and unseemly; as if a man
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:32977:48"/>
should be more carefull of his foot than of his
Head. What comparison is there between
the Soul and the Body? Is not that of far
greater excellency than this? How unseemly
a thing is it to seek the satisfying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
of the body, rather than of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and better part of a man's self? So Sin
enclineth old men in age to become more
earthly and covetous than before; Now this
is most unseemly. So the Heathen could
observe, counting it as foolish and absurd
for an old man to grow more covetous, and
eager after the world, as for a Traveller to
provide himself so much the more carefully
for his Journey, the nearer he cometh to his
Inne, or Journey's end. Were it not an
unseemly folly, when a man is even at
home, and seeth the smoak of his own Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
to seek about carefully for a fresh Horse,
and other necessaries fit for a Journey of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred miles? So what more foolish
and unseemly than for an old man, travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to his last home, to be the more carefull
of earthly things, the nearer he cometh to
his grave, which are useful to him only by
the way? And as sin enclineth old age to
that whch is most unseemly; so also it doth
younger years. Oh do not think these things
seemly for thee, to which Nature, corrupted
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:32977:49"/>
by sin enclineth thee; no more than that is
wholsome for a sick man, to which his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
vitiated by a disease doth move him.

                        <p>IN the next place we may observe, under
what terms the daies of Old Age are
opposed to the daies of Youth: it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the notion of <hi>evil daies.</hi> They are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the daies of Youth, as evil to good;
therefore, hence I observe,</p>
                        <p>Obs. That the daies of Youth, are good
daies. So the opposition teacheth us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr;
for they are such daies as men enjoy,
while the evil daies come nor. The <hi>Hebrews</hi>
call young men by such a name as imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:32977:49"/>
is as much as a chosen or selected man,
a man picked out of the multitude for special
use: and so the time of Youth is expressed
as a chosen selected time. So in this very
place; for as he had said before, <hi>Eccles. 11.
9. Rejoyce O young man,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">

                     <div n="2" type="chapter">
                        <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                        <p>WHerefore, that this may be made
more clear unto us, let us consider
how, and in what respects the daies of Youth
are called good daies. <hi>They are good daies,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Because they are the first daies of a
man's life. Childhood is but (as it were) a
preparative to the life of man: Children,
while they are Children, have but some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
beginnings of the life of reason, which
is the proper and peculiar life of man: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may reckon the daies of Youth, as
the first daies of man's life, when he first
beginneth to live as a man, and to live the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:32977:50"/>
life of reason in some degree of perfection.
Now ye know, that the first in every kind hath
the preheminence; the first-born of men,
the firstlings of beasts; the first-fruits of the
earth; the morning of the day; the first age
of the world; the spring of the year. So there
is a kind of preheminency in the first daies of
man's life, which are the daies of Youth;
they are a man's prime and his good daies.</p>
                        <p>2. The daies of Youth are good daies,
because ordinarily they are the daies of best
health and strength: daies wherein we are of
able bodies for any special service. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be true, that in the worship of God,
bodily exercise profiteth but little, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the inward power of godliness;
yet strength and health, when they are made
serviceable to a sanctified upright heart, are
of special use, both in the immediate worship
of God, and in the performance of many
offices of love, which we ought to do towards
our Brethren in the Lord. <hi>Mens sana in
corpore sano</hi> (as they say) a sound mind, and
an heavenly spirit, furthered in the worship
and service of God, by a strong, healthy,
well-tempered body, hath a great advantage
in it's work; and in that case, the daies of
health and strength are good daies. In
Prayer; although the strength and force of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:32977:51"/>
Prayer doth not lie in the strength of the
sides, or loudnes of the voice; yet it is no smal
advantage to the Spirit, when in it's fervour
and strength of affection, it gathereth up and
putteth forth all it's powers in earnest sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
before the throne of Grace; if
then it hath a sound healthy body, able to
bear the intention of a fervent spirit, without
fainting or distraction. You know that if
the arrow be long, and drawn to the head,
it is needfull that the bow and the string
should be of sufficient strength to hold draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And a Christian, that will not content
himself to shoot those fools bolts, mentioned
<hi>Eccles. 5. 1.</hi> but desireth to send forth wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
shafts of fervent Prayer that shall pierce
the Clouds, and enter the Heavens, findeth
it an help not to be despised, when the
strength and health of his body is suitable to
the vigour of his spirit. This holdeth (as
ye may easily conceive) in those exercises of
hearing, reading, meditation, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>3. Daies of Youth are times wherein the
powers of the Soul are also quick, lively and
able by the communion with the body. The
Soul by reason of it's near conjunction of the
body hath it's Childhood, Youth and decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
time. In younger years it hath those gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
daies, wherein the understanding is quick
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:32977:51"/>
in apprehension, teachable, and apt to receive
impression; the Memory faithfull, the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
good and sound; the Affections strong
and stirring: Therefore these are the good
daies wherein it is fit to be used in the work
and service of God. And as in the Spring,
all these concurring together, the Trees in
their fresh clothing; the face of the Earth
renued, the beauty of Herbs and Flowers,
together with the Sun's shining brightly in
his strength and glory, make up good daies;
whereas in the Winter, the brightness of the
Sun maketh but an imperfect good day, whiles
the Trees and Fields are stripped, dead and
withered; the ground covered with mire and
dirt: so the meeting of these together, the
birth-right of Youth, the strength and health
of the Body, the quickness of the Senses, the
activeness and abundance of the Spirits, the
perfections of the Soul, &amp;c. make the daies
of Youth good daies: whereas, although in
the winter of Old Age the Sun may shine;
the principles of wisdome stored up in Youth
may be preserved; yet there are those defects
naturally clogging that dying age, which do
ecclipse the brightness, and lessen the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of those daies.</p>

                              </gap>.</hi> THis may serve to reprove those,
who do allow some fleshly liberty
to the daies of Youth. Many, who themselves
are aged, out of a kind of fatherly experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
gravity (as they would have men think)
and out of a kind of moderation, to which
their years have brought them (as they will
have us believe) do give liberty to a kind
of latitude in the ways of Youth; and young
men must be born with. Who doubteth but
that there is a Christian moderation and
compassion to be exercised towards such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of the flesh, which the Spirit wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
and laboureth against either in young or
old; when the heart being given up to Christ,
and brought under the soveraign command
of his glorious Gospel and blessed Spirit,
cannot yet wholly free it self from the law
of Rebellion, nor utterly shake off the body
of Death? But out of a pretence of levity
to flatter the enormities of Youth, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
those vitious unbridled courses, which
stain the glory of those best daies; what is it
but to say, that hard Frosts, deep Snows, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations,
thick mire and dirt, are not to be
accounted strange in <hi>May,</hi> nor to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at in the prime and spring of the year. Is it
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:32977:52"/>
to be endured, when the best daies of a man's
life are wasted away in such courses as are
contrary to the end for which a man liveth;
most contrary to the glory of that great God,
who hath given them these choice daies of
Youth. To speak plainly; when are you
more carefull to fence your Copses, Pastures,
Meadows, than in the Spring: and will ye
say the spring of our life (which is the time
of Youth) may be laid open to the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of lusts, to the assaults of Satan, to the
pleasures of Sin? Let other men applaud
their own gravity, and condemn the rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of others; I cannot believe that <hi>Solomon</hi>
wanted either years, gravity, wisdome or due
moderation, when he checked the folly of
Youth in an holy Irony, <hi>Eccles. 11.</hi> and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
before all vain young men the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the great day, shewing that for all
these things, even these excesses of Youth,
they shall be made to give account: nor
when he did put down this serious admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the words of this Text, backed with
so many pressing motives, <hi>Remember now thy
Creator in the daies of thy youth, while the evil
daies come not,</hi> &amp;c. and had there been any
defect in the pen-man, yet I am sure the
Holy Ghost which held his hand, would not
have suffered him to write one syllable amiss.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:32977:53"/>
Neither doth the Psalmist return an answer
sutable to these mens conceits when the
question is moved, <hi>Wherewithall shall a young
man cleanse his way?</hi> but quite contrary,
<hi>By taking heed thereto according to thy word.</hi>
Where ye see both the Rule by which, and
the manner how they are to frame their
Courses, requireth a special strictness. The
very Word of God, that pure and holy Rule
of Righteousness, and not the customs of
the time, nor the ordinary practice, nor
lusts of youth must guide them, and this
Rule they must heed with much attention and
watchfulness, having one eye upon their
ways, another upon the word: taking heed
thereto according to the word, ever marking
the steps they tread, and observing how it
suiteth with the precious truth of God. This
is the wisdom of the Antient of daies, and
whatsoever is contrary to it, gray hairs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
exempt from folly.</p>

Think the spring of your age
too good for Satan, too pretious for Lust, for
Drunkenness, for Vanity, too good to be
so spent, that in old age ye shall not be able
to remember it without shame, without a
sting. Ye know what the Lord spake long
since to <hi>Israel, If ye walk contrary unto me,
I also will walk contrary unto you.</hi> How can
ye walk more contrary unto God, than to
make those the worst daies which he hath
made the best? To have abused any of God's
good Creatures under the Law had been sin,
to have profaned the first fruits a double sin,
to give any of our time to the service of sin,
is unworthy of a Christian; but to abase
the prime of Youth, and the crown of our
years, the choicest of our daies to this sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
what is it but to set our selves to cross
the Lord in the wisdom of his wayes, and to
make these daies evil because he hath made
them good? Regard not those who scoff in
their carnal folly at the uniting of these two
together, Youth and Holiness, as at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
match: as if a young man and an old
woman were joyned together in marriage.

are they made evil daies?</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="83" facs="tcp:32977:54"/>
                              <hi>Sol. I.</hi> I answer in general: The daies of
Youth (good in themselves) are made
evil, when they are spent in unregeneration,
spent in a state of impenitency, without
sound conversion to God, without holy
communion with him. Every young man,
who is not brought home to God by unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
repentance in his Youth, maketh the
daies of his Youth to be evil daies, <hi>Rom. 6. 20,
21. When ye were the servants of Sin, ye
were free from righteousness: what fruit had
ye then in those things whereof ye are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed;
for the end of those things is death.</hi>
Whiles a man is an unregenerate person, he
is a servant of Sin, and all that while he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his daies evil daies, his life an evil life;
for he is not able to shew any fruit that he
hath reaped of all his works and wayes; no
true benefit, no sound comfort ariseth out of
all his courses. So it is with old men that live
in the service of sin without true regeneration.
In like manner it is in young men that are
unregenerate, let them do what they will,
or can, let them fill themselves with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of earthly pleasures; let them please
themselves every way, and do what they can
to enjoy these dayes of Youth, walking in
the wayes of their own Heart, and in the sight
of their Eyes, please their Senses of all sorts,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:32977:55"/>
&amp;c. Nay, let them spend their daies of Youth
better than so, even in Wars, in Study and
Learning, in getting some useful &amp; commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Trade; yet so long as they are unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
and do not seriously remember
&amp; turn to their Creator now in these daies of
their Youth, they have no true fruit (worth
the having) of all their endeavours, of all their
daies of Youth. Now doth not a man make
his daies evil daies, when he spendeth them
so, that no true good cometh of them? when
they bring forth more evil than good; so
much evil, as that the good that might come
of them is not good unto them: for the end
of these things is death. When a man is
still hastening to his destruction, running o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>â€¢</desc>

towards his death (as every one unconverte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>â€¢</desc>
                              </gap>
is) what fruit can there come of any thing
he goeth about? All ye that are young, who
put off repentance and are not regenerate,
nor labour to be so, ye make the daies of your
Youth, which ye so rejoyce in, evil daies,
cursed daies, ye walk under the wrath and
curse of God, and are not freed from the
sentence of condemnation. Whiles ye are
merry and jocund, whiles your Hearts cheer
you, ye do but sport your selves in the midst
of your own misery and dangers. Canst thou
enjoy one good day whiles thou hast no assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:32977:55"/>
for an hour to be free from the fire that
never goeth out; whiles thou standest accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and hast the sentence of condemnation
written upon thy conscience, and not washed
off by the blood of Christ spinkled by faith:
oh these are evil bitter daies, if thou couldest
discern them rightly, wherein Heaven frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon thee, God is angry with thee; and
all thy sins remain unpardoned! Therefore
repent and make thy peace with God, that
so the daies of thy Youth may be good daies;
daies wherein thou maist be assured that God
is appeased with thee; daies wherein thou
maist walk in the bright Sun-shine and light
of his countenance; daies wherein thou maist
have thy fruit in holiness for the present, and
be assured that the end will be everlasting
life: then shall the daies of thy Youth be
good and blessed daies un o thee.</p>

                           <p>II. More especially these good daies of
Youth are made evil daies, when they are
spent in any, or divers of those sins to which on
the one side You his commonly accustomed;
and which on the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>â€¢</desc>

of things, are most unseemly and
unfit for Youth.</p>
                           <p>I. One sin is <hi>whoredom:</hi> if any thing can
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:32977:56"/>
make the daies of Youth, of good to become
evil daies, this will do it; when the body,
which is as a Temple of the Holy Ghost,
and should be consecrated and dedicated to
him from the first building or framing of it
as it were, shall be made a cage of unclean
lusts, how great is this prophanation? If the
Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when it was new built,
should have been made a Stews (as one of
the Popes is said to have made his Palace)
and then have been left to be employed
as a Temple for God when it grew old and
ruinous; would not the earth have opened
her mouth to swallow up those who should
have thus prophaned it? O young men!
how dangerous is it then, whilst your bodies
are young, and should be esteemed and used
as new-built Temples, wholly dedicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, his glory and service, to defile them
with those sins, intending when they are old,
decayed, and ruinous buildings (and not till
then) to use them as Temples of the Holy
Ghost. St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>If any man defile the
Temple of God, him shall God destroy,</hi> 1 Cor.
3. 17. Therefore if any one hath not kept
his Garments clean in this regard, let him
without delay wash and be clean, wash away
his guilt by the blood of Christ; wash away
these lusts and sinfull inclinations by the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:32977:56"/>
Spirit of Christ, by unfeigned repentance and
amendment of Heart and Life: and for the
time to come (according to <hi>Davids</hi> counsel,
<hi>Psal. 119. 9.</hi>) Let them make clean their
wayes from this foul sin, by taking heed unto
them, according to such parts of the word as
these: <hi>Flee youthful lusts, but follow after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
faith, charity, peace, with them that
call on the Lord out of a pure heart,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.
22. And that <hi>Whore-mongers and Adulterers,
God will judge,</hi> Heb. 13. 4. And that of St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Thess. 4. 3, 4, 5. <hi>This is the will of
God, even your sanctification, that ye should
abstain from fornication, that every one of you
should know how to possess his vessel in sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and honour: not in the lust of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence,
even as the Gentiles which knew not
God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>2. <hi>Drunkenness;</hi> which, as it is enough
to make any part of a man's life evil, so it is
a great blemish to a young man, and maketh
the daies of his Youth, evil and wretched
daies. The wise man sheweth, that the
ruines of Old Age do make the Keepers of
the House tremble, and the strong ones to
bow themselves; the Hands and Leggs to
shake. But how shamefull is it for young
men of firm and strong bodies, to bring a
drunken Palsey upon themselves, whereby
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:32977:57"/>
they are staggering in the streets, their Leggs
even failing them? or a brutish Lethargy,
whereby they are not able to arise from the
place where they sit or lie? ye that are
Parents look to it, that your Children come
not into such infectious company, as many
entice them. Take heed ye that are young,
of besotting your Brains and Understandings,
which now are naturally fresh and quick (if
ever) wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>â€¢</desc>
                              </gap>h this swinish sin: Consider that
weighty Charge of our Saviour, <hi>Luke 21.
34. Take heed, lest at any time your Hearts
be over-charged with Surfeiting and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>3. <hi>Pride</hi> is another sin, that is enough to
make the daies of Youth to be evil daies.
That which made good Angels wicked
Devils, is enough to make the best daies
of a man's life evil and miserable: What is
more seemly for the younger sort, than true
modesty and humility, which God accepteth,
blesseth and crowneth with graces here, and
glory hereafter? What worse than Pride
and a disdainful Carriage? want of farther
experience should make them in many things
to suspend their Judgements, unless it be in
such as are cleer and evident. Contempt,
and scornfull behaviour towards the Antien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>â€¢</desc>
                              </gap>:
Self-conceit; as if Wisdom should die with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:32977:57"/>
them: Self-will and stubbornness; an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
Stiffness in their own groundless
opinions, and unwarrantable purposes, with
other fruits of Pride; they do even deface the
good daies of Youth, and make them evil.</p>
                           <p>4. <hi>Idleness</hi> is another sin which marreth
these good daies, which bringeth not only a
rust upon them, but letteth loose the lusts
of Youth, and maketh it exceeding sinful.
If any should flee this sin (as all should)
then especially the younger sort ought to
observe it above others. It is not a misery of
miseries, that those golden daies should be
worn out in sluggishness? that those abilities
of body and mind, which are at their best,
should want employment? and want they
cannot, work they must; they are made of
such a temper, that they cannot be without
motion. If the Heavens cannot stand still,
nor the Air fix it self in one place, and abide
without stirring, no more can the minds of
young men, nor the thoughts of their hearts
abide without inward workings of spirit. O
young man! thou canst not keep thine eye-lids
from stirring; thy Lungs from moving; thy
Heart and Pulse from beating; and canst thou
keep thy Soul and the affections of thy Heart
from stirring, which are more active than
any part of thy body? No, they will have
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:32977:58"/>
their course: and if in any idle, sluggish
carelessness, thou lettest them go as a Ship
without a Rudder or Pilot, the event is like
to be wofull, and thou art running upon
the Rocks; Satan filling the Sails of thy
affections with contrary winds and hellish
suggestions, which drive thee from the Haven
of Peace to the gulph of everlasting destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
What a world of snares hath the
Devil ready for thee, whiles he finds thee
idle? How many enticing objects, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
temptations? When shouldest thou
provide against the winter of thy life, but
now in the spring of thy daies? Old Age is
almost unteachable; and if thou learnest not
in thy Youth, but spendest it in lazy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
it will be very hard (if not impossible)
to learn in thine old age, when thou art
more ready to forget than to learn. It is a
most miserable spectacle to see an ignorant
old man or woman, which hath lost the best
time of Youth in idleness, and not treasured
up the principles of heavenly truths: Oh
how uncapable are they of the things of God!
how likely to perish for want of knowledge,
how uncapable of Knowledge it self? Rest
and ease is fitter for Old Age, than for
Youth: Labour, Diligence, Watchfulness,
I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>â€¢</desc>
                              </gap>dustry, are things which become those
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:32977:58"/>
good daies. In a word! when any sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth,
and any lust prevaileth, it is enough
to make the dayes of Youth evil daies.
Therefore ye that are young, and yet enjoy
the good daies of your life, do not ye make
them evil. Remember your Creator in the
daies of your Youth, take heed to your ways
according to the word of God, so shall these
daies indeed be good daies to you, and you
shall prepare your selves either for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Old Age, or for a blessed end, and
an happy death; preventing the evils of
Old Age, and putting you in possession of
everlasting life, which never seeleth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays
of Age.</p>
                           <p>Finally, let me in a word beseech those
who have already out-lived their best daies,
to look back seriously and speedily upon the
times and courses of their Youth, and see
how those daies have been spent, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
what matter of joy and thanksgiving,
or what causes of grief and humiliation they
may find, and accordingly to be affected. If
you have made them evil daies, how should
you mourn for this? How should you seek
God now that it draweth towards the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
hour, before the night cometh when
no man can work; which burieth all secure
loiterers and unprepared ones in an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

night of utter darkness, where is weeping

                           <hi>Observ.</hi> That the daies of Old Age are
evil daies. So the Spirit of God here calleth
them. This the Holy Ghost here, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Verses of this Chapter sheweth in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
circumstances. Here he saith, They are
daies wherein there is no pleasure; daies
wherein there is much matter of grief and
vexation, little contentment: when a man's
life is like gloomy daies, such as St. <hi>Paul</hi> met
with in his Sea-voyage, when neither Sun
nor Starrs for many daies appeared; to such
daies Old Age is here compared; daies of
darkness, wherein Sun, Moon and Starrs
have their light hidden and darkened; and
the Clouds return after the Rain. Though
the showres fall, yet it doth not clear up, but
the Clouds grow up, and gather together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
so it is in Old Age, the end of one
trouble is but the begnning of another affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:32977:59"/>
like to that. In the words following
these evils of Old Age are more particularly
expressed and numbred up. The keepers of
the house do tremble; the arms which are to
guard and defend the body, shake with the
Palsey: the strong men, the Leggs which
are the pillars to bear up this house of clay,
begin to fail with weakness, and to double
under their burthen like posts worn and
weakened with age. The Grinders, the Teeth
cease, because they are few, and the Windows
shall be darkned, &amp;c. In a word! we may
summe up the evils of these Aged daies in
these two heads: Evils of Loss, and Evils of
Sense. The loss of Contentments in God's
good blessings: the loss of ability for many
good Offices: on the other side, the suffering
of many inconveniences in body and mind,
which maketh a man a burthen to himself,
being burthened with such an heap of years.</p>

daies; repentance and an holy conversation
make the evil daies of Old Age to be good.
Godliness is profitable to all things, saith
the Apostle, and so it is profitable for all
times, for times of Youth as well as times
of Old Age; for health, for sickness, for
life, for death: it shall do thee good, and not
evil all thy daies. If Old Age bring so many
inconveniences with it, how careful should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thou be to remove the guilt of thy sins
before the burthen of Old Age cometh upon
thee? If these wounds of thy conscience be
truly healed by the blood of Christ aforehand,
sprinkled on by the hand of faith, then shall
thy Spirit be enabled to bear the infirmities
of Old Age; yea, thou shalt be able to do
all things through the Spirit of Christ,
strengthening and supporting thee. Oh how
miserably is that poor Soul burthened, that

unpardoned, lying upon it? but how bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
how honourable is the gray hoary head

more and more far and flourishing; and
their last works (as it is said of the Church
of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> Revel. 2, 19.) shall be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:32977:60"/>
more than the first: their last daies better than
the first. Such a good old age they shall have,
as divers of the Saints are said to have had.
Labour then so to live now, that the evils of
your Age may be mitigated and removed.</p>
                        <p>But on the other side, how evil and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
must those daies of Old Age be, which
are accompanied with the guilt of many sins?
when years encrease, and wickedness encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth;
when a man will not be admonished,
but as he hath been rebellious in his Youth,
so he will be obstinate in his Old Age? Oh
take heed of this! if these evil daies have
overtaken thee before thou hast put away thy
sins, before thou hast sought the Lord with
all thy heart, repent now in the anguish and
bitterness of thy soul.</p>

                        <p>THus ye have heard, how Old Age is
said to consist of evil daies: now here
we see how the Holy Ghost doth call away
the thoughts of young men from the pleasures
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:32977:61"/>
and vanities of Youth, wherein they are
usually drowned and over-whelmed, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
them a foresight of a change: letteth
them know, that it will not alwayes be thus
with them; they must look for other times
hereafter to pass over them; now they have
their good daies, their daies of Youth, but
they must perswade themselves there be other
daies coming; these good daies will not last
alwayes. Hence I observe,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Observ.</hi> That it is Christian wisdom to
foresee and provide for changes ere they
come: it is a brutish and sensual folly to have
the Heart so possessed and taken up with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
prosperity and earthly contentments of
any kind, as not to have any serious and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
regard of such changes as may be
brought upon us. Therefore the Spirit of
God having to do with young men in this
place, who did please themselves in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and in their present youthful wayes,
delights and contentments, he setteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes a lively image of Old Age;
with the many evils, grievances, and blemish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of it: yea, he leadeth them along to the
death-bed, and hangeth out their winding-sheet
before their eyes; and by the way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
them with many objects unpleasing
to sensuality, and vain youthfull affections.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:32977:61"/>
First, evils in general, and then the loss of all
earthly pleasures; then dimness and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
weeping, cloudy weather, Ver. 2. and
so he goeth on in the words following. Thus
doth St. <hi>James</hi> deal with secure and carnal
rich men, whose hearts did rest with a kind
of muddy contentment in their abundance of
worldly things, not seriously thinking of sad
alterations that might follow, <hi>Jam. 5. 1, 2.
Go to now ye rich men; weep &amp; howl for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
that shall come upon you: your riches are
corrupted, and your garments moth-eaten, &amp;c.</hi>
and ver. 5. <hi>Ye have lived in pleasure on the
earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished
your hearts as in the day of slaughter.</hi> As
the beast that is full fed and fatted, is wanton
and frollick, feeding without fear or foresight
of the Butchers Axe, even in the same morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when he is to die before night, even in
the day of Slaughter: so do ye please your
selves, and satisfie your own lusts without
any serious consideration aforehand of the
Axe of God's wrath, that lyeth at the root
of all such unfruitfull Trees, and is ready to
give an irrecoverable stroke: ye do not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
forethink of the evils that shall come
upon you, and therefore I present these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

of the whole world; and great wisdom to
provide so carefully against it, preparing an
Ark for the saving of his House: Herein he
condemned the unbelief and folly of the
world, whose sensuality, earthly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and deep security, our Saviour decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<hi>Matth. 24. 38.</hi> in the daies that were
before the flood, <hi>They were eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
marrying and giving in marriage, untill
the day that</hi> Noah <hi>entred into the Ark, and
knew not untill the flood came, and took them
all away. Noah</hi> did foresee, and prepare for
this notable change before it came; but the
world of the ungodly continued in deep and
dead security: They would not believe that
the flood-gates of Heaven should be opened
so wide, as to pour down an universal deluge
upon the earth; they knew not, they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
not of this wofull change, untill the
flood came, and took them all away.</p>

                        <p>NOw the reasons why this is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a point of wisdom, necessary
for every Christian, are,</p>
                        <p>1. Because a change will certainly come,
Eccles. 1. 2. <hi>Vanity of vanities</hi> (saith the
Preacher) <hi>all is vanity.</hi> All is vanity and
uncertainty: There is no pepetuity, nothing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:32977:63"/>
changeable in man, or in the outward conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of man here on earth; yea, many changes
and strange alterations may befall those that
seem to be in a most setled condition; many
may come, some must come. Thou that art
in prosperity, maist fall into adversity; Thou
that art rich, maist become poor: Thou that
hast Children, maist become childless: Thou
that hast Friends, maist become friendless
Thou that hast health, maist have sickness<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
Thou that art young and strong, maist be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
old and impotent: Thou that art a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
maist be a prisoner. These things may
come; but there is another change that must
come, namely, Death. Thou that art living
man or woman must be turned into a dead
carkase: Thou that art now reckoned among
the living, must be accounted among the
dead. Thou that now seest, hearest, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
walkest, &amp;c. must become blind, speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
senseless, not able to move or stir: a
corps without life, breath or motion. Thou
that now conversest with men, must be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and become a dead man out of mind:
yea, thou that now sittest here at this time, must
stand before the Lord's Judgement-Seat,
Oh then it is wisdom to be aforehand with
these changes and alterations, that they may
not surprize and overtake thee unprovided.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="101" facs="tcp:32977:63"/>
2. It is uncertain how, and when these
changes shall come, <hi>Jam. 4. 13, 14. Go to
now ye that say, To day or to morrow we will
go into such a City, and continue there a year,
and buy and sell, and get gain; whereas ye
know not what shall be on the morrow: for what
is your life? It is even a vapour that appeareth
for a little time, and then vanisheth away: For
that ye ought to say, if the Lord will, we shall
live, and do this and that.</hi> Our life is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
that in that respect it may rather be
said to appear then to be: and it appeareth
but for a very little time, the date of it is soon
expised. It is even a vapour, and a vapour doth
quickly vanish, riseth in the morning, and is
dissolved before noon: we may promise our
selves years, but are not sure of the next day.
So it proved in that rich mans case, <hi>Soul, thou
hast goods laid up for many years.</hi> He had a
short answer, <hi>Thou fool, this night shall thy
soul be taken from thee.</hi> It is therefore a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>ecessary point of wisdom to foresee and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for this change.</p>
                        <p>3. Great miseries and inconveniences
follow upon such alterations, when they are
not foreseen and provided for: many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
are lost, which never can be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
such changes happen as deprive men of
all ability of doing that which they might
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:32977:64"/>
have done at ease, if they had foreseen
these things, and taken their time: and men
may look back with many sad thoughts, and
much bitterness of spirit upon their neglects
and losses this way, when it is too late. Some
few daies, weeks, months, wilfully lost and
wasted before, will seem more worth unto
them than all the world; and the treasures and
glory of the world, when once these changes
have overtaken them, and come upon them
unawares, and disabled them for ever.</p>
                        <p>Much discomfort cometh upon this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providence:
when changes happen which are
grievous in themselves; they become more
grievous to us for want of preparation. That
which in its own nature is a misery, is made a
double misery to us, when we are not prepared
for it. What discomfort will sickness bring,
when it cometh unlook'd for; and when we
have not prepared for it by searching our
hearts; casting up our accounts; getting
assured pardon of our sins at the hands of
God? when a sick body and a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
meet together, there is a woful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
when a man shall lie down in his
death bed with the guilt of all his sins lying
upon him, and pressing upon his Soul, there
is a grievous burthen; and especially when
death cometh, and findeth him not regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:32977:64"/>
findeth in him no other life, but that
which floweth from the union between the
Soul and Body; no new spiritual life issuing
from an inseparable communion between
Christ and him. Oh how wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>l death insult
over such a one? how will the name, the
thought, the visage of death dismay him?
when it meeteth him alone, not joyned
to Christ, and entreth into a single combat
with him; not strengthened by an happy u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Lord of life; will it not tear
him in pieces as a Lion might do a little Dog?
It is a double misery not to be aforehand with
death, not to be provided for this change.</p>
                        <p>4. on the other side, much ease, much
good, much comfort followeth upon a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
foresight, and wise preparation for such
changes. When a sad and sudden change
was brought upon <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> a sharp fit of
sickness (supposed to have been the Plague)
and a peremptory message from the Lord by
the Prophet; <hi>Set thine House in order, for
thou shalt die and not live.</hi> Did it not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
ease his burthen, that he was so
well prepared for this change, and able to
say (his conscience bearing him witness)
<hi>2 Kings 20. 3. I beseech thee O Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
now how I have walked before thee in
truth, and with a perfect heart; and hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>â€¢</desc>
                              </gap> done
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:32977:65"/>
that which is good in thy sight.</hi> What a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
will it be, when thy health is turned into
sickness, thy strength into weakness; when
thou art fastened to thy bed, and hast received
in thy self the sentence of death; if then
thou findest thy self provided for this change.
A sweet comfort it shall be in old age (when
the Grashopper is a burden, even the lightest
thing) it shall then ease that burden of years
that makes thee stoop; if thou didst in time
foresee and provide for it, turning to the
Lord aforehand; that so thy gray hairs may
be found in the way of righteousness.</p>

excellently of this point; both shewing
the folly of men trusting to outward things
as to certainties, and declaring his own spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
wisdom which God had taught him in
preparing for any changes that might befall
him. First, he calleth for attention for all
sorts of men throughout the world. <hi>Hear

this all ye people, give ear all ye Inhabitants
of the world, both low and high, rich and poor
together.</hi> It concerneth all sorts nearly, and

stirred up by way of remembrance. Then he
doth very effectually seek to win attention
by the excellency of the things which he is
about to deliver. <hi>My mouth shall speak of
wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall
be of understanding;</hi> such wisdom as many
worldly wise men never learned: yea, he
sheweth in the next verse, that it is an hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
wisdom; and as a parable to natural
men for the most part. Then he entreth
upon his discourse, and in the first place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
with himself, ver. 5. <hi>Wherefore
should I fear in the daies of evil, when the
iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?</hi>
as if he had said; I do foresee changes and
afflictions, I look for assaults from Satan;
but I am armed against them through the
mercy of God, who hath pardoned my sins,
and therefore when such evils come, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
shall seek to entangle my Conscience, as
in a snare, as if these were sure arguments of
God's hatred against me: I will not fear, I
am prepared for these things. Then on

he goeth on at large, declaring the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:32977:66"/>
folly and blindness of worldly-minded men,
&amp;c secure sinners in this case. <hi>They that trust in
their Wealth, and boast themselves in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of their Riches, none of them can by any
means redeem his Brother, nor give to God a
ransom for him:</hi> They trust in outward things,
as if they were enduring substance, and their
hearts are lifted up with thoughts of their
Wealth and Riches; they think not serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of changes to come; they trust in their
strength and healthy tempers in their Youth,
they rest their hearts in their present carnal
contentments, sinful pleasures, &amp;c. as if these
things should alwayes continue; whereas
they can neither rescue or ransom themselves
or dearest friends from the power of death,
that he should live for ever, and not see cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:
<hi>For he seeth that wise men die,
likewise the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>â€¢</desc>
                              </gap>ol and the brutish person shall
perish, and leave their wealth to others.</hi> This
sheweth their great sensuality and sottishnes,
that though they have daily experience of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces
&amp; separations made by death between
men and their wealth, their honours, their
pleasures, and that they are forced to leave
all, and go naked out of the world; yet
they do not apply this, and make it their own
case; but they go on even like to the brute
beasts, which when they see one of their
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:32977:66"/>
own herd led away to the slaughter-house,
regard it not; but delight as much as before
in their fat pastures, sitting themselves daily
more and more for the same end. So these,
though they see those that were framed of
the same clay with themselves, drop away,
and return to their dust; yet they mind it not,
unless it be for a short fit, but set their hearts
upon these things, as much as if they had
never heard of any that had been taken away
by death. <hi>For their inward thought is, that
their Houses shall continue for ever, &amp;c.</hi> The
Spirit of God here looketh into the inside,
and rippeth open the bosomes of these earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded
persons, and sheweth what
thoughts and hopes they have even of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuities
here on earth: and so they love and
strive for these things, as if there were eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in them, as if they were everlasting
things. <hi>Nevertheless man being in honour
abideth not, he is like the beasts that perish.</hi>
Let him enjoy never so much of these things,
yet he abideth not; there shall come a
change, all shall be turned upside down,
and he shall become like the beasts that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.
As he is sottishly and sensually affected
with things present like the beast, so he shall
return to the earth like it, and be turned out
of all, ver. 13. <hi>This their way is their folly,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:32977:67"/>
yet their posterity approve their sayings.</hi> It is
a sad thing, that when experience hath
taught the world so often the vanity of such
thoughts, yet that those that come after
should be of the same mind too, think as they
thought, do as they did, live as they lived.
The Psalmist addeth, <hi>Selah!</hi>] and it is well
worthy even of a note of wonder and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
Children see their Parents sins,
and see how they are taken away; and all
their pride and covetousness, &amp;c. doth them
no good; the pleasure of all is vanished and
gone; it is no more: yet will they run blindly
on in the same way; so will others that come
after them: Neighbours and acquaintance
though they see this, yet they will follow
them, and tread in their steps; this is their
folly, <hi>Selah!</hi> it is remarkable folly. Ver. 14.
<hi>Like sheep they are laid in their grave, Death
shall feed on them, &amp;c.</hi> As sheep dying in
the field, are devoured and fed upon by Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and other birds of prey and beasts of
the field; so death shall not only slay them, but
feed upon them, it shall consume them, and
turn them into rottenness and dust. Then
saith he, <hi>The upright shall have dominion over
them in the morning.</hi> After this long night
wherein death shall feed on them in the
grave, the morning light of that great day
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:32977:67"/>
shall arise upon them, when all shall rise
again; and then the Righteousness shall have
dominion over them, and sit in Judgement
upon them. Oh how many changes are here
which they do not effectually foresee and
provide for! Friends are taken from them;
they are taken from their wealth; Death
killeth them, Death feedeth on them: and
if here were an end, it were nothing: but
then cometh that great day after this long
night, when they must be awakened by the
last Trumpet, and see the Righteous whom
despised, sit as Judges over them. But Ver.
15. The Psalmist sheweth, how he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into consideration aforehand all these
things, and was prepared for them. <hi>But
God will redeem my Soul from the power of
the grave, for he shall receive me, Selah!
David</hi> did not settle his heart upon any things
of the world, but he looked for death, and
prepared for it, made account of being
Death's prisoner in the grave; but then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
he had overcome death, and the grave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand by the power of faith, laying hold
of the promise of God, knowing that he
should be ransomed and redeemed from it;
not as the wicked, whose hearts were set upon
the things of the world, to be carried from
the prison of the grave to execution: but
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:32977:68"/>
he knew, that the Lord would receive him
to glory, and upon this he sets a special note
again, <hi>Selah!</hi> Then he sheweth what little
cause any child of God hath to be troubled
at the outward prosperity of the wicked, and
in the end concludeth all with this speech,
<hi>Man that is in honour, and understandeth not,
is like the beasts that perish.</hi> Let him be never
so highly advanced and enriched; yet if he
doth not understandingly consider of changes
likely to come upon him, but glut himself
with the things of this present life, he is more
like a beast than a man, and maketh no use of
that reasonable soul which God hath given
him above a beast, whereby he hath an ability
to look beyond these things that lie before
his eyes for the present, and to make use of
his experience in those changes which he hath
seen in others; applying to himself, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
from one thing to another, and so to
provide for the like to come upon himself.
You see here the very picture of a caranal
secure heart, setled upon its lees, embracing
this present world, and doting upon it; not
foreseeing nor providing for those many
changes and turnings of things that are likely
to happen, and especially that great change
that shall certainly come, death, the grave,
and resurrection unto Judgement. Which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:32977:68"/>
were they throughly sensible of, they should
have a low esteem of these perishing vanities,
and uncertainties under the Sun, and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
their dear Souls by too much affecting,
and too eager seeking after them.</p>

The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> saith, <hi>I will stand
upon my Watch, and set me upon the Tower, and
will watch to see what the Lord will say unto
me, and what I shall answer when I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

He was before like one standing
upon the lower ground, looking upon things
present, things that lay before him, <hi>viz.</hi> The
present prosperity of the wicked prevailing
over the Church, and was troubled at it in
his thoughts to see the wicked devour the man
that was more righteous than he; Chap. 1. 13.
Hereupon he is tempted to complain of the
Lords wayes of Providence, and his manner
of governing the world. But now being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of his errour, he would get upon the
higher ground, upon a watch-tower, that he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:32977:69"/>
might see into changes that should come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
and discern things afar off; when
the wicked should be most severely punished
for all their cruelty in oppressing the people
of God. So Christians, when they stand
upon the lower ground, and consult with
flesh and blood, and look upon things with
fleshy eyes, their thoughts are bent upon
things that are at hand, even present things:
but they must get upon the watch-tower, raise
up their hearts in holy meditations upon the
word, so that they may see afar off what is
coming, and what shall be hereafter; what
changes of things shall happen in time to
come. When <hi>Jehu</hi> had the Kingdom of <hi>Israel</hi>
bestowed upon him with a charge to execute
Justice on the wicked house of <hi>Ahab,</hi> he rode
in his Charet with other Captains &amp;
Souldiers to <hi>Jezreel,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Kings Chap. 9.</note> where <hi>Joram</hi>
the King, and his confederate <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi>
King of <hi>Judah</hi> were together, in Vers.
17. it is said, There stood a Watch upon the
Tower in <hi>Jezreel,</hi> and he espied the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Jehu</hi> as he came; and when a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
was sent out and detained, he could see
this too, and give the King knowledge of it:
yea, and a second time he could see who it
was too ere the King saw him at all (as it
seemeth) standing upon the lower ground.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:32977:69"/>
And the driving (saith he) is like the driving
of <hi>Jehu</hi> the Son of <hi>Nimshi,</hi> for he driveth fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously.
Then saith <hi>Joram,</hi> make ready,
when he was even upon his back; But then
it was too late, he was now within the reach
of <hi>Jehu's</hi> Bow. So whiles the wicked are
secure, and content themselves with present
things, they foresee not dangers, miseries,
death, destruction marching furiously to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, untill it be too late, the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
shafts of death piercing through their
hearts, and cleaving the body and soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder.
But a Christian must be a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and still stand upon his watch-tower,
that he may descry changes and dangers afar
off; that he may see death riding post to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him on his pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Beloved, every one that death surpriseth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

to be taken with death. Death hath taken
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:32977:70"/>
hold of all such, and hath them within it's
power. But he that is aforehand with death,
and is a partaker of life in Christ, cannot be
taken with it, but he hath death rather in his
power, and is a conquerour over death by
the power of Christ. Others are taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided;
they are taken sleeping in their
sins, when death driveth it's nail into their
heads, as <hi>Jael</hi> did into the head of <hi>Sisera.</hi>
Oh, then be watchfull to foresee and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide

wrought much wickedness, the Kingdom of

youngest, Ver. 16, 17. Then also the Lord
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:32977:72"/>
smote him with an incurable Disease in his
Bowels, and after two years torment (as it
seemeth) his Body rotted, and his Bowels
fell out, so that he died of sore Diseases, and
had not that honour at his Funeral which was
usually done unto Kings: See how his life
out-lasted the comforts of his life, and yet
his life was short; he died when he was about
forty years old, and reigned eight years.</p>
                        <p>Now ye may see by these examples, that
there are two wayes in general by which it
cometh to pass; that the comforts of this life
are shorter than life it self, and that this life
out-lasteth them all: and that is, 1. By reason
of old age. 2. By reason of crosses &amp; afflictions.
1. In respect of old age: so it was with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and <hi>Barzillai:</hi> So it is expressed at large
in this last Chapter of <hi>Ecclesiastes;</hi> where he
sheweth how the daies of old age are such
many times that a man hath no pleasure in
them; and sheweth at large how the several
parts of the body decay, and the powers of
nature fail. The Grashopper shall be a
burthen] that is, every little thing shall
trouble them. And desire shal fail.] They
shall have no mind to any thing: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
also it must needs be that delights
should fail, they should joy in nothing;
all the pleasures of Youth, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:32977:73"/>
of Life are gone. <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.
90. 10. The daies of our years are threescore
years and ten, and if by reason of strength
they be fourscore, yet is their strength but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and sorrow.</hi> Yea, and some ere they be
threescore, do feel the burthen of Old Age,
as much as others do at fourscore. 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of sufferings and afflictions, some do
out-live the comforts and pleasures of this
life. So did Job: but that afterwards the
Lord restored his prosperity to him in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
manner. So <hi>Saul</hi> (it seemeth)
in respect of age might have enjoyed many a
fair year) but all was blasted, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
did him little, good. The Lord declared
himself against him. So ye see in the example
of <hi>Jehoram:</hi> the Lord may take away those
comforts from a man, that the loss of them
may drown all the pleasures of this life, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter
all those sweets that this world can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
to us.</p>

                     <div n="2" type="chapter">
                        <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                        <p>THe Reason in general is the sin of man:
that hath shortned life, &amp; made it mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
which (had it not been for sin) should have
been imortal. That hath made the comforts
of life shorter than life it self, which should
have been everlasting, as life it self should
have been immortal, had not sin given a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:32977:73"/>
wound both to the life of man, and to the
comforts of this life. Man should have had
no thorns nor thistles to have vexed him in
Paradise, if he had not let Sin into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
but Sin being let in cast him out into a
thorny world ful of miseries, whereby his short
life was made bitter to him, and the pleasures
of life not so long-lived as life it self.</p>
                        <p>Many times the special sins of men are the
cause of this, and that both of God's Children
and of the wicked. The special sins of the
Godly, as in <hi>David:</hi> his sins into which he
fell, made the latter part of his life full of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness:
and had not he been able to comfort
himself in God, and to have refreshed his
heart with his saving love and mercy, how
could he have been able to bear up his Spirit
under such grievous burthens?</p>
                        <p>So the Lord doth many times change the
outward condition of his Children, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them in stead of many outward comforts
formerly enjoyed, to eat the bread and
drink the water of afflictions; and causeth
sad times to pass over them; insomuch that
all the comforts of this life do no way yield
them so much content, as their outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
do bring bitterness upon them.</p>
                        <p>On the other side, the special sins of the
wicked, do sometimes move the Lord to turn
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:32977:74"/>
their laughter into mourning, and to bring a
a dark Cloud on all the Sun-shine of their
outward comforts, so that all things in the
world shall look sad upon them, and this he
seemeth to do for two causes.</p>
                        <p>1. To bring them home to himself, that
being taken off from carnal contentment in
outward delights, and brought to deal se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
with their own hearts, and to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their wayes; and finding nothing in the
world for their hearts to rest upon, they may
be made to turn to the Lord, and to seek
peace with him, and comfort in his love. Thus
it was with <hi>Manasseh,</hi> whiles he flourished
in his Kingly dignity, and had what his heart
could wish, how did he exceed in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
But when the Lord gave him that blow
by the hand of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which
struck him down from his Throne, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>aid
him in fetters; then in his affliction he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
the Lord his God, and humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
greatly before the God of his Fathers,
and prayed unto him, and he was entreated
of him, &amp;c. <hi>2 Chron. 33, 11, 12, 13.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The Lord seemeth to do this many
times to manifest his Justice, and to let the
wicked know what they are to look for in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
world. Thus he seemeth to have dealt
with <hi>Pharaoh, Saul,</hi> and many others. This
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:32977:74"/>
I am perswaded, the Lord doth often aim at
even in those changes which are brought
with Old Age. Many which have been flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
in their daies, and abused their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
their bodies decay with old age,
and their outward means wither together
with them, and they are set before the world
for spectacles, wherein men may read the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of all things under the Sun, together
with the fading and uncertain condition of
all the comforts of this life. I mean of such,
who after Youth and riper years spent in sin
and impenitency, do afterwards go creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the burden of Old Age, and have
no heart to seek the Lord in sincerity; but
their hearts die within them, and become
like <hi>Nabals,</hi> having lost the content which
they took before in the pleasures of sin, and
wanting grace to raise their hearts to the
Lord, that they might delight their Souls in
him. Many such examples may be observed
in the world.</p>
                        <p>3. Sometimes the Lord doth this to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
the graces of his Children, and to make
them examples unto others of patience and
stedfastness in his ways: as it was with <hi>Job,</hi>
who continued in his integrity after that those
great changes were brought upon him.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Use.</hi> I. HEnce we may be brought to a
consideration of the shortness and
uncertainty of all the contentments of this
present life. How short is life it self? And
yet the pleasures of life are shorter than
life, Psal. 39. 5. <hi>Behold thou hast made my
daies as an hand-breadth,</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> There
is the life of man measured by a span: it is
but an handfull long; not an Inch long com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to eternity: for so it followeth; <hi>Mine
age is as nothing before thee.</hi> Compare it to
eternity, and it is nothing. The daies of a
man's life are not worth the reckoning, not
worth numbring. Nay, compare it not only
to the eternity of God, who is from everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to everlasting; but make the comparison
between the time of this life, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
and everlasting continuance of the
Soul of man in another world either in mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or blessedness, and it is as nothing. What
then are all the pleasures and contentments
which this life can afford, which usually are
expired before life it self? The year is but
short, and quickly turned about in its seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
seasons: how soon is the Spring gone?
How soon the Summer? The Autumn is
quickly spent, and the Winter is not long
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:32977:75"/>
ere it be ended: but the pleasures of the year
last not so long as the year it self. When
once Winter appeareth, we may say, where
are all the flowers and Rose-buds of the
Spring? They are long since dead and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
yet the year is not ended: within a
few weeks what will become of all the green
leaves that have beautified the Trees: they
will fall and die. Within a few months what
will become of all the green grass that
cloatheth the Earth? It will be dead, and
lose its beauty and sweetness. Now unto
the year ye may compare this present life:
to the flowers, blossomes, leaves, grass, you
may compare the pleasures, delights and
contentments of this life: The year is short,
and quickly gone; yet the flowers, blossoms,
leaves, &amp;c. are gone before it. So life is
short, and soon spent, yet the pleasures and
contentments of this life are spent before it.
In the eleventh verse of the same Psalm, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
saith, <hi>When thou with rebukes dost cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty
to consume away like a moth: surely every
man is vanity.</hi> Thou makest his beauty, and
all those delights, and that prosperity wherein
he flourished, and took contentment, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
and wither like corn that is blasted:
surely every man is vanity. At the end of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:32977:76"/>
the fifth verse he saith; <hi>Verily, every man at
his best estate is altogether vanity.</hi> Take him
at his best estate, when he hath the most of
those things which belong to this life, strength
and health, wit and understanding, wealth,
worldly honours, credit with the world, and
respect from worldly men, yet even then this
holy Prophet guided by the spirit of truth,
doubteth not to pronounce or proclaim him
meer vanity; an empty thing, a bubble, a
bladder swoln big, but filled with wind.
Take him as he is a meer man, not renued by
the Spirit of God, not having Christ dwelling
in him: and take him at his best with all
those things with which this mortal life is
capable of, and wherewith this lower world
wherein we live, can furnish him, and he is
but vanity; there is nothing sound, nothing
solid nor substantial in him: his life and the
pleasures of this life are but for a moment,
and of the two the pleasures of this life u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
are the shorter, and sooner ended than
life it self. The Apostle saith, <hi>1 Pet. 1. 24. All
flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the
flower of the grass; the grass withereth, and the
flower thereof fadeth away.</hi> Man and his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
life are like the grass: the glory and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
of man's life is as the flower of the
grass. The grass it self is not long-lived,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:32977:76"/>
but the flower of the grass is dead before the
grass it self. Life is not long, but the flower
of life, the pleasure and prosperity of life is
shorter than life it self, <hi>Jam. 4. 14. What
is your life? it is even a vapour that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</hi>
Where the Apostle meeteth with the fond
thoughts of our fleshly hearts: for when a
man is strong and healthy, and in prosperity,
and enjoyeth the pleasures of this life, he
thinketh he hath gotten a jewel, and his heart
resteth in these things, he thinketh it is well
with him: Oh this life, and that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to it, is a thing which he doth highly
prize, and setteth a great rate upon it. Now
saith St. <hi>James, What is your life?</hi> Ye think
ye have a great treasure of it, I pray what is
it? What is that life which ye do so highly
esteem? I will tell you saith he, it is even a
vapour that appeareth: it hath rather an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
than a being. It maketh some shew
in the eyes of the world, but it is nothing in
a manner; and that shew and appearance
which it maketh, is but for a time, &amp; when the
time is gone, it is as if it had never been; it
is all lost, man is never the better for it; for
those things which are limited within the
compass of time, and measured by a term of
daies or years, both in respect of themselves
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:32977:77"/>
and their fruit, all the good of them weareth
out with that time, and he that enjoyed them,
is never the better for them, no more than if
he had never had them. I speak of those
things which in themselves and in their fruit
are measured by time; for some things in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of themselves, and their continuance, are
but for a time; but the fruit of them is everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
to those that use them in an holy &amp; san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
manner, to those who receive the truth
in love into honest and good hearts, in whom
it becometh an immortal seed, enlivened and
actuated with the Spirit of life and holiness;
yea, there are some principal graces, which
end with time in respect of themselves, but in
respect of their fruit are everlasting, as
Faith and Hope which cease with this life,
but in their fruit are perpetua and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
Nay, even many outward things in the
possession of a Child of God, being sanctified
to him, and improved by him to the glory of
God, though they are mortal and temporal in
themselves, yet they have an everlasting
fruit; so that a Child of God that is rich in
good works, may be the better for his wealth
for ever. The Psalmist speaking of him that
feareth the Lord, and delighteth greatly in his
Commandements, speaketh of his wealth
and riches, <hi>Psal. 112. 3.</hi> and ver. 9. of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:32977:77"/>
good use of them. <hi>He hath dispersed, he
hath given to the poor:</hi> and then of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
fruit of wealth so employed with such
an heart; he saith, <hi>His righteousness endureth
for ever.</hi> So <hi>Matth. 6. 20</hi> saith our Saviour:
<hi>Lay up for your selves treasures in Heaven,
where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and
where thieves do not break thorow, nor steal.</hi> But
now to an unregenerate man, both his life it
self, and all the good he enjoyeth in this life,
and all the fruit of that life, and that good is
temporal, and limited by time. All his
pleasures, and prosperity, and all the fruit of
these end with time; and so when the time
is past, and these do him no good, he is never
the better for them, no more than if he had

man's case is not a jot better, when the time
of this life is worn out, than the others; it
may be worse because of his unthankfulness,
and the abuse of his wealth. So take a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
man that hath enjoyed abundance of
pleasures, and another that hath scarce seen
any good daies all his life long; if both of
them live and die in their natural estate, they
are both alike: the pleasures that the one
hath had, do him no more good, than if he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:32977:78"/>
had never had any more than the other: It
may be they have encreased his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
exceedingly. Now St. <hi>James</hi> saith,
that life is but for a time, or rather it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
but for a time: so the pleasures of life are
but for a time; nay, it followeth there, life
appeareth but for a little time; and the

pleasures and prosperity of life may be made
shorter than this short life it self.</p>

                        <p>II. IN the second place this should serve to
wean us from the love of this world,
and the things of this life, whether it be
wealth, or pleasure, or wordly credit, or
health or strength, or friends or children
that we set our hearts upon, or take content
in: how soon may all, or any of these be
taken from us? or how soon may some such
heavy blow from the hand of the Lord fall
upon us, as may strike dead all the delight
and comfort which we took in these? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the Prophet saith, <hi>Isai. 2. 22. Cease ye
from man whose breath is in his nostrils, for
wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> Cease to put
your trust, or place your content in man,
whether men of high degree, or of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
for he is a mortal creature, soon gone.
When that fading flee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ing breath that issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in and out at his nostrils, is stopped by
death, he is gone: and <hi>wherein is he to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of?</hi> What reckoning should be made
of so frail a creature? So in this case I say,
cease ye from the things of this life, for they
have their breath in their nostrils (as it were)
they are frail, short-lived comforts; and
wherein are they to be accounted of? Here
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:32977:79"/>
then is Christian wisdom to have the heart
crucified to these things when they are at
best, and when a man hath most of them:
then to die to the world, and to look upon
the best things of the world, and the greatest
outward comforts of this life as upon so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dead things: to affect them, and make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them as so many shadows and empty
vanities to use them as dying things. <hi>I am
crucified to the world</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>and
the world is crucified to me.</hi> This is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
wisdom when a man can so carry his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
towards the greatest comforts of this
life, as he would to a thing that is crucified,
to a thing already nailed to the cross, and
dying. It were a vain thing to take a few
flowers and blossoms in the Spring, and to
lock them up safe in a Cabinet, like so many
precious Stones, or Pearls of great value,
meaning to keep them many years: whereas
if he look upon them the next week, he shall
find them dead and withered, their beauty is
gone. And is it not yet a far greater <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lock up the fading comforts of this life in that

                     <p>THE <hi>Proverbs</hi> are like Manna scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the ground by <hi>Solomon,</hi> which
his Servants gathered up, and put into the
Pot for the benefit of Gods people. It is
labour in vain to seek the dependance of
them one upon another; for they do not
(like <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi>) catch one another by
the heel. The Text therefore being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Proposition, I will first open the
words, then draw some doctrinal conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
from them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Children.</hi>] To have Children, is every
way in Scripture commended for a great
blessing, <hi>Psal. 127. 3. Lo, Children are an

Heritage of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Lo,</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed,
implyeth, that a numerous posterity is
an admirable blessing. Worldlings look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
many Children as a great Charge, not as
a temporal blessing. <hi>Children are an Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Lord.</hi>] Implying they do descend
from God, as an Inheritance from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>
                        <hi>Childrens Children</hi>] Here is blessing upon
blessing. That thou art a Father of a Child
is a blessing: and that thy Child is a Father
of Children is a superadded blessing. This
was the blessing of <hi>Rebecca</hi> by her friends at
her departure. <hi>Grow into thousand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,</hi>
Gen. 24. 60. <hi>Blessed is the man that
hath his quiver full of Children,</hi> saith the
Psalmist. When the Lord would shew the
manner of his blessing to the Jews after their
return from captivity, he thus describes it.
<hi>The streets of the City shall be full of Boyes

                        <hi>Are the Crown of old men.</hi>] That is, it is
the honour of old men: or, posterity is a crown
of honour. Then the 3d generation is a treble
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:32977:82"/>
Crown of honour. <hi>Joseph</hi> saw <hi>Ephraims</hi>
Children, of the third generation: the Children
also of <hi>Machir,</hi> the Son of <hi>Manasseh,</hi>
were born upon <hi>Joseph's</hi> knees, <hi>Gen. 50, 23.</hi>
Of the Lord's blessing the last daies of <hi>Job</hi>
more than the first; it is said that <hi>Job</hi> had
seven Sons, and three Daughters; and that
after this <hi>Job</hi> lived an hundred and forty
years, and saw his Sons, and his Son's Sons,
even four generations, <hi>Job 42. 13, 16.</hi>

or Children are a reproach to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:32977:83"/>
and a shame to their Mother: such
crosses as do embitter all their worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
and bring down their gray hairs with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to the grave. Therefore the words are
not to be understood <hi>de</hi>

                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>,
of fair, comely, witty Children: for though
these be outward ornaments, yet they may
be wantons, drunkards, very fools, and so a
reproach to their Fathers. <hi>Absalom</hi> was a
fair and proper man, but <hi>Davids</hi> heavy cross.
<hi>Esau</hi> was a strong man, but <hi>Isaac's</hi> cross; the
Spirit of God calleth him <hi>profane Esau, Hebr.
12.</hi> But the words are meant <hi>de pia posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi>
of a godly posterity, of pious and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Children: they, and only they are the
glory of old men, the joy, hope, comfort,
and support of their aged Parents. Such
Chldren are called Olive Plants and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows:
Olive branches for cheerfulness, and
Arrows for strength and protection. <hi>Happy
is the man that hath his quiver full of them:
they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak
with the enemies in the gate,</hi> Psal. 127. 4, 5.</p>
                     <p>So again, the words are not to be taken for
all Fathers, for there are Fathers that be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:32977:83"/>
disparagements, a shame, a reproach to their
Children, Atheistical, drunken, blasphemous,
adulterous, oppressing Fathers are the stinking
reproaches of their surviving posterity; they are
not the glory of their Children: so the words
are not to be meant of their descent. Many
glory, that they are descended of such a noble
and honourable Stock, from such wealthy or
antient Families. It is an extrinsecal honour
and priviledge, and indeed it is the great
<hi>Diana</hi> of the world. But this is nothing, if
their Fathers were drunkards, whoremongers,
blasphemers, persecutors, hereticks; these foul
vices (like the Plague of Leprosie in the
wall) make such extrinsecal priviledges to be
vile and base. As it was said of <hi>Naaman</hi>
the <hi>Syrian,</hi> Captain of the Host of the King
of <hi>Syria,</hi> that he was <hi>a great man with his
master, and honourable, he was also a mighty
man in valour, but he was a Lepper,</hi> 2 Kings
5. 1. So for any one to say, that such a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
Father was a drunkard, or a swearer,
or an ungodly man, or the like; is a reproach,
and no honour to his posterity. But it is
meant of godly, wise, religious Fathers, they
are a glory of their Children.</p>

                     <p>GOdly Fathers are said to be a glory of
their Children in these following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</p>
                     <p>I. Their very graces are their own and their
Childrens glory, <hi>Prov. 16. 31. The hoary
head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way
of righteousness.</hi> Their very silver hairs are
their crowns. It behooveth the young to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
them for their age. Hoary hair is a
Crown set upon the heads of godly men by
God himself, therefore we ought to reverence
them. Then a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>e their silver hairs true crowns
of glory, when they are found in a way of
righteousness. Grace is the Crown of old
age. The holiness, heavenly-mindedness,
gracious counsels, pious instructions, and
godly conversations of aged persons, winneth
honour and reverence. To see aged men to
be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in
charity, in patience: and the aged women
likewise to be in behaviour as becometh holy
women, to be teachers of good things, to be
discreet, chast, &amp;c. this is a Crown of glory
to them. Otherwise, though men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
live long, and are found in the way of
sin, they are a cursed people, <hi>Isai. 65. 20.
The sinner being an hundred years old, shall be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:32977:84"/>
accursed.</hi> An old drunkard, an old swearer,
an old whoremonger, an old profane world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is a wicked wretch. <hi>Diogenls being asked,</hi>
what was the saddest spectacle in the world,
answered, an old man in misery. But an old
man in misery, is not so vile an object, as an
old man in his sins. To see an old man
durunk; to hear oaths, curses, revilings, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauldry,
come from the mouths of aged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
is a most lamentable thing. Poor
wretches! they lie under the evil of Age
which is burdensom; and they have the evil
of Sin upon them, which is intolerable; and
may daily expect, when their gray hairs shall
be brought down with sorrow to the grave,
yea, to the pit of Hell.</p>
                     <p>II. It is Children's glory, that they are
descended from such gracious and aged Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
We see how the world esteemeth of
descent from men of noble birth, from antient
Stocks and Families. But this is nothing, if
Children do degenerate from their generous
and noble Ancestors. In this respect, if any
glory be due, it is due to the Parents, not to
the Children, unless they tread in the steps of
their worthy Parents: which gave occasion to
<hi>Cicero,</hi> to reprehend <hi>Cateline,</hi> by comparing
the antiquity of his blood, with the vitiosity
of his manners; who saith of him, That he
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:32977:85"/>
was not more famous by the Nobility of his
Parents, than ignominious by his own noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Vices. It is a vanity for men to derive
their Pedigrees from antient Houses, and to
carry themselves unworthy such Ancestors:
surely the Nobility and goodness of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors
cannot so much credit them, as their
own badness and wickedness will discredit
them: But if nobility of blood be joyned with
grace and vertue, it is highly to be esteemed.
Now if men account it an honour to them to
be nobly descended: surely much greater
honour it is to descend from godly Parents;
grace and godliness being much better than
all outward wealth, riches, honour and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
This was the glory and boast of the
Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> that they had <hi>Abraham,
Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> for their Fathers. <hi>We
have Abraham to be our Father,</hi> said the
<hi>Jews, Matth. 3. 9. Our Father Jacob.</hi>] said
the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>. 4. 12. and St.
<hi>Paul</hi> speaking of the priviledges of the Jews,
puts in this for a great priviledge, <hi>Rom. 9. 5.
Of whom are the Fathers.</hi> So it is the glory
and crown of Children, when they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Fathers; when it can be said of them,
as of our Saviour, <hi>Who was the Son of Enos,
which was the Son of Seth, which was the Son
of Adam, which was the Son of God,</hi> Luk. 3.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:32977:85"/>
38. So it is spoken to the honour of such a
Child, when it is said, He is the Son of such
a godly Father, and such a godly Mother;
who were, and are the Sons and Daughters of
God. <hi>Solomon</hi> sets it down as an honour to
him, that he was <hi>the Son of David, Prov. 1.
1.</hi> The Proverbs of <hi>Solomon, the Son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
King of <hi>Israel.</hi> It might well be an
honour to <hi>Solomon</hi> to have the Title, which
was afterwards given to Jesus Christ, <hi>Mat.
1. 1.</hi> It was an honour to young <hi>Timothy,</hi>
that the unfeigned Faith that was in him,
dwelt first in his Grand-Mother <hi>Lois,</hi> and in
his Mother <hi>Eunice, 2 Tim. 1. 5.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>III. It is their glory and Crown, in that
they can glory in this, that God was, and is
the Father of their Fathers. It is a frequent
title in Scripture given to God <hi>[The God of
our Fathers.]</hi> It is that wherein the faithfull
boast. <hi>Except the God of my Father, the God
of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had been
with me,</hi> saith <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Laban:</hi> that is, that
God whom his Father <hi>Isaac</hi> feared, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
<hi>Genes. 31. 42.</hi> God himself glorieth
in this title. <hi>I am the God of Abraham, the
God of Isaac, and the God of Israel.</hi> The
Lord appeared unto <hi>Isaac</hi> at <hi>Beer-sheba,</hi> and
said, <hi>I am the God of Abraham thy Father,</hi>
Genes. 26. 24. So the Lord said unto <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:32977:86"/>
I am God, the God of thy Father,</hi> Genes.
46. 3. So the Lord said unto <hi>Moses, I am
the God of thy Father, the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,</hi> Exod.
3. 6. And when he sent <hi>Moses</hi> to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Israel,</hi> he said unto him, Thus shalt
thou say unto the Children of <hi>Israel, The
Lord God of your Fathers, the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,
hath sent me unto you. This is my Name for
ever, and my Memorial unto all Generations,</hi>
ver. 15. This is a memorial of my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
of my truth and constancy in my
promises made with your Fathers, that all
succeeding Generations may see, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
me to be a God keeping Truth
and Covenant for ever. The glorious God
is not ashamed to be called the Father of his
people; neither is Christ ashamed to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
their Brother. Now that their believing
Parents are thus allyed to God, to Jesus
Christ, to all the company of Angels and
Saints, what an honour and crown of glory is
this unto the Children?</p>
                     <p>IV. The Parents being in Covenant,
maketh their Children holy, this is a glory to
their Children. <hi>1 Cor. 7. 14.</hi> because they
come of a believing Parent, they are fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
holy; for God covenanteth with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:32977:86"/>
Parents, that he will be the God of
them, and of their seed. So the Apostle,
<hi>Rom, 11. 16.</hi> If the first-fruits be holy, the
lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so
are the branches. The Apostle proveth
there, that the Children of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are within the Covenant of God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Parents, the Children too. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the seed of the Jews are not finally
rejected, for they be the seed of faithfull <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
they spring from that holy root. That
which he made an Argument for the Children
of faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> is a good Argument for
the Children of all faithfull Parents. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
being within the Covenant, so are the
Children: for the Children are as the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
the Parents as the root: Children as
the lump, Parents as the first-fruits. It is
the ground why Christian Parents bring their
Children to Baptisme, to receive the Seal of
the Covenant, because the Children are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in that Covenant, <hi>Act. 2. 38, 39.
Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the
Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of
sins,</hi> &amp;c. (saith <hi>Peter</hi> to his hearers) <hi>for the
Promise is to you, and unto your Children.</hi> God
owneth such for his people, for his Sons and
Daughters, who are in Covenant with him.
Other people are called by the name of that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:32977:87"/>
Idol-god which they worshipped; as the
<hi>Moabites.</hi> were called the people of <hi>Chemosh,</hi>
because they worshipped an Idol so called,
<hi>Jerem. 48. 46.</hi> So likewise the <hi>Ammonites</hi>
are called the people of <hi>Milcom,</hi> because
they worshipped an Idol so called. And
<hi>Euripides</hi> calleth the <hi>Athenians</hi> the people of
<hi>Minerva,</hi> because they worshipped that
Goddess: by this you may gather that those
whom God owns for his people, are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
for to be the people of God is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-stile:
and this the Children of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Parents are.</p>
                     <p>V. Godly Parents are a glory and honour
to their Children, in that for their sakes the
blessing of the Lord falls upon their Children,
<hi>Prov. 20. 7. The just man walketh in his
integrity, his Children are blessed after him.</hi>
The Hebrew word denoteth one that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in all godliness constantly to the end,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>

                        <hi>beat itudines,</hi> blessings shall be upon
his Children. God hath graciously promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that he will shew mercy to thousands of
them that love him, and keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
What a motive should this be to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
to stir up Parents to labour after god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.
Ye would have your Children to be
rich, and many men do adventure the loss of
their immortal Souls to advance their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:32977:87"/>
now <hi>the blessing of the Lord maketh
rich, and addeth no sorrow with it.</hi> God
doth sometimes divert his anger from the
Children of Godly Parents, and give them
special mercies. It is a frequent passage in
Scripture, nevertheless for my servant <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
sake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So God saith of <hi>Solomon, I
will make him Prince all the daies of my life,
for David my servant</hi>'s <hi>sake, whom I chose,</hi>
&amp;c. 1. Kings 10. 34. So in the daies of
<hi>Abijam,</hi> it is said, <hi>Nevertheless for</hi> David<hi>'s
sake did the Lord his God give him a Lamp
in Jerusalem, to set up his Son after him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

servants.</p>
                     <p>VI. It is a glory to a Child, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dies a servant of the Lord: his death is
precious in the sight of the Lord, and in the
sight of man. It is the highest commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that can be given of any one, that he
died the servant of the Lord, <hi>Moses my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
is dead,</hi> said God to <hi>Josua,</hi> Jos. 1. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>
Such a one is dead that was the servant of the
Lord, what greater commendation than this
can be given to any? Worldlings will say,
such a one died worth so many hundreds by
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:32977:88"/>
the year, worth so many thousands of pounds;
poor creatures! did not the fool in the Gospel
die rich? Did not the glutton die rich? What
commendation is it to say of such a one, he
was rich, but a glutton, a fool, an adulterer,
an oppressour, a covetous unjust dealer?
What honour is this to the Children of such
a man enjoying his wealth and riches? And
as his death is precious, so the memorial of a
good man after his death is precious. <hi>The
memory of the just shall endure, but the name
of the wicked shall rot.</hi>

                     <p>IN the next place I shall also shew, how
Children are the glory of their Fathers.</p>
                     <p>I. Their filial obedience to their just and
lawful commands is an honor to their Parents.
Therefore in the fifth Commandement it is
said, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> that
is out of reverential obedience to them. St.
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Eph. 6. 2.</hi> That <hi>it is the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
with promise.</hi> But it may be
said, Is not the second Commandement with
promise? The answer is two-fold. There is
a double Commandement, affirmative, and
negative: This is the first affirmative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement:
or rather, it is the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
in the second Table, to shew,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:32977:88"/>
that next after the care of Religion, our duty
to Parents must be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<note place="margin">Diis &amp; Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus nunquam satis fit. <hi>Aristot.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> could say, God
and Parents cannot be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
required. The Heathen
punished injuries to God, and
Parents alike. <hi>Valer.</hi> lib. 1. <hi>Qui dubitat
utrum oporteat Deos revereri, aut Parentes,
non indiget natione, sed pari poenÃ¢.</hi> Arist.
Topic. <hi>lib. 8.</hi> He that doubteth whether
God or Parents be to be reverenced, needs
not to be confuted by reason, but by the same
punishment. Now stubbornness in a Child
is a reproach to his Father. <hi>Who so keepeth
the law, is a wise Son, but he that is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of riotous men, shameth his Father,</hi> Prov.
28. 7. God ordained a Law, that such Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
should be stoned to death, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
should be the first that should throw a
stone upon them, to shew, how hainous
a sin stubbornness is in Children, <hi>Deut. 21.
20, 21.</hi> The sins of Riot and Drunkenness
were not by <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law punishable by
death: this punishment therefore was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon a riotous Son, in respect of his
disobedience to his Parents, which greatly
aggravated his sin, and for which he was to
die, when other Drunkards escaped with
lighter punishment. The <hi>Rechabites</hi> were
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:32977:89"/>
an honour to their Father, in that they kept
the Commandement of <hi>Jonadab,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Rechab</hi> their Father.</p>
                     <p>II. When they shall give pliable atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the godly instructions, and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their Fathers. <hi>A wise Son heareth
the instructions of his Father; but a scorner
heareth not rebuke,</hi> Prov. 13. 1. It is an high
point of folly and contempt when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is wisely charming, and the Son stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
his ear against the voice of the charmer.
<hi>Hear ye Children the instruction of a Father,
and attend to know understanding,</hi> Prov. 4. 1.
Children are sluggish, &amp; had need to be often
called upon to hearken to pious instruction.
None can be more faithfull to
give counsel to thee,<note place="margin">Gregor. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. lib. 1.</note> than he
that loveth not thine, but thee,

Parents &amp; therefore most worthy to be heard.
Godly Parents take care of their own Souls,
and therefore will not neglect the Souls of
their Children. Therefore saith <hi>Gregory,

not Children slight the sharp rebukes of
faithfull Parents, seeing it is for the good of
their S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Child bear withall, if not with his own
Father?</p>
                     <p>III. When Children walk in the holy
steps of their godly Parents, and are follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of them, as they are of Christ. Such a
one is an honour, and no shame to his Father.
There cannot be a better resemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Child and a Father, than this spir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
resemblance in that which is good. This
was ever the praise, or ignominious brand of
the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> That those that were
godly, they did walk after the Lord, as did
<hi>David</hi> their Father: or who walked in the
way of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who made Israel to sin.
So it is the high commendation of a Son,
when it shall be said, he walketh in the same
holy religious course, as did, as doth his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It is the reporach of both, when as
they say of a Child, that he is a drunkard, or
a swearer, his Father was so before him.
How doth St. <hi>John</hi> honour the elect Lady in
his Epistle to her, with a praiseful memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
2 Epist. Joh. 4. <hi>I rejoyced greatly, that I
found of thy Children walking in truth, as we
have received a commandment from the Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IV. A wise Son is an honour to a godly
Father. <hi>A wise Son maketh a glad Father,</hi>
Prov. 10. 1. So in <hi>Prov. 23. 15. My Son,
if thine heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>le wise, my heart shall rejoyce,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:32977:90"/>
even mine.</hi> Such a Son is an honour to his
Father while he liveth. <hi>My Son be wise, and
make my heart glad, that I may answer him
that reproacheth me,</hi> Prov. 27. 11. Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to leave memorials behind them: a wise
and godly Son is a better Monument of a
Father, than a stately Pallace left behind
him. <hi>Absalom</hi> having no Son, he built him
a Pillar, to keep his Name in remembrance,
2 Sam. 18. 18. A grave Divine tells us of
an ancient Minister of good note in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who being unmarried himself, reasoned
with a married Gentlewoman about the best
Estate of the two, pleading his great free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from family cares, and for his studies:
She calleth a Child of hers, and catechizeth
him before the Minister. Now Sir (said she)
you had need serve God while you live, for
he shall get no glory by you in this world
when you are dead. This Child may honour
God, when I am dead and gone, and others
that may come from him to the worlds end.
Godly Children, as they are an honour and
comfort to their Parents while they live, so
they honour the memory of their Parents,
when they are dead. But as for foolish and
wicked Children, they are like Peacocks,
which uncover the house where they roost, or
the Ivy, that pulls down the wall that holds
it up.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:32977:90"/>
V. Parents and Children, will be mutual
crowns and glory to each other at the day of
Judgement. When the Father shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
his godly Children before Christ, Lord,
here are the Children whom thou hast given
me; blessing and praising God for them;
how will the Children bless God for such a
Father, and bless the Father for his example,
and pious instructions.</p>

and regard not, though their Sons

                        </gap>me and reproach, be a
stinking generation and family, walking in
their sins. <hi>Diogenes,</hi> when he saw a young
man drunk, said, the reason was, because his
Father begat him when he was drunk. In
like manner when he saw a young man beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Father, he said, he doth it because his
Father did neglect his duty to him in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him up. The wicked lives and dissolute
conversations of Fathers, is the cause of their
Sons wickedness. Hearken to me all ye Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
let me demand of you; Are not ye
the propagators of original sin to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:32977:91"/>
which maketh them Children of wrath,
and heirs of damnation? Will not ye rest
there, but must you needs by your wicked
and licencious conversation make them two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
more the Children of Hell, Hast not
thou sins enough to answer for? but thou
must have their sins upon thy score too? Ye
wicked Parents, that sin in the sight of your
Children, you draw them to sin as you do:
a Parents sin committed in the sight of a
Child, is a double sin. It is said of a corrupt
generation, Hos. 2. 3, 4. <hi>Their Mother plaid
the Harlot, and they are the Children of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</hi>
The Holy Ghost seemeth to give in
this as the reason why the Children are the
Children of whoredoms, <hi>viz.</hi> Because their
Mother plaid the Harlot: so that there was
a succession of wickedness among them. Take
heed therefore O ye Parents, of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infection upon your Children, to make
them like your selves in wickedness, and the
guilt of your sins, and to bring them to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of God<hi>'s</hi> Judgements together with
your selves. The <hi>Switzers</hi> foresaw this,
who enacted a Law, that if a Child were
condemned to die, the Father should exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
him; because that usually the neglect
and evil carriage of Parents, is the fountain
of all misery and wickedness in their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:32977:91"/>
Oh, what cruel Parents are they to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren!
that will lie, swear, curse, in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Children, that will teach them to
lie, to game, to steal, to use deceit, to break the
Sabbath, as if they would have them to learn
the Devils Carechism without book? Thou
that art a Father of Children, consider thou,
that at the resurrection day, thy Children,
whose damnation thou didst further by thy
wicked example, will curse thee to thy face.
Cursed be that Father that begat me, and
the Womb that bare me, and the Paps that
gave me suck: Oh! that there had been news
brought to my Father, that a Toad, or a
Snake had been born to him, when it was
said, there is a man-child born. Then will
the Son cry out in Hell-torments, I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come into this place of torment, had not
my Father been; had he given me good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
a good example, I had not been
cast into this dark dungeon. I learnt to curse
and blaspheme from that cursed blasphemous
Father. I learn'd to be drunk from that
drunken Father. I learn'd to mock at piety
and holiness, to scoff at the wayes and people
of God, of that scoffing Father. I learn'd to
prophane the Sabbath, I neglected Prayers in
my family, I neglected the hearing of the
Word, for my Father did so before me: he
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:32977:92"/>
was an Atheist, and so was I. Oh, that I had
been his currish Dog, his filthy Hog, rather
than his beloved Son. As they in <hi>Rome</hi> said
of <hi>Nero,</hi> because of his cruelty, it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

labour more to make their Children rich,
great, glorious in the eye of the world, than
to make them gracious and glorious in the
eye of God, who care not by what unjust
means they scrape their wealth together, to
leave behind them a rich posterity, and care
not that their Children be enriched with

laid up much riches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
With his goods
(saith <hi>Salvian</hi>) he
prepareth happiness
for others, misery for
himself: mirth and jollity for others, tears
and sorrow for himself; a short pleasure for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:32977:92"/>
others, everlasting torment for himself. His
heirs that possessed his wealth and substance,
did game, take their ease, eat, drink, and
were merry: and this poor covetous wretch
was howling and roaring, weeping and
wailing in Hell. Oh, what fools are those
Parents, that labour more for temporal ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
for their Children, than for grace and
godliness! God usually crosseth such Parents
in their plots and purposes: their Children
after them usually do prodigally spend that
wealth which the Parents wickedly scraped
together: and the Parents are tormented in
Hell, whiles their prodigal Children are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and jovial upon earth: Graceless Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are drinking and gaming and drabbing,
spending their daies in mirth and pleasure,
whiles the wretched covetous Father is houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
roaring, and tormented in Hell. Now
if thy everlasting confusion, be either thine,
or thy Childrens glory, much good may it do
thee. Such Parents are the most deadly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
their to own Children. Many wicked
men (like <hi>Ahab</hi>) kill, and take possession of
the Vineyards and Inheritances of poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents,
and settle them upon their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as firm as firm as Law can make them, to them
and to their Heris for ever: But after all this,
if such Parents would but cast up their Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:32977:93"/>
they would see, they had damned
themselves to enrich their Children: and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
their Children to undo them: they
had brought the curse of God upon their own
Souls, to leave their Children that, which
should undo them and theirs. How politick
was <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to entail the Kingdom of Israel
to his own line! and therefore sets up two gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Calves, the one at <hi>Dan,</hi> the other at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi>
to hinder the people from going up to
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> to worship, where King <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boham</hi>
was. But that very course of his, by
making Israel to sin, was the ruine of him and
his house. The Lord swept away the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of his house, as a man sweepeth away
dung, till all be gone, <hi>1 Kings 14. 16.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ye that are Parents, ye can love your
selves in your own persons, and in the images
of your nature, and in those that are the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of your families, the Children which
God hath given you. Therefore when you
commit great sins, or leave great estates to
your Children wickedly gotten, what do ye
but represent the future estate of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and as it were slay them with your own
inhumane and barbarous hands! Oh, how
vile a person is that Father or Mother, who
for a little money gotten by usury, extortion,
or oppression, will leave an Estate to their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:32977:93"/>
Children, and the curse of God with it, and
become parricides, and embrue their hands in
the blood and ruine of their own Children!
Many men think no course amiss, so they
may set their nests on high, and make their
seed great on earth, <hi>Habbak. 2. 9.</hi> But in this
they are utterly deceived, for this is the very
next way to bring the curse of God upon
their Children. How often is that snatch'd
away by others, which men provided for their
own Children, and that of <hi>Solomon</hi> is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
<hi>The Riches of the sinner is laid up for
the just,</hi> Prov. 13. 22. Thus the Estate of
<hi>Haman</hi> was given unto <hi>Mordecai. Solomon</hi>
speaking of an oppressour, saith, <hi>That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
a Son in whose hand is nothing,</hi> Eccles. 5.
14. <hi>Wo be to him that coveteth an evil cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
to his house.</hi> There hangs a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over the heads of the Children, for the
Fathers covetousness, as rain in the clouds,
which perhaps in their Sons, or in their
Grand-childs dayes may come down as a
mighty flood upon their House, <hi>Habak. 2. 9.
Thou hast consulted shame to thine own house
by cutting off many people, and hast sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thy Soul: for the stone shall cry out of
the wall, and the beam out of the Timber shall
answer thee, ver. 10.</hi> Such Parents are no

to Parents, when they have
ridings that a Child is born unto them;
Take the mercy, but remember your duty,
lest this or that Child be not one day thy
greatest shame and reproach, which is at
present thy joy and comfort, for according to
thy fatherly duties, so will thy comfort, or
thy sorrows be. Do ye desire your Children
may be your joy, and not your sorrows; your
glory and crown, and not your reproach and
shame, then walk wisely towards them, and
before them: be thou a glory to them, so
may they prove thy glory and crown. Now
that you and they may be crowns and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to each other, consider these following
duties.</p>
                     <p>I. Give a good example of an holy life
to your Children: be frequent in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise

Thus <hi>David</hi> did, Psal. 101. 2. He would

godly, in a perfect way of godliness before his
Children and Servants. Examples of Parents
have a strong influence into the manners of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:32977:94"/>
their Children. Personal sins are usually
derived from Parents to Children by their
bad lives: for a Father to lie, to swear, to be
drunk, to neglect holy duties, this hath
a great influence upon the Children. A
Son may inherit the Father's sin by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
by following his example, and
doing the same sin, and the proverb is,
The young birds will do, as they see the old
ones do before them. We read that more
than forty Children were destroyed by two
she-bears for mocking the Prophet <hi>Elisha,
2 Kings 2. 23, 24.</hi> One hath this Query

Though we might suppose
that they were of such a tender
age, that they were ignorant of
the evil of this action, yet having learn'd
this from their Parents, God sent this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon them to punish the Children and
the Parents at once: for doubtless they had
learn'd that mocking Language from their
Parents, at least by hearing them say so to
the Prophet <hi>Elisha,</hi> Go up thou bald-head,
go up thou bald-head, if they had not taught
them to say so. Which scoff they cast upon

                        <hi>Elisha,</hi> in allusion to the rapture, or carrying
up of <hi>Elijah</hi> to Heaven. As if they had said,
Go thou up also to Heaven as <hi>Elijah</hi> did
that we may be rid of thee, as we are of him.

drawn from the word of God. <hi>Henoch</hi> had
his name, as one taught from his Youth, and
consecrate unto God. God commanded his
people, <hi>Deut. 6, 7. Thou shalt rehearse
these words continually unto thy Children.</hi>
The word is, Thou shalt whet them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
upon thy Children: as when an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
or other Instrument is sharpened, that
it may pierce the deeper. It implyeth two
duties, 1. That the Parent make his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
delivered, plain and piercing, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity
giving it an edge, that it may the
more easily enter into the dull heads, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:32977:96"/>
pierce the hard hearts of his Children. 2. That
he repeat it again and again, going often o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the same thing, as the Knife goeth often
over the whet-stone, as the beast in chewing
the Cud. <hi>Abraham</hi> is highly commended
of God for instructing his Family. I know
<hi>Abraham</hi> will command his Sons, and his
houshold after him, that they keep the way
of the Lord, <hi>Genes. 18. 19.</hi> He taught
them the substance of the Law, in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to do Righteousness and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and the substance of the Gospel, in
declaring unto them the tenour of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
promises: that in him, or his seed,
that is in Christ (the promised seed, who
was to come of his loins) all the Nations of
the earth should be blessed: as also the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Circumcision. <hi>Genes. 17. 23. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
professed, that he and his house would
serve the Lord, <hi>Jes. 24. 15.</hi> Intimating,
that he would instruct his Family in the true
knowledge, and right manner of the worship
of God, without which they could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
any acceptable service unto him. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
taught his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> and laid this
Charge upon him, <hi>And thou</hi> Solomon <hi>my
Son, know the God of thy Father, and serve
him with a perfect heart, and with a willing
mind,</hi> 1 Chron. 28: 9. So others, <hi>Psal. 34.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:32977:96"/>
11. Come ye Children, hearken to me, I will
teach you the fear of the Lord.</hi> Thus <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
instructeth his Son <hi>Rehoboam</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Book of the Proverbs. <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
professeth as much of himself. <hi>The
living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do
this day: The Father to the Son shall declare
thy truth,</hi> Isai. 38. 19. He established a
testimony in <hi>Jacob,</hi> and appointed a Law in
Israel, which he commanded our Fathers,
that they should make them known to their
Children, that they might set their hope in
God, and not forget the works of God, but
keep his Commandements, and might not be
as their Fathers, a stubborn, and rebellious
generation, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>IV. Have a watchful eye over the duties,
practices and conversations of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<hi>David</hi> would not suffer a worker of
deceit to dwell in his house, nor a teller of
lies to carry in his sight, <hi>Psal. 101. 7.</hi> Oh,
take heed of countenancing or allowing your
Children in any sin. Their sins, and thy
neglect of godly reproof, will make thee
stink in the Land as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> made
<hi>Jacob</hi> their Father to stink, his name to stink
among the people of the Land. Take heed
of cockering, and over-much indulging
your Children. It is observed, that usually
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:32977:97"/>
that Child which the Parent cockereth most,
regardeth the Parent least; and many times
proveth the heaviest cross unto it: making
him to speak in bitterness of Soul, Why died
it not from the womb? <hi>Job 3. 11.</hi>
One saith,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bolton's</hi> Direct. p. 19.</note> That the bloody knife of
Parents unconscionable and cruel
neglect in training up their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
religiously, doth stick full deep in their
Souls. We have read and heard of some
Children that have been loosely trained up,
who have pierced their Parents hearts with
sorrow, yea and their throats too, who have
stuck the knife in the bowels of their Parents.
A certain fond Mother must not
have her Child corrected at School
when he deserved correction.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Woodw.</hi> Child's Patrim.</note> Not
long after the Child angred the
Mother, and the Mother struck the Child: he
runs to the fire, and up with the fire-fork,
and at the Mother he makes, threatning what
he would do. The Mother would not have
her Child struck with a rod, to let out his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the Child offers to strike the Mother
with the fire-fork. Then the Mother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens
to the School-master, as much displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the Child, as ever before she was
pleased with it. Another Parent so doted
upon her Child, that she could not endure it
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:32977:97"/>
out of her sight: but at last he proved so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
that she would have sent this Son to
the remorest Islands: any where, so he were
on ship-board (that would keep him in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
which a Prison did not) or out of her
sight. That Child which the Parent so coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kereth,
that it must not be out of his sight, is
the Child that is most like to be an eye-sore,
and heart-grief to the Parent, to whom the
Parent is most like to say, <hi>Stand out of my
sight,</hi> thou art a burden to me. S. <hi>Augustine</hi>
gives us a sad relation of one <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> a man
mighty both in word and work,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Agust.</hi> Serm. 33. ad Fratres in Eremo.</note>
but a very fond and indulgent
Father. One Son he had, and
but one, and because but one,
he must have his will; he must not feel the
rod, he must not be crossed. He might
have what he would, and do what he listed;
he might go forth, and return when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
he gave no account either of his purse or
time: we read in the story, that this Child
brought his Mother to shame; nay, more
than so. This Child came home drunk, and
in the day time he violently and shameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abused his Mother great with Child, he
killed his Father out-right, and mortally
wounded two Sisters. Hereupon a great
Assembly was called, that all Parents hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:32977:98"/>
so sad and lamentable a Tragedy, might
for ever beware of this loose and sottish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
which brings woe to the Parent,
and ruine to the Child.</p>
                     <p>V. Pray for your Children, that they may
glorifie God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and so be your glory and crown,
this was <hi>Job</hi>'s practice, <hi>Job 1. 5.</hi> Job <hi>sent,
and sanctified his Children, and rose up early
in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings
according to the number of them all.</hi> Whiles
his Children were feasting, he was fasting:
while they were merry, he was mourning and
sacrificing, lest his Sons should blaspheme
and dishonour God. A godly Father's Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
do fly to Heaven, and return into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
of his posterity with rich and pretious
blessings. If these rules I have propounded
here, were well and conscionably observed,
Parents and Children would be a crown and
glory to one another: and God would set an
incorruptible crown of glory upon the heads
both of Parents and Children.</p>

this Message, that he would have a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
according to the first Institution and
pattern, and would not have them abide any

2 <hi>Chron. 29. 10.</hi> They laughed the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

God of your Fathers,</hi> ver. 7. They that will
erre by their Fathers Copy, may also perish
by their Fathers example. In the beginning
of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign in <hi>England,</hi> the
Papists made a Supplication to that King of
happy memory: one branch whereof was
this. We request no more favour at your

                        <p>Many of our Fathers lived in times of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance:
had they lived in the light which
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:32977:99"/>
we do, it is not probable they would have

and Count <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> was by a
certain Prince advised, for his Religion to
follow the example of his Father <hi>Lewes,</hi> his
answer was, <hi>In Religione, non Parentum, non
majorum exempla sequenda, sed tantum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas
Dei.</hi> In matters of Religion, we must
neither follow the examples of Parents, nor
Ancestors, but the will of God only is to be
regarded. And for this resolution, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the testimony of the Lord out of
<hi>Ezek. 20. Walk ye not in the Statutes of your
Fathers, nor observe their Judgements, nor
defile your selves with their Idols: I am the
Lord, walk ye in my Statutes,</hi> vers. 18, 19.
Therefore it was a good Confession of the
Church, <hi>Psal. 106. 6. We have erred with
our Fathers.</hi> S. <hi>Hierom</hi> once desired of S.
<hi>Augustine,</hi> that he might have leave to erre
with seven Fathers whom he found of his
opinion. I should not crave that leave, nor
envy any one the priviledge. The Fathers
are but Children when they erre: and they
who will erre with their Fathers, are more
foolish than Children.</p>

did our Saviour threaten the Jewes with all
the blood which their Fathers had shed cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly?
Wherefore behold, I send unto you
Prophets, and wise men, and Scribes, and

not the blood of Christ upon the Children of

more Instances to shew the truth, how God
doth punish the Children for the sins of their
Fathers: to convince us, of what concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is for us to confess their sins before
the Lord, as well as our own; and to deterr
Fathers from sinning against God. Ye may
see, that Fathers in sinning, do not only sin to
their own destruction, but to the destruction
of the Children that are yet unborn: ye lay
up Estates and Portions for your Children,
and God layes up wrath and vengeance,

                     <p>NOw because there are objections, which
perhaps may arise in your thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

his Father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled
his brother by violence, and did that which is
not good among his people, lo even he shall die
in his iniquity. <hi>So in</hi> Jerem. 31. 29, 30. In
those dayes they shall say no more, the Fathers
have eaten sour grapes, and the Childrens teeth
are set on edge, but every one shall die for his own
iniquity: and every man that eateth the sour
grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge. <hi>How
can these Scriptures be reconciled with that
in the second commandment, where God is
said to visit the sins of the Fathers upon the
Children to the third and fourth generation,
&amp;c. how can it agree with these dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Judgements?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> There are divers answers given here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I. Origen,</hi> and some others make an alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical
Interpretation, and say, that by the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:32977:103"/>
third and fourth generation is not meant Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but so many degrees of sins, as if God
would spare men for the first and second
fault, and punish the third and fourth. But
this is a false and foolish conceit, because God
sometimes punisheth men for the first sin.
God chastised <hi>David</hi> for one act of adultery.</p>
                     <p>II. Some answer it by distinction of civil
and divine punishments. The Civil Law,
which God made for the Common-wealth
of <hi>Israel,</hi> did forbid to put the Child to death
for the sin of the Father: as <hi>Deut. 24. 16.</hi>
The Fathers shall not be put to death for the
Children, nor shall the Children be put
to death for the Fathers: Every man shall
be put to death for his own sin. But God,
who is the supreme Judge of the whole
world, and is not tied to humane Law,
punisheth Children for their Fathers sins.
But this answer is not sufficient, for those
places of <hi>Jerem. 31.</hi> and <hi>Ezek. 18.</hi> speak
not of a civil, but of a divine punishment.</p>
                     <p>III<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Others again answer it thus, that
God punisheth the sins of Fathers on their
Children, if they do such like sins as their
Father. He will punish the Children for their
Fathers Idolatry, if their Children are Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
also, and punish them that hate God,
as their Fathers did before them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="182" facs="tcp:32977:104"/>
If this were true, then those places in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah,</hi>
and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> were answered with this
exception. The Son shall not bear the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of his Father, unless the Son be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
too: the Childrens teeth shall not be
set on edge unless they eat sowre grapes, as
their Fathers did before them. But this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is not to the purpose neither.</p>
                     <p>1. Because Children have been punished
for their Fathers sins, which they never imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
as the Children of the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were
destroyed with the same destruction their
Fathers were.</p>
                     <p>2. Sometimes the Children who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,
have been outwardly miserable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Fathers were exceeding sinful.</p>
                     <p>3. Because then God did not punish the
sins of their Fathers on them, so much as
their own personal sins: not punish their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Idolatry, but their own Idolatry; nor
their Fathers Adultery, but their own.</p>
                     <p>4. The force of the threatning is taken
away; for God brings that threatning of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting
their Idolatry upon their Children, to
make Fathers to take heed of Idolatry. Then
this would be the sense of it, according to
their interpretation. Take heed, ye Fathers,
of Idolatry, for I will punish your third and
fourth generation if they be Idolaters. By
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:32977:104"/>
these reasons it is evident, that this answer,
that God punisheth Children for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sins, because Children follow their
Fathers in their sins, is not sufficient.</p>
                     <p>IV. This answer may give full satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
There is a three-fold evil of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with which God visits sinners.</p>
                     <p>1. There is eternal damnation: so no
Child is punished for his Fathers sins, but <hi>the
Soul that sinneth, that shall die.</hi> Every man
is damned for his own proper sins: only such
as eat the sowre grapes of sin, they shall gnash
their teeth in Hell.</p>
                     <p>2. There is <hi>malum morale,</hi> a moral evil.
God his giving up the Children to follow
their Fathers steps, is a punishment for their
Fathers sins. But this God doth not inflict
upon them as they are sins, but by denying
grace to the Children of wicked Parents, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which denial they fall into the like sins
their Fathers did before them. God deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grace to the posterity of Idolaters, they
commit Idolatry also.</p>
                     <p>3. There is <hi>malum naurae,</hi> evils of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
as Losses, Crosses, Afflictions, Famine,
Sword, Plague, temporal death. God often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
punisheth the Children for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sins with these temporal punishments:
For <hi>Gehazi</hi>'s Covetousness, his posterity
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:32977:105"/>
shall be leprous, and for the mutiny of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
and <hi>Abiram,</hi> their Children perished
with them. For <hi>David</hi>'s Adultery, the
Sword shall never depart from his house to all
successions: So oftentimes it falls out, that
for the riot, adulteries, or oppressions of Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors,
Children are brought to a morsel of
bread. The reason is, because God in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Children, punisheth the Fathers also,
<hi>Qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap> Filii quaedam pars parentum,</hi> because
Children are part of their Fathers, as bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are part of the tree: therefore the good
that is bestowed on the Child, or the evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on him, is the good and evil of the
Father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> But how can the evils which Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
suffer when their Fathers are dead, be a
punishment to him that is deid? how can the
evil which the fourth generation suffereth, be
the evil of the Father, dead it may be many
years before?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Resp. 1.</hi> I answer yes, they are evils to
them, because God threatens them as punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to them. Shall we think, that God
would threaten this as an evil, if it were not?
look as other evils threatned, which follow
the wicked after they are dead, are a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
as the name of the wicked shall rot,
shall stink when they are dead: They that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:32977:105"/>
pass by their graves shall say, Here lieth a
beastly drunkard; here lieth a profane swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
a cruel oppressour. These are curses,
though they are not sensible of them. So,
when God shall ruine the posterity of wicked
men, it is a sore punishment to them. As
now it is a mercy to just men, that their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
(when they are dead) shall be blessed, and
that the seed of the Righteous shall be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
on earth. Then on the contrary, if the
seed of a man be cursed, it is a punishment
to the Fathers.</p>
                     <p>2. We are not to judge of punishment
only by our sense and feeling, as if it were
no punishment, because dead men are not
sensible of the miseries of their Children: but
we are also to judge of punishment by the
evil which is in it. Now it is a sore evil,
when God shall for the sins of our Fathers

                     <p>3. It is a punishment to the Fathers, though
dead; because it is directly contrary to their
wills and intentions. Fathers would have
their Children, rich and happy after their
death, and would have their Houses and
Names to contiue for ever: but God in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
ruinates their Families, and cloatheth
their Children or Childrens Children with
misery as with a garment.</p>

Fathers?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I answer yes, God sometimes may,
and doth deprive such of their honours and
estates, and takes them away with temporal
death for the sins of their Fathers. But then
the evils which such Children endure, are
only <hi>parentum poenae,</hi> their Fathers punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and are <hi>filiorum probationes, medicinae,
exercitia,</hi> the Childrens tryals, medicines,
exercises. God in mercy turneth their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
into their spiritual advantage: God
makes their death a passage to glory, and life
eternal. And these afflictions, (though they
are the punishments of their Fathers, yer shall
work out for them a greater weight of glory.
Here let me add these things.</p>
                     <p>1. We must hold this as an undeniable
truth, that God is alwayes righteous in all his
administrations of Judgements, whether in
punishing Parents, or Children for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
sake. Though the Judgements of God
are sometime hidden, yet they are never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just.
There is no iniquity in the wayes of
God, though we cannot see the equity of
them.</p>
                     <p>2. There is a matter of condemnation in
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:32977:106"/>
all Children, though God sometimes in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
doth not punish them with an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
relation to their own sins.</p>
                     <p>3. When God visits Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
then usually he doth it for the sins of
the present generation, as for the sins of our
Fathers. Our sins, and the iniquities of our
Fathers do joyn forces to bring down Plagues
and devastations upon the Kingdom. The
Jews were led into Captivity for their own
sins, and their Fathers also. So <hi>Daniel</hi> in
his Confession of sins acknowledgeth, We,
our Kings, our Princes, our Fathers, and all
Israel have sinned.</p>

to Children sincerely confessing
the iniquities of their Fathers, as well as

26. 40, 41, 42. If they shall confess their
iniquity, and the iniquity of their Fathers,
with their trespass which they have trespassed
against me, and that also they have walked
contrary to me, and that I have also walked
contrary to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then will I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
my Covenant with <hi>Jacob,</hi> and also my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

1. Sometime it procureth and obtaineth a
delay, and putting off the pouring forth the
wrath of God upon a Family, Person, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
God oftentimes delayeth the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
not remitting the sins. As upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>'s
humiliation, he delayed the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but did not remit the sins of him and
his house: yet for his humiliation, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
should be prorogued to his Son's
daies, 2 <hi>Reg. 21. 29.</hi> Upon <hi>Moses</hi> his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
for <hi>Israels</hi> murmuring, he remitted
the execution of his wrath, but remitted
not their sin, <hi>Numb. 14. 18.</hi> ad 23. We
have a clear Instance for this in <hi>Josiah,</hi> who
humbled himself for the iniquities of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and the sins of Israel: and the Lord
put off the execution of his wrath, till he was
laid in his grave, 2 <hi>Chron. 34. 21, 24,</hi> ad 28.
Perhaps the second generation may die in
peace; or it may be the third and the fourth
generation shall bear the iniquities of their
Fathers it is no small mercy that wrath breaks
not in upon the first generation.</p>
                     <p>2. If it doth not keep off, and procure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
of execution, but wrath from the Lord
breaks in upon u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>, yet it may mitigate the
wrath of God: so that God (though justly he
might) yet proceeds not to a final devasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Persons, Families and Kingdoms, but
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:32977:107"/>
a remnant may, and shall escape, <hi>Jerem. 39.
16, 17, 18.</hi> Thus God bids <hi>Jeremy</hi> tell
<hi>Ebed-melech</hi> the Ethiopian, that though he
would bring his words upon the City of
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> for evil; yet say thou to him, <hi>I
will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not
fall by the Sword, but thy life shall be for a prey
unto thee, because thou hast put thy trust in me,
saith the Lord.</hi> And that God made them
not as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> but left a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<hi>Ezra</hi> acknowledgeth in his confession,
<hi>Ezra 9. 8. And now for a little space grace
hath been shewed from the Lord our God, to
leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a
nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten
our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our
bondage.</hi> When people are generally stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
and wicked, God sometimes makes a
full end of them, when their determinate
day of visitation is come upon them, he
overthrows Families, as he overthrew <hi>Sodom</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> cutting down root and branch,
and casting them into the fire.</p>
                     <p>3. Sometimes it procureth a shortening
of the day of visitation, God will not length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
out their judgement: will not (as justly
he might) spin out their time of calamity.
For mine elects sake these dayes of calamity
shall be shortened. The day of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>'s
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:32977:108"/>
calamity should be shortened for his el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ct
which were in it.</p>
                     <p>4. If God yet visit the iniquities of our
Fathers upon us, he will change the nature
of our punishments: though they be to the
destruction of our estates and bodies, yet
they shall be to the Salvation of our Souls in
the day of the Lord Jesus: he will inflict
them upon us as trials and fatherly chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
doing us good in the latter end;
though in relation to the iniquities of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
they be sore punishments.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, we ought to be humbled for the
sins of our Fathers, because God was disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by them. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was ashamed,
and confounded for his Fathers sins, as well
as his own. That God was dishonoured in
former years, grieveth a godly heart, as well
as in present times.</p>
                     <p>Besidesâ€”the sins of our Fathers are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to us. That men should say of such
a man, his Father before him was a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,
an oppressour, an idolater; so was his
Grand-Father, his Great-Grand-Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; this is a reproach unto the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
the best way to wipe off the reproach,
is for the posterity to mourn for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sins: the godliness of Children will be
some covering to their Fathers nakedness.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:32977:108"/>
But if our Fathers greatly provoked the Lord,
and we are not humbled for their sins, but
walk in the steps of our evil Progenitors;
then hear what the Lord saith to such, <hi>Isai.
14. 20, 21, 22. The seed of evil doers shall
never be renowned: prepare slaughter for his
Children for the iniquity of their Fathers, that
they do not rise, nor possess the Land, nor fill
the face of the world with Cities: for I will rise
up against them, saith the Lord of Hosts, and
cut off from</hi> Babylon <hi>the Name and Remnant,
and Son and Nephew, saith the Lord.</hi>
