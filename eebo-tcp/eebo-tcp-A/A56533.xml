            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For those that have but any thing more then ordinary inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to piety, will still be scandalized at it, the more dissolute will thence take occasion to some with more insolence and encouragement, and hereticks will be sure to make their advantages of it, that is, think it a just ground publickly to discredit the Catholick Church, by laying at her doore these pernicious maximes, as hath been done heretofore by the Minister <hi>Du Moulin</hi> in his book <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I Have received your Letter of the 13. current, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you tell me that your health being not in such a posture as would permit you to come hither to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, where you were in hopes to understand what had passed between the Curez of <hi>Rouen</hi> and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Society of <hi>Iesus,</hi> a Friend of yours here had sent you a printed sheet, with this title, <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e Answer of a Divine to the Propositions extracted out of the LETTERS of the IANSENISTS, by some of the Curez of</hi> Rouen; <hi>which answer hath been presented to the Right Reverend the Bishops met together in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assembly of the Clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but imagine how much you were surprized at the first reading of that Answer, and how that at the same time your judgement of it was, that it could be no other then an infamous Libell, and a scandalous Pamphlett purposely scattered abroad to blast the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and holinesse of the Church, derogating from the authority of the right Reverend the Arch-bishop of this place, and destructive to the innocence of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors who endeavour to serve and maintain that divine Spouse of IESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>That you have also understood, how that the <hi>Iesuits</hi> seem loudly enough to declare themselves the Authors of that piece, when they cause it to be sold publickly by the Book-sellers belonging to their Colledge, when they distribute it themselves in the houses where they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96080:15"/>
make any visits, and do so exactly play the <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> to scatter it up and down, that we are oblig'd to them for its coming among those that are of our Arch-bishop's Councell.</p>
            <p>And lastly, that you expected with some impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a generous reply from the Reverend the Curez of <hi>Rouen</hi> to that injurious and ill-instructed Divine, and how necessary you conceiv'd it that such a course should be taken, to the end that all the world might be satisfied of the purity of their intentions in the cause they are now engag'd in, their prudence in point of proceeding, as well in the enterprise as the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the integrity of their Faith, which it was the main design of that Libell to cast a blemish upon.</p>
            <p>To satisfie therefore your desires as to these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and to give you some account of an affair where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are all equally engag'd by the common concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Ministery; I am to tell you, Sir, that the Curez of <hi>Rouen,</hi> having taken notice of a sheet that was scatter'd up and down full of impostures and calumnies against them, and being in a manner perswaded, as well by the hints you give in your Letter, as by other too too pregnant circumstances, that it was a production of the Jesuits, thought fit to make their complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it to the other Arch-bishop, by a Letter which they immediately writ thereupon, and to demand ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for the same of his <hi>Officiall,</hi> by a Petition which they presented to him, whereof I thought it not a misse to send you a copy, that you may see the justifiable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of their complaints.</p>
            <p>That once done, they had resolved to sit down and be silent, so in some measure to expresse their moderation in suffering injuries suitable to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes of the Gospel wherein they instruct their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. They were, I say, content to be quiet, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the publick satisfaction and reparation, which might prove the effect of those juridicall courses they had taken.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:96080:16"/>But having observ'd on the one side, that the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings were likely to take up much time, and that the <hi>Iesuit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96080:16"/>There needs no more then the simple, that is to say, the most sincere and most faithfull relation of what hath passed in this emergency on the part of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez of <hi>Rouen,</hi> to justifie their proceedings, and to prove the Author and dispersers of that Libell guilty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and imposture. I shall not say any thing which cannot be confirm'd by the testimonies of persons on whom no reproach can be fastened, nay, by that of the Arch-bishop himself; who being our head, our Judge, and our Father, hath also ever been our witnesse and our Oracle; and we should justly deserve his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did we any thing without a relyance on his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and conduct.</p>
            <p>The businesse, as to matter of fact, stands thus. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>De Four,</hi> CurÃ© of <hi>S. Maclou</hi> (whose abilities and worth are generally known) having preach'd two seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times (as you have already understood) against those pernicious doctrines which tend to the corruption of good manners, the <hi>Iesuits</hi> were immediately troubled thereat, and made great complaints of it to our Arch-bishop, in a Petition which they presented to him in the name of Father <hi>Brisacier,</hi> fraught with injurious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions and calumnies against the said Monsieur <hi>du Four.</hi> These things coming to the knowledge of the Curez of <hi>Rouen,</hi> they thought themselves oblig'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the quarrell of their reverend Brother, violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set upon in a difference wherein they were all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd, since it is their duty to be watchfull over sound doctrine and the purity of Manners, as that on which depends the safety of those souls that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge.</p>
            <p>But that their proceeding might appear to be such as was the effect of a serious consideration of the Affair they were to engage in, they had a debate in one of their Assemblies, about consulting the Bookes, whence it was alledged, that the propositions and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maximes, preached against by the CurÃ© of Saint <hi>Maclou,</hi> had been taken, to the end that true copies
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96080:17"/>
and extracts should be made of the same, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly that the condemnation thereof should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Canonicall wayes, if the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Six of the Assembly were pitched upon and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to undertake that employment. They spent therein a whole moneth, doing all things with all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They drew copies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and reported the whole to their Brethren in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Assembly, wherein for further certainty, it was ordered; That if any among them were desirous of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther satisfaction as to those matters, they would be permitted to come to the persons deputed, into the places where the books were, to consult them and compare them as they pleased. This order was put in execution, insomuch, that for five or six d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What greater circumspection could be us'd in a proceeding of this nature?

For, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been drawn up, and digested into the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to be invested on, by some of their Company appointed to that purpose, it was read severall times in two or three severall Assemblies, wherein were present ordinar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This certainly should be look'd on as an argument of the union and good intelligence which is among the Curez of <hi>Rouen,</hi> and that it is the same spirit they are guided by; not as proceeding from any combination, as it is maliciously objected by the Author of the Libell, but from the Love of Justice, and a tendernesse for truth, which thus joyntly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages them in this cause.</p>
            <p>Five were chosen out to go as Deputies from the Assembly to the Arch-bishop, to present to him the Petition and the Extract of pernicious proposition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> gathered out of the Casuists, and that worthy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late honoured them with so kind an entertainment, and so favourable a reception; he express'd so much satisfaction at their piety and zeale; he told them with so much earnestnesse and reality that he abhorr'd those corrupt doctrines, that they could not, from all, but conceive immediate hopes of happy succe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>xtracts, thereunto annexed, should be sent up to our Lords of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall assembly of the Clergy, to the end, that those pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent doctrines should receive a more notorious and solemn Censure, by the decisions of so illustrious and and venerable an Assembly as that which is the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative of the Church of <hi>France,</hi> and whence we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the Oracles of our Religion.</p>

the Curez of <hi>Paris</hi> having had notice of what was in agitation in our City about these matters, were s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t they write to them, and to give them thanks for the affection and tendernesse they had expressed for the purity of Christian Morality, they intreat them to send up their collections and memorials, and appoint eight of themselves, all Doctors of Divinity of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of <hi>Paris</hi> to examine them, and accordingly to give the said Curez of <hi>Rouen</hi> all the advice and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance requisite in such a business. Since which time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more fully informed and satisfied as to the matter of fact, they resolv'd to joyn with us in this cause, and to exhort the Curez of the other Diocesses of <hi>France,</hi> to demand joyntly with them, of our Lords the Prelates (in a spirit of peace and charity, which ought ever to be attended by a true zeale) the censurt of the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, propositions specified in the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And our Arch-bishop himself, for his own part, to shew how much he thought himself concern'd in an affair of this importance, and the justice he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to do the Curez of his chief City, sent up Monsieur <hi>Gaulde</hi> his Grand Vicar (whose vertue and abilities all have sufficient experience of) to present, on his behalf, the Petition, and Extracts made by the Curez of <hi>Rouen</hi> to our Lords of the Assembly Generall with Letters of recommendation worthy his zeal and earnestnesse.</p>
            <p>Accordingly hath that honourable Assembly given eare to these just demands, it hath afforded them a favourable reception, it hath even publickly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Thus, Sir, have I given you a true and sincere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what passed in this Affaire on the part of the Curez of <hi>Roven.</hi> I dare call God to witnesse, that it is nothing but the naked truth, and thence you may be pleased to consider, whether they have had any ground to traduce us; consider, what foundation they may have to blast our reputation with calumnies as they do in that Libell; consider, I say, whether it does not even in the title broach three signall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures.</p>
            <p>For in the first place, the Propositions, which we desire should be censured, are not extracted out of the LETTERS of the JANSENISTS, as the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eces, out of which they are taken, as it were easy for us to demonstrate.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this catalogue and the extracts which the Jesuits have so great an aversion for, and are the ground of all their fury and exasperation, are not the worke of the Curez of <hi>RouÃ«n,</hi> who only drew up the Extracts which they presented to their Arch-Bishop, and which the Arch-Bishop hath sent up to the Assembly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> such as is that Answer. No, those who are thought to be the Authors of it, are more prudent and better advised then ever to have attempted any such thing, though they are not to be numbred among those that have the most respct of Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops.</p>
            <p>I should be over troublesome to you, and haply exceed the Limits of a Letter, should I make it my businesse to refute all the calumnies and impostures which are scattered up and down the body of that pamphlet, and therefore shall fasten only on some.</p>
            <p>This implacable Pamphleteer sayes, <hi>that we have put in an information against the Iesuits at the tribunall of our Lords the Bishops,</hi> and we may say, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that it is they themselves that have brought the information against themselves. For neither in our Petition nor our Extracts presented to the Arch-Bishop do we any where taxe the <hi>Iesuits</hi> by name; if we say any thing of them, it is occasionally, and by way of instance; all that we desire being only the condemnation of the pernicious doctrines taught by some late Casuists, whoever they may be.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96080:19"/>
to have presented to our Lords of the Assembly any petition or other piece to bring them into trouble there, it being certaine that it is only the Arch-Bishop him selfe that hath, by his Grand Vicar, presented them, and consequently this Jesuiticall Secretary does Notoriously derogate from his Authority, and is not afraid in his Libell to be a little too peremptory with him and to traduce him under the name of the Curez of <hi>Roven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing he quarrells at is that we are guilty of a <hi>frivolous busying of our selves to weed out the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may be found in bookes, while they grow and thrive in mens soules, whence we should endeavour to root them up.</hi> This is an indeterminate charge of our idleness and want of courage in our Functions, but without the least consideration, that these Lesbian Maximes purposely sorewed up to a complyance with sinners (whereof we find the bookes of the Casu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Then he tells us, <hi>that it were a far better employment for our Assemblies to review the</hi> Houres <hi>of Port Royal,</hi> and addes, <hi>that the Faithfull committed to our charge, do to this day repeat, at the feet of our Altars those very prayers that are contained in that book, to the reproach of Faith and scandall of the Church.</hi> We never had yet the least acquaintance with the Authors of those <hi>Houres,</hi> and therefore cannot be said to countenance them, and it is a prerogative of God only to judge of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of their hearts. But it's to be hoped, this censorious Libeller will not think it much we should

Some more knowing and better Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines then he differ very much from his opinion of those <hi>Houres,</hi> because they are not prepossessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them as he is, who supposes <hi>that the son of God is therein degraded from the title of the Redeemer of all men,</hi> because it is not there expressed in the Version of certaine Hymnes, though the same thing be found in severall other places, and particularly in the 7th. ver. of the <hi>Te Dum.</hi> And we would gladly referre him to the Hymnes of the Romane Breviary corrected by <hi>Vrban VIII.</hi> of blessed memory. That methinks were enough to give a check to his sinistrous judgement of the persons that composed them, as to what concernes that article.

Besides that in the Hymnes, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanies and Prayers of these <hi>Hours,</hi> the intercession of the Saints is therein very often insisted upon. What probability is there then, that, if some of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishoners make use of them, it must needs he to the great reproach of Faith and scandall of the Church?</p>
            <p>He would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Letter, which he cites, we find, that <hi>the Church hath a power to take a course with Priests of ill lives, and to cut them off from any relation to her, if she think it fit, and that if she do it, they are no longer to be reputed Priests, but to be looked on as secular persons.</hi> This faithfull Secretary hath left out the word <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,</hi> which is to be seen in all the latter editions of those Letters, and was omitted onely in the first printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> through the Printers negligence, and is accordingly put upon his score among the other <hi>Errata</hi> at the beginning of the Book. Let him then but restore that word to the passage fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recited, and he will find the Doctrine of that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be the same with what is taught us by the Church in her Canons, that is to say, that Priests degraded, and such as, for their lewd lives and

disparagement of your Petitioners. For the Author does therein lay it to their charge that they are the first kindlers of that fire which now begins to break forth in the house of God, and that they are the cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors of those who endeavour to quench it. That he further reproaches them, that though it is their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be tender and watchful over the Church, yet they shut their eyes so as not to see the danger that shee is in a manner fallen into, and that they are so far from making any opposition against her enemies, that they quarrel with her children. He sayes that they insist upon the advantages which Hereticks pretend to have against her, and though he seems unwilling to lay an imputation of Heresie equally on all, yet would he have them discover strange symptomes thereof in that action of theirs. He charges them with a reproachful easiness of nature, such as inclines them to give credit to and countenance calumny. He sayes that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice of their prosecution tends in effect to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Faith, and the reestablishment of <hi>IANSE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISME.</hi> He blames them for traducing Monsieur <hi>du Val,</hi> as a criminel, not knowing what they do. He sayes that these Curez, (meaning the Petitioners) combine together in a design to sacrifice the Masters of both ancient and modern Divinity, to the passion of the <hi>Iansenists,</hi> and to offer them up as publick vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims to Heresie. He sayes that they prosecute a charge against all Catholick Universities, and all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Doctors on the behalf of <hi>Iansenisme.</hi> He says that the voice of the Pastors of <hi>Rouen</hi> is no more then the Eccho of those mali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on</hi>; that the enterprize which the Curez of <hi>Rouen</hi> are engaged in, is frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, as to the design, and unworthy the prosecution of a prudent man. To be short, his writing is filled up with diverse other expressions of the same nature, which are all most untrue, and tend very much to the discredit of the Petitioners; and he grounds all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96080:25"/>
and all his reproaches on a matter of fact abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely supposed; that is to say, that the Petitioners have put in an information against those whom this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter makes it so much his business to vindicate (whom he sufficiently discovers to be no other then the <hi>Iesuits</hi>) and have impeached them at the tribunal of our Lords of the Assembly of the Clergy, of having corrupted the whole doctrin of Morality; supposing withal, but untruly, that the petitioners had presented to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Assembly, an injurious catalogue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions that concern Moral doctrin. Which is a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and palpable imposture, since it is evident, that the petitioners neither were sent, nor did send to the Assembly, that they have not impeached any one, that they never presented any catalogue or any propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
            <p>But the truth, as to the matter of fact, is this, that the Petitioners desirous to be fully satisfied whether the doctrines that were contrary to the holiness and purity of Christian Morality, which so many learned and able persons have so long since quarrelled with these Casuis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s for, were really to be found in the books of those Authors, some of them, appointed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of their Assembly, had accordingly undertaken the examination thereof: and having found in diverse books of those writers, the greatest part of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions laid to their charge, they drew a faithful extract thereof, and having reported the whole business in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>nother assembly, they unanimously resolved to have a petition presented to the Arch bishop, to demand of him the condemnation thereof. That this being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly put in execution, the Arch-bishop had sent up the said petition, with the extracts thereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, to the Lords of the assembly held at <hi>Paris,</hi> as being an affair of general concernment, and such as the whole church was interes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ed in. And having to that purpose sent up Monsieur <hi>Gaulde,</hi> his Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car to make a report of the whole, with a Letter from
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96080:25"/>
himself, powerful and worthy his zeal, the said assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly took cognizance thereof, and immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed certain Commissioners to examine the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to the end, that upon the return of their report, they might proceed to judgement.</p>
            <p>That the business came to this head as to matter of fact, is a thing so well known that the Author of the said Libel could not be ignorant thereof. Whence it may be easily inferred that when he attributes to the petitioners, what hath been done only by the means of the Arch-Bishop, his main design was, to fasten all the injuries and invectives of his defamatory pamphle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> upon the said Praelate. For it being a thing out of all dispute, that neither the Curez of <hi>Rouen,</hi> nor yet those of <hi>Paris</hi> presented to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ssembly any proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning Morality, and that there was not any thing of that kinde brought thither, but by the means of our Arch-Bishop, yet does not this detractor think it much openly to direct his calumnies against him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the Curez of <hi>Rouen</hi>; affirming that the Hereticks, whom he makes the Authors of the propositions, daring not to appear themselves for fear of being dismissed with reproach, yet there hath not wanted some that durst present in so honourable an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, what should rather have been cast into the fire.</p>
            <p>And it is this bitter re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>lection of the Libeller which the Petitioners are most troubled at, as conceiving themselves less wounded in the disparagement they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in their own reputation, then in the injury done their Head, whom the respect due to his eminent dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity should have secured from all the assaults of calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that especially in an occurrence, wherein he hath been honoured with the elogies of our Lords the Prelates and the most cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This your Eminences may well imagine must needs be no small affliction to me, nay, that I cannot but be much more troubled at it then I am well able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press; since that, being come to the extremities of old age, and upon the point of my departure hence, to go and give an account to the supream Judge, of my administration, I finde, that, not only, the world is already full of malice; but also that it degenerates

dayly more and more into wickedness, because cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity waxeth cold. Desirous to finde out some reason thereof, I have often both observed, it my self, and have it from the information and judgement of several persons, whose integrity, zeal, experience, and learning I am well satisfied of, that the principal cause of this deplorable degeneration and disorder, proceeds from the over indulgence of many confessours who are ready enough to open trap-doors to let men into dissolution and Libertinisme, taking for security <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

so must it needs happen, that those, who are the Authors thereof, taking it for granted by the easie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment they meet with in the world, that they had done a very considerable service therein, cannot but presumptuou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having received several complaints against this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and dangerous kinde of Theologie, from those who have a certain zeal and tenderness for a more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid doctrin, and a more christian discipline; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the other side, that the <hi>Hereticks</hi> who are our Neighbours, continuall loading us with reproaches, that some Doctors of our Catholick Church do maintain things so extravagant in the business of <hi>Morality,</hi> as that Pagans themselves ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having so done, I thought it not amiss to require the opinions and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof of the most knowing men of my Diocess, as well secular as regular. Whereupon having seen and examined the whole, I resolved to prevent the further progress of this evil, by the application of the most gentle remedies I should have thought of; tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> is to say, by giving notice as well by my self as those who had managed the examination of the business, that those, who were admitted to hear Confessions,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96080:55"/>
should beware how they fell into that dissolution of doctrin; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d giving order withal that there should be a learned refutation set forth of some part of those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Much about that time, it happened, that on the 23. day of April 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thereupon I began with those, as well out of an imagination, that if they should willingly comply with, and observe that oath, the Religious men of other orders would certainly make no difficulty thereat; as that I had certain proo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, that the Fathers of that society, were of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the most addicted to invent and to practise those licentious doctrines. And this among many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>All these things considered, I must confesse I could never comprehend upon what these Fathers ground the imagination they are of, that I have done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itions ensuing were not to be tolerated in the practick, and that it was the duty of Superiours, to make provision of their Authority tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> they should not be taught, as may be seen by the copy of the Decree of the said Faculty hereunto annexed.</p>
            <p>To the end therefore that I might in all things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96080:56"/>
the order of your Eminences directed to me, as far as lyes in my power, and at the same time not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any thing that my Episcopall Function may oblige me to, as to what concerns the weeding out of these pernicious Doctrines, I shall be ready to admit the Religious men of the Society aforesaid, to receive Confessions, when there shall not be wanting any of the qualifications requisite, provided alwayes that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing legally authorized, they promise and swear, that they will never, in the practick, adhere to those XVII. Propositions at least, which I shall to morrow propose to the Ecclesiasticks and Regulars of my Diocesse, to the end they may be abhorr'd by all, a proceeding I hope your Eminences will allow as justi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>iable.</p>
            <p>There are yet two things, whereof I think it not amiss, upon this occasion, to give your Eminences some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of. The former, is, that the <hi>Regulars</hi> do not observe the Decree of the Congregation, made concerning the affairs and requisitions of the Bishops and Regulars, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the 15. of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1647. hereafter mentioned; wherein it is declared, That it is not lawfull for Regulars to give absolution in cases reserved to the Ordinaries of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or that might be reserved to them for the future. And consequently, that they cannot exercise that power, if they have not obtained leave to that purpose of the Ordinary. Now, though I took great care to have the said Decree communicated to all Superiours of the Regular orders the 3. of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1647. yet hath there been with me but one single Religious man of the Order of S. <hi>August.</hi> to desire that power, which I accordingly granted him, because he was a prudent and pious man. Others there are that pretend they have I know not what priviledges, or communications of priviledge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>; nay they disclaim the Decree, as nul, because it was granted without their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard thereto. Others there are, that affirm it only to be declarative, and consequently that it is of no force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their priviledges, which, they say, cannot be made invalid, but by a Decree formally levell'd against them. Nay, there are some so teme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>arious, as presumptuously
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96080:57"/>
to affirm, that it is not in the power even of our holy Father the Pope himself, to revoke or abridge their Priviledges, as being such as have been granted them by way of reward for their merits.</p>
            <p>The second thing I have to represent unto your Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences, is, that there are severall Regulars who receive Confessions within my Diocesse, though they have not been approved either by my Predecessors or my self. Upon which account it was, that, not long since, I caus'd notice to be given to all the Regulars (as it appears by the copy of the Mandate hereunto annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that they should come and present the Deed or Writing wherein are to be seen the names, and the time of Approbation, which they had received either from me or my Predecessors. This hath been done by many; and so that it soon discovered the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those that have intruded into the Office of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors within my Diocesse, without the said Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But one thing happened which I cannot suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently admire, that is, that when the Mandate came to the knowledge of the Abbot of Saint <hi>Angelo, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuncius</hi> of his Holinesse in the Low-Countries, he sent to me that I should revoke the said Mandate, though it did not comprehend any thing which had not been observed from all Antiquity, and that it had been esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished for a Rule in the Provinciall Councell of <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chlin,</hi> and confirmed by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. in the title <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>. c. 1. <hi>of the Sacrament of Penance,</hi> in the termes recited in the Article hereunto annexed. And all this, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the express command of our most holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope that it should be observed, as may be seen in his Brief of the 16. of <hi>May</hi> 1648. concerning the cause of the Bishops of <hi>Angelopolis.</hi> By which Brief, it is enjoyned, that the Regulars, even of the Society of <hi>Iesus,</hi> approved in a Diocesse by the Bishop thereof, to hear the Confessions of secular persons, shall not have power to receive the like Confessions in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diocesse without the approbation of the Bishop
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96080:57"/>
of the said Diocesse, as I doubt not but is well known to your Eminences.</p>
            <p>And thus much I conceiv'd it my duty to discover to your Sacred Congregation, in order to the good of Ecclesiasticall discipline, having so great a confidence of your Piety<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> zeal, and vigilance, as that you will vouchsafe to afford me some more effectuall means and remedies, whereby I may be enabled to oppose those abuses which ought not to be neglected. In the mean time, having with all submission acknowledg'd the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence I have for your purple, I remain</p>

The reason thereof is, that, as the nature of man is even from its first being perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclin'd to evil, and that the onely thing which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents him from falling thereinto is ordinarily the feare

he may be in of the Law, so it happens, that, when he hath once shaken off that bridle, he runs at random in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all excesses of concupiscence; so that there is no difference between making <hi>all vices lawfull,</hi> and <hi>all men vicious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thence it comes, that the Church hath never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that when time hath produced Christians of evill lives, it is to be observed at the same time that there were holy Lawes that condemned them and were purposely made for their reduction. Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was it ever known before the starting of these Casuists, that any one, acknowledging himselfe to be of the Church, did publickly endeavour to destroy the purity of her rules.</p>
            <p>This, it seems, was an attempt reserved for these last times, which the clergy of <hi>France</hi> calls <hi>the dregs and dotage of the last dayes,</hi> wherein these new Divines, instead of making the lives of men consonant to the precepts of Jesus <hi>Christ,</hi> make it their businesse to levell the precepts and rules of Jesus <hi>Christ</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, passion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is by this horrid overturning of things, that some, who go by the names of <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Divines,</hi> have introduced, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of true Morality, which ought to have no other principle then divine Authority, nor other end the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the purity of manners proportionably to the attempts of those that would defile it. Morality, the more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully it is opposed, becomes the more endeared to us, to which it addes some thing that we are alone to defend it. And therefore out of the satisfaction it is to us, that God is pleased to make our weakness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributory thereto, we presume to say with the man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own heart, <hi>Lord it is time for thee to arise, they have destroyed thy law; but it raiseth in us a greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to thy precepts, and an aversion for all the wayes of iniquity.</hi>

            <p>It is in the mean time a very deplorable case that we should be thus worryed and persecuted by those from whom we ought rather to have expected relief; so that we are to engage with the passions of men, not only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with all the impetuosity that is naturall thereto, but also puffed up and main<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And this posture are our affairs in at the present; but we hope God will incline the hearts of those, in whose power it is to do us justice, to take our cause in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their consideration, and that they will be the more earnest to endeavour our vindication, by how much they are otherwise likely to be made complices of these corruptions In this number are comprehended the Pope, the Bishops, and the Parliament, by that extravagant insinuation wherein the Authors of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel would have it believed as a thing most certain, <hi>that the Bulls of the</hi> Popes <hi>against the five</hi> Propositions <hi>are a general approbation of the doctrine of the</hi> Casuists; then which there cannot be any thing more injurious to those Bulls, nor more impertinent in it self, since
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:96080:69"/>
there is not the least analogy between those two things. All that is common between those five Propositions and those of the Casuists, is that they are all equally here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.

            <head>THE ANSWER OF the Curez of PARIS, Maintaining the FACTUM Presented by them to the Reverend Vicars Generall, to demand the Censure of THE APOLOGY FOR THE CASVISTS; Against a piece intituled, A REFVTATION of the Calumnies lately publish'd by the Authors of the FACTVM, under the name of the Reverend the Curez of PARIS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AFter the solemn Indictment we have brought in with so much justice and reason before the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Tribunall, against the <hi>Apology for the Casuists,</hi> whereof we have discovered the most pernicious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes and the strange extravagances which had fil'd with horror those whom God had inspired with any thing of love for his Truths, there was some ground to hope, that those, who, out of an immoderate desire to maintain
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96080:70"/>
even the most dissolute of the Authors (whereof that Book gives the world a faithful Catalogue) were engag'd in the defence of it, would by their humility and silence, have repaired the injury which they had done all just and indifferent persons by their temerity and blindnesse.</p>
            <p>And we find to our regret that nothing is able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate their presumption. Instead of sitting still, or not opening their mouths, unlesse it were to disclaim er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours so unmaintainable, and so palpably opposite to the purity of the Gospel, they have newly put forth a piece, wherein they maintain all those errours, and fall into the greatest virulence that may be against the FACTUM we had made, to lay open the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of their doctrines.</p>
            <p>This is it that obliges us to reassume new courage, and to rise up against that excessive confidence of theirs, so to take away the reproach which must otherwise be put on our age, that the enemies of Christian morality had been more earnest in their attempts against it, then the Pastors of the Church in the maintenance of it; and that it happen not, that, while the people rely upon our vigilance, we our selves should fall into that sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full indifference, which the Scripture does so severely condemn in the Pastors.</p>
            <p>The writing newly publish'd against our <hi>Factum</hi> is a meer stratagem of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> who are nam'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and who, that they might with the greater liberty exercise their detraction upon the piece, without any apparent injury to our persons, say, that they do not look on it as a thing whereof we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
