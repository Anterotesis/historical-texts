            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are many in <hi>England</hi> I perceiue, that are so addicted vnto their own opinions, as concerning the pretended holy Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and such a reformation, as they themselues haue deuised: that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with anie patience endure, to heare either contradiction or argument to the contrarie. <hi>I knowe some of them</hi> (saith a certaine aduertiser touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies of the Church of England) <hi>that would thinke it a tempting of God, to heare or read what might bee saide against them: as if they could be at quod bonum est tenete, without an omnia probate, going before.</hi> Which maner of persons, the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> resembleth vnto the deafe Adder, <note place="margin">Psal. 58.</note> 
               <hi>that stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his eare, and will not heare the voyce of the inchaunter, though he be expert in charming.</hi> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> writing vpon these wordes, saith: that the serpent delighting in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wherewithall hee hath inclosed himselfe, clappeth one of his eares very hard to the ground, and with his taile stoppeth the other: least hearing the <hi>Marso,</hi> he should be brought forth to the light. And so do a great number of these Serpentine persons, whereof the aduertiser made mention: they stop one of their eares so hard with earth, that is, with a most insatiable and greedy desire of riches:
<pb facs="tcp:775:3"/>
and the other with their tayles, whereby saith <hi>Aug: posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or a intelliguntur,</hi> that is with a sacrilegious hope, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after vnder pretence of setting vppe theyr discipline, they may come to the massacre and spoyle of the Church: and will fleere and Ieere, much against theyr own consciences, (god knoweth) when any inchaunter or <hi>Marso</hi> assayleth either by wordes or writinge to charme them. With these men or any else, whose hartes are thus possessed, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this earth and hope, or with any other such like poison, for what respects soeuer: I haue nothing here to doe: but onely to pray for them, that god mollifying their preiudiciall and obstinate mindes, they may be content, first to beholde, and then with humility to acknowledge the truth.</p>
            <p>There is an other sorte both of the Clergy and laitye, who notwithstanding they fauour the pretended discip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, euen with singlenesse of hart, and in good earnest (I am perswaded,) as supposing it to be the Lordes owne workemanship, &amp; holy institution: yet forasmuch as they do very well know, that many dishes are washed cleane on the outside, and yet are foule within: that many sepulchers are gorgious to the eies, and yet inwardly haue nothing in them but bones and corruption: that men may be often times deceiued with shewes and probabilities, as allwayes heretofore many haue beene: and that there are no spirits of any prophets in our dayes, which ought not to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the spirites of other prophets: they will be pleased I trust, to yeald themselues vnto the Apostolicall rules of trying of all thinges, and not bee caried away, either with rashnesse or preiudice, to belieue any spirit, vntil they haue tried it throughly whether it be of god.</p>
            <p>In the behalfe of these men, and for their sakes especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
<pb facs="tcp:775:3"/>
I haue presumed to offer vnto their wise and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent consideration, such simple notes and obseruations, as I had formerly gathered, when according to the said rules of the Apostles, by occasion of the great opinion, which beganne to growe of the <hi>Geneua</hi>-forme of ecclesiasticall discipline, I was bold to try and examine it, according to the measure of such small ability and iudgement, as god hath indued me withall. Whereby if either they or any other shall reape anye profit, to the establishing of their mindes in this giddy age, from running vppe and downe after euery young start-vp, hether and thether, to secke new platformes of Church-gouernment in this place or that place: when as we haue one of our owne, which is in my conscience truely Apostolicall, and farre to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, before any other that is receiued this day by any reformed Church in Christendome: I shall thinke my paynes well bestowed: nay, I shall bee right glade in my hart, and allwayes most thankefull vnto allmightie god for it. Otherwise if by reason of such weakenes and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as I do acknowledge to bee in my selfe, &amp; to haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed themselues in euery parte of this Treatise, there shall any offence bee taken, that may blast or hinder the sayde fruite, which I doe indeede most earnestly desire, I cannot choose but bee very sory for it, satisfyinge my selfe in the meane time notwithstanding, that in the whole processe following, (the contents whereof you may see in the next pages) I haue set downe nothing, which I doe not thinke I haue set down truly. <hi>Liberaui animam meam.</hi> I haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in discharged my conscience: and so I committe you to God.</p>

To the which purpose (amongst many other most notable perswasions, &amp; prophecies) he vseth these wordes: <hi>for Syons sake I will not hold my peace, and for Ierusalems sake I will not rest, vntill the righteousnes therof breake forth as the light, and saluation therof as a burning lampe</hi>:<note place="margin">Caluin vpon Esay.</note> that is, <hi>donec erigam piorum animos spe futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae salutis, &amp;c: vntill I may confirme the minds of the godly</hi> (saith Caluin) <hi>with the hope of their restitution againe: so as they may vnderstand, and be fully perswaded, that God will be the deliuerer of his Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The false Prophet <hi>H.N.</hi> the moste illuminated father of the family of loue, counterfaiting the imitation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God in this place: doth take vppon him to tell the world, of a farre greater captiuitie, not of 70. yeares, but of more then a thousand and fiue hundred yeares: that is, euer since the Apostles times. Wherein (saith he) <hi>darkenes of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:775:6"/>
hath ouershadowed the earth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euang Regni</note> lumen vitae incognitum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum est, <hi>the light of life hath been made vnknowen: and the trueth hath been hid, as vnder the maske of Popery, vntill this day of loue.</hi> He turneth the whole doctrine of our saluation, into a vaine mysterie, &amp; an allegoricall conceit of his own: leauing the Church no mediator at all, besides himselfe. He hath framed a platforme, or new kingdome and gospell of his owne inuention: bearing this title, <hi>Euangelium regni dei: the gospell of the kingdome of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">H.N. 1 Exhor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation, pag. 33 &amp; 43.</note> Into this kingdome, as Vicegerentes he hath brought: for our ministers, his <hi>seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores sanctae intelligentiae, Elders of the holy vnderstanding: pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres familiae Christi, fathers of the family of Christ,</hi> and for our Archbishops and Bishops, his <hi>Primates, or principall Elders,</hi> his <hi>seniores parentes, Elder fathers,</hi> and I know not how many illuminated and deified gouernours. And perseuering in these and in many other such like very grosse &amp; fond ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations: he lewdly presumeth, to apply the said place of the Prophet, to himselfe, and his owne conceites, for the better animating of his followers to sticke fast vnto him: saying:<note place="margin">Euang Regni.</note> 
               <hi>O Syon, tua causa non silebo, &amp;c: O Syon for thy sake, I will not hold my peace, and for Ierusalems sake I will not rest: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the righteousnes thereof breake forth as the light, &amp; saluation thereof as a burning lampe: that is</hi> in effect: vntill the holy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the family of loue, bee established vppon the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>T.C.</hi> a man I confesse, not to be sorted with <hi>H.N.</hi> (were it not vpon this occasion) wil needs take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him likewise, the person of the Prophet: and to aduertise vs of a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seruitude, that hath continued in the Church of God, (in effect, with <hi>H.N.</hi>) from the apostles times also, &amp; which yet remaineth (as he saith) in the church of England. From the which seruitude, he reckoneth, that it shall neuer be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:775:6"/>
vntill it submit it selfe, to be newly reformed again, by the aduise of his deepe vnderstanding (assisted with those that diligently wait vpon his illuminated deuises) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the maner of <hi>Geneua.</hi> To winne himselfe therefore the better credite, for bringing this to passe: hee laieth about him, and would haue al things turned topsie turuie (as they say) euen the vpside downe. Our ministery, their callings, our seruice, our sacraments, and all we haue, is out of ioint: Councels, fathers, histories, they are but dishcloutes with him: he shaketh them off, as it were with a shrugge: they are indeed (as after it shal appeare) no body in his handes: but he flingeth them here and there at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>He in like sorte with the assistance of his partakers, hath framed after the fashion of <hi>Geneua,</hi> a platforme and newe kingdome, or rather an infinite number of litle petite king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: but yet euery one of them of an absolute power: aswell ouer Lordes, Earles, Dukes, Princes, Kinges and Kingdomes, as ouer the meanest whosoeuer vnder them. This kingdome he would impose vpon this land. Wherein for our Archbishops, Bishops, ministers, &amp;c: hee placeth his graund Elders, (whome he tearmeth pastors): his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sort of Elders, (whome he tearmeth Doctors): his third sorte of Elders, (whome he tearmeth Gouernors) ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto them <hi>Deacons,</hi> to carry their purses, and <hi>widdows</hi> to wash their feete, where neede shall require. And with this deuise, he is so possessed, that hee thinketh all them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, and aduersaries to the trueth, that do impugne it. He supposeth the present estate of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (wanting that Allobrogicall deuise, though reformed as it is,) to be as yet, vnder the yoake of a wicked and vnlawfull gouernment, as it were, vnder that Iewish captiuitie of the Church, vnder the Babilonians: And therefore the better
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:775:7"/>
to incourage such factious persons, as do gape for a change, out of Gods blessing into the warme sunne: hee taketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to be their Prophet, and (as it were another <hi>Esay</hi>) sayth: <hi>For Syons sake I will not hold my peace, and for Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems sake I will not rest, vntill the righteousnesse thereof breake forth as the light, and saluation thereof as a burning lampe</hi>: that is in effect: vntill the said glorious kingdome of this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian Eldership, be enthronized in this land, and do carrie the scepter ouer euery parish in England.</p>

            <p>And these men come in, with another, a far more royall kingdome then <hi>Cartwrig hts.</hi> But it consisteth partly of his sayde officers, and partly of some other of their owne:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:775:7"/>
that is, of all the people: whome they greatly magnifie, not seeing their owne confusion. Which forme, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, they haue in suche admiration, for their conceaued purity of it: as that all the parishes in England (they say) must be first disparished, and all the people of the land first sanctified, and made a chosen people vnto the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the same may be planted amongst vs. And therefore one of them, (whether <hi>Barrow, Greenwood, Harrison, Glouer,</hi> or which of their schollers, I doe not nowe remember) but one of them I am assured; doth so greatly dislike the thraldome (in his conceit) of the Church of England, at this day: and so thirsteth to drinke the waters, which they haue drawn out of their own cisternes: that as, rauished in spirit, and for the comfort of his companions, he protesteth that for <hi>Syons sake, hee will not hold his peace, nor for Ierusalems sake, take any rest, vntill the righteousnesse therof, breake forth as the light, and saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof as a burning lampe</hi>: that is (in effect): vntill all the parishes in England bee purified after their fashion; &amp; then an Eldership, (abridged by a popular authoritie) bee placed in them.</p>
            <p>But of all the cryers, that I haue read of: hee shall weare the garland for crying,<note place="margin">Petition di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to her Maiestie.</note> that presumed of late to printe a petition, directed to her Maiestie: but published and spread abroad amongst her subiectes, for what other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I know not, then to withdrawe them from their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful allegiaunce, &amp; liking of her gouernment: when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they should be informed, sufficiently (as he deemed) of such notorious abuses, as he falsly pretendeth: and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, her highnesse being acquainted with them, yet she cared not for the reformation of them. They say the man hath beene of a crased iudgement: and I easiely belieue it: partly for that he hath so giddily and so vntrue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:775:8"/>
sought to disgrace, asmuch as in him lieth, the present gouernement of the Church: and partly in respect of his desperate boldnesse, that after so many rebukes, giuen to such franticke fellowes in the like cases: he durst presume againe, to offer to the worlde, such a fardell of malitious collections, and vntruthes; and yet thinke them fitte mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be dedicated to her Maiestie. But the thinge that most astonisheth me, is this: in that he saith thus; <hi>I do not now write eyther to pull downe Bishoprickes, or erect presbyteries. With whome the truth is, I will not determine. For I knowe not &amp;c.</hi> And yet he taketh the said sentence out of <hi>Esay</hi> (some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what turkised) for his poesie aswell as the rest. And to the condemnation of the present gouernment, and iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the disturbers of it (if he vnderstand himselfe) he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly professeth: that although he knoweth not which part hath the truth: yet <hi>for Syons sake he will not cease, nor for Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salems sake hold his tounge:</hi> till he hath aduanced his owne conceite, and depraued that which hee knoweth not, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as possibly he is able.</p>
            <p>And thus you see, what loue on all sides is pretended to <hi>Syon</hi>: and how the prophets wordes are wrested, by euery one of them, to serue their owne turnes. But they who haue iudgement, will not be much moued with such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. It hath beene an ancient practise of the aduersaries of the Church of God, then especially to be complotting of some mischiefe,<note place="margin">Esra. 4.</note> both against Syon and Ierusalem: when in outward shew, they haue pretended most of all, to bee desirous to repayre them, and to seeke their glory. There are some men spoken of in the scriptures,<note place="margin">Psal. 12.</note> who vaunt: that because their tongues are their owne, they will speake what they list. To whom also these men that professe, they will not holde their peace, may be more fitly compared,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:775:8"/>
then with the holy prophet <hi>Esay.</hi> Or I doubt it, that if a man shoulde iudge of many of them by the course which they haue taken: or if they of themselues would resorte indeede to their owne coulours: they might soone ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be so far from bearing any true affection to Syon, as that we should rather finde them in the tentes of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites,<note place="margin">Psal. 138.</note> cryinge in their heartes against the good estate of the Church of Christ, now in England: as the Edomites did in the day of Ierusalem: <hi>Downe with it, downe with it, euen to the ground.</hi> But because <hi>T.C.</hi> and his followers (for with the rest I will not further meddle) haue such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite: as that the light and saluation of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> cannot well breake foorth, vntill his pretended Eldership may bee generally admitted of in England: I will leaue their harts to God, and deliuer vnto you historically, how this plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme was deuised, and grew to bee so much in request: which will be the contentes of the two next chapters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

If the <hi>Emperours</hi> of <hi>Germanie</hi> doe thinke it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the glory, and for the strength of their Empire, to haue it (as it were) distributed into so many free Citties, so many popular states, and little petty soueraignties: it were a saucie part for me (as I take it) to busie my selfe with it. Howbeit that any such doctrine or examples, should be published, or once dreamed of, in such a kingdome as this is: there is no pretence of religion, no shewe of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no platforme of Discipline, although it shoulde come from <hi>Geneua,</hi> that can sufficiently warrant it.

               <note place="margin">Bodinus de repub. pa. 353</note> that after some time, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of <hi>Geneua,</hi> growing wearie of the foresaid troubles: <hi>did beginne to professe, that they would not be bound eyther to the lawes of the Duke of Sauoy, or of the Bishop.

Which inclination of theirs, was altogether misliked, (ye may be sure), by their popish Bishop.

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:775:11"/>It resteth nowe to be considered, by what meanes (in part) they brought their saide purposes to passe. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by <hi>Caluins</hi> wordes to <hi>Cardinall Sadolet</hi>: that if the Byshop woulde haue harkened at the first, to <hi>Farellus,</hi> for the abolishing of Poperie, they would then, haue been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well content, to haue admitted still of his Episcopall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction. But (as I sayd) hee would not. And then both <hi>Farellus, Viretus,</hi> and all their fauourers, did set vpon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, withall maine &amp; might. They said it was not meete, for a Minister to haue so great a liuing. They pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, <hi>clara voce fure<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> esse,</hi> with a loud voice to be a theefe.

In this contention therefore, (which <hi>Bodinus</hi> speaketh of) for the principality betwixt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and the people (how matters fell out I know not) but such was the present occasion: that (as it seemeth) the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop with many of his popish crue, gat him thence. <hi>Quo eiecto Geneuates monarchiam in popularem statum commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarunt:</hi>

the said Bodinus:<note place="margin">Bodi. meth. pag. 243.</note> doth adde, the cittie of <hi>Geneua,</hi> vnto those citties of <hi>Heluetia</hi>: which for the auoyding of the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of their gouernours, haue entered into a confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp; shaken them of. Vpon the eiection of the said Bishop, the citizens (by such aduise as they liked) ordained a newe forme of popular gouernement: such a one, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues thought meetest for the state of that cittie. A coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was chosen, to consist of two hundred: which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell hath the highest, and a standing authority, sauing that for the making of lawes, for the choosing of their principall magistrates, for decreing of peace or warre (which were <hi>iura magistratis</hi>: notes and rightes of soueraignty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality) these be reserued to the whole people and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of citizens. They ordaine also two other councells: the one of threescore, and the other of fiue and twenty: and likewise also fower Syndicks, their chiefest magistrats, to bee yearely elected, with manye such orders as they thought conuenient, for the better gouernement of the cittie. Whilst they of <hi>Geneua</hi> were busyed in these affaires, which were necessary for their state: the Bishop with all his shauelinges and adherentes, was not idle I assure my selfe.<note place="margin">De. repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Helu.</note> He laboured (as it seemeth by <hi>Simlerus</hi>) a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sauoy:</hi> and (by what meanes I know not) did grow into such a frendship with him: as that hee obteyned of him his assistaunce: meaning to haue recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by force and armes, his saide right and authoritie.

of gouernement, as hath briefly bene touched.</p>
            <p>I would not haue any man to thinke, that I take vppon me, to censure the doinges of the ciuile state, either of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi> or of any other place. Onely I haue bene bolde, to set downe the premises, as I finde them reported by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors mentioned: because they conteine some such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as are necessary to be vnderstood, in some ouuert sort; in respecte of that, which followeth, concerninge the first institution of the pretended consistoriall discipline. Besides (propounding to my selfe, throughout this whole booke, to deale with nothinge, whether it bee good or euell, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then as it concerneth the affaires of the Church:) I doubt not, but that I may presume, without any mans iust offence, to speake my opinion, as touching the Diuinity, which was pretended, by the saide Ministers of <hi>Geneua</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Bishop. For in deede I doe dislike it. If such dealinges were simply to be vrged by the worde of God: they might reach further, then would be conuenient. Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thought it agreeable to Diuinity, for ministers to caste of their rulers, at their owne pleasures. M. <hi>Caluin</hi> writeth wisely to <hi>Cardinall Sadolet</hi>: but the course, which (there hee sheweth), was helde by the Ministers, (say what men list,) cannot be iustifyed. I know one that hath written thus of that matter:<note place="margin">D. L.</note> 
               <hi>eum principatum, euangelij lux ciuitati restituit, the light of the Gospell, did restore to the Citty, that principality which the Bishop had.</hi> But all the learned Diuines in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> at their conferences with the Emperour (about that time) were of a contrary opinion, as touching the Bishops in those countries, who are greate Princes. And surely it would seeme strange to me: if the Gospell should wrest the sword, out of any ciuile Magistrates hande: let him be of what profession he list.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:775:12"/>I doe therefore subscribe to <hi>Zanchius</hi> iudgemente, for mine owne part, where he sayth: <hi>We deny not, that such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, as bee also Princes, besides their Ecclesiasticall authority, haue also their politicke lawes, and secular powers, as other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue: vz. right, in commaundinge in secular matters, right of the sworde,</hi>

And therefore we confesse, that their subiectes ought to obey their ciuile commaundements, (which may be kept without the breach of Gods law:) and that not onely for feare, but also for conscience sake.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Zanchius,</hi> whose iudgement in this pointe, will be esteemed of (I suppose) hereafter, when all that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, or can be sayd by any man to the contrary, will fall to the ground, or vanish like smoake. If it be saide that <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> writeth truely, but that my allegation of his wordes is altogether impertinent; for that the Bishops of <hi>Geneua,</hi> had neuer any setled right in the ciuile gouernement of that cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: I am not the man that will either iustify mine owne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion, or impugne any thinge, which may bee brought for the ciuile proceedinges of that state, or of any other: so as they carry no false groundes of Diuinity with them, which may prooue daungerous vnto our owne:<note place="margin">De auth. mag. in subd. &amp;c. vindic. cont.

Christ refused to be a deuider of priuate mens inheritances: and then surely it doth not become me, to be a decider of any titles, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, citties, or kingdomes. I pray for all: and will not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meddle with any.</p>
            <p>Now it remaineth, that hauing made relation vnto you, of the premises (as you haue heard): I should also acquaint
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:775:13"/>
you, more particularly, with the alteration that was made at <hi>Geneua,</hi> in the order and forme of the gouernemente of the Church. Wherein you shall finde, some greater varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty both of actions and pollicy.<note place="margin">Beza in vita Calu.</note> M. <hi>Beza</hi> speaking of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of religion in that citty, sayth: that <hi>Christes Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell was established there, mirabiliter, wonderously.</hi> A wonder the common saying is, doth last but nine dayes: but that wonderfull course, which he speaketh of; will not bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, I suppose in hast.</p>
            <p>As you haue heard, that the Bishop of <hi>Geneua</hi> was dealt withall, for the principality of that City: so was he vsed as touching his Bishopricke. The Ministers cryed out, that his Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, was as vnlawfull, as his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile. Wherevpon the Bishopricke was dissolued: and that forme of Ecclesiasticall gouernement, vtterly abolished, whereby that citty had bene ruled in Church-causes, from the time, that first it receiued the profession of christianity. Together with the ouerthrow of which Bishopricke; all the orders, constitution, and lawes of the Church: (which had beene in framing by all the learned men in christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, euer since the Apostles times) were at one stroake quite chopte of, and wholy abrogated: vnder pretence (forsooth) of the name of cannon lawes, the popes lawes, and I wot not what. Wherein the ministers dealt as wisely in mine opinion: as if some king, succeeding fower or fiue of his predecessors (whome he hated): should therevpon ouerthrow, all the lawes, that eyther they, or any other of his predecessors, had euer made before him.</p>
            <p>Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> being charged by some (as it seemeth) with the rashnesse,<note place="margin">Calu. de ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. ref. eccl. pa. 64.</note> which was vsed at <hi>Geneua</hi> in this point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth excuse it thus in effect: vz. <hi>that they deale therein, as men doe with rotten houses: they ouerthrewe all the whole forme, of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:775:13"/>
ecclesiasticall building as once, as it were into a rude heape: out of the which they might the better make choyse, and take of that olde stuffe, as much as liked them, to build withall</hi>: againe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Indeede there are many builders in these dayes: of such a kinde of humor. Nothing will content them: but that they build themselues. And therein also they are very inconstant. Now this must downe, now that must vppe; now this must bee chaunged, and that must bee enlarged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here the workemen mistooke me: this is not in good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, away with it: I will haue this square chaunged into a rounde: and this rounde altered into a square. A fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter metaphore could not well haue beene found: to haue shewed the vnstayed minds of such manner of reformers.</p>
            <p>But to proceed. The auncient forme of ecclesiasticall gouernement with all the Elders thereof, being thus ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; as the citezens in the framing of their newe ciuill gouernement, had an especiall eye to the manner of the ciuill gouernement of their neighbour citties and states ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning: so had both the magistrates and the ministers at the first also great regard of the ecclesiasticall pollicy in the same citties: relying principally vppon their forme of Church-gouernement, and vppon their orders and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes in that behalfe prouided. But this Church <hi>Modell</hi>; was also shortly after wholy misliked. For the ministers perceiued, that (as they thought) the ciuill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats, had too great authorie giuen vnto them in church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>causes: &amp; that they themselues had a great deale too little. Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> speaking of this manner of reformation:<note place="margin">Calu: to Sad:</note> calleth it, <hi>but a correcting of the Church.</hi> And <hi>Beza</hi> yeeldeth a reason:<note place="margin">Beza in vit. Calu:</note> why <hi>Farellus</hi> &amp; <hi>Viretus</hi> contented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with such a simple Church-gouernement: vz. in effecte (to my vnderstanding): not that they were ignorant, what insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:775:14"/>
there was in it: but because in such a hurly burly, and great chaunge of things, they could haue no better; and afterwardes when they woulde faine haue bettered themselues, the rest of the ministers, that should haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them therein, were fearefull to attempt (so soone) any new alteration.</p>
            <p>The same yeare, that <hi>Geneua</hi> was assaulted (vz. 1 5 3 6.) Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> came thether: and was there admitted <hi>non concionator tantum (hoc enim primum recusarat) sed etiam sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crarum liter arum doctor:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>not onely for their preacher (for he had refused that before) but also for a doctor of the holy scriptures.</hi> In which place, hee was scarcely warme: when like a man of courage (reiecting all feare) hee tooke in hand to frame a new platforme for the gouernement of that Church, (or as Maister <hi>Bezaes</hi> word is) <hi>ecclesiam componere</hi> to compound the Church: being of likelyhood before in his opinion, <hi>tanquam dissoluta scopa,</hi> as a dissolute Chaos and vndigested bundell. And in very short time, hee did so farre prouaile therein: as that hee caused the cittizens (being assembled together) <hi>to abiure their former popish gouernement</hi> (as they termed it) <hi>by Bishops</hi>:<note place="margin">Beza in vit.

               <hi>and to sweare to a

            </p>
            <p>What the forme, of this draught was: I finde it not any where mentioned. But whatsoeuer it was: it appeareth that both he, <hi>Farellus</hi> and <hi>Viretus,</hi> so vsed themselues in the administration of it: as that the rest of the ministers, and the chiefest of the cittie grew quickly, very weary of it. For through their rough dealing in diuers pointes: especially in opposing themselues against the orders of <hi>Berne,</hi>

The causes before mentioned of this their bannishment, were giuen out thus in generall termes: <hi>Tyranni esse voluerunt in liberam ciuitatem: voluerunt nouum pontificatum reuocare.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And here beganne the Consistorian humor, (which raigneth nowe amongst the factious sorte in England) to shew it selfe: but yet in a more secrete sorte, by their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate letters one to an other. Their fauourers and partakers, (whome they lefte behinde them at <hi>Geneua</hi>) presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their departure, entered into faction: and refused to receiue the communion, with vnleauened bread, as it had beene ordered,<note place="margin">Beza in vit.

For in that they continued their ministery there, without the newe <hi>Discipline</hi>: they were said to hold <hi>otiosam functionem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Capit. to Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell. epl. Cal. 6.</note> 
               <hi>an idle function.</hi> The Senate of two hundred, that expelled the said three prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,<note place="margin">Cal. epI. 40</note> was termed by <hi>Caluin, tumultuos a perditorum homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num factio, a tumultuoas faction of rakehells &amp; castaway
es. Beza</hi> saith:<note place="margin">Beza: in vit. Cal.</note> that in that councell, <hi>the greater part ouercame the better.</hi> But then by the way, they were not all of them, such manner of men, as <hi>Caluin</hi> reporteth The chiefest magistrates of the cittie, euen the Syndickes, were ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>factionum et discordiarum duces, the ringleaders of fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and dissentions.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cal. epl. 10.</note> They were resembled to <hi>Nabuca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnezar:</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:775:15"/>
and the exiles to <hi>Daniell.</hi> And generally they gaue it out against all their backe frendes: that they went about to ouerthrowe the Church, and that they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durated themselues against the Lord Iesus Christ. These and such like speaches, you must thinke were giuen out then secretly: but since, they are published in printe, for other ministers instructions: which may hereafter receiue any checke about that kinde of discipline.</p>
            <p>Hetherto for ought I finde, the pretended discipline had no great successe. I must therfore proceede on forward. These three preachers being thus banished, their friendes at <hi>Geneua</hi> were maruailous earnest, to haue them thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Many letters were procured from certaine church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and learned men, to the magistrates in that behalfe: as you shall partly perceaue by diuerse epistles set out vnder the title or together with <hi>Caluins</hi> epistles. Euery one like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the Cittie, that held for the discipline, did his best with the people. But Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> was the man, whom they all of them most desired: for the rest (being else where placed) they cared not much.</p>
            <p>Vnto these endeuours may be added: some very wise courses taken by Maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> in the time that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued from <hi>Geneua<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cardinall Sadolet</hi> hauing written to the <hi>Geneuians</hi> in dislike of the alteration, both of their state and of the <hi>Romish</hi> religion, admonishing them to returne to their olde byace: Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> aunswered him, and iustified as he thought meete their proceedinges therein: to their very good contentment. Also, where some (&amp; that of his owne friends) had greatly laboured to discredite, the ministers of that cittie, (which were lefte,) to the griefe of the magistrates: &amp; endeuoured to haue brought them vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:775:15"/>
into contempt, for executing their ministerie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the pretended <hi>Discipline, &amp;c.</hi> Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> staied that course by writing vnto them, <hi>that he doubted not, but that their ministers deliuered vnto them, the chiefe heads of Christian religion, which were necessary to saluation: and that also they ioyned thereunto the right vse of the Sacramentes. And then</hi> (saith he) <hi>where those two pointes are performed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calu. epist. 17</note> 
               <hi>illic substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia ministery viget: there is the substance of the ministerie: and a lawfull honour and obedience is to be giuen to that Ministery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, the mutinie mentioned, which was about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall,<note place="margin">Beza in Vit. Calu.</note> to communicate with vnleauened bread, he likewise appeased: by perswading the authours of it: <hi>that it was a matter of indifferencie, for the which they ought not to disquiet the peace of the Church.</hi> By which occasions, together with the former sutes mentioned, the Citie (as I iudge) hauing conceaued a better opinion of maister <hi>Caluin</hi> then they had before: and supposing, that if he came againe amongst them, he would vse a great deale more mildnesse, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in his proceedinges then hee had earst done: they were at the last contented, (after two yeares bannish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and more,) to recall him vnto them: vz: in the yeare, 1541.</p>
            <p>Whilest his friendes were labouring for him, (as you haue heard:)<note place="margin">Calu. to Viret Epist. 25.</note> he himselfe perceiuing, that hee shoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thither, was still harping to his friendes vppon this string: how he might haue the Citie so bound <hi>to the forme of Discipline,</hi> which he had in his head, as that afterwardes they might not when they list,<note place="margin">Calu. to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. Epist. 50.</note> start from it. And therefore as soone as he was come thither: hee imployed his studie that way especially. At the first <hi>offering of his paines to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: he told him that the Church there, could not possibly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, except there were same certaine forme of Church gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:775:16"/>
established. Whereupon the Senate ordered at his request, that he and fiue other of the Ministers should conferre together, about such a forme as they thought meet: and that hauing so done, they should offer the same to the consideration of the said Senate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then you shall see the strength of maister <hi>Caluins</hi> wit. He wisely saw, that notwithstanding, the <hi>Bishops</hi> eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall authoritie had been vtterly disgraced, and was thereupon reiected, as being (forsooth) Popish and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall: yet it was not good for the Church, that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters should bate the citie one ace, of an ecclesiasticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, aequiualent at the least, to that which their <hi>Bishops</hi> formerly had enioyed amongest them. Howbeit, he well perceiued withall, that for the bringing of this matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; there must be verie good pollicie, and circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vsed: or else that it would be a thing impossible, to bring a people, (hauing gotten their libertie) into the like or a worse seruitude, then they were in before. His plot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as I take it) was, as followeth.</p>
            <p>He laboured to perswade the people and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates: that as there was a ciuile <hi>Senate,</hi> for the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Citie, and the territories thereof, in ciuile cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: so by the word of God, there should be an ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>Senate,</hi> for the gouernment of the same Citie and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories (conteining aboue twentie parishes) in causes eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall. And to this purpose he wanted not (I warrant you) very many probable reasons. The persons that should beare authoritie in this <hi>Senate</hi>: (I nothing doubt) but that he could haue been very well contented they should haue been all of them ministers: euen as the ciuile gouernment did then wholly consist of ciuile persons. But by reason of the great authoritie, that the preachers had before intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ciuile magistrates vnto, for the bannishment of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:775:16"/>
their <hi>Bishop,</hi> &amp; for their dealing in Church causes; (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall they were in some sorte possessed) hee very wisely considered with <hi>Farellus</hi> and <hi>Viretus,</hi> that if they tooke that course, they should finde vnresistable opposition. And therefore they deuised a way, which if they could obtaine, should bee in effect, all one, as if they had been all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: and yet shoulde carrie such an outward shewe, as though there had been, no such matter intended.</p>
            <p>And their deuise was: that their ecclesiasticall <hi>Senate</hi> should consist of twelue Citizens, to be chosen yearely (not out of the baser sort of the people, but out of the ciuile councels of the Citie, all of them to be states men): and but of sixe Ministers, who were to continue for their liues, except there fell out some occasion, to remoue them. With this inuention, after many perswasions vsed, both publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the pulpit, and priuately vppon euery occasion: the Cittizens at length were contented. They sawe, there should bee twelue of them continually, (as any matters should fall out,) to sixe ministers: which was oddes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough. They imagined, that notwithstanding they yeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to such a platforme, for the satisfiyng of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters importunitie: (when they sawe that needes they would be some body amongest them:) yet they should in effect keepe the raines still in their owne handes, and be able to curbe them at their pleasure. Vpon these and what other such like considerations I knowe not:<note place="margin">Calu. epist. 54.</note> but after mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Caluins</hi> very great paines taken about that matter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as <hi>hee was therewith all almost oppressed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Beza in Vit. Calu.</note> the Cittie at the length was induced, to admit <hi>of their platforme, with the lawes and prerogatiues thereunto appertaining.</hi> And this was the first time, for ought I finde, that the pretended <hi>consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Discipline,</hi> euer drew breath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:775:17"/>Maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> hauing thus (as you haue seene) preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this attempt: it was not long after, but that the wiser sort of the Citie, perceiued their owne ouersight. For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of ecclesiasticall causes, there was nothing done in the Citie, (which this newe <hi>Senate</hi> misliked,) but by one meanes or other, they drewe it vnto their cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance. They would say that this and that was an offence to the godly: and then forthwith it was a cause for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistorie.</hi> Besides the maner of their proceedings in such cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as were brought before them, was altogether misliked. They endeuoured by all their deuises:<note place="margin">Cal. to Viret. Epist. 76.</note> 
               <hi>to winne the people vnto them.</hi> If any of the Magistrates fell into their handes: especially,<note place="margin">Calu. Epist. 71</note> if they had no good opinion of them, they were sure to pay for it. A very rigorous course was held with certaine of the chiefe of that Citie, <hi>about their dauncinges</hi> (vpon a certaine time) priuately in one of their friendes houses: as you may read in the 26. chapter following. And their especiall drift therein, (besides their affectionate dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon a quarrell towardes one of them,) was: (as I take it) to curry fauour with the multitude. <hi>Oh</hi> (saith <hi>Caluin</hi>) (writing how like men both he and his associates had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in this dauncing matter) <hi>exemplum valde proderit &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
               <hi>the example will do much good. For now it is alreadie a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon saying amongest the people, nullam esse spem impunitatis, cum primarijs non parcatur, that there is no hope of impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, seeing the chiefe men of the Citie are not spared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will say, howe came it to passe, that the twelue Elders all of them states-men, would suffer such things to be done in that <hi>Senate,</hi> as should breede such discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongest the Citizens? You may remember that I tolde you howe maister <hi>Caluin</hi> in this matter shewed his great wit, and ouerreached the Citizens notably. He was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:775:17"/>
not ignorant, how easy a matter it would proue, for him and his fellow ministers, to ouer-rule twelue simple men, all of them vnlearned, as being either apronmen, artizans, or marchantes. But his chiefest reach was: that he knewe these twelue graund gouernours, woulde certainely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that their office was but annuall: and that if they opposed themselues against their ministers, being theyr superiours in office, (and whose authoritie was still to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue) they might afterwardes peraduenture be caused to repent it. And in deede according to his good foresight, so it came to passe; which encreased the cittizens generall discontentement and dislike of that manner of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouernement.</p>
            <p>Besides, an other thinge there was, that especially grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them: and disclosed their want of prouidence. They saw their cittizens of that <hi>Senate,</hi> not onely ouer-ruled by the said six ministers, but likewise all the ministers so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topped by Maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> as that in effect he was <hi>Domine fac totum</hi>: &amp; tooke vpon him to doe all in all. Wherevpon there were some that beganne to feare; least (as I suppose) Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> sought (by his cunning) to bring them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to the gouernement of one: which they alltogether detested. Thus he himselfe reporteth in effect of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: vz. <hi>that there was a supplication</hi> found, which was meant <hi>to haue beene exhibited to the people, at their most generall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, wherein these two propositions were contayned: Nihil esse legibus vindicandum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Viret. cp. 77.</note> 
               <hi>nisi quod rempub. laederet: that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was to be punished by lawe, but that which did hurt the common wealth. And the other: periculum esse, ne dum haec vrbs vnius hominis melancholici cerebro obtemperat, excitata seditione, perdat mille ciues: that there was daunger, least, whilest the cittie, obeyed the brayne of one melancholy man,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:775:18"/>
vppon some rebellion raysed, it might ouerthrowe a thousand cittizens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it will be said, that Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> reporteth this as a slaunder. I confesse he doth so. And yet for my part, this I belieue was true: that in effect he ruled there in that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> as peremptorily, as euer the <hi>Byshop</hi> of that cittie did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, by vertue of his ecclesiasticall authoritie. And I am led to iudge so, by his owne wordes. For in the time of his banishment, when he was vrged by sundry mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to admit of equall conditions, and to returne to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi> for the good of that Church: hee aunswered them partly thus. <hi>Ad tantam multitudinem regendam, qui suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficerem?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cal: to Farell. ep. 23.</note> 
               <hi>how should I be able to rule such a multitude?</hi> Againe: <hi>desuetudine oblitus sum artis regendi multitudinem: through want of practise, I haue forgotten the art of ruling a multitude</hi>: And to <hi>Viretus,</hi> speaking of his going to <hi>Geneua: Cerno quam arduum sit munus ecclesiasticum regere:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cal. to Viret: ep. 25.</note> 
               <hi>I perceiue howe hard a matter it is, to mauage an ecclesiasticall function.</hi> Againe <hi>I am nescio quid factum sit, vt animo incipiam esse inclinatiore, ad capessenda eius gubernacula: I know not how it now commeth to passe, that I am of a more inclininge minde to take the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Church vpon me.</hi> What doe all these speaches meane (I pray you,) but that notwithstanding his pretence of assistantes: yet hee meant so to lay his plot, as that they should all be constrayned, all the sort of them, to daunce after his pipe?</p>
            <p>But howsoeuer these thinges may be interpreted, this is most apparant: that, (as I sayd) such were the <hi>Consistorian</hi> proceedinges, as that both he and his <hi>Consistory,</hi> did grow into great hatred and malice. Insomuch as writing to his friendes,<note place="margin">Cal. ep. 79.</note> he complayneth in this manner. <hi>We haue too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, of a hard and vntamed necke, who vpon euery occasion do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:775:18"/>
to shake off the yoake: that by their tumultes, they mighte abolish the lawfull order of the Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cal. to Viret. ep. 73.</note> 
               <hi>There are in that nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, both olde men, and young men.

               <note place="margin">Cal. to Viret. ep. 3.</note> 
               <hi>I dare not call you hether, for many causes.

               <hi>totum consistorium ruat necesse est: if I desist, there is no remedy, but downe falleth the consistorie.</hi> Great tumults, were vp amongst them in the cittie: and therefore he altered his former mind touching his not calling of <hi>Viretus:</hi> and requesteth him most earnestly: (as beeing more gratious then himselfe) to come and helpe to appease them. <hi>You cannot possibly doe a thing</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that shall be more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto me: then if you shal make a good ende of these quarrells: me ad Garamantas relegato, though I be bannished into the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest partes of the worlde.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cal. to Viret. ep. 82.</note> And in another epistle: <hi>Eo prorupit improbitas, vt retineri qualemcunque ecclesiae statum diutius posse (meo praesertim ministerio) vix sperem. Impiety hath gotten such a head, that I canne scarsely thinke, there can anye tollerable state of the Church continue here, especially, by my ministery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These dissentions proceeding thus on for a time: at the last they came to this issue:<note place="margin">Cal. ep. 165.</note> 
               <hi>vt maior Senatus receptum et bactemus seruatum ecclesiae ordinem repente conuelleret. Nos re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitimus: that the greater Senate did sodainely ouerthrowe the order of the Church: which had beene receiued and kept. But we withstood them.</hi> An argument of very good subiection. Much trouble would surely haue come of it, but that vpon
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:775:19"/>
a sermon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preached by Maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> and after vppon a motion made by him, and the rest of the ministers to the <hi>Senate,</hi> order was taken, that for the quieting of all partes, the said sentence of the greater <hi>Senate,</hi> should be suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, vntill the state of <hi>Geneua</hi> had taken the aduise, of foure <hi>Heluetian</hi> citties,<note place="margin">Beza de vit.

            </p>
            <p>When this course was taken: marke I pray you Maister <hi>Caluins</hi> pollicy.<note place="margin">Calu. to the minist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Tig. ep. 165.</note> He knew (as in effect he saith) that none of the magistrates of anye of those fower citties, woulde write any aunswere, to the cittizens letters of <hi>Geneua,</hi> but by the aduise of their ministers. Wherevpon, whilest the <hi>Syndickes</hi> with their councells were conferring about their letters to be sent to the foresaid citties, how, and what, they should write; yea peraduenture, who should endite them: <hi>Maister Caluin</hi> presently, speedeth a messenger one <hi>Budaeus,</hi> with his priuate letter vnto his priuate friendes, as to <hi>Maister Bullinger, &amp;c.</hi> and with other letters also to the rest of the said Ministers ioyntly: of purpose to prepare and pre-occupate their mindes beforehand, against their magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates should write thither. Now I am come to the very panting or short breathing of the <hi>Consistoriall</hi> pretended <hi>Discipline,</hi> whether it shoulde liue or die at <hi>Geneua.</hi> The daunger it lay in, was exceeding great: but <hi>maister Caluin</hi> applied all his skill and medicines, for the recouerie of it. Few Phisitions will take such paines for their patientes.</p>

table blindnesse: that they had dealt contumeliously with poore straungers: that they had vsed</hi> Farellus <hi>very hardly: that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse of them were such as shamed not to defend</hi> Seruetus <hi>the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke: and that they were Sathans Ministers that stirred vp these strifes.</hi> He indeuoureth to moue all commiseration towardes himselfe and his associates, in respect of their paines and daungers, vndertaken in the behalfe of that Church: as <hi>that for seuen yeares together, they had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, by all those that sought to liue riotously, from vnder the yoake: that for the space of foure yeares, nothing had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted by the wicked, whereby they might by little and little ouerthrowe the state of that Church: and that for the last two yeares, their condition was no better, then if they had liued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the professed enemies of the Gospell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ascribeth very much vnto the ministers: to whome he writ: which was an especiall meanes to procure their good fauours. As (when he saith) <hi>now the matter is come to this point, that all our ecclesiasticall orders shall be quashed, nisi istinc afferatur remedium:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>except there come a remedie from you.</hi> Againe: <hi>you must so deale, as if the state of our Church were in your handes.</hi> Againe, <hi>nunc extremus actus agitur: now the last act is vpon the stage: and the enemies of the Gospell, are begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alreadie, to triumph against Christ his doctrine, his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and all his members.</hi> Againe: <hi>so perswade your selues: that if Sathan be not now bridled by you: habenas ei laxatum iri: he will get the libertie of his bit hereafter at pleasure.</hi> And againe, <hi>I beseech you brethren, by the name of Christ: to thinke that it is no common matter, that is committed vnto you: but that the consultation to be had, is of the state or very being of our Church.</hi> He touched furthermore, all other points: which hee was sure would be especially regarded by them, being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues ministers: in <hi>that</hi> (he saith) <hi>that if their aduersaries
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:775:20"/>
get the victorie, the whole authoritie of the ministerie, is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gone in Geneua: but that it will be subiect, to euery base rake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels reproches.</hi> Which if it should happen, he telleth them, that he was resolued <hi>to depart thence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vnto all these artificiall points, thus insisted vppon by him: he addeth another, of no lesse importance, to drawe the said ministers mindes vnto the bent of his bowe. For notwithstanding hee ascribeth so much vnto them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath been shewed: yet he qualifieth all, in such sorte, as that they might suspect, that except they did concurre with his desire, he would hardly for his part, yeald to anie thing that might crosse him.</p>
            <p>He writeth vnto them, very moderately, of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall platforme. He saith, <hi>he is not ignoraunt how diuerse lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men,</hi>

               <hi>do not thinke that forme of Discipline, that hee writeth for, to be necessary: but yet hee addeth, what his owne opinion is of it, and that he trusteth no man of iudgement will improoue the vse of it, where it is.</hi> He also goeth further, and protesteth, <hi>that whilest he sustaineth the person, that then he did,</hi> (meaning belike whilest he should be the chiefe pastor at <hi>Geneua</hi>) <hi>hee would striue to the death, for that forme of Discipline.</hi> But yet toward the end, he tempereth all againe in some sorte. For else it had been a ridiculous matter, to haue referred their doubtes to those Cities; and withall to haue signified vnto them, that thus and thus we are resolued: and if you shall iudge otherwise, we care not for your iudgements: for we will surely sticke to our owne. He therefore thus qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this point, saying, <hi>nec morositate nostra fiet, vt loco potius cedamus, quam sententia: we will not bee so wilfull, as that wee minde rather to leaue our places, then our opinions.</hi> Meaning (as I take it) that seeing they had put their cause into their hands: they would be content to stand to their directions.</p>

The summe thereof briefly is this: that your honourable Senate may giue this aunswere: vz: that the forme of our Discipline, which heretofore we haue followed, is consentanea verbo dei: agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the word of God: deinde nouitatem improbet: and then let them reproue the newsanglenesse of our Citizens.</hi> Indeed if he can get that aunswere, it is to the matter: and (of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood) will serue his turne. But what do the magistrates of <hi>Geneua</hi> all this while, you will say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Surely: I tolde you before.

            <p>If the magistrates of <hi>Geneua,</hi> had met with as good an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, as <hi>M.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:775:21"/>
continue the preaching of the Gospel amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as euer they were glad at the first to procure &amp; admit it: If they had giuen some round intimation, that they the cittizens were resolued, to haue their Church reformed according to some of the platformes of the <hi>Heluetian</hi> Churches, and that they would no longer endure to be so ouer-looked and hampered, in their owne free Cittie, by such a pragmaticall and intermedlinge <hi>Discipline</hi>: If (I say) their letters had beene penned after this or some such like sort, as I suppose there was good cause: (the proceedings of that Consistory being such at that time as since they haue beene in other places) I doubt not, but that the ministers of those citties, would haue aduised their magistrates: to haue giuen an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of aunswere then they did. For they the saide ministers belieuing Maister <hi>Caluins</hi> information, that all was true which he had reported vnto them: and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, what a small matter it was, which hee and the rest of his associates required at their handes, &amp; that the satisfying of them therein, might breake the backs of such a wicked conspiracy, as was pretended to haue beene made euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe and his Church: and not onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uente that mischiefe for that time, but procure the establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shinge of the Gospell there, for time to come hereafter; they dealt no otherwise for the sayde aunswere, then I am perswaded all the <hi>Bishops</hi> that now are in <hi>England,</hi> (if then they had liued) woulde haue done in the like case.</p>
            <p>And that was in effect as Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> wished: sauing, that whereas he woulde haue had them to haue sayde,<note place="margin">Bul. to Calu. epist. 166.</note> that the forme of the <hi>Geneua</hi> discipline was <hi>consentanea verbo dei, agreable to the worde of God,</hi> they refused to write in that sorte: but were content to say that it did <hi>accedere ad verbi dei praescriptum: that is, that it drewe towardes the prescript of gods
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:775:22"/>
worde, or looked that way.</hi> But you shall heare Maister <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger</hi> himselfe report the aunswere of their <hi>Senate</hi>: which was: <hi>that they were grieued, theyr Church was so troubled, as that one quarrell and contention did begette another: that they had lately heard of the consistoriall lawes of that Church</hi> (for <hi>Caluin</hi> had sent such of them as he thought good, vnto the sayde ministers by <hi>Budaeus</hi> his messenger) <hi>and did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to be godly, and to drae towardes the prescript of gods worde: and therefore that the chaunging of them by any innouation, was not to be admitted in their opinions: that it was better, they should be wholy kept, especially in this age when men waxe worse and worse: that although</hi> (say they) <hi>our discip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line doth not agree with that of Geneua in all points: yet the same being framed according to the circumstaunces of times, places, and persons, doth not import any ouerthrowe of yours: and that according to their desire of Geneua, they had sent vnto them, the forme of their discipline, not minding (as they said) to prescribe any iote of it, to them: for that they deemed their owne at Geneua, to be more meete for them there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being the summe of the aunswere agreed vppon by the sayde <hi>Senate</hi> at <hi>Zuricke</hi>; Maister <hi>Bullinger</hi> presently dispatcheth the same in a priuate letter to <hi>Caluin</hi>:<note place="margin">Bul. to Calu. epist. 166.</note> and not that onely, but he also writ his letters at the same time, to the ministers of <hi>Schafhusen</hi> and <hi>Basill</hi> (two of those citties belike, to the which the deciding of the saide questions was also referred) signifying <hi>what aunswere the magistrates of Zuricke had made: that they likewise there, might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with them in their aunsweres for the peace and edification of the Church of Geneua, although</hi> (sayth he) <hi>you haue not the like forme of discipline in your Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that M. <hi>Bullinger</hi> had thus dispatched his priuate letters: the <hi>Senate</hi> then, soone after, sent their saide aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:775:22"/>
to <hi>Geneua.</hi> Which being receiued, perused, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of: there was great muttering in the cittie. The magistrates thereby did finde themselues as it were in a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berinth. The strength of their state, did depend especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as I iudge) vpon the league and frendship, which they had with the sayde fower citties. So as they might not doe any thinge: that shoulde dislike them. And on the other side, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring the great abuses of their <hi>Consistorialls,</hi> how they had formerly dealt with them, and tyrannized ouer them (as they supposed:) it greatly troubled them, to confirme vnto them, any such authoritie. It seemeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they endeuoured to protract the time, as much as they could. And yet because they thought it meet, that some thing should be done vpon the receipt of the sayde aunswere: they caused a kinde of generall <hi>reconciliation, by giuing theyr right handes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calu. to Bul. epist. 171.</note> 
               <hi>and an oathe was taken, that none of them, for the time to come, would support any euill causes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maister Caluin</hi> being discontent with this <hi>plausible co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of peace,</hi> as perceiuing that thereby <hi>the restoring of the Discipline, vnicus pacis custos: the onely preseruer of peace</hi> (as he tearmeth it) <hi>was neglected,</hi> and <hi>that their Church was still, like Noahs Arke in the floud</hi>: he grewe (after a short time) to be resolute, and prouoked the magistrates, to giue their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere; whether they would followe the aduise of the sayd former Cities, or they would not. Whereupon (as it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) the matter was put to voyces.</p>
            <p>And now see the vpshoote. <hi>In illa promiscua collunie suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragijs fuimus superiores, in that confused ofscouring of the whole multitude,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calu.' to Bul. epist. 207.</note> (saith maister <hi>Caluin</hi>) <hi>we had the most voyces.</hi> It is very worthy the obseruation, and to bee kept likewise in perpetuall memory: in what honourable presence (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:775:23"/>
to maister <hi>Caluins</hi> own estimation) by how reuerend a companie of learned fathers, and famous persons, and with what singular grauitie, great wisedome, and mature deliberation, this solemne and glorious forme of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended holy Discipline, was reuiued againe and intertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>Geneua. In illa promiscua colluuie suffragijs fuimus su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periores.</hi> In that disordered dunghill of riffraffe, tagge and ragge, our presbyteriall platforme, hauing moste of their voyces, carried away the bucklers. No doubt a worthie victorie: For if an assembly be called <hi>colluuies</hi> (as I take it is) a <hi>maiori parte,</hi> of the greater part: what godly man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing would not then haue flung vp his cappe and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to haue seene the noble Consistorye triumphing that day, with the applause and approbation of so honourable a company. Men may talke hereafter of the councell of <hi>Nice</hi> with shame inough: if they shall compare it with this royal assembly. In good earnest, seeing the multitude of all the Citizens of <hi>Geneua,</hi> was content to gratifie maister <hi>Caluin</hi> so much: it might haue become him well inough, to haue recompensed their friendships with some better tearmes. But let that go: if the Citizens themselues do take it well at his hands to be so vsed by him: it shall not any way trouble me any further.</p>
            <p>When maister <hi>Caluin</hi> had well considered, how hardly he had obtained his conquest, and how it was not very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, but that some of those, who had before opposed them selues, would still be practising to ouerthrowe his worke againe, if possibly they coulde: hee aduised (as it should seeme) with his best and surest friendes, what course was meetest to be thought of, and taken for the preuenting of so notable a mischiefe. And their plot was: howe they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:775:23"/>
might strengthen their saide <hi>Colluuies</hi> or greater part, for the better continuance of it. The present oportunitie ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their purpose. Whereupon like wise men, they so hammered their matters whilest the Iron was hot: that they procured fiftie of maister <hi>Caluins</hi> owne nation, all of them meere Frenchmen to be admitted Cittizens at one time in <hi>Geneua.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bod. de repu. lib. 2 Calu. 6.</note> Which was a point of very great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For (as I take it) the people hauing reserued to them selues (as <hi>Bodiue</hi> saith) <hi>ius i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then to haue such an increase of assured friends, that would sticke as fast to maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> as the skinne did to his forehead: was surely a great matter in so little a towne. And as this polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie was put in practise for the Citizens: so I coniecture it was also from time to time, as touching the ministers.</p>
            <p>None but Frenchmen might rule there in that Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie: if maister <hi>Caluin</hi> could helpe it. When the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates vpon a time would needes haue one <hi>Trollietus</hi> a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuian</hi> borne, to bee one of their ministers: heare (I pray you) how maister <hi>Caluin</hi> writeth thereof, to his friend <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cal. to Viret. epist. 586.</note> 
               <hi>Trollietus quidam, quod natione sit Geneuensis &amp;c. One Trollietus, because he is a Geneuian borne, is obtruded vnto vs: in whome there do appeare many signes, which none of vs like of. Aud I see not any thing in him worthy a Minister: nisi quod Simiae amant suos catulos: but that apes loue their whelpes.</hi> So as I gesse, that for maister <hi>Caluins</hi> time: no Apes were fit for his turne, but his owne. Though maister <hi>Caluin</hi> writ in this sort, (merrily peraduenture) to his familiar friend: yet maister <hi>Beza</hi> was not bound to haue published such a disgrace in print against those, that haue deserued better
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:775:24"/>
of him. But this partialitie in the choyse of their ministers; was not a matter that much offended any; for ought I find. Marry the other deuise, of making fiftie Frenchmen, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens at a clappe: did wonderfully trouble many. It caused a present mutinie in the Citie and a great vprore: the sparks whereof were neuer quenched, as long as maister <hi>Caluin</hi> liued.</p>
            <p>And thus you haue the birth, and confirmation, of the Consistoriall discipline with a deuise for the continuance of it: collected (for the most part) out of such Epistles as <hi>Beza</hi> hath thought meete, to publish, for maister <hi>Caluins</hi> commendation. If I should haue set them both downe; as some others haue done: (who are no Papistes) you should haue heard another manner of history. But I like not to take thinges, at the worst hand. The trueth was it I sought for. And I would not haue done that neither in this point: but because certaine persons of the consistoriall humour, doe daily vpon euery occasion, still dash vs in the teeth, with the orders of <hi>Geneua</hi>: the discipline at <hi>Geneua</hi>: and the Consistorie in <hi>Geneua</hi>: as though that forme of discipline, had come lately from heauen: with an embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage from God, that all the Churches in the worlde must frame and conforme themselues, to the fashion of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua.</hi> Which gaue me iust occasion (in mine opinion) to search (as you haue heard) into the secrets of that manner of Discipline: to knowe indeede, from whence it came, whether it would, who deuised it: when, and how, it was planted at <hi>Geneua</hi>: the first place that hatched and recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was not long, after that M. <hi>Caluin</hi> had obtained his desire, (as you haue heard in the former Chapter,) for the planting of the platforme of his pretended Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in Geneua: when for the better backing of himselfe he procured maister <hi>Beza,</hi> his especiall friend, (a man whom he knew to be of a very great courage, wise, learned, and one wholly addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to applaude to all manner of his procedinges) to be likewise placed with him there. And then being both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: two such excellent men amongest a company of Artizans and Marchaunts: what might they not compasse and bring to effect? Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time that maister <hi>Caluin</hi> came first to <hi>Geneua,</hi> 1536. and had gotten the allowance of his first draught of Discipline, vz. 1537. hee grew daily more and more into liking with it: especially after the fuller inlargement thereof 1541. when hee was restored againe to his place at Geneua. But most of all, when about the yeare 1554. hee hadde triumphed as it were the third time, by the greater part of the voices of the ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t multitude, and had also gotten maister <hi>Beza</hi> his applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into his company: then we may not maruaile, if that his platforme so trauailed for, seemed glorious vnto him.</p>
            <p>In those daies when maister <hi>Caluin</hi> did first shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his writinges against the Papists: he was the onely man of especiall account of all the French nation. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as all the rest of his countrey men, that began more
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:775:26"/>
freely to professe the Gospell: did principally in a manner depend vppon him: especially after he had possession of his great authority in the Presbytery at <hi>Geneua.</hi> For then by reason of the quiet estate of that Citty: the free accesse and entertainement of such French-men as fledde thither for religion: the want of sufficient men in other places of their owne countrey, to giue aduise and Councell, what was to be done in such distresses of the Church, as then were vsuall, and by reason of the fame, ability, learning and pollicy, both of himselfe and of his assistant Maister <hi>Beza</hi>: and likewise of their willingnesse or rather desire to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all occasions of busying themselues: the Citty of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua</hi> became in short time (for their sakes) to bee of great estimation in Fraunce. He that shall read maister <hi>Caluins</hi> and maister <hi>Bezaes</hi> two bookes of Epistles, and likewise the Commentaries of Fraunce, with diuerse other discourses, about those affaires, and should withall giue any credit ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Heshusius, Baldwinus, Carpentarius</hi> or others, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all of them, and some of them knowen Protestants: would certainly maruaile to vnderstand into what actions and dealinges they thrust themselues: of warre, of peace, of subiection how farre it extended: of reformation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out staying for the Magistrates: of leagues: of impositions, and what not. They writte their Letters, to this state and that state: to this Prince and that Duke: to this king and that Emperour: what their desire was, should be done in such, and such a matter? Not like the persons either of Newington or Hitchin, (that I may vse <hi>Cartwrights</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of such Episcopall Seas, as he alloweth of) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like two Patriarches at the lest. Generally for Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters: they had ingrossed the whole managing of them into their handes. And then you may easely gesse, what
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:775:26"/>
fauour the pretended presbyteriall discipline was like to finde with them: it being the onely pretence for all that their authoritie, or whatsoeuer else they tooke vpon them to deale in.</p>
            <p>And marke howe the oportunitie serued them. The number of zealous professors in Fraunce daily increased: who exempted themselues from the tyrannous comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes of their Romish Bishops. They had then no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or certain forme of Church gouernment: how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede and behaue themselues in their religious assemblies. And to haue framed it to any forraine platformes: woulde haue stirred vp coales amongest them. Nay it was not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to haue been compassed, Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> and Maister <hi>Beza</hi> sitting at their sterne. So that it came no sooner in question, what maner of ecclesiasticall regiment was mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test for those Churches: but the forme of discipline vsed at <hi>Geneua,</hi> was presently agreed vpon. From which time you shall finde that the reformation of religion in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> did wholly proceede after the rules of that kinde of discipline. It was not sufficient to haue the exercise of religion: but the Churches must <hi>vindicari in plenam libertatem, be restored to her full libertie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pet. Carpent. ad Franc. portam.</note> 
               <hi>Synodes</hi> were held, lawes were made, and decrees were put in execution. What orders then in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest:<note place="margin">Comment. of France.</note> what ceremonies: what manner of seruice: what kinde of subiection: what way to reforme religion: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fashion of <hi>Geneua</hi>?

            </p>
            <p>Much more might heere be added, and that out of their owne authentike writers of this <hi>disciplinarian</hi> canker: how and by what meanes it spred it self in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and in some other Countries. But I will passe that ouer, and come to acquaint you, how the same infection hath been transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from those coastes to this side of the seas, amongst vs. If Maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> but especially maister <hi>Beza,</hi> could haue been content to haue contained themselues, within the limites either of <hi>Geneua</hi> or <hi>Fraunce,</hi> &amp; to haue intermedled &amp; raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there only: and to haue vrged their platforme and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise no further: they might the better (for vs in <hi>England</hi>) haue been borne withall. But nowe seeing they haue not so done: who can be offended that I should make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it? to the end, that if they dealt amisse therein, theyr examples and proceedinges might haue the estimation, which indeed they deserue.</p>
            <p>I omit how in <hi>K.

In <hi>England</hi> poperie was restored, and much cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vsed, whereby they were constrained for the sauing of their liues, to leaue their Countrye, their liuings, and theyr friendes. In which case a man may easily gesse, how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable these pointes were vnto some kinde of humors: <hi>vz.</hi> that if Bishops and Princes refused to admit of the Gospell: they might be vsed by their subiects, as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Geneua</hi> was vsed, that is (<hi>deposed,</hi>) and that euerie particular minister with his assistants according to the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme of that discipline, was himselfe a Bishop, and had as great authoritie within his owne parish, as any Bishop in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:775:28"/>
the world might lawfully challenge: euen to the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of the best, aswell the Prince as the Pesaunt. And indeede accordingly, these positions (as afterward it will appere,) were so pleasing to <hi>Whittingham</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sortes, as it had beene a very meane forme of discipline, (I suppose) that hauing such principles annexed vnto it, wold at that time haue beene refused by them. Howbeit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there were, and that of the learnedest of those, that then departed the Realme, as <hi>Doct. Cox, Doct. Horne, M. Iewell,</hi> with sundrie others: who perceauing the trickes of that discipline,<note place="margin">Discourse pag. 47.</note> did vtterly dislike it. So as when they came afterwardes to <hi>Franckford,</hi> they wholy insisted vppon the platforme of <hi>England</hi>: and in short time obtayning of the Magistrates the vse thereof, they did chose either <hi>D. Cox</hi> or <hi>D. Horne,</hi> (as I gesse) or some such other as had beene of especiall account in K. <hi>Edwards</hi> time, to be (as it were) their Superintendent.</p>
            <p>For the bringing of which matter to passe, one maister <hi>Clanbourge</hi> a chiefe magistrate in that Citie, hauing shewed them some especiall fauour: complaint was made thereof (as it seemeth) to <hi>M. Caluin.</hi> Whereupon the sayde <hi>M. Clanbourg</hi> did write to him, (as it should appeare,) that he was induced to yeald to such a choyse, the rather because the sayd Superintendent had some such like superior place in <hi>England,</hi> before he came thither. Vnto the which point, maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> (that he might thrust his oare into euerye mans boat,) to disgrace the sayd platforme of <hi>England,</hi> as much as lay in him, and to incourage the factious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at <hi>Franckforde,</hi> (that were besotted with his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded discipline,) did returne this answere: (If <hi>Beza</hi> hath set out his letter truely):<note place="margin">Calu. Epist. 229.</note> 
               <hi>I would one point had beene omitted, which was suggested vnto you, I doubt not by that one partie.</hi> (I
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:775:28"/>
thinke he meaneth the sayd superintendent.) <hi>For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it would neuer haue come into your cogitation,</hi> (as though he had still kept his whole estate in England,) <hi>to haue esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished his former ministerie there with you, in a perpetuall possession of the authoritie therof. Peraduenture there is nothinge that from the beginninge,</hi> (his meaninge is, since the Englishemen came thither,) <hi>hath stired vp more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or at the leaste displeasure, &amp; so hath kindled strife, then this emulation: in that the greater part did thinke themselues to be thrust from their equall degree, and to bee contumeliously excluded from the common societie: if the Church which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued intertainment with you,</hi> (meaning the companie, that had receiued his forme of discipline, before the saide lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men came to Franckford,) should receaue their lawes from the other parte or side.</p>
            <p>Within some short time after this, that, the sayd order of the English Church was established, (as you haue hard) at <hi>Franckford</hi>: diuerse of those men, who had beene earnest for the <hi>Geneuian</hi> discipline, deuided themselues from that Church, (as <hi>Whittingham, Gilby, Goodman,</hi> and others,) and went to <hi>Geneua.</hi> Where, to the great discredit of the estate of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in Kinge <hi>Edwardes</hi> time: to the greate griefe of such godly men, and afterwardes worthy Martirs, as remayned here in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time in <hi>England</hi>: and to the greate discouragement of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry weake professors then also in <hi>England</hi>: they reiected the whole forme of our English reformation: the booke of common praier: our seruice: the order of our sacramentes, and of all thinges els in effect there prescribed: and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themselues altogether to the fashions of the Church at <hi>Geneua.</hi> Where they had not beene longe, when they had sucked and disgested the whole doctrine before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:775:29"/>
to be as the appendants necessarily annexed to that forme of newe discipline: and which was afterwardes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by <hi>Beza,</hi> (as I take it,) <hi>Hotoman,</hi> &amp; others of the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinarian</hi> humor, in their bookes intituled: <hi>De iure magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratuum &amp;c. Vindicia contra tirannos: Franco-gallia. &amp;c.</hi> The generall summe of which their <hi>allobrogicall</hi> food, so much as concerneth this poynt of the <hi>disciplinarian</hi> reformation: (that I may omitt their desperate poyntes of deposinge of Princes, and of putting them to death in diuerse cases of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance against reformation) was this: that <hi>if the soueraine magistrates refused to admitt it: the ministers, the inferior magistrates, the people &amp;c. might set it on foote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</hi> Of these and such like arguments, diuerse bookes were allowed of, by the ministers of <hi>Geneua</hi>: to bee then printed there in English, and to be published for Englande and Scotland, as conteyning such doctrine in them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the worlde might take notice, that as they had practised some parte of it themselues, so they would be ready vpon all occasions to iustifie it.</p>
            <p>I haue heard many, greately commende the intertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that was giuen in Queene Maries time to English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, at <hi>Geneua.</hi> And surely the citizens there, are (in mine opinion) to be greatly commended and assisted for it, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions shall require.

            <p>As soone as this saide pretended discipline began to get a head in that Countrey: then againe (as amongest cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Frenche Ministers,) no forme of Seruice, or of the administration of the Sacramentes, no orders, nor any thing else, but all must be done, as it was at <hi>Geneua.</hi> As any doubts did arise amongest them, concerning any Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>causes, though they were but very simple, &amp; such as a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of meane capacity and iudgement, might very easely haue satisfied: yet no man but maister <hi>Caluin</hi> for his time,<note place="margin">Calu.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:775:30"/>
themselues exceedingly. See how <hi>Beza,</hi> being informed thereof, doth allow of their dealings, &amp; incourageth them to goe forewarde, in such their obedient &amp; right <hi>Consistori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> courses.

But I will leaue these and such like <hi>Geneuian</hi> dealinges, in that part of this Iland: because per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture they are desired to be continued there still: and come vnto the <hi>Geneuating,</hi> for the selfe same platforme of discipline, here at home amongest our selues.</p>
            <p>As soone as her maiesty, (whom Almighty God longe preserue to raigne ouer vs,) was come to the Crown: word was sent into this Realme from <hi>Geneua,</hi>

But for the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuian</hi> discipline, all their desires were in that point insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. They had seene how <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> did raign at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi> and thought scorne thereuppon to be subiect vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

Comming from <hi>Geneua</hi>: they thought they should haue beene ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired. But finding themselues therein deceaued, and that their <hi>Geneuian</hi> motions, were little regarded: it wrought in them a very great discontentment, and made them so wilfull, that nothing would please them, which was not practised in <hi>Geneua.</hi> So as thereby great contentions were presently stirred vp by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

A long time I differred for diuers waighty reasons so to do: and I professe, that most willingly I would yet haue beene silent, but that I thinke I should greatlye offende, if I should still reiect their so many petitions, and most pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull mournings.</hi> Wee in <hi>England</hi> may thinke, wee haue had great iewels of these disturbers, and that for all their pretences of great learning, and grauitie, they were indeed of a very shallow iudgement, that could finde nothing to stay their consciences vppon, but what should bee sent to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:775:32"/>
them from <hi>M. Beza.</hi> It was a fond part for them to write so vnto him, and a very insolent parte for him to take so much vpon him: but in that hee hath published so much to the world in print: (their childishnes, &amp; his owne pride, I may terme it,) but I want a word to expresse my conceit.</p>
            <p>Hereby it should seeme, that if <hi>Beza</hi> had taken such a course as might well haue beseemed him: it lay greatly in his power, to haue very much quieted all those present troubles. But that minde was farre from him: and yet it would haue tended a great deale more to his owne credit. For he giueth his sayd deerest beloued Brethren, very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, vnlearned, and vngodly councell: although euer since that time, (according to their promise) they haue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grauely builded their consciences vpon it.<note place="margin">Beza Epist. 12</note> And it was this in effect, <hi>that if they could not enioy their ministerie, without giuing their consents, to the manner of making of our Ministers by the Bishops, without the voyces of such a Presbiterie, as he and his Schollers do dreame of, without giuing their consents to the vse of the Cap and Surplise, and to the manner of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Church of England &amp;c.

            <p>After some time spent in these brables: then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought them, to fall more directly in hand, with the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian Discipline.</hi> To this purpose certaine persons assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themselues priuately together in <hi>London:</hi> (as I haue beene enformed): namely <hi>Gilbye, Sampson, Leuer, Field, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cox,</hi> and I wot not who besides.

               <hi>wherein there would bee dealing with matters of Religion, I could not chose, but write vnto you of that matter.</hi> And so he proceedeth; shewing, <hi>that all men doe allow of our doctrine, but not of our Discipline.</hi> That <hi>except, where there is pure doctrine, there be also pure discipline</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own <hi>Geneuian</hi> Darling): <hi>the Churches are litle the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and that therefore <hi>her Maiestie, and her faythfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors should procure the setting vp of this pure Discipline,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding any <hi>difficulties</hi> whatsoeuer that might hinder it. The same yeare also 1572. hee writ to the Queenes Maiestie, an Epistle dedicatory, before his annotations vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the new Testament.

Neither the Bishop of <hi>Geneua,</hi> nor the Bishops in <hi>Scotland</hi> (for ought I finde) were euer more Turkifhly handled by Heathenish Libels and most vnchristian calumniations, then our Bishops haue bene, by diuers of these our <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating Passauantians.</hi> By the like course also, and in the same manner, haue they dealt (as far as possibly they durst) with her most excellent Maiestie, with the high Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, with the Lordes of her Highnes most honorable Priuy Councell, and with the Iudges &amp; Lawes of the land. The reformation of religion, which almighty God hath wrought amongst vs by her Maiesties meanes, some of them haue tearmed a deformation: and all of them do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:775:33"/>
and depraue it to their vttermost abilitie, most lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and falsly.</p>
            <p>Since the time, they haue seen litle hope, that her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie &amp; the other states of this land, would euer giue place to their vnstaied vanities and <hi>Phaetonicall</hi> presumptions: they haue applied themselues to the practise of the inseparable <hi>Disciplinarian</hi> adiunct mentioned: vz: that when such states do refuse, and will in no wise be perswaded to embrace and establish within theyr dominions, the pretended Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Discipline, so liked of at <hi>Geneua</hi>: the Ministers may draw the people vnto them by all maner of allurementes, and so betwixt them set it vp themselues. And in this course, they haue already farre proceeded: altogether (as you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by the saide act of Parliament in <hi>Scotland, Anno.</hi> 1584.) after the same maner that the Ministers of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did proceede. They haue had theyr subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their <hi>Synodes</hi> of diuerse sortes, <hi>Classicall, Prouinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> and <hi>Generall.</hi> In those <hi>Synodes</hi> they haue practised Censures, made lawes of their owne, and disallowed some of those, which the state of this realme hath made. Vnto these and such like their priuate Conuenticles, they haue appropriated the name of the Church: and hauing separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselues in a sorte, from all those Christians, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour not their mistresse, they are become ioined into a new brotherhood of the <hi>Allobrogicall Discipline.</hi> As there grew some occasion of feare amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that these their Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storial proceedings, were likely to breake forth, before they were ready and able, by the strength of their assistance to stand to their tackling: consultation was had, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ouerruled, that none of that brotherhood, (if hee were apprehended) should in any wise appeach another: but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refuse to detect such dealinges of the godly brethren,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:775:34"/>
as they themselues so greatly liked, and were of opinion to be most honest and iust. He that woulde take the paines to peruse the examinations of <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and of some others in the <hi>Starre-chamber</hi>: (as any may easily do, now that they are published) should finde all these particulars and many more, then heere I wil speake of, to be most true.</p>
            <p>And thus you see the <hi>Geneuian Discipline</hi> deuised by one man, procured at the first by his comming, great intreaty, and friendship, being then a simple and a poore Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, God knoweth, fit peraduenture, in the alteration of a <hi>Monarchy</hi> into a popular state, to receaue some intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but (as I say) now you may plainly see what a Ladie she is growen to be: through the instigations and practises of maister <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> and howe and by what meanes she hath enlarged her Dominions, and set her foot into this Iland, of <hi>Britaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could further adde hereunto: how they haue not bin content to keepe themselues within the limites of <hi>Geneua, Fraunce, England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> dealing as you haue heard: but haue sought to take the verie same course in some other Countries likewise. Maister <hi>Beza doubted not</hi> (as hee saith) <hi>omnes principes hortari, to exhort all Princes,</hi> to admit of the <hi>Sauoyan</hi> platforme.<note place="margin">Beza de pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byt. pag. 123.</note> And this you shall finde a thing ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, both in maister <hi>Caluins</hi> and maister <hi>Bezaes</hi> writings: that as soone, as they haue heard from time to time of any countrey, that hath begunne to abolish Popery: by and by, they haue come vpon them, with most earnest solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and gloses for the contracting of this their gallant Consistorian minion with them. What letters haue been written into <hi>Germany, Transiluania,</hi> and <hi>Polonia,</hi> wherein that point alwaies playeth a chiefe part? One letter written by <hi>Beza</hi> into <hi>Polonia,</hi> I cannot chuse but make mention of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:775:34"/>After diuerse attempts and sutes made, in the behalfe of their <hi>Discipline,</hi> to haue had her placed in <hi>Polonia</hi>: one <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicius</hi> writ to <hi>Beza,</hi> (as it seemeth) in this sorte: <hi>timetur al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera tyrannis:</hi> now the Pope is bannished, it is feared heere, that this your platforme of <hi>Discipline,</hi> woulde proue to be as tirannous a kinde of gouernement, as euer the Popes was.<note place="margin">Sar. in.

In gold (the chiefest met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall) there is great sophistication. He that will be easily led:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:775:35"/>
is soone deceaued. To hold a thing for good, before a man haue tried it: (by such a touchstone as is meete for his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,) I hold it great folly. The credit which Popery grew vnto: did partly proceed of such rashnesse. Men were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, hauing a good opinion of their Priestes to be led by them, as it were a Beare by the nose: and without any triall to accept in good part of whatsoeuer they gaue them. And as the people were carried thus away by their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions of their Priestes: so were the poore Priests them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues (many of them no doubt) misse-led through the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable regard, which they had of their superiors.</p>
            <p>It is wonderfull, what time and custome will worke. A man may tell a lye so oft, that forgetting himselfe to be the authour of it: he may thinke he heard it, at the first from some person of credite, and so beleeue it to be true. It may be that the Bishops of Rome, through the continuall flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of their Parasites, telling them still, they coulde not erre, and that they were the Lordes of the whole world: though at the first, they knew they lyed: yet afterwardes, beginning by little and little to beleeue them, they are now in time come to this, that he who saith otherwise, they will by no meanes endure him: he is become an heretique, and I wot not what. The Bishops also and other great learned men, following the streames as they ranne in their dayes: did grow by degrees to reckon of the Popes, as they found them, in their times, to account of themselues. And thus I suppose, (or at the least by some such meanes) that both the Priestes of all sortes, and likewise the people, became in time, to be so drowned in the puddles of Poperie: all of them together from the top to the toe, forgetting the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles saide rule, of trying euery thing whatsoeuer, before they held it for good. Which notable point of this Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:775:36"/>
wisedome being of later yeares fallen into practise, by euery man that feared God: according to the measure of his giftes and as his calling did require: we see it to be true by our owne experience, that euen children now (in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) are able to discerne the trueth, in sondry thinges, wherein many men of iudgement and good learning were heretofore blinded. And euen in some such like sorte hath it happened in this matter of the <hi>Geneua</hi> Discipline.</p>
            <p>Men haue been carried headlong with it, before they knew well what they did: and all vnder godly pretences. It is a plausible matter with the people, to heare them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued, that are in authoritie: but especially to vnderstand of anie libertie or power which may appertaine to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Besides when men haue been bitten with abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, it is an acceptable point, to heare the things themselues which were abused, exclaimed against. For it falleth not vnder euery simple mans cap: to distinguishe well in that matter. Furthermore also it is not vnknowne, to any of iudgment, what the profession of any extraordinary zeale, and as it were, contempt of the world: doth work with the multitude. When they see men go simply in the streetes: looking downward for the most part: wringing their necks awry: shaking their heades, as though they were in some present griefe: lifting vp the white of their eies sometimes, at the sight of some vanitie, as they walke: when they heare them giue great grones: crie out against this sinne, and that sinne, (not in them their hearers, but in their superiours) make long praiers, professe a kinde of wilfull pouertie, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king most earnestly against some mens hauing too much, and some men too litle (which beateth into the peoples heades a present cogitation of some diuision to be made in time.) when I say the multitude doth see, and heare such
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:775:36"/>
kind of men: they are by and by carried away with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous great conceite and opinion of them: especially when withall they take vpon them to shewe a way or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Discipline; which shalbe (forsooth) nothing preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to the people: but rather bring them great libertie, and yet shalbe such a way, as shall reforme all thinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, and that in such sorte, as they themselues would ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wish or desire.</p>
            <p>And as many people in this our time haue beene thus beguiled, by a certaine crue of Ministers: so they the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters amongst themselues, vpon the like outward shewes, and false pretences, in this point I speake of, (concerning the pretended holy Discipline) haue beene greatly misled, one sorte by another: the inferior, by the superior, (as by <hi>Cartwright</hi> and some others) and these superiors here, with vs, by two men especially, maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> and maister <hi>Beza,</hi> whilest the first sorte haue wholly depended vpon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the second vppon the third.</p>
            <p>Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> that deuised the said platforme, was sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an excellent man: and so is maister <hi>Beza,</hi> who since that time hath beene the principall maintainer of it. But yet both of them in their times: haue not wanted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affections of men. Much trouble there was, before their saide deuise was receaued: which made them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the fonder of it. We haue a saying, that the Crow thinketh her owne birde the fairest: and so doe men and women (for the most part) their owne children. Nature doth therein beare sway with the best. But especially she sheweth her force most, in the fruicts of a mans mind. For as our mindes ought to be more deare vnto vs, then our bodies: so are the fruites of our minds, of greater account with vs, then the fruites of our bodies. Few men that we
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:775:37"/>
heare of, will giue their liues for their children: but many wee see, will do it most readily in the maintenance of their opinions. Which thinges considered, I cannot but in some sorte excuse maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> and maister <hi>Beza</hi>: in seeking all manner of waies, all shewes, all shiftes, all aduauntages, that possibly they could either finde or deuise: whereby they might iustifie in some sorte the birth and bringing vp of their misconceaued offpring. The chiefest ouersight was in my opinion, that other learned and wise men, doe not well obserue, these manner of naturall and common affections in them: but were carried after them (as it were with a whirlewind) to like as they liked, to say as they said, and to doe as they did. If maister <hi>Caluin</hi> and maister <hi>Beza</hi> affirmed it: why it was inough.</p>
            <p>I haue heard it credibly reported that in a certaine Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> when it happeneth that in there dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, the authority either of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> or of Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> or of Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> or of any other of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers: nay the whole consent of them all alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is alledged: it is reiected with very great disda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne: as: what tell you me of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> or of the rest? I regard them not a rush: were they not men? Whereas at other time, when it happeneth that a man of an other humor doth aunswere, if it fall out that he beinge pressed with the authority either of <hi>Caluin</hi> or <hi>Beza,</hi> shall chance to deny it: you shall see some beginne to smile, in commiseration of such the poore mans simplicity: some grow to be angry in regard of such presumption: and some will depart away, accounting such a kinde of fellowe, not worthy the hearing. Were not this a pretty and pleasaunt Interlude, or Comedy: to behold such Parasites, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their partes, so <hi>Disciplinarian</hi>-like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And all these follies
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:775:37"/>
and dependances; that the people haue doted so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some kinde of Ministers: that the inferior sort of those ministers haue taken all for currant coine, that hath beene paide them by their superiors: and that they the superiors haue beene also so farre ouercaried with the credite of the saide two persons: all these follies (I say) did proceed from this fountaine, that neither the people, nor their rash seducers, did in time put the holy Apostles rule in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise: vz. <hi>try all thinges, and keepe that which is good.</hi> But it is better late then neuer. Since men of all sorts, haue ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more carefully into the triall of all the saide pretences, together with the very substaunce of that their pretended holy platforme, the furious rage of that floud hath beene pretily well diuerted. And the very chiefe Captains them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, being vrged of necessity a litle to fall on searching: haue found that (which I feare) they are sorry for: and are become (as it seemeth) like men greatly amased, to be at their wits end. And now to this purpose I will tell you a wonder.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Cartwright</hi> and his adherents were to beginne the course againe, that they haue runne: I am perswaded, they would neuer tread so much as one steppe in it. But nowe they haue engaged their credits, they must shift thinges of, aswell as they can: and where their wards serue them not, beare-of the blowes, that shall fall vppon them, with their heads and shoulders. In the yeare 1572. (as you haue heard in the former Chapter) the first admonition was offered to the Parliament, as containing a perfect plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme of the worthy pretended Discipline, to haue beene established within this Realme. Within a yeare or two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Cartwright</hi> taking in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the defence of that platform: did alter it in some points, especially where it seemed to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:775:38"/>
too much vnto the people. And then if it bee true which is reported: that one desiring vppon a time confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with him, about these manner of causes; he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: what neede you to talke with me? you may haue my Bookes, they are <hi>Est</hi> and <hi>Amen:</hi> I doubt not but he would haue sworne vppon conuenient occasion, that the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitioners platforme, so qualified by him, was a most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect patterne for all Churches. Howbeit within a while after, it proued not so. For about the yeare 1583. where before the platfourme of <hi>Geneua</hi> (as it was lefte at large in <hi>Cartwrigts</hi> Bookes) had beene followed: now there was a particular draught made for <hi>England,</hi> with a newe forme of common Praier therein prescribed.</p>
            <p>The yeare ensuing 1584. the seuen and twentith of her Maiesty, out starteth this Booke, with great glory at the Parliament time: and forthwith the present gouernment of the Church, with all the orders, lawes and ceremonies thereof, was to be cut-off at one blow, and this new booke or platforme must needes be established. But it preuailed not. Shortly after that Parliament, the saide booke and platforme was found amongest themselues, to haue some thing amisse in it. And the correcting of it was referred to <hi>Trauerse.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A letter of Field to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers 1585.</note> Which worke by him performed, came out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine about the yeare 1586. when there was an other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the nine and twentieth of her maiesties raigne. But it was then (as I suppose) seuered from the saide book of Common praier: and become an entire worke of it selfe. And then also at the saide Parliament there wanted not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse solicitors,<note place="margin">Examinat in the Star-cha-</note> for the admittance of it. Afterwardes a new conference was had againe, about this seconde corrected booke. For still there were some things out of square in it.</p>
            <p>In the yeare 1588. at an assembly in <hi>Couentry,</hi> these
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:775:38"/>
doubts,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> which were growen, were (as it seemeth) debated: and so were many other, <hi>Cartwright</hi> himselfe being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. But which of the saide doubts in their platfourme were then resolued, I find it not. This appeared, that some of them remained, which they were not able to resolue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> For although they then concluded, that the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it selfe was an essentiall forme of Discipline, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for all times: &amp; subscribed vnto the practise of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of it, without any further expecting the magistrats pleasure: yet in theyr subscriptions, <hi>they excepted some fewe points, which were reserued to be discussed, by certaine bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in an other assembly.</hi> Where this assembly was kept, I canuot certainely affirme.<note place="margin">Articles an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to their booke of dis.</note> But it appeareth <hi>vppon deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that the next yeare after, there was one held in Sainct <hi>Iohns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Where <hi>Cartwright</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine present and many moe besides: <hi>diuerse imperfections in the saide Booke of Discipline were corrected altered and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>:<note place="margin">Maister Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber examined in the Starre. chamber.</note> 
               <hi>and there they did not onely perfect the said Booke: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so did then and there (as the examinate remembred) voluntarily agree amongest the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, that so many as would, should subscribe to the saide Booke of Discipline after that time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well then, at the last, I trust we haue found out, what they are agreede vppon: and what they will stand vnto. You see there hath beene much plotting amongest them: and it is time (a man would thinke) that after such stirres, meetinges, conferences, and Synods made in that behalfe: they should be resolued at the last of the things they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. But now I come to my wonder, before mentioned: for so I esteeme of it. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and the chiefest of those, that haue beene lately in prison, in one of their foresaide examinations in the Starre-chamber, doe plainely auouch it, vppon their oathes: (and so I belieue them) <hi>that there
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:775:39"/>
are some thinges in theyr saide draught of Discipline, wherein as yet they were neuer resolued.</hi> What? Is neither, <hi>Geneua, Fraunce,</hi> nor <hi>Scotland,</hi> able to satisfie them? Haue they sought vnto them for theyr opinions: and doe they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to make them any aunswere? Or else thinke they scorne to aske councell of any men: but had rather, then they woulde so much discredite themselues, dwell still in their doubts? Surely I would be very glad to know what doubts these were, wherein as yet, they were neuer resolued. I haue desired diuerse, to haue told me of them: but they would not. Notwithstanding I will tell you, what I gesse, they were; not at randon (as they say) but vppon some good probability. I met by chaunce with a paper, of no mean mans among them, wherein (as I take it) some of them (at the least) are expressed, and they are these following.</p>

            <p>Vnto these quaerees, I could adde some other if I list. What if <hi>Beza</hi> himselfe, beginne to doubt, as concerning his Discipline: or at the least beginne to finde some defectes in it? What if he desire to be <hi>caput Episcoporum:</hi> the head of all Bishops within his prouince? what if hee would haue the presidentship of euery Synode to be a continuall office? But hereof afterwardes in the chapter. In the meane while, I could wishe with all my heart, that those who are wise, would throughly consider, howe this Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the state of the whole Realme, her Maiestie, the high Court of Parliament, the present forme of our Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call gouernement with the lawes and orders thereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining, and generally all her highnesse dutifull and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing subiects haue been vsed, by these so distracted, so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous, and so notorious rash-pates: in that after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny admonitions, supplications, petitions, deprauations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uections, humble motions, draughts, platformes, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, and what not? (which haue bred alreadie a milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of great inconueniences and mischiefes.) Now being pressed vpon their othes, they are constrained to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that as yet they are not resolued in all pointes what they woulde haue. If the state had been as rashe in their grauntes, as they haue been shamelesse in their demaunds: peraduenture the Realme and Church of <hi>England</hi> by this time, might haue been in some such like case, as (if sondry reportes be true) there be some in the world.</p>
            <p>It may be heere obiected peraduenture, that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the testimony alleadged for the doubtes mentioned,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:775:40"/>
were sufficient: yet they are but about matters of small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: whereas in points of substance they doe all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre and are agreed together. Whether the doubts which I shewed vnto you, be of any importance or not: I leaue it to your consideration. Indeede, if a man may say the truth, without their offence, there is nothing which they holde concerning this <hi>Allobrogicall</hi> deuise, wherein we do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them, that is of any good importance of substance. But for any agreement or resolution in any of the partes of their platforme, whether of substance almost or not of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, you shall not finde it I assure you amongst them: as in the processe following it wil appeare. And I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they will disagree euery day more and more: vntil by triall of their former rashnesse, they shalbe contented to embrace the present forme of Ecclesiasticall gouernement in England, and from the bottome of their heartes thanke almightie God for it.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. With what distraction, vncertaintie, diuersitie of iudgementes, pretence is made, that the Geneua Discipline is of very great antiquitie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I haue said, in the second chapter, if my life lay vppon it, I could not finde, that there was euer in the world, anie such platforme of Discipline, as is now vrged, by the patrones and defenders of it, before maister <hi>Caluin</hi> deuised it, and with much trouble set it vp, at the last in <hi>Geneua.</hi> I know it is said nowe a dayes: that it is of a farre greater antiquitie. And if I were not otherwise by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:775:40"/>
setled, I might peraduenture be ouercarried that way with their pretences. The Herroldes at armes they say, can do verie much, in a mans pedigree. Though peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his Gentilitie be not of fiftie yeares standing: yet if neede require, <hi>William Conquerours</hi> time is nothing: they will fetch it from <hi>Adam.</hi> You shall haue the first finder out, Bathes in <hi>England:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Book of the Bathes.</note> so gentilized. And euen suche a like course is taken, for the <hi>Geneua Discipline.</hi> She must needes be a Lady, of an auncient stocke. And therefore her feed Herroldes do take great paines in her behalfe. Such chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and changing: such clayming and disclaiming of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reds: such coating, intercoating &amp; quartering of her armes, with this great personage in that countrey, and with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as great in this countrey: you shall rarely finde (I am verely perswaded) in all the auncient recordes and rules of Herrauldry. To leape ouer a thousand and fiue hundred yeares, at the first skippe, ouer almost two thousand yeares at the next, and in a manner to <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke at the third: is but a small matter with them. There was neuer poore gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomans credite more sought to be set foorth: with the smoakie images of her worm-aten auncestors, then hers is. The <hi>Geneua</hi> platforme to be reckoned so late a deuise, as that maister <hi>Caluin</hi> should be the first author of it: they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide it.</p>
            <p>But I will come to their first skippe: which is in effect, from the yeare aboue mentioned 1541. vnto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles time backward. For as I remember I haue read it in one of their bookes: that <hi>in all the auncient fathers, you shall finde a little, but as it were of the ruines of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the ruines of it in all the auncient fathers? What lucke had they, that the building of so gorgeous a peece of worke, stoode not in their daies, as now it standeth in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:775:41"/>
that they might haue seene the bewtie, and the glory of it. If it were so ruinate before the times, wherein the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers liued: then surely it will followe (in spite of whosoeuer saith nay) that it is of greater antiquitie, then all the fathers were of. But I maruaile howe it grewe into such ruine, before their times. For (to my vnderstanding) the Apostles times, were next before the time of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers. The learned discourser, will help vs, for this plunge,<note place="margin">Learned dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. pag. 7</note> out of the bryers. <hi>The ecclesiasticall offices</hi> (saith hee) <hi>namely of Pastors, Doctors, Gouernours, and Deacons, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in the primatiue and pure Church, vntill the mysterie of iniquities, (working a way for Antichristes pride and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) changed Gods ordinance, &amp;c.</hi> And when was that? The mistery of iniquitie began to worke in the Apostles dayes.<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.</note> Was it then? Peraduenture hee meaneth, that immediatly after the Apostles times, there was some age, wherin there liued no ancient fathers: and that then this mischiefe was wrought. I would it had pleased him, to haue deuised such a prouiso, in the behalfe of those most notable men: manie of them very godly and holy Martirs. But the discourser was (as it seemeth) a plain man: he will lay the fault, where it was: as indeed it is reason, that euery man should beare his owne burden. Heare him therefore againe. <hi>Our fathers of olde time,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Learned disc. pag. 12.</note> 
               <hi>were not content with the simple order instituted by Christ, and established by his Apostles: but for better gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Church thought good: some offices to adde thereunto, some to take away, some to alter, and change, and in effect to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert and ouerthrow all christian and Ecclesiasticall pollicy, which was builded vppon the foundation of the Prophetes and Apostles, Iesus Christ being the chiefe corner stone.</hi> A strange conceite, that all the auncient fathers, should thus conspire, to thrust Christ out of his kingdome: and to ouerthrowe all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:775:41"/>
pollicy. What? not a man amongest them, as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and as godly affected, as either <hi>Caluin, Beza,</hi> or this discourser? Not one in those ages that would stand to Christes Discipline? A pittifull case. But I promise you, for my parte: I rather doubt of the discoursers credite in this point: then that I will thinke, there should be such dishonesty, in the auncient Fathers. Nay I durst certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sweare it, that if there had beene any such gouernment of Christ in their daies, they would haue beene as carefull, for the continuance of it, as any of the purest platformers in Christendome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trauers</hi> in his Booke of Ecclesiasticall Discipline, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth eight degres of the declination of this new pretended regiment: to haue growne before the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi>: procured (as he saith) <hi>cunningly by Sathan</hi>:<note place="margin">Fol. 140. 141.</note> 
               <hi>but yet so, that</hi> (as he addeth) <hi>there are euidences to be shewed of sondry partes of it, in the writinges of the auncient Fathers &amp;c, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in this age,</hi>

               <note place="margin">pag. 9.</note> All out of square, from the Apostles times: till <hi>Geneua</hi> was illuminated. Some blinde euidences there may be found, (he saith) for sundry parts of that Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: whereby a man may conceaue, that there was once such a thing in being. Wel, yet if that were true, the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers deserue some little commendation: in that they were content to leaue some scroules or shiuers of it vnto their posterity. To the same purpose also in another place the same party confesseth, <hi>that the ordinary offices</hi> (as he tearmeth them) <hi>in the Apostles times,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 79.</note> 
               <hi>haue beene nowe of many yeares out of vse, either in part, or altogether afore the last restoring of the Gospell in this age.</hi> A great leap (as I think) from the Apostles time: to this ourage. If I had framed the scope of my second Chapter, after this mans pleasure:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:775:42"/>
I might (as you see) haue safely set it downe with <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse</hi> consent: that from the Apostles times, till maister <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> was fully placed in <hi>Geneua,</hi> the now pretended order &amp; forme of Ecclesiasticall Discipline, was not to haue beene found in all the world.</p>
            <p>Maister <hi>Cartwright,</hi> though he say in his first Booke, that the Eldership <hi>did most florish in Constantines time,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 182.</note> and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the same,<note place="margin">pag. 67.</note> in the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part of his 2. reply, (sauing that he leaueth out the word <hi>most</hi>) with such shifting and fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, as I durst make any learned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iudge of his dealing therein: yet (I say) in his Table to the first part of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reply, and also in the second part therof: he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth in effect (to my vnderstanding) that of the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships declining, there are to be found in the Fathers, <hi>but certaine traces and marks, whereby we might come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 43.</note> 
               <hi>and vnderstand that certaine Churches, (as at A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria) went out of the way.</hi> As if he should haue sayd: looke how a man seeketh for a Hare in the snow, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome findeth her, till he come to her forme: so you must seeke, for the Eldership (as now it is vrged) in the auncient Fathers: still pricking after it: till hauing runne past all them, you come to the forme of it, in the Apostles times. Or, as if he had said: the best vse that a man can haue, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the auncient fathers, or of the Ecclesiasticall writers is this, concerning the <hi>Geneuian</hi> Discipline: that a man by them may learne, when men goe out of their right way, but how to get in againe, when we are once out: if you wil haue any direction for that point: you must either goe to <hi>Geneua,</hi> or to him, or to some of his fellows. There goeth the Hare away: for the Fathers cannot helpe you.</p>
            <p>But belieue me, such is my dulnes, as I doe not wel dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne: how these words of <hi>Cartwrights</hi> will stand well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:775:42"/>
with those of the Elderships flourishing in <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> time: seeing now in the auncient Fathers, we haue so little of it: vz. onely as it were some few markes, traces or footesteps of a thing which had beene, and was gone before their times. For as concerning the state of the Church in <hi>Constantines</hi> time, there are whole Cart-loads of most pregnant euidences, in the auncient Fathers of it: &amp; yet but traces (as he saith) or empty steps in them, for his Eldership. In effect as if he had saide, the <hi>Geneua</hi> Discipline flourished most when it was not. One that hath sent vs, a printed Book out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> taking vppon him to know belike, the mindes of all the <hi>Scottishe</hi> Ministers, that seeke for the pretended Discipline, as concerning the time, how long they account it, since it was in any good reparation, saith plainely: (not as <hi>Cartwright</hi> affirmeth, that it flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed most in <hi>Constantines</hi> time) but thus: <hi>we must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse in deede, that this gouernement of the Church fell to decaye long before the Councell of Nice.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Disco. against R.B. Ser. p. 21.</note> But yet one step further, after maister <hi>Cartwrights</hi> dubling: where speaking in his second booke of the corruption, (as he tearmeth it) that one <hi>Bishop</hi> had a prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce giuen him aboue other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters (which he cannot deny to haue been an ordinance in <hi>Alexandria</hi> from Saint <hi>Marks</hi> time &amp;c.) he saith: <hi>from the first day, wherein this deuise was established, corruption grew in the Church &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 2. pa. 569</note> 
               <hi>And the first resistance by any setled Church against that corruption, was by those that abolished that deuise of man, and receaued the order in the Apostles times, touchinge the equality of Ministers: as the Bohemians, Merindols, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Germany, and Geneua.</hi> See, what carieers are here. From <hi>Geneua</hi> to the Apostles times; and thence backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to <hi>Geneua</hi> at a leape. From Saint <hi>Markes</hi> time, till the time here limited: the pretended <hi>Presbitery</hi> with all
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:775:43"/>
the complements thereof (as nowe it is vrged) hath lyen <hi>alla-mort.</hi> No one setled Church, (that is, in <hi>Cartwrightes</hi> language,) no one particular parish in all the world, for a 1500. yeares, did euer account it vnlawfull for a <hi>Bishop</hi> to haue authority aboue other Ministers. Or thus: there hath not bin vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the face of the earth, within the space of a thou sand &amp; fiue hundred yeares, so much as in any one parish, such an equality amongest the Ministers of the worde of God, as is now pretended to be in the <hi>Presbitery</hi> at <hi>Geneua</hi>: and so consequently in all that tyme not suche a <hi>Presbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Or thus: within the compasse of the Heauens, there hath not beene one Church for aboue 1500- yeares: that euer dealt so with <hi>Bishops,</hi> as of late they haue beene dealt withall, especially in <hi>Geneua,</hi> and in some other such places as haue followed therein the example of that Citty.</p>
            <p>Well hitherto then you see, that since we came from <hi>Geneua</hi>: vz: the yeare 1541. the men themselues that talke so much of their <hi>Geneua</hi> platforme: cannot finde it flourishing, in the daies of all the auncient fathers, nor in all the world for the space of aboue 1500. yeares. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (alas) some of them were but simple men: some were ambitious, and some were ignoraunt. They poore men had small experience: and lesse pollicie. They wanted iudgement, and zeale: either to discerne, or to keepe in her virginitie, <hi>this gallaunt Dalila.</hi> They chopped and chaunged, the institution of Christ at their pleasure. Any examples that shall be fet from them: are very dangerous. They were but men. But if you will leape ouer all them, and come to <hi>Geneua</hi>: there you shall finde wise men, learned men, humble men, zealous men, nay rather Angelles, then men: there you shall see the glorious rankes of Elders, sitting vppon their thrones: the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:775:43"/>
company of Deacons, attending vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, the well Disciplined multitude, bringing in the price of their lands and goods, and powring all downe at the Deacons feete: there Christ carrieth hys owne scepter, in <hi>Bezaes</hi> hand: there this pretended holy Discipline, so disgraced by the fathers, so corrupted and so defaced: there she raigneth, there shee flourisheth, and there she is magnified.<note place="margin">The authour of a briefe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. pa. 49.</note> 
               <hi>The Church of Geneua</hi> (saith a good fellow) <hi>is the purest reformed Church</hi> (forsooth) <hi>in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Againe, <hi>Geneua is the chiefest place of true comfort in Earth.</hi> Now, what is here said of <hi>Geneua,</hi> and her Ministers: except you extend it, to all other Churches and Ministers, that follow the <hi>Geneua</hi> platforme: they will be angry with you, and thinke themselues (as I suppose) to be very great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disgraced.</p>
            <p>But I will leaue them clawing one of another, and come to the Apostles times: to see if the <hi>Geneua</hi> Church-gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be found out amongest them. For either there, or no where. The Apostle Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> liued much longer then any of the rest of the Apostles did. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> saith that he liued after Christes passion, <hi>threescore &amp; eight yeares.</hi> So as the Apostles times, after the largest accompt, are not further to be extended. Now (as <hi>Baronius</hi> collecteth out of <hi>Eusebius</hi>) <hi>Saint Marke</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> about 19. yeares: and died about the thirtith yeare after Christes ascention. So as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> out-liued Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> some 38. yeares. After this reckoning, if the Church of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> should haue departed from Christes institution, and so cleane haue disgraced the glory of this fained Eldership, when there was a Bishop made there; according to <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrightes</hi> assertion: then before wee can finde, the <hi>Geneua</hi> platforme, in such perfection as it is in that Citie: we must
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:775:44"/>
cut of the said 19. yeares, (wherein Saint <hi>Marke had</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so grossely from Christes ordinance) from the before mentioned 68. yeares, (the full extent of the apostles time:) which being done, you haue but eleuen yeares, wherein there is any hope for the pretended puritie, and practise of the <hi>Geneua Discipline,</hi> to shadow or shrowd her selfe.</p>
            <p>Yea, but where Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> saith, that there were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. pa. 107.</note> from Saint <hi>Markes</hi> time, &amp;c. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> hath this shift: vz: <hi>that the wordes from Saint Marks time may be taken exclusiuely, to shut out Saint Marke.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to saue Saint <hi>Markes</hi> credite, that an Euangelist should not be thought, to haue broken the necke of Christes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement: he woulde haue this great defection, to haue been presently after Saint <hi>Markes</hi> time: and so hee exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Saint <hi>Marke</hi> (after the <hi>Geneua</hi> fashion) quite and cleane out of his Bishopricke: and will needes suppose, that hee was neuer Bishop, contrary to Saint <hi>Ieromes</hi> expresse wordes in sondrie places, and contrarie to the full consent and agreement of all the auncient fathers, and of all the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall histories. But be it, as hee would haue it: yet let the reckoning be newly cast vp againe, and it falleth out, that this supposed departing from Christes institution, was about thirtie and eight yeares, before S. <hi>Iohn</hi> died. Which standeth hardly with the reputation of the Apostles times in my opinion. But that, is no great matter. <hi>We know</hi> (saith the authour of the foresaide booke, that was sent vs from <hi>Scotland) Diotrephes to haue been in the Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page. 21.</note> 
               <hi>euen in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times: and we are assured, he could neuer be gotten out of it, since the first houre, that he set his footing therein. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot greatly maruaile, though euen in their time, there had been a diuerse gouernment from this of the Lordes appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we labour for. For euen in the Apostles times the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:775:44"/>
mistery of iniquitte beganne to worke.</hi> And what? will they say of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle, and of all the rest of them, that out-liued Saint <hi>Marke</hi>: as they haue done of all the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers? was there so small intelligence, amongst those most prouident and wise holy men: that there could be so notorious a defection in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> so famous a Citie, and they neuer to heare of it? Or shall we thinke, that they heard of it, and conspired together, to ouerthrow Christes institution? It may be said, that peraduenture, they heard of it, and reproued it: but could not reforme it. Very well. But where be then their admonitions, petitions, supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and libels against it? Where be their suspensions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications and giuings ouer to Sathan? Not a word of that abuse, in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell, written after the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed defection? but especially could he haue pretermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such a high point: in the booke of his Reuelations? Or had he so many Reuelations of other matters, of lesse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance (forsooth); and was such an ouerthrowe of Christes kingdome, kept from him? The Disciplinarian shiftes in this case, (to make the best of them) can be but slaunderous and desperate.</p>
            <p>But to graunt (to all of them) the acceptation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times, after the largest accompt: there is (surely) nothing lesse to be found in those times, then the <hi>Geneua</hi> platforme. For then as particular congregations professed the Gospell: you should haue found a Priest, or minister of the worde and Sacramentes,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.5. 2.

In Citties, where there were diuerse such congregations, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto sondry congregations of the country did appertaine: then you shoulde haue found some <hi>Timothy</hi> a Bishop to gouerne them. After that diuerse Citties had receaued the Gospell: or some whole Countrey: it was not long,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:775:45"/>
but some <hi>Titus</hi> was placed as Archbishop ouer them. <hi>The twelue Apostles were in those times as twelue Patriarchs,</hi> for all the world:<note place="margin">Beza annot. Act. 1.2.</note> who planted, directed, visited, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and appointed the foresaid Church gouernours: and what else they thought meet, for the benefit of the church. If I were presently to leaue this life, and should speak what I thought of the present forme of Ecclesiasticall gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at this time in the Church of <hi>England</hi>: I would take it vppon my soule, (so farre as my iudgement serueth me) that it is much more Apostolicall, then any other forme of gouernment, that I know in any other reformed Churche in the world. As for these men, that talke so much of the Apostles times: they are indeede but brablers. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised regiment, hath not any resemblaunce at all, of that: which was in the Apostles times. They haue peruerted in deede the true meaning of certaine places, both in the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and in the auncient fathers, for a shew to serue their turnes, (as after it shall appeare): and other proofes from those times, they haue not any.</p>
            <p>But you will say: this is denied. It is so: and of that else-where. Howbeit in the meane while, that cannot hinder my purpose: to search out, the pretended antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. For it is confessed by them; that the Apostles pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised no other form of Ecclesiasticall gouernment in their times; then Christ himselfe, in his time did ordaine, and assigne vnto them, to be practised afterwards. And what forme was that? Forsooth (they say) it was the very same forme of Church regiment, that was amongest the <hi>Iewes</hi>: and that Christ, when he said, <hi>Dic Ecclesiae,</hi> tell the Church, did translate the same, (being called <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> Councell or Senate) into the Church: to be the onely lawfull gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, vnto the end of the world. So as here then
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:775:45"/>
we must fetch another friske about: to search for the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Senate.</p>
            <p>Maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> after hee had deuised the <hi>Geneua</hi> plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and leapt ouer more then a thousand and fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares for the strengthning of it, by those wordes of Christ, <hi>tell the Church</hi>: vppon occasion, he further saith: that as farre as his auncient records will serue him, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide <hi>Iewish Sanedrim,</hi> was deuised by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> after theyr returne out of captiuity: which was vppon the pointe of fiue hundred yeares before Christ:<note place="margin">Calu. in Mat. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Scimus &amp;c. wee knowe that from the time, that the Iewes returned out of the captiuitye of Babilon, the censure of manners and of doctrine, was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to a chosen Counsell, which they called Sanedrim: in Greeke, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Hoc legitimum fuit, Deoque probatum regimen, &amp;c. This was a lawfull regiment, and allowed of God.</hi> And againe, to cutte of all childishe cauilles, how to shift this place: (as that <hi>Caluin saith not, that it was then first instituted</hi>): the sam
e <hi>Caluin</hi> speaketh hereof more plainely: where intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the seuenty Elders, <hi>Numbers</hi> 2. that were chosen to assist <hi>Moyses,</hi> he hath these wordes: <hi>Certum quidem est. &amp;c. it is very certaine that when the Iewes were returned from the captiuity of Babylon: because it was not lawfull for them to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a king, they did imitate this example in erecting of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrim.</hi> Here is then the time, as plainely set down again, as needeth: vz. after the Captiuity: the cause why they ordained it: vz. because they might haue no King: and the patterne they did imitate: vz. <hi>Moyses</hi> choosing of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenty Elders, to assist him, in his gouernment.</p>
            <p>But all this will not yet serue the turne. For besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other exceptions, which are taken to Maister <hi>Caluins</hi> extraction of the <hi>Iewes Sanedrim,</hi> out of Christs wordes, <hi>tell the Church</hi>: this is one: that if they will needes inforce
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:775:46"/>
such a gouernment vppon the Church, as was amongst the <hi>Iewes,</hi>: then they meane belike, to wrest from the Prince, the ciuile sword; and to deale themselues in ciuile causes, by their owne authority, which they haue so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in others, (though they meddle not otherwise with them, then by the Princes appointment): for that the <hi>Iewes</hi>-sayd gouernment or <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> had to doe as well in ciuile causes, as in any other that were Ecclesiastical. Their aunswere to this exception is, that in deede the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they speake-of, had to deale in Christs time, with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile causes,<note place="margin">Beza de ex. com. pag. 106 107. 108. &amp;c Annot.

Surely mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Caluin,</hi> should haue been as well acquainted with <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> doings, as <hi>Beza</hi> is: for that he hath written Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, vppon all his fiue Bookes: which <hi>Beza hath not.</hi> If <hi>Caluin</hi> in sifting the Text, so painefully as he hath done, cold finde no such matter in <hi>Moyses,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> pretendeth: it doth greatly preiudice, (in my opinion) his lighter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite.<note place="margin">Beza cont.

            </p>
            <p>Very well. Here then wee must haue a newe issue. We must set vp (as I said) the Church-gouernement, which the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:775:46"/>
Apostles practised: the Apostles practised the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Christ appointed: Christ appointed the <hi>Iewes Sanedrim,</hi> to be in euery parish: the <hi>Iewes Sanedrim</hi> was corrupted: and therefore we are now sent from <hi>Geneua,</hi> to <hi>Moses</hi>: to vnderstand what he wil say vnto vs of this matter. Was there euer any forme of gouernement: that hath had so euill fortune? A gouernement so long since ordayned, not to continue for the time of the law onely, but euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worldes end: and neuer to be in such vse, as it ought to haue been, except it were for some eleuen, or some 38. yeares, (and not that neyther,) vntill this our age, that <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua</hi> hath refined it? <hi>Miranda canunt, sed non credenda poëtae.</hi> They tell vs wonders.</p>
            <p>But because, wee must be carried so farre: let vs see in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, the institution of it. I trust that point will be made most manifest vnto vs. Therefore I would desire to know, where the Lord did institute this their ecclesiasticall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate? The effect of <hi>Bezaes</hi> aunswere (if I haue iudgement to gather it) is this.<note place="margin">Lib. de presb. pag. 103.</note> 
               <hi>Iehosophat appointed such a kinde of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in his time: Mosis proculdubio praescriptum sequutus, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing (proculdubio) without doubt, the prescript of Moses.</hi> And where learned <hi>Iehosophat</hi> that prescript?

            <p>Of this exposition in another place. We are yet dealing with the pedigree of this gouernment. Heereunto there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is obiected. Let this interpretation go a while as currant: yet heere is no mention of any other, to exercise this iurisdiction, but onely of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his two sonnes.

            </p>
            <p>There came out from thence not long agone, a booke:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:775:47"/>
translated since into English, and printed in <hi>Scotland:</hi> tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, &amp; so interpreted, <hi>Propositions and Principles of Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> Amongest the which principles (in my latine booke) these are three: vz: <hi>It appeareth in Moses booke, that as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with his</hi> 70.<note place="margin">Cap. 86.</note> 
               <hi>did exercise his ciuile iurisdiction: so Aaron with his assistants, priestes and Leuites, had chiefe authoritie in the ecclesiasticall:</hi> 2. <hi>And furthermore, there were amongest the Iews certain men, whom they called</hi> capita patrum, <hi>the heads of the fathers, &amp;c.</hi> quos verisimile est fuisse etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Synedrij eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastici partes, &amp;c. <hi>who were parts (it is likely) of the ecclesiastical Councell.</hi> 3.

Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risimile est:</hi> it is likely: <hi>constat ergo</hi>: therefore it is manifest. As though a man should reason thus. It is probable, that these men that dare thus abuse the worlde, haue made a shipwracke of their consciences: therefore it is manifest, that they haue done so. Vnto how many kinges, princes, Countries, and states, hath maister <hi>Beza</hi> written, for the aduauncement of this his pretended gouernement? What petitions, supplications, demonstrations, motions, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, discourses, complaints (and I know not what) haue been published amongest vs, in <hi>England</hi> to the same effect? And is all now come to this point, <hi>probabile est</hi>? Can <hi>Beza</hi> himselfe finde no other ground, for his Elders? Doth it depend but vpon likelihoodes and probabilities, by your owne confessions: whether almightie God did euer as yet institute any such gouernment or not?</p>
            <p>But to passe by <hi>Beza</hi> with his <hi>probabile est</hi>: and to come to maister <hi>Cartwright,</hi> another manner of fellow. He (it seemeth) doth account maister <hi>Beza,</hi> to be, but a simple
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:775:48"/>
man in respect of himselfe: in that he deemed the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to be of no longer continuance, then since <hi>Moyses</hi> time.<note place="margin">T.C. lib. 3. pa. 40.</note> 
               <hi>This gouernement</hi> (saith he, by the Eldership) <hi>was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the gouernement of the people of God before the Lawe. And it beganne as soone as there is any mention made of anye fixed forme of a Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In the table of that book.</note> 
               <hi>which standing of diuerse housholdes, were deuided into particular assemblies. Beza</hi> is then (you see) deceaued: who said that <hi>Moyses</hi> did institute the Eldership. It was long (you heare) before his time. Did I not tell you; we should be brought (in effect) to <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke? But let vs consider of his proofe, that maketh him so peremptory in this point. You shall not finde him so loose I trust: as to dash vs in the teeth with <hi>probabile est.</hi> Ineuitable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, or nothing from him. Forsooth (saith he) it is thus written in <hi>Exodus</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
               <hi>So Moises and Aaron went and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all the Elders of the children of Israell: and Aaron tolde all the wordes which the Lord had spoken to Moyses &amp;c.</hi> And what then? Indeede, that would be heard: for as yet, this point runneth harshly. But (saith <hi>Cartwright) that these were Ecclesiasticall officers, thereby it may appeare: for that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such a tiraunt, and such oppression, as the Israelites were in, it is altogether vnlike,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
               <hi>that they should haue the benefites of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates of their owne.</hi> Indeede now he hath won his spurs. In effect all that he saith, is but thus much: It is likely that the Elders he buildeth vppon, were such officers as hee dreameth of. It is likely. It is probable.</p>
            <p>Well, I trust the vizards of such maskers will be so throughly weatherbeaten (in short time,) as that the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest will be able, to discerne their deformities. For in this cause assuredly, (they pretending onely probabilities) all probabilities indeede are flatly against them. Is it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if Christ had appointed any such gouernment, as they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:775:48"/>
speake of, to haue continued to the end of the world, or if the Apostles themselues had ordayned or practised it, in their times: that all the auncient Martyrs, Councels, and godly Fathers would with one consent haue abolished it? It is probable, <hi>Moyses</hi> being so carefull, (as it is to another purpose by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alledged,) that he would not omit to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vnto his people, euen the smallest matters, that God gaue him in charge, till he came to their basons, besomes, and pinnes about the Tabernacle: that he woulde haue made no mention of such a waighty point, as this is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be: if the Lord had euer giuen him commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement for the institution of it?<note place="margin">Exod. 18. Numb. 2.

            <p>To draw therefore to an end of this point. The insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this pretended gouernment, cannot be shewed out of the old Testament: and then by theyr owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions (in effect) it may not be vrged out of the new. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they say, that Christ appointed no other forme of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment; then they thought they could haue found to haue beene instituted by <hi>Moyses.</hi> But my conclusion shal be built vppon one of <hi>Vdals</hi> demonstratiue propositions:<note place="margin">Demonst. 2. cap. 2.</note> vz. <hi>That gouernement, whose originall is vnknowen; hath no warrant in Gods word, and is vnlawfull.</hi> But the originall of the <hi>Geneua</hi> platforme of Discipline, is vnknowen: therefore it hath no warrant in Gods word, and is vnlawfull. And thus you see, that (as I sayd in the beginning,) the first time, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:775:49"/>
this fained <hi>Geneuian</hi> deuise saw light (for ought I can read or iudge:) was at <hi>Geneua.</hi> Whether for my part, I doe remitte it again, to see if they can deduce the pedigree of it, from any further Monuments of antiquity: or that else they may blotte it out, of their now deuised Creede, whereof you shall heare hereafter.</p>

            <p>Would a man haue thought that men so curious to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte of nothing that is not in the Scriptures; would haue stooped so low: as to the Talmud? I cannot thinke that seeing Almighty God would not suffer the beastes of the earth and fowls of the aire, to be without their names, past two or three daies; that he could be content, that such an excellent creature, as this is pretended to bee, shoulde be without a name so many hundreth yeares; as from <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> time vntill the <hi>Iewes</hi> Talmud was made.

Peraduenture <hi>Moyses</hi> a ciuile Magistrate, foreseeing that this regiment was to be placed in euery parish or Synagogue, and that so he himselfe should become subiect vnto it; did seeke to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace it as much as he could, and therefore left it name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.

By this doctrine then of the <hi>Talmud</hi> and maister <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaes</hi> translation: shall wee tearme this parochiall regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Councell, and the Gouernours therein, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie soeuer, so manie Councellors? Surely this were greatly to the honour of <hi>England,</hi> and to the benefite of her Maiesties subiectes. For whereas nowe they haue many occasions to come to the Court to their Lordships, for the redresse of manie great enormities: they should haue a Councell table, to repayre vnto, in euerie Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe.</p>
            <p>But it will heere bee aunswered peraduenture, that wee may not call it a Councell: For that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ (minding as they say, to translate the forme of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ecclesiasticall gouernement, tearmed <hi>Sane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi> from the lawe, to the Gospell) vsed not that name of Councell, but called it <hi>ecclesia:</hi> that is the Church. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well: any thing will content me: Howbeit for ought I know, there was no cause, why it might not haue pleased our sauiour Christ, if he had conceiued so notable a liking of that <hi>Iewish</hi> platforme: but that hee might, also haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned the olde name, and so haue made no alteration at all. The authour of the booke of Discipline, hauing, as it should seeme, some such like consideration in his head, or what other I know not: and thinking scorne (as I gesse) to runne to the <hi>Iewes</hi> Talmud, for a name for this regiment: is not afraid to dissent from <hi>Caluin, Beza,</hi> his olde tutor <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and a number of other his good maisters here|

And certaynely
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:775:56"/>
there is here no starting hole (as farre as I can discerne) for the excuse of that Reformation and platforme: except it maye bee iustified, that all these foure or fiue and twentie parishes or there aboutes, are so trussed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they doe and maie all at once meet in one Congregation, &amp; are taught with one mouth: which to affirme (besides that their practise is otherwise) will bee thought I trust great boldnes, vnlesse they can find a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor with <hi>Stentors</hi> voyce, who (by report) could make as great a noise as fifty men.</p>
            <p>I cannot chuse but put you heere in minde of a poynte in Maister <hi>Cartwright,</hi> that seemeth verie strange vnto mee. Hee sayth, that there were moe that did externally professe <hi>Christ,</hi>

               <hi>in the Apostles times, then there are nowe: insomuch as wee are not nowe the tithe of them</hi>: that is the tenth parte.

And by that account, there are moe christians within the citie of <hi>London,</hi> &amp; the suburbs, thé were in al those cities, &amp; twise as many more. Which if <hi>M.

for the credit of <hi>Scotland</hi> or of <hi>Geneua</hi> at the least, that (of all likelyhood,) as diuers housholdes (by his owne rule) do concurre together to make one conuenient parish: So diuerse parishes in one citie, suburbes, and territorie thereof, may be vnited, and rightlye beare the name of the church. Except wee shall thinke, that Christ refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (as they suppose) his Apostles to the imitation of the Iewes church gouernment, <note place="margin">Iosephus.</note> they were so negligent workemen, as (there being at that time 400. <hi>Synagogues</hi> in that one citie,) they had erected in all their times, but one congregation, christian church, or parish, answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to one Synagoge: it being lawfull for them (by the square of that platforme,) to haue erected, if they had could, 400.</p>
            <p>But let this passe (as a thing impertinent) and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the maimed &amp; pining Parishes at <hi>Geneua.</hi> You will say, did not <hi>Cartwright</hi> know the ecclesiasticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of that citie; when he writ his bookes? or shall we once conceaue, that he thought to condemne that regiment: which in other places hee doth so greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll? certainly for mine owne part, although I do not greatly respect what he will saie that hee either knoweth or thinketh: yet I suppose he will neuer for shame denie it, but that he misliketh that forme of church regiment. For first besides the premises, being vrged with <hi>Caluins</hi> authoritie, <hi>who thought the church of Geneua, with all her sayde Parishes to make but one body of a church</hi>:<note place="margin">Lib. 2. pag. 631.</note> his answere to that point in effect is this, <hi>Admit Caluin so thought.</hi> I am of opinion that if <hi>Caluin</hi> had not soe thought, hee would neuer haue erected vp such an Eldership. And if <hi>Beza,</hi> did not thinke so still; I iudge hee would alter it. Secondly also, (vppon another occasion) he resembleth

            <p>Lastly, as hitherto you haue found <hi>M.

               <hi>For my part I confesse, that there commeth not to my minde, whereby I could precislie conclude out of the olde testament, that there was an eldershippe amongst the Iewes in euery of their Synagogues.</hi> If that can|

not then be shewed out of <hi>Moses</hi> (who was so faythfull in setting downe all that was committed to his charge) and that Christ commaunded no new thing, but such as <hi>Moses</hi> instituted: how hath hee vrged so mightely, that we must haue his Elderships in euery Parish? We shall see peraduenture that in shorte time M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> will giue ouer this holde, and betake himselfe to the citie consistories, framing new Diocesses, to bee subiect vnto them: as in other countries, you haue heard, they are.

In the new testament, our Sauiour Christ, whilst hee liued on the earth, had his Apostles, and in degree vnder them, his 70. Disciples. After his

ascentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the same inequality of the ministery of the word; continued in the Church (by all mens confession) as long (at the least) as the Apostles liued. In the Apostles times Saint <hi>Marke</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> Saint <hi>Iames</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem, Timothy</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Crete:</hi> if the ancient fathers, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical histories be of any credite.</p>
            <p>The Apostles hauing receaued the promise of the holy Ghost; after a short time dispersed themselues (by aduise) into diuerse regions. And there by painefull preaching and labouring in the Lords haruest: they planted no doubt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Churches. As the number of Christians grew, and had their particular assemblies, and meetings in many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and countries within euery one of their circuites: they placed pastors in euery congregation, they ordained cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Apostolicall men, to bee chiefe assisters vnto them: whom they placed, some one in this particular countrey, another in that, and some others in sondry Cities to haue the rule and ouersight vnder them, of the Churches there: and to redresse and supply such wantes as were needefull. And they themselues, (after a while, and as they grewe in age, and escaped the crueltie of tyrantes) remained for the most part in some head Citty within their compasse: to ouersee them all, both Churches, Pastors, and Bishops or Superintendents: and to giue their directions as occasions required, and as they thought it conuenient.</p>
            <p>When any, either of these Apostolicall assistantes, or of the Apostles themselues, dyed: there were euer some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men chosen and appointed to succeede them in those Cities and Countries, where they had remained. For wee may not idlely dreame, that when they dyed, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which was giuen vnto them, ceased: no more then we
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:775:59"/>
may, that the authoritie of <hi>Aaron,</hi> &amp; of his naturall sons expir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed and ended with them. Besides it is manifest by all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall hystories: that many Churches were planted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theyr deathes. And furthermore, it coulde not be, but that some Churches, especially vnder those Apostles, that were soonest put to death, were (when they dyed) in the same case that <hi>Crete</hi> was, when <hi>Titus</hi> was sent thither, and had therefore as much neede of a <hi>Titus</hi> as euer <hi>Crete</hi> had. Furthermore, who can bee accompted to be well in his wittes, that will imagine, that Christ should ordaine such an authoritie, but for some threescore yeares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> especially the same causes continuing, <hi>why it was first instituted,</hi> that were before. Nay I may boldly say: that there was greater neede for the continuance of it afterward. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles hauing so great power to worke myracles, and by their praiers to procure from God such straunge executions of his pleasure vpon the contemptuous, as did fall vpon <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and his wife, (and I doubt not but in like cases, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, vpon some others): their ruling and commaunding authoritie, was not so necessarie then, as it was afterwards, when that power to worke myracles ceased.</p>
            <p>But what should I neede to vse many wordes in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so apparant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After the death of the apostles, and of their assistants: vz: the Bishops placed by them, as is mentioned, the Ecclesiasticall hystories, and the auncient fathers, haue kept the register of their names, that succeeded sundry of them, and ruled the Churches after them, as they before had ruled them. Whereupon they were called from all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie: the Apostles and Apostolicall mens successors. This inequalitie in the Ministery of the worde, hath been approued and honoured by all the auncient fathers (none excepted): by all the generall Councelles, that euer were

held in Christendome: and by all other men of learning (that euer I heard of) for many hundred yeares after the Apostles time: sauing that <hi>Aerius</hi> the hereticke, an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious person, growing into great rage, for that hee missed of a Bishopricke, which he sued for: first broached the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which is nowe so currant amongest his Schollers: <hi>that there ought to bee no difference betweene a Bishoppe and a Priest.</hi>

            <p>In this latter age of the worlde, when after a long darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it pleased almightie God to restore vnto vs, the light of his Gospell: the chiefe instruments that God then vsed, and adorned with most singular giftes, for such a mightie worke, were very farre from that conceite, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>and rashe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, which afterwardes possessed certaine persons of <hi>Aerius</hi> humour, and yet doth boyle in many of theyr followers breastes. It is true, that many thinges are to bee found in their writings, which (at the first shew) do make very greatly against Bishops. But diuerse persons in these dayes, not well considering the circumstances of those times: doe greatly abuse the world, in extending them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then they meant <hi>them.</hi> It was farre from their intent that those thinges which they had written against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Bishops (the ennemies of the Gospell): should euer haue bene vrged, against such Bishops as did willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it. I will acquaint you a little with the proceedings of those times: and then leaue this point to your wise consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>When the said learned men beganne to seeke the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion in <hi>Germany,</hi> it is not vnknowen vnto
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:775:60"/>
you, into what subiection the Pope had brought all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes and states. The Bishops as his vassals, did then wholly depend vppon him. They held their Bishoprickes by his authoritie: and nothing coulde be done, especially in Church matters, but by the Pope and them. So as when <hi>Luther</hi> and the rest beganne to disclose the enormities of Popery, and desired some godly reformation of them: you may easily conceiue (the Pope and his Bishops being the chiefe maintainers of that corruption) what little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement they found at their handes. It is euident in their writinges, howe earnestly and humbly at the first they dealth both with the Pope and with many other of the chiefest Bishops: that they would be content and pleased to reforme such thinges as they found to bee amisse in the Church. But all their indeuours to that purpose, were in vain. The Pope and his Clergy, stood too much vpon their reputation. If they should haue yealded, they imagined the world would haue condemned them: in that they had not in time, of themselues, preuented or redressed so notable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses. Whereupon <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; those learned men that ioyned with him, were driuen to flie vnto the Ciuil magistrates, &amp; to aduertise them of their dueties, prouing it vnto them most plentifully out of the scriptures, that in such an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate defection amongst the priests, it appertained vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (euery one within their owne free states and territories) to reforme religion themselues: as the godly kings in the old testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t had done in the like cases. And the rather to moue them thereunto, they laboured by al the means they could, to make the Popish Clergy most odious vnto them. They inueighed against their pride, against their superfluities, against their tyranny, and against their corruptions. After much paines taking to these and the like effectes, it pleased
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:775:60"/>
God to moue the hearts of many of the ciuile magistrates, to thinke better of their duties, &amp; plainly to perceiue, how the Pope and his Bishops had formerly abused them. The godly kings and magistrates in the scriptures, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed religion, were euer most carefull, that the liuinges appointed by God for the Priests, might be throughly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. If any by abuse had bin alienated: they caused them to be restored againe. And so I suppose the ciuile magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, should haue done in this latter age. But it hath faln out otherwise: and all the other godly learned men in chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, do mislike it. The perswasions to Princes that the Bishops and Abbots had too much: was very plausible. The free Cities, notwithstanding their freedom in respect of the Emperor, yet they were subiect all of them vnto Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: &amp; were not discontented, that so good an occasion was offred vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to procure their greater liberty. <hi>Luther</hi> and the rest of those learned men regarding nothing, but that the light of the gospel might be restored: were content to yeald much, &amp; to beare (against their minds) with many vnequall conditions. So as at the last: by their wisdome and diligence, they preuailed. God moued the hearts of diuers ciuile magistrates: to begin a reformation. The Pope, the Bishops, and the chiefest of the Cleargy impugned it, by all the meanes they could possibly. Whereupon, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other remedie, their authoritie imployed to hinder those proceedinges, was reiected: and the most of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings (which they had in any of those territories) were sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into the hands of the ciuile gouernors there. vpon these &amp; many such like occasions, great trobles did arise. The bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, thoght the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues greatly iniuried. Diuers great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, took their parts: &amp; so did the Emperor. They misliked the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; which was proceeded in, after that sort: the

Vouchsafe (I pray you) to heare their owne testimonies, to this purpose.

            <p>Hitherto then, it appeareth (as I take it) what is both the practise of the reformed Churches in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t also of the chiefe learned men there, since <hi>Melanchthon</hi> &amp; <hi>Bucers</hi> times: concerning Bishops or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents, with their preheminence, charge, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.

Did not God himselfe in the old Testament appoint a chiefe Bishop, Priests, and Leuits?

            <p>Indeed he is so: but it turneth more &amp; more, dayly to his own discredit. He succeeded Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> in place; but neither in his learning nor in all his vertues.

It is chiefly he, that hath set the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reformers, in this whole land, so much a gogge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Bishops: by his secret letters, and other disordered writinges of incouragement vnto them. And yet (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) he can write to other men; and pretend the quite contrarie. Consider the processe following: and then, if I be too blame thus to write of him, <note place="margin">Epist. 2.</note> tell me of it.</p>
            <p>In one of his epistles dated 1570. he affirmeth that <hi>Archbishops &amp; Primates are a shadowe and image of the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Roome: that they are petty tyrantes in respect of the Pope: and that although the names be neuer soe auntient, yet it ought to haue beene enquired, whether it were lawful to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the church &amp;c.</hi> It had beene a maruailous beneficiall matter to all posteritie: that <hi>Beza</hi> had beene the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder

at <hi>Geneua</hi> in the times of the Primitiue church, that so the learend &amp; graue fathers of those ages might haue inquired this point of him &amp; knowen his pleasure.</p>
            <p>In the yeare 1572. it seemed good vnto him, (as it hath beene said before) to write his letter into this Iland, to <hi>Knox</hi> the reformer in <hi>Scotland</hi>: at what time the Bishops there had receaued the <hi>Gospell</hi> (at the least many of them as I thinke) though it woulde not serue their turne to keepe them in their places. In which letter amongst many other good consistorian documents, hee writeth thus. <note place="margin">Epist. 79.</note> 
               <hi>But I would haue you, and the other brethren to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that which is before your eies: as Bishops brought foorth the Papacy, so false or counter set Bishops, the reliques of Popery, will bring in Epicurisme. They that desire the churches good, let them take heede of this pestilence. And seeing you haue put that plague in Scotland to flight: quaeso &amp;c. I hartily pray you that you neuer suffer it againe vnder any pretence or color of keepinge of vnitie: which pretence deceaued the auncient fathers, euen many of the best of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But least any man shoulde imagine, that I doe <hi>Beza</hi> iniury in applyinge his wordes, to the purpose for the which I bring them: and, that he writ not thus, against such Bishops as did imbrace and maintaine the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which we all professe; but against Popish Bishops: <hi>Cartwright</hi> him-selfe wil cleare both me and <hi>Bezaes</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For he (a man of the same spirit) hath brought both those places, and vrged them, for <hi>Bezaes</hi> iudgment against our Bishops nowe in <hi>England. Beza</hi> (saith he) <hi>is so farre from allowing Archbishops, that our kind of Bishops he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth counterset Bishoppes, reliques of Poperie, such as will bring in Epicurisme:</hi> and soe he proceedeth on with the rest of <hi>Bezaes</hi> wordes, to <hi>Knox</hi> as before they are set downe.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:775:70"/>
But I shall not needed to labour much vpon this point. <hi>Beza</hi> will himselfe vouch safe (you shall see) to deliuer his mind, as plainly as one would wish.</p>
            <p>In his treatise that he writ into Scotland, about the yere 1579. of three sortes of Bishops mentioned in the third Chapter: vz. the <hi>Bishops of God, of man, and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill</hi>: He writeth thus (by no good direction, I am sure) of that ancient, and the most godly Councell, that euer was helde since the Apostles times, vz. the honourable councell of Nice. <hi>The Nicene Councell pretending anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent custome, confirmed the patriarchship, and made a way for the horrible papacy of</hi> Rome, <hi>(sliding on), and vnderlaid the seate for the harlot that sitteth vpon seauen hils.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, where M. <hi>Caluin</hi> spake, as you haue heard, of the forme of Church gouernment, which was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded vppon, <hi>that it differed not from that which God had prescribed: Beza</hi> is bold (if <hi>Field</hi> his translator haue dealt well with him) to call it a <hi>deuillish Oligarchie,</hi> making the fathers of the said <hi>Councell,</hi> to be the deuisers, or at least, the aduancers of the Bishops of the deuil. Vnder which member of his diuision, hee bringeth all the Bishops in Europe (excepting his owne parochiall Bishops) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding anie reformation of religion whatsoeuer. And therefore aduiseth <hi>all godly Princes, that at once they abolish them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is hee in effectanie thing more gratious or bountifull to his second sort of Bishops, the Bishops of men. But before you heare his censure of them, you shall vnderstand how he describeth such a kinde of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. <hi>The Bishop of man</hi> (sayth he) <hi>brought into the Church by the alone wisedome of man, besides the expresse word of God, is a certaine power to one certaine pastor, aboue his other fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:775:71"/>
yet limited with certaine orders, or rules prouided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst tyrannie. They which did beare this office of Bishop, are called Bishops in regard of their fellowe Elders, and the whole Cleargie, as watch-men set ouer the Cleargie.</hi> And I maruell why the ministers after the Apostles time shoulde not haue as greate neede of such watch-men, as they had when the Apostles themselues liued: who were then their watch-men by all their confessions.</p>
            <p>But nowe let vs see what <hi>Beza</hi> will doo with these kinde of Bishops. Surely by his aduise, down they must as wel as the former, or to vse his translators phrase, <hi>they must bee chased awaie.</hi> And his chiefe reasons are these, First, because that <hi>vnlesse this roote also be plucked vp, it wil come to passe, that the same fruit will sprout and bud forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:</hi> Secondly, for that <hi>Christ</hi> (as he falsely supposeth) <hi>hath shut this superiority out of the church</hi>: And thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as hee saith) <hi>Where the remnants of this gouernment by a few, are not cleane taken awaie, the word of the Lord is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly hindered.</hi> Hee meaneth (I thinke) his counterfet platforme of discipline: for the inordinate vrging whereof, some few disordered persons haue beene put to silence. But what hath he to do with that? You see then the mans boldnesse, and with what presumption hee aduanceth himselfe against all the learned Fathers; against all the generall Councels; against all the flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing Churches, that haue beene in the worlde since Christs time; against the iudgementes of all the chiefe learned men (almost) of ourage: &amp; (that which is most with him) euen against the iudgement of his superior master <hi>Caluin</hi>; and you see also the pit and smoke, from whence the Locustes amongest vs of late yeeres came, that with their venemous libels and railing discourses,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:775:71"/>
haue infected the harts of many good men, with a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the holy calling of our Bishops. That some haue been mis-lead heeretofore, with the violent streame of this faction, I wonder not But for mine owne parte, I shall little pittie anie of them heereafter, if when they shall see these things, they will notwithstanding yeld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer themselues to bee seduced by so grosse, so palpable, &amp; so childish illusions: but especially if they shall heare <hi>Beza</hi> himselfe begin to alter his mind, and to sing a new song.</p>
            <p>I will not affirme much for his alteration: but when hee hath opened himselfe a little further vnto you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him as God shall moue your harts. Surely he will not proue a man (in my opinion) for anie to build their faith vppon.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:775:73"/>
that they did it for honest causes, appertaining at that time to the order, decencie, and edification of the Church.</hi> And in the next article: <hi>Hac ratione, &amp;c. By this reason,</hi> vz. <hi>that the nurseries of dissentions and of schismes may be taken away, wee thinke that these thinges which were ordained before the Councell of Nice, concerning Archbishops, nay, as touching the foure Patriarches, may be excused and defended.</hi> When this booke was perused, and this clause found in it, then forsoth a deuise was had, for the staying of it, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that now it was thought more meete, that there should be a harmonie made of all the confessions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers churches.<note place="margin">Derelig. pa. 218</note> But <hi>Zanchius</hi> himselfe maketh this the chiefe cause (if I vnderstand him) why his booke dyd mislike some of them: for that hee had written, as before is mentioned, of Bishops. For so hee sayth, <hi>Magnus quidam vir, &amp;c. A certaine great man,</hi> (meaning <hi>Beza,</hi> as it is supposed,) <hi>did write vnto mee of this matter, as followeth. Your confession was read by mee and N. &amp; others, with great delight. It is written most learnedly, and in a most exquisite methode, and (if you except that which you adde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end, touching Archbishops and the Hierarchie)</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi summopere placuit, <hi>it pleased mee exceedingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon this occasion (as it seemeth) <hi>Zanchius</hi> printed his said confession, with certaine annotations. In the which annotations, he sheweth three reasons, for his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llowance of Archbishops &amp; Bishops. The first, is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the practise of the primitiue church present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Apostles times: the second is, for that hee thought it his dutie in the draught of his said booke, to haue regard to those reformed churches which retaine both Bishops &amp; Archbishops: and the third, because all the reformed Churches generally, although they haue
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:775:73"/>
chaunged the names, yet in effect they doe keepe the authoritie: as where they haue <hi>superintendents,</hi> and <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall superintendents: Nay</hi> (saith he) <hi>where these new, &amp; base Latine names are not admitted,</hi> Ibi tamen solent esse ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot primarij, penes quos fere tota est authoritas: <hi>yet there are in those places vsually certaine chiefemen, that doe in a manner beare all the sway.</hi> But I pray you be pleased that I may deliuer vnto you, the maner of his setting down of his first reason, and that in his owne words: for they carry with them a notable condemnation of other mens great pride &amp; rashnes. <hi>Cum haenc conscriberem fidei confessionem, &amp;c. When I writ this confession of faith, I writ all the thinges in it of a good conscience: and as I beleeued, so I freely spake the scriptures, teaching men so to doe. And my faith first of all, and simply, doth rely vpon the word of God, &amp; then somewhat also vpon the common consent of the whole an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Catholicke Church, if the same bee not repugnant to the scriptures. For I beleeue that what thinges were defined and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the auncient Fathers assembled in the name of the Lord, with a generall consent of them all, and without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of the holy Scriptures, the same surely, although they be not of the same authoritie with holy Scriptures, yet did they proceed from the holy Ghost. Heereof it commeth to passe, that those things which are of this nature, neither would I, neither dare I with a good conscience disallow them. And what can be shewed more certainly out of histories, out of the councels, &amp; out of the writings of all the ancient fathers, then that those orders of Ministers, of the which we haue spoken, haue bene ordained and receiued in the Church, by the generall consent of all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian common-wealths. And who then am I that should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to reproue that which the whole Church hath approued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> This is true and religious humilitie.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:775:74"/>
Thus all graue and discreet godly men haue euerwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Those that contemne all the learned Fathers that went before them, doe open a windowe to their owne discredite by those that shall come after them. That which this godly and great learned man ascribeth to the holy Ghost, and durst not with a safe conscience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue: euerie sawcie Iacke with vs, euerie ignoraunt dolt, and euerie Bridewell rake-hell dare disdaine and condemne.

            <p>But as yet you know not the cause: why I haue espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially alleadged all these things out of <hi>Zanchius.</hi> I will therefore now tell it you. And it is this. You haue heard how <hi>Beza</hi> and some others disliked of <hi>Zanchius</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and wherefore. But now hee is come about, and is grown to be fully of <hi>Zanchius</hi> iudgement; if a man may beleeue him. For wheras D. <hi>Sarauia</hi> had cited these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Zanchius</hi> in the behalfe of Bishops, and Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;<note place="margin">Beza contra Sarau. p. 161.</note> M. <hi>Beza</hi> aunswered directly: that neither he nor his brethren doe dissent therein from <hi>Zanchius: à quo minimè certè dissentimus.</hi> But I may not conceale this fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you; that although <hi>Zanchius</hi> hath written so modestly of the callinges of Archbishops and Bishops: (as it hath beene shewed), yet he rather fancied the new platform of Elderships: which <hi>Beza</hi> omitteth not to put <hi>Sarauia</hi> in minde of, when hauing yeelded to <hi>Zanchius</hi> his saide opinion of Bishops, he addeth other places out of him for his allowance of the Eldership: and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth;<note place="margin">Beza contra Sarau. p. 164.</note>

formerly against such Bishops &amp; Archbishops, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the Gospell: he can now bee content to reuoke it wholy, so as they at <hi>Geneua</hi> may holde their Elderships. He hath so farre ingaged his credit for that kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, as gladly he would preserue the reputation of it. But he seeth (I am perswaded) it will not bee, and that the equality they haue dreamed of, tendeth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, &amp; therefore he beginneth to retire himself from that conceit, as well as he may. It is much (his former proceedings considred) that euer he could be brought to <hi>Zanchius</hi> moderation. But yet hee commeth neerer vnto vs; for although his Bishop of man found so small fauour with him before, as that hee made him the roote of iniquitie, and needs he must be plucked vp: yet now he is much more fauorable vnto him (if I vnderstande him,) and saith he calleth him the Bishop of man, <hi>non simpliciter,</hi>

for some amendment. And lette vs take holde of that which they haue granted. You may be bold to build v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it for a truth: that they are so constrained to yeeld vnto. And then to ende this chapter: Forasmuch as God himselfe, appointed an inequalitie amongst the Priestes in the olde Testament: Forasmuch as Christ, though he calleth himselfe a Minister, to minister vnto others, was yet the Maister ouer his Apostles and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: Forasmuch as by Christs institution, and in his owne time, the Apostles were superior vnto the seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Disciples: Forasmuch as the Apostles when the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell began to spread it selfe, appointed <hi>sundry Timothies</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus,</hi> to gouerne the Churches in diuerse countries and territories: Forasmuch as all the ecclesiasticall hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, doe record the superioritie of Bishops, and doe sette downe, the Catalogues of many of them, and which of the Apostles and Apostolicall Bishops, and in what cities &amp; countries they succeeded: Forasmuch as all the ancient generall Councels, &amp; all the ancient and godly learned Fathers, haue allowed of Bishops, and of their superiority ouer the rest of the clergie: Forasmuch as Bishops haue been accounted generally throughout the world, to be the Apostles successors, &amp; haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Church euer since the Apostles times: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as there was neuer any one of all the auncient Fathers, nor any learned man for 1500. yeres but <hi>Aerius</hi> the heretike, that euer held, that there ought to bee no difference betwixt a Bishop &amp; a Priest, (I meane an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Minister of the word:) and that his opinion was imputed vnto him 1200. yeeres since by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> for an heresie: Forasmuch as all the chiefe of the learned men that were the principall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

vnder God in this latter age, for the restitution of the Gospell, allowed fullie of Bishoppes, and of their authoritie, and would not willingly haue submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselues to their obedience, if they might haue bene receiued with anie tollerable conditions: Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as all the reformed Churches in Germanie, that doo imbrace the Augustane confession, haue (for the most part) their superintendents and generall superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents, the same in effect with our Bishops &amp; Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops: Forasmuch as the chiefest of the Germain wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters now liuing, do iustifie the calling &amp; offices of their superintendents, and generall superintendents by the word of God. Forasmuch as none of later times euer condemned the calling and authoritie of such Bishops and Archbishops, as imbraced the Gospell (for ought I finde) but <hi>Beza</hi> and his schollers. Forasmuch as <hi>Zanchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> a fauorer of the Elderliship equalitie, and now <hi>Beza</hi> himselfe ioyning with him, do both of them confesse, that the calling and authoritie of Bishops and Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops may be defended: that they did proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy Ghost, and that there is nothing more manifest in all the Ecclesiasticall histories, all the ancient councels, and in the writings of all the ancient fathers, then the allowance of them, throughout all christendome: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as <hi>Beza</hi> for his own part, hath written so hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to the now <hi>L. Archbishop of Canterbury,</hi> and so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of all our Bishops now professing the Gospell, condemning those of great arrogancie, that shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to speak against them: Forasmuch as you perceiue by <hi>Bezaes</hi> confession, that there ought to be Bishops or Prelates, such as were in the Church from S. <hi>Markes</hi> time, for the auoiding and staying of contentions and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:775:77"/>
schismes. And forasmuch (I saie) as all these particular points, are in sort, as you haue heard, the most of them confessed, &amp; the rest by diuerse learned men proued to be true, &amp; so still alwaies to be iustified, with as ful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and authoritie, as may satisfie anie men, either of learning or iudgement: I see no reason why this Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisticall dreame, of equality amongst pastors, should not be sent backe to the place fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it issued: why the vrgers of it, with such bitternesse, ought to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted otherwise off, than hereby, I trust, you may see they deserue: why <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and his libelling genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, against the present forme of our Church-gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, should be anie longer indured: or why any cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the world, next vnto the calling of euery <hi>Moses</hi> and soueraigne, within their owne dominions, should be more esteemed, cherished, reuerenced, or honored, by all true christians, then the callings, offices, &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Bishops, and Archbishops: hauing so generall &amp; continuall an allowance, both of God himselfe, and of all godly and rightly zealous men, euer since there was any outward forme of church gouernment appointed.</p>

And then it may not be meruailed, though all the rest of that humor, do faithfully imbrace it. Of this office, our reformers (all of them ioyntly) do carry this resolute opinion:<note place="margin">Trau. def. of dis. T.C.</note> 
               <hi>that it is a distinct ordinance of Christ, to continue in the Church for euer: that there ought to be a Doctor in euery Parish, wheresoeuer there is a Pastor: that the doctor is one of the members of the body of Christ: that the doctor is one of those officers, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gouernment of the Church (by Christs appointment) is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted: &amp; that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he hath by the same authoritie his place &amp; voice in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistorie, as wel &amp; by as good right, as either the pastor or Elder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So as, if there be anie reformed churches in the world (where there are pastors) that haue not these doctors, &amp; which do not admit them, to haue anie such authoritie, nor giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either place or voice in their consistories, then surely all those, and many such like speeches fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, do euen as properly fall vpon them, as they do vpon our church, against the which they were first coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and vttered.<note place="margin">Learned dis. pa. 17.18.</note>

            <p>There is a saying of <hi>Will Summer,</hi> that whosoeuer pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him, he wold be sure to strike him that stood next him. And I cannot more fitly resemble our reformers rashnes. Things go not here as they would haue them, which pincheth them; &amp; therupon whilest they would be reuenged vppon those that hinder their plots, then (laying about them like mad men) haue stroke one for another: and so (as in such cases it oft falleth out) haue maimed verie sore their next and best friends. For I do not remember, that either <hi>Geneua, France, the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> do so account of Doctors, as our men do. They recken them not among those officers, that Christ hath appointed for the gouernment of the church. They haue no places or voices, but of curtesie, in their consistories: their Senates, or glorious body of Christ, is without them; and yet they esteeme of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, to be as perfect and entire bodies, as comely, &amp; of as beautifull a stature, as our platformers, (their scol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers) can deuise, and counterfeit anie.

            <p>Now, if these things be true, which heere I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, is it not wonderfull, with what faces <hi>Cartwright</hi> and the rest, dare tell vs so confidently, of such necessity of their pretended doctors, as before I haue noted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Do all the reformed Churches which they brag of, dwell in such darknesse, as that they deforme and mayme Christs bodie, and knowe it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay, peraduenture if they bee pressed ouer eagerly with these examples and testimonies, they will not sticke, to tell either <hi>Geneua,</hi> or the best of them all, another manner of tale. Where it is obiected, agaynst the great necessitie of Doctors, which is pretended, that, some Churches haue them
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:775:79"/>
not: aunswere is made, that <hi>Sacraments are verie profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet sometime the Church cannot haue them:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Def. of dis. p. 69</note> 
               <hi>and that, although they are not simplie, and absolutely necessarie to saluation: yet so necessarie they are, as the contempt and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full neglect of them, is damnable.</hi> And there is theyr aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: implying (forsooth) such a lyke necessitie of his Doctors, as though, none coulde bee saued, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned this fancie of theirs. Which aunswere, is puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vp with an hereticall humour, of condemning all men, that doo withstand them; or, if his dearest friend should speake for him, the best sense that it can possiblie carrie, is this: that those who incounter with these Doctors, are, in his opinion, but sillie and ignoraunt persons. For otherwise, if they knewe but as much as hee, and his companions doo knowe, and shoulde resist these officers, there were then no remedie with them, by his diuinitie, but fall they must needes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the same daunger, that remayneth for such, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the holy Sacramentes. So, as if hee escape the sayde imputation, of that hereticall humour, of condemning: yet another marke thereof sticketh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, both vppon him and his fauourers, then (I feare) they will easily shake off from them; and that is, pride, and an ouer-weening of themselues, and their owne learning. But it is a shame, that such insolencie is not more carefully repressed. They haue rashly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, they knowe not what; and for their reputations, (with most ridiculous obstinacie, euen agaynst Gods forbod, all the world in effect impugning them) yet they will needes looke bigge on the matter, and blush not. In their first admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they themselues did most faithfully (after their manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) assure the high Court
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:775:80"/>
of parliament,<note place="margin">Admon. 4</note> that the officers, <hi>which had to deale in the Ecclesiasticall discipline,</hi> (by them at that time vrged so vehemently) <hi>were Pastors, Elders and Deacons.</hi> And after, <hi>To these three ioyntly, the Ministers, Seniors, and Deacons, is the whole regiment of the Church committed.</hi> So as then, these parochiall Doctors, were cleane out of request. And is not this the <hi>lightnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Corinth. 1.17</note> 
               <hi>and fleshly minde,</hi> which the Apostle renounceth, in that they come thus vnto vs, with yea, and nay.</p>
            <p>But as yet you see not all the vncertainties, follies, iarres,<note place="margin">Eccle. pa. 95</note> squaringes, and contradictions, which I finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter, <hi>Iunius</hi> saith, that of doctors, some were prophets, &amp; some were doctors. <hi>Beza,</hi> he holdeth that S. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, was to diuide Prophets, into Pastors &amp;, doctors. Whose diuisions or opinions cannot both bee true; if the rules of diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be duly obserued. For by the first, euery prophet is a doctor: and by the second, euery doctor is a prophet. Furthermore, as <hi>Iunius</hi> very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly will draw, both a prophet and a doctor, out of a doctor,<note place="margin">Def. of dis. p. 61</note> &amp; as <hi>Beza</hi> wringeth the doctor out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: so <hi>Trauerse</hi> he can fetch him out of a Bishop. <hi>Of Bishops</hi> (saith he) <hi>some are pastors, and some are doctors.</hi> By whose extraction, euery <hi>Geneua</hi> school-master (that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth but <hi>petits</hi>) is now become a Bishop. And perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture I doe espie his pollicie in it.</p>
            <p>A great while it went vnchecked amongst them, for an Ecclesiastical canon (as though the king of <hi>Persia</hi> had made it), that a Doctor was inferior to the Pastor, and to holde the second place. But since it was better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of, &amp; wisely foreseene, that <hi>Cartwright</hi> &amp; some others, might more safely take vpon them the office of doctors, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of pastors (who are tied more strictly to the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:775:80"/>
obseruation of diuers ceremonies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) they seeme to mee, to bee quite come about, and to assigne the first place mentioned, vnto the Doctor: &amp; so no maruaile if they make him a Bishop.<note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> 
               <hi>The office of teaching</hi> (saith the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned discourser) <hi>is the chiefe &amp; principal office in the church.</hi> And afterward. <hi>The office of a Doctor is to teach.</hi> With whom the godly Sermoner seemeth to agree, when he saith:<note place="margin">Pag. 73.</note> 
               <hi>Mans soule hath two parts: vz. reason, or the minde; and the hart, or the affection. By the fall of</hi> Adam <hi>there is darknes in the mind, and rebellion in the hart. Now the Lord, to cure these diseases, hath giuen remedie to his Church: First a Doctor to teach vs, and then a Pastor to exhort vs, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Fenner</hi>-likewise,<note place="margin">Sacrae Theolog. Pag. 275.</note> doth place the Doctor before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor.</p>
            <p>But of this matter I haue no great regard: whether soeuer goeth first, as proud commeth after. And perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, they haue some way to shift it. I will not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stand greatly vppon it: especially, hauing some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Doctoral points to aduertise you of: which are of greater importaunce. For as yet, they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, (for any thing I can find) whether their Doctors in that they are Doctors, bee Ministers, to take (as wee commonly speake) the cure and charge of soules vpon them, in particular parishes, or not. In the whole treatise of the discipline of Fraunce: the rules and orders sette downe for making of Ministers, doe belong altogether vnto such as our men tearme Pastors. And the same course is also held, in the seruice booke of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But most plaine it is, in the generall Synode of <hi>Hage,</hi> (vz. that Doctors are not such Ministers) where hauing set downe (after the newest fashion) the foure functions left vs (as they say) by Christ: vz. Pastors, Doctors, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:775:81"/>

               <hi>Nemo sine legitima vocatione, &amp;c.

            <p>Lastly, if they should bee able in time to compasse this point: that their Doctors, by vertue of that calling, might goe for such Ministers; yet a new controuersie thereupon ariseth, not inferiour to any of the rest: vz. whether it appertaineth to these kinde of Ministers of the word, to be Ministers also of the sacraments. <hi>Caluin</hi> thinketh,<note place="margin">Inst. lib. 4. cap. 3. sect. 4.</note> that this is a part of the difference betweene the Pastor and the Doctor: <hi>Quod Doctores, nec discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae, nec sacramentoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> administrationi praesunt: That Doctors haue neither to deale with the discipline', nor with the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of sacraments.</hi> But <hi>Cartwright</hi> (little esteeming <hi>Caluins</hi> iudgement in this matter) is most earnest to the contrary: who grounding himself (as he would seem) vpon diuers reasons, examples, and authorities, giueth out these Oracles.<note place="margin">T.C. l. 1. p. 139.</note>

            <p>In the new draught of discipline (wherunto he hath subscribed,) it is thus defined. <hi>The Church-officers are first the Ministers of the worde, &amp;c.

Not to gratifie, I suppose, either <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi> or the truth: but because it concerneth most, their owne present estate. For as the Doctor, for their sakes, began to be aduanced a steppe higher than he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: so is hee now likewise (as I imagine) in the same respect, disburdened of that base office. They can finde in their harts, to preach: but, vrge them to administer the sacraments, and their common answere is this: we haue nothing to doe with that duetie: it belongeth to the Pastors, and we are Doctors. The matter is; they will not obserue the orders of the Church, in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of sacramentes: whereupon it is now come to passe, that there may bee certaine Ministers of the worde, who haue not authoritie to administer the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes.<note place="margin">Prouerb. 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. XII. They cannot agree where to find their Elders qualities described.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thinke it can hardly be shewed in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: that God himselfe did euer ordaine any speciall officers, either ecclesiastical, or ciuill: but he likewise appointed, what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men they should bee, in respect of their abilities and vertues, for their fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full discharging of them. Which maketh mee, more than to suspect, that these pretended Elders, for all the outcries made in their behalfe: to be indeed but counterfaits; in that they cannot agree among themselues, where they are described. The forme of praier made at <hi>Geneua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Learned dis. pag.</note> and practised in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and with diuers alterations, offered not long since, to haue beene (by parliament) established in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; others that follow them, do thus describe them. <hi>The Elders must bee men of good life, and godly conuersation, without blame and all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, carefull for the flocke, wise, and aboue all things, fearing God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for all these qualities, the chiefe place alledged (as I thinke) is out of <hi>Numbers:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 11. 16. 17. 24. 25.</note> where it is saide, <hi>That God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> Moses <hi>to choose 70. men of the Elders of Israell to beare the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the people with him</hi>: which <hi>Moses</hi> hauing performed, the Lord, according to his former promise, <hi>tooke of the spirite, which was in</hi> Moses, <hi>and put it vpon the 70. ancient men, &amp; when the spirit rested vpon them, they prophecied, and did not cease.</hi> Out of which words, I find nothing for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: except they wil haue them Prophets. But I do here dispute nothing, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> speak for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. Welsurely, then saith a discouerer of vntruths,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:775:86"/>
that came lately from <hi>Scotland:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 8.6.8.</note> 
               <hi>They are ignoraunt in the cause of Christes gouernment, that will affirme these were Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall officers. The very place it selfe, and all the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, doe prooue them ciuile. And where it is said that the seuenty Elders prophecied, it can no more prooue them to belonge to the gouernement of the Church, then the like gift bestowed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon</hi> Saul <hi>can make him a Church officer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bannosius,</hi> he relieth not vppon the booke of <hi>Numbers,</hi> for this matter: but if you will be content with <hi>Exodus,</hi> he can fet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence with a wet finger: marry you must haue it by way of collection. <hi>Si ex praecepto Domini &amp;c. If by the Lords commandement the gouernours of the common wealth of the Hebrewes, were men of courage, fearing God, men dealinge truely, hating coueteousnes, multo magis tales esse debent Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri &amp;c. Much more these Elders ought to be such valiant men.</hi> In good time. And other place out of the old Testament for this purpose he nameth not any: which sheweth he was brought to a very low ebbe.</p>
            <p>There is a description of the visible Church, which (they say) was printed at <hi>Rochell:</hi> Wherein these Elders are thus described. <hi>They must be of iudgment and wisedome, endued with the sprite of God, able to discerne betweene cause and cause, betweene plea and plea</hi> &amp;c: and to that end, besides the place of <hi>Numbers</hi> mentioned, they quote another out of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> where <hi>Iehosophat,</hi> speaking of the iudges of the high Court,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 19.9 10.</note> for all causes at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> saith: <hi>thus shall yee doe in the seat of the Lord, faithfully and with a perfect heart, and in euery cause that shall come vnto you, from your brethren that dwell in theyr cities: betweene bloud and bloud, betweene lawe and precept, statutes and iudgement yee shall iudg them.</hi> Where I note, the warines of these fellowes, in attributing vnto their Elders Commission to discerne betweene cause and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:775:87"/>
cause, plea and plea; that they leaue out purposely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene bloud and bloud &amp;c. For the which <hi>Beza</hi> will not giue them any thankes at all: hauing deuised a tricke (as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it shall appeare) how they may deale in those matters, aswell as in the other. Indeed in all alike. But this place ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther serueth to shew their opinions, what causes the Elders are to be Iudges in, then to describe their qualities, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then that they must be faithfull men. They will play smal play befor they sit out. And thus you haue what they bring to this end (for ought I finde) out of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: with such good agreement as hath beene declared, Which causeth me to imagin that the Lord neuer thought of any such officers, in the time of the Law. For if he had: <hi>Moses</hi> surely (in mine opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) would haue described their qualities: aswell as he did the 70. Iudges and other officers (to diuers purposes) by him appointed, and not haue lefte them (especially such noble Prelates and Cherubins) to be described in this sort: hit I, misse I, by gesse.</p>
            <p>But peraduenture, there are more pregnant places in the new Testament, to supply some want in <hi>Moyses</hi>: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uppon they doe iumpe with one consent and good agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together. I would be glad to see that: but he liueth not, I am perswaded that shall euer see it. When proude men dissent: they are hardly reconciled in matters of wit and learning.<note place="margin">De polit. 71.</note> Let vs try them. <hi>The qualities required to bee in an Elder, are sette downe by the Apostle in the Epistle to</hi> Titus (saith <hi>Bannosius</hi>) and some others, in these wordes thus in effect. <hi>An Elder must be vnreprouable, the husbande of one wife,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1.</note> 
               <hi>hauing faithfull children, which are not slaundered of riotte, neyther are disobedient, not frowarde, not angry, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to wine, no striker, not giuen to filthy lucre, but harbarous, one that loueth goodnesse, wise, righteous, holy, temperate, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:775:87"/>
Nay (sayth <hi>Caluin</hi>) though there be two kindes of Elders,<note place="margin">Cal. in Tit.</note> yet <hi>contextus statim ostendit, hic non alios quàm Doctores intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligi, hoc est, qui ad docendum ordinabantur: The Text doth shew, that here no other are to be vnderstood, but Doctors, that is those that were ordayned to teach.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclesiasticus pag. 64.68.</note> With <hi>Bannosius</hi> agreeth <hi>Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>

They are out of all doubt, that where the Apostle in his Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Beza annot. 1. Tim 3.1.</note> doth describe the qualities, which are required in a <hi>Bishop,</hi> there also and in the same wordes, he setteth out the Elder in like maner: <hi>For that the word</hi> (Bishop) <hi>doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in that place, both a Minister of the word, and the ruling Elder also.</hi> Now then we haue him: and because we haue beene so long seeking for him, you shall haue him at large, according to these mens opinions. He that desireth the office of a ruling Elder, desireth a good worke. <hi>A ruling Elder therefore must be vnreprooueable, the husbande of one wife, watching, sober, modest, harbarous, apt to teach, not giuen to wine, no striker, not giuen to filthy lucre, but gentle, no fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not couetous, one that can rule his own house honestly, hauing children vnder obedience with all honesty: for if any man can not rule his owne house, howe shall hee care for the Churche of God? Hee may not bee a young Scholler, least hee being puffed vppe, fall into the damnation of the Diuell. Hee must also bee well reported of, euen of them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, least hee fall into rebuke and the snare of the Diuell.</hi> There is not a Shoomaker in <hi>Geneua,</hi> but he is such a one ye may be sure: and in <hi>England</hi> you may haue a dozen of them in euery parish.</p>
            <p>But may we now indeede, rest in these mens opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doe what you list. But <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Trauerse</hi> are directly
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:775:88"/>
against them. For <hi>Caluin</hi> neuer comprehendeth, the only ruling Elder, vnder the word <hi>Bishop:</hi> and vppon this place of <hi>Timothy,</hi> he maketh Pastor &amp; Bishop, words of one sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification: as he doth also vpon the 1. to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and the first to <hi>Titus:</hi> which quite excludeth this counterfaite Elder, from shrowding himselfe here vnder the <hi>Bishop.</hi> With <hi>Caluin</hi> also agreeth herein,<note place="margin">Disc.

            </p>

               <hi>They are contained in that Epistle to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, vnder the name of Deacons.</hi> Nay sayth maister <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi> where Sainct <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of Deacons, <hi>quod alij ad Presbyteros referunt Episcopo inferiores, caret fundamento: in that some referre it to Elders that are inferior to the Bishop, it wanteth a foundation. Restat vt Diaconos intelligamus, quorum mentionem facit Lucas Act 6. . Sunt qui curam pauperum habebant. It remaineth that wee vnderstande those Deacons of whome mention is made Act. 6. And those were they that had the care of the poore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto them.</hi> But now commeth in M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> on the behalfe of his pupill <hi>Trauers</hi>: saying in effect. It is true that <hi>Caluin</hi> was a learned man in his time:<note place="margin">Lib 3. pag. 34</note> but yet herein <hi>Trauers</hi> doth seeme to bee of the sounder opinion. These be his wordes: <hi>In the worde Deacons (as it is well obserued in the booke of the Discipline of Englande) the Apostle comprehendeth both the Elders, and those which had the Almes to dispose.</hi> Indeede maister <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> is a fellow for a dead lifte. For if I vnderstand him wel, he wil haue his Elders described, both vnder the nams of Bishops &amp; of Deacons: as though they were, a thirde

thing compounded of them both.<note place="margin">Lib. 3. p. 54.</note> I haue <hi>shewed</hi> (saith he) <hi>that both they and their office be there: which is the same with the Bishops: that onely of teaching excepted.</hi> But <hi>Iunius,</hi> when he sorteth them with the ministers of the worde, leaueth not out that point as impertinent to them:<note place="margin">Eccles. 69.</note> but maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>apte to teach.</hi> From whome (as I take it) <hi>Beza</hi> dissenteth not much,<note place="margin">Anno. 1. Cor. 12.8.</note> when speaking of these Elders, hee saith: <hi>qui &amp; ipsi interdum doctrinae verbo praeerant, euen they somtimes did preach the word.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thes. Geneu. pa. 217.</note> And <hi>Abraham Henric,</hi> is direct: <hi>presbyteris, peculialiter sic appellatis, verbi quoque administratio commissa est, &amp;c. The administration of the word is also giuen to the Elders peculiarly so called, &amp;c: but to another end then to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Doctors: vz: vt iudicijs ecclesiasticis, praeeuntibus pastoribus praesint:</hi> that next after the Pastors they might beare rule in their ecclesiasticall iudgementes, or courtes of iustice.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Henric</hi> may meane well: but to my seeming hee doth not well expresse himselfe. Maister <hi>Beza</hi> can open this point more directly. Indeede he hath so opened it, as he hath already almost vndone his Elders. For now by his statutes of <hi>Geneua,</hi> the twelue Elders, must all be preachers. This mysterie was neuer reuealed, so directly to the world before, as I thinke till nowe of late. <hi>The Elders wee speake of,</hi> (saith Maister <hi>Beza) do feede the church with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, being ioyned with the Pastors and Doctors, in the exercise of ecclesiasticall iudgementes. Yea what differeth that publicke preaching of the word, which is proper to Pastors, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is exercised in the Consistories, according as it is meete, that some should be conuinced, some instructed, some reproued, or some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, sauing in this, that the Pastor preacheth publickly to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, and the Elders but to priuate men, being called into the Consistory?</hi> If their Pastors preach no better in their Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:775:89"/>
then I imagine their Artizan preachers doe, in their Elderships: peraduenture he that should say their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were but pratling, might sometimes say it truely.</p>
            <p>But what should we respect any of these fellowes: let vs followe <hi>Cartwright</hi> and <hi>Trauerse</hi> (in the point they agree in) and through their spectacles, beholde: howe these El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are to be furnished, vnder the shadowe of Deacons. <hi>They must bee honest, not double tongued, not giuen to muche wine, neither to filthy lucre, hauing the mystery of faith in pure conscience</hi>:<note place="margin">Tim. 3.8.9.10 11.12.13.</note> 
               <hi>And let them first be proued, then let them minister if they be found blamelesse: Likewise their wiues must be honest, not euill speakers, but sober and faithfull in all thinges. They must be the husbandes of one wife, and such as can rule their children well, and their owne housholdes. For they that haue ministred well, get themselues a good degree, and great liberty in the faith, which is in Christ Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus you haue your Elders, with their compleat ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, layd out before you: after this and that mans fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, agreeing as iustly, as Germanes lippes together. But I may not omit one thing, before I ende this point. It may peraduenture seeme strange vnto you (as surely it doth to me) that anie men of iudgement: (whether they will haue their Elders indued, with those qualities that were required in the 70. chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> or in the <hi>Iudges, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, 2.</hi> or in the Bishops, or in the Deacons, <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.) should but once dreame, that there might so many men of such vertue and qualities be found in a kingdome, as might supply euery parish with six, or eight of them. But I will tell you what <hi>Cartwright</hi> faith for remedie heereof:<note place="margin">T.C. lib. 1. pag. 180.</note> beleeue him as your discretion shall direct you. <hi>When men are called</hi> (faith hee) <hi>to a lawfull and profitable calling, and especially to a publicke calling, God doth poure his giftes on that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:775:89"/>
person, which is called so plentifully, that he is as it were sodainly made a new man.</hi> An excellent conceite. But to see my sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie. I euer thought, that where God appointeth, what maner of men (for their giftes and qualities) shoulde bee chosen, to such and such offices, there ought euer especiall care to be had, that none destitute of them, as neer as might be, should be admitted vnto them. And if I haue been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued herein, I maruaile howe it commeth to passe, that many men vnfit for their giftes, being vpon diuerse occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions more necessarie, then can happen for the choyse of their Elders, admitted into the ministery, such wants haue not been so plentifully supplied, and they sodainly become new men. But the rule holdeth of likelihood, only for their Elders. Ah hee meaneth (I suppose,) that God will take off the spirite, that is in him and the rest of their Pastors and doctors, and put it vppon them, as he did from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> for the 70. <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. and this you may beleeue when you heare them all prophesie. Surely (for ought I can see,) they haue not any suche aboundant store of the giftes of Gods spirite, that they can spare much to bee taken from them, except they shall be left wholly destitute. But it were good wee sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and some other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to learne more certainly of this straunge <hi>metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis,</hi> before we be too light of credite. For as I take it, we may not looke for such extraordinary matters nowe. And besides, I feare, if their Elders should receiue any portion of that spirite, which is in some reformers; it will be of that which offred himselfe, to be a lying spirite in the mouthes of certaine Prophets: and then it were better for vs, they neuer prophesied.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Beza</hi> (as I take it) is plaine in this poynt: <note place="margin">Beza de exco. pag. 112.</note> and to our men verie opposite. For sayth hee, in proofe of his Elders: <hi>Certè nisi &amp;c. Surely except some men chosen out of the body of the whole assemblie, should sit in that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, by whom the whole Church is gouerned: The generall name of the church would scarsly agree to that company: with which name notwithstanding it is adorned, because through that meanes, men being chosen out of all the partes of the whole Church, they might represent the whole church.</hi> By which wordes, his meaning eyther must needes be, that for the better representation of the whole church, there must be Lay-men, (as wee call them) aswell of the Eldership, as Ministers; or that their Elders ought to bee chosen out of the companie of men, of euery trade and vocation; which cannot in any wise agree to the practise of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,</hi> where men of the state, and Councellors, are onely chosen. Now if vppon their choyse, as being Idiots before, they are become wise; So of Lay-men, they are presentlie made Ecclesiasticall persons: then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of both the estates, is drowned: by which meanes theyr Eldershippe might loose the name of

the Church, or at the least scarsely continew it.</p>
            <p>Heere commeth also further into my minde, another opinion of <hi>Bezaes,</hi> fitte for this place: which in my iudgement doth mightely thwart not himselfe onely, but all his abettors for erecting vp of their Eldershippe. He sayth,<note place="margin">De. excom. pa. 53.</note> when Christ vsed these words: <hi>Tell the church &amp;c. Math.</hi> 18. <hi>In discipulorum persona legitimum ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae nomine consensum congregatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> intelligebat, he vnderstood, in the person of his Disciples, a lawfull Senate or company as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together in the name of the church.</hi> And in his confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,<note place="margin">Cap. 5. sect. 43</note> hee also affirmeth; <hi>that the keyes of the kingdome of heauen were giuen, omnibus verè presbyteris; to all true El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> including his only ruling Elders, <hi>in persona Apostolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, in the person of the Apostles.</hi> Which opinion of his, first ouerthroweth his collection: that there must needes be vnpriestly Elders, for the sayd representation by him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised. For here wee see, the Church represented suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently in his iudgement. <hi>Math.</hi> 16.19. and 18. v. by Christs disciples and Apostles, they being all of them ministers of the word, and sacraments, to whom Christ there spake. Secondly, if the Apostles, in receauing the keyes, sustayned the person of all true priests: and if <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> when Christ saide vnto him, <hi>vnto thee, I will giue the keyes,</hi> sustained the person of the Apostles: It followeth that one man maye sustaine, the person of all <hi>Bezaes</hi> true Elders or Eldership: and so consequently, it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the word of God, if wee saye, <hi>Tell the Churche,</hi> that is, <hi>tell the Bishops</hi> vz. <hi>one man.</hi>

            <p>But to leaue <hi>Beza</hi> to his owne pleasure, both to saye, and do what he list: especially in his owne Consistory. And yet truelie it were good reason, if their Elders bee Christs vicars, Gods prelates, Bishops, &amp; Archbishops,

            </p>
            <p>Nowe, if they will say: that they haue some rules, out of the scriptures for this their mutabilitie: (as I trust they will be ashamed to saie otherwise) &amp; that (as <hi>Cartwright</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">T.C. Lib. 1.</note>) <hi>These Elders did not florish in Constantines time:</hi> shall wee thinke, that the Bishops in the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> when they went about the matter that <hi>Paphnutius</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode, did euer intende, that such an Elder or ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call person (becomming a layman againe after a yeare or two,) should vppon his choyse to that office, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence foorth, not companie with his wife which he had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before? It maie peraduenture bee answered, that Christes order for this annuall or bienniall change, was through corruption altered, before that Councell; and growen to bee a continuall office. Indeed they may bee bolde with those times: to speake of them, as they list. But what will you thinke if nowe the matter beginne to be called in question: whether <hi>Geneua</hi> first, and then after, whether other their reformed churches of the Lowe Countries, and of Scotlande haue done well, in making these Elders but temporall officers, rather then Ministers of the worde. Certainelye a Learned man of that humor, tolde mee playnlie, that both <hi>Geneua,</hi> and the rest were thought by diuerse graue men to haue done amisse therein. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture by degrees, you shall see some alteration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that matter. For the Bretheren of Englande, in their subscribed Discipline, do beginne to make some
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:775:93"/>
qualification that way (as it seemeth vnto mee) when they saye: <hi>Presbyteri non sunt perpetui, neque tamen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilè moueantur. Let not the Elders bee perpetuall, nor yet easilye remoued.</hi> They must not bee perpetuall: but yet; no time is prescribed. So as, they may continew Elders by this rule: through the strength of one ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, twentie yeares, if the rest of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie bee so pleased. And <hi>Carolus Gallus</hi> in his booke of Discipline is already come to the poynt: affirming directlie, <hi>Presbytero Ecclesiae post biennium aut triennium stationem suam deserere non licere: That it is not lawfull for an Elder of the Church after two or three yeares to giue ouer his charge, but must contynue the same vsque admor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, vntill his death.</hi> Which assertion hee taketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him to prooue, after the manner of these men: by many arguments (such as they are) both out of the olde, and newe Testament: with whome agreeth <hi>Bannosius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De polit. ciuit. dei. &amp;c. 71.</note> alledging this old Cannon: which prouideth <hi>Ne bis presbyter ordinetur, et ne quispiam bis baptizetur: That a Priest or Elder bee not twise ordayned nor any twise baptised.</hi> For (sayth hee) <hi>Ordinatio est perpetuae functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis consecratio, quemadmodum baptismus perpetui foederis cum Deo initi est testificatio: Ordination is the consecration of a perpetuall function, as baptisme is a contynuall testimony or witnesse of our League made with God.</hi> This surelye draweth deeplie.</p>
            <p>How it will be taken at his handes I knowe not. I am perswaded, that whilest <hi>Beza</hi> liueth: it will neuer be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at <hi>Geneua.</hi> For so if their twelue Elders did see their authoritie to bee of such continuance: they might paraduenture, hold the six ministers noses to the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:775:93"/>
grindstone. Whereas nowe, they knowing their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to bee of such small continuance, euen as they please the ministers: doe suffer them to raigne and doe what they list; fearing what afterclapps might light vpon them, the yeare after: if they should doe otherwise.

So as what will be the issue amongst them herein: god knoweth. For my part, I doe not: and therefore I will leaue them to their consultations, what course they were best to take, for their owne credits: &amp; proceed to the qualities, wherewithall they affirme, that their Elders (by the worde of god) must needes be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger come to dwell within their seuerall tribes, they must signifie the same vnto the pastor, that hee may examine his religion.</hi> Thirdly;<note place="margin">Beza: de exco: pag. 102. Lawes of Geneua.</note> 
               <hi>if any infants are to be baptised, they must likewise giue the pastor notice therof.</hi> Fourthly; <hi>at the time of the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they must all ioyntly see, that no excommunicate persons, come into the church: likewise helpe and assist the pastor, (at Geneua the Elder ministreth the cuppe): take heede that none come to the Lords table, whose religion and honesty should not be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en vnto them, and with whom the pastor and Doctor, should not haue dealt before.</hi> In general tearmes their whole duety is to helpe, <hi>to informe and to aide the pastors and Doctors, &amp; to haue a vigilant eye to the obseruation of all such ceremonies, lawes, and orders, as they themselues, with their fellow Senators should constitute and ordaine.</hi>

In what reputation shoulde the ministers be; that shoulde haue such eyes, such

aiders, such informers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What would the people (thinke, you) say, when they should see these noble men and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen come to the Pastors with their caps in their hands seuerally, saying: May it please you Sir, there is a stranger come lately to dwell within my Tribe: another, there is a childe to be Baptised within my tribe: another, this and that fellow are obstinate persons, within my Tribe: and altogether (if they know any that presumed to come to the Communion:) Oh Sir, here is a fellow, you haue not spoken withall: and (when I say) the people shoulde see these things &amp;c. on the other side likewise perceaue, and heare their Ministers (as I imagine) giue a nodde with their heads and aunswere vnto them: very well: yee haue done your duties, and we commend you for it: bring this: take away that &amp;c, would they not fall downe think you, and worship these <hi>Rabbies?</hi> But you must remember al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies that they hate superiority.

            <p>Well it is meete we should now consider, what proofe they haue: for all these particular dueties, out of the word of God.

Whosoeuer will take the paines to reade, that parte of his Booke, <hi>de Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terio:</hi> shall finde little else in it, but his probabilities and groundlesse assertions.

The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise is surely vnworthy such a mans, as maister <hi>Beza</hi> would be accounted.</p>
            <p>And vppon the like conceipt also, our Englishe Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers haue taken vppon them to set downe all the former duties mentioned of their Elders: not that they find them in the word of God, but because they fit their turnes, and doe account them necessary to set vp their own kingdom.

            <p>It appeareth by diuers letters of <hi>Gualters,</hi> that the present state of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is so depraued beyond the seas by these companions amongst vs: as that it hath beene conceiued by godly men, that wee had no lawes, no good orders, no discipline, but that euery man might doe what he list: which caused him to giue this aduise.

For the best reformed churches in Europe, may cast their caps (as the saying is) in this respect, at <hi>England.</hi> Which heapeth a greater iudgement vpon them, that can not bee content to liue quietly, vnder the present gouernement: but do so frowardly, so seditiously, &amp; so fondly seek to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe the same: and to bringe vnto vs, they know not what, a counterfeite <hi>Chimera,</hi> without either top, or toe, proportionable to that which is pretended.</p>
            <p>But this is by the way. My purpose was to informe you, that for the duties or offices (before so largely ascribed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Elders, to bee seuerally by them executed in their particular tribes,) they haue no warrant in the woord of God: but are driuen to silly shiftes, their <hi>proculdubio,</hi> their <hi>thinkinges,</hi> and (as you haue seene,) in effect, to confesse as much. So that by their owne diuinity, those men that

dare take vpon them such offices: are in daunger to perish. Now I will come to those offices, which they affirme they are to execute, with the Pastor and Doctor.</p>

            <p>A man would haue thought these Elders had been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently loaden before: but here is a surcharge with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

say that in the old testament these their Elders, had to doe in the electing or chosing of Priests, &amp; so consequently in their deposition? Lay it in them or in their voices: to make new <hi>Leuites</hi>? It is a mockery. Besides: what if their Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships themselues, haue no such authoritie? shall it not in some sorte impaire the credite of their Aldermen? Or if the Ministers, the maisters of the game be cut short: may not their attendantes be contented, though they be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abridged?</p>

               <note place="margin">Ibid. Artic. 23</note> This were a disgrace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: if our graue Eldership, should be thus ouerruled. But for their Aldermen, in all that action of both sortes: vz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and abdication: I doe not find them, so much as once mentioned by those lawes: except they be included, in the name of ministers. And then some of their ministers, are dumbe dogges.</p>
            <p>By the decrees of the nationall Synode at the Hage: the election of ministers,<note place="margin">Synode Hage Art. 4.</note> may not be, <hi>by the Consistorie alone, but the Deacons are also ioyned in commission with them, and likewise the Classis: or if there be none, then two or three neighbour-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> And for deposition of any from the ministerie: that is, <hi>Penes caetum Classicum: belonging to the Classicall assembly.</hi> It seemeth that the Elders (being more in number in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

Eldership then the ministers) beganne to play false play, and shewed some wilfulnesse: so as nowe they must in this sorte be bridled, with a pluralitie of more Priestly voyces. By which meanes, though they seeme to haue some interest in these affaires: yet in effect, it is none at all.</p>
            <p>Furthermore,<note place="margin">French disc. Art. 4.</note> it is ordered by the great Synode in <hi>Fraunce, that a minister may not be chosen, by one onely minister with his consistorie, but by two or three ministers: or if there be a colloquy, by the coll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>if it may be.</hi> But touching the deposition of any: that is reserued onely to the prouinciall Synode. It should seeme that in these places, they haue not the same word of God, that our men haue. Or otherwise, (if our reformers say truely) that election and abdication doe belong to the Eldership: and that it is as the sinne of <hi>Chore, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> for any that are not of the particular Eldership, to intrude themselues, and meddle with the matters which are there to bee handled: and so consequently to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to deale in such thinges, as are not prescribed vnto them particularly by the Lord himselfe. Alas in what great daunger are all those Elders, both Classicall and Prouinciall, in swaruing so greatly from our mens plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; to the vnspeakable preiudice of the presbyteriall Aldermen in euerie particular Eldership. I might heere shewe the sillie proofes, which are brought by our refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers out of the newe testament, to confirme their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But I haue a more fit place for that: So as nowe I will proceede to that, which followeth of their imposition of handes.</p>
            <p>A man, that is no minister to haue an interest in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of a minister, by imposition of hands: was it euer
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:775:98"/>
heard of, by the space of a thousand &amp; fiue hundred yeares in the Church of God? The Papistes at the first did trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vs much with an obiection: that we had no Priests nor Ministers, because wee had no Bishops to ordaine them. Whereupon aunswere was made: that a Priest or Minister of the worde, and a Bishop was all one: and that <hi>Luther, Zwinglius, Oecolampadius,</hi> and diuerse others being Priests euen after the Popishe order, had therefore authoritie to ordaine ministers. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rke the reason: because they were Priestes. These vnpriestly Elders were not then hatched. If they had: the aunswere woulde haue beene thereby much more strengthened. But will these men bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in this point? Is imposition of handes allowed of, by them at all:<note place="margin">Lib. 3. pa. 232.</note> or not? <hi>It is the ordinance of God</hi> (saith <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi>) <hi>and may not for anie abuse bee taken awaie. The Apostles continuall obseruation of imposition of handes, in ordaining of Ministers,</hi>

               <hi>praecepti vice nobis esse debet: ought to bee as a precept vnto vs,</hi> (sayth maister Caluin). And manie reasons are brought by the <hi>Demonstrator,</hi>

Indeede the olde doctrine hath beene, <hi>no ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by imposition of handes, no minister.</hi> But all this will not serue the turne: away it must. We are oft cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the example of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and there the Discipline is so purely practised, that imposition of handes (as a fruitelesse ceremonie) is quite and cleane bannished thence. Heare the historie of the Churche of <hi>Scotlande</hi> published in the name of their ministerie.<note place="margin">Hist. of the Church of Scotl. pa. 557.</note> 
               <hi>Albeit the Apostles vsed imposition of handes (in the ordayning of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters) yet seeing the myracle is ceased: the vsing of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, we iudge it not necessary.</hi>

               <hi>It appeareth</hi> (saith he) <hi>that diuers pastors did lay their handes vppon the Deacons: Paule, and Barnabas: and some other.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Sed Paulus ipse alibi se, non alios complures, Timotheo manus imposuisse commemorat &amp;c. But Paule in an other place reporteth, that he himselfe alone without any other, did lay his handes vppon Timothy.</hi> But nowe he pincheth the brotherhood.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Nam quod in altera epistola de impositione manuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> presbtyerij dicitur &amp;c. For that which is spoken in his other epistle of the imposition of the handes of the Eldership:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>non it a accipio quasi de Seniorum collegio loquatur &amp;c. I take it not as though Paule did speake of the college of Elders: but by these words I vnderstand the ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it selfe: as though he had said: Fac vt gratia, quam per manuum impositionem recepisti cum te presbyterum creaui, non sit irrita. See that the grace which thou receiuedst by imposition of handes, when</hi> I <hi>created thee a priest: be not in vaine.</hi> Now that this place is thus wrested from you: all the packe of you bring one other out of the newe testament: for your vnsanctified Aldermens imposition of hands. Nay you see allready, that Totnam is almost turned into french: and there is nothing, why our Bishops might not, for any thing that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues doe bring to the contrary, vse imposition of handes.</p>
            <p>Besides, all our reformers shiftes in one respecte are hereby cut of. For when we euer alledged for our Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops authoritie in this point, the example of Saint Paule: who saith <hi>that</hi> Timothy was made priest, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of his handes: they still would tell vs (but of their own heades without any further warraunt) that he did not so, as by his owne authoritie, but in the name of the Eldership. Which cannot in anie wise be true:
<pb facs="tcp:775:99"/>
for that which may bee done in their names, may bee done by themselues. In that therfore, they might not doe it themselues: they coulde not depute it to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle. So as it remaineth that he did it, by his owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: or at the least, in the name of the rest, that were ministers of the word; which will not agree with our mens platforme. If here exception be taken to <hi>Caluin,</hi> as that in some other of his writings, he is of an other minde: you must bee aduertised, that he beginning to write betimes, did in diuers thinges vpon better aduise change his opinion. And therefore in one of his epistles, desireth those that wil reade his workes, that they would first take the paines to reade his institutions; as contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge in them, (for those things there set downe) his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mind and setled iudgment.

            <p>With which offices, if they of that consorte, will bee content to infeoffe their Aldermen, and goe no further: I see no cause, why any man should greatly enuie them that preferment.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the apostles times, when after Christes ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they began to preach in <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> such was the charitie of those, that professed the Gospell: that many of them, solde all, or the most part, of that which they had, and brought the price of it to the Apostles feete. The especiall reason that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them, (as I take it) so to do: was this. The greatest part, that (at the first) did followe the Apostles,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> were of the poorer sorte. Who vppon theyr newe embracing of that so comfortable a doctrine, did giue ouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:775:104"/>
to the carefull meditation, and throughly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it: leauing their trades, (though not altogether, yet surely as I suppose for the most part,) vntill (at the least) that they grew to bee more fully instructed therein. To the which purpose, they kept asmuch together, with the Apostles, as possibly they could, and had their holy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, their exhortations, praiers, and the administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Baptisme, secretly in priuat houses, for fear of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats. Now (as I said) the most of these being poore men, and the Apostles themselues hauing nothing to liue vpon: When any of the richer sorte did ioyne themselues, to that meeting or congregation: they sold such thinges as they had, or thought meete, and brought the price of it vnto the Apostles: not onely for theyr owne mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, but committed the distribution of it, vnto them, for the reliefe also of the rest that wanted, and were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prouide for themselues, those thinges that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
            <p>This charge, as well for the saide religious exercises in their priuate assembly, as for this distribution equally to be made, as the occasions required: the Apostles took vppon them more particularly for a short time, then they did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward: vz. vntill the number of Christians in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> increased from 120. vnto fiue thousand at the least, and did grow daily more and more: so as they were (as I thinke) constrained to haue diuerse Congregations. And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they found it to be some hinderaunce, vnto the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their generall Commission, for (the further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persing of the Gospell:) they caused seuen men to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,<note place="margin">Acts 6.</note> such as were knowen to <hi>be of honest report, and full of the holy Ghost, and wisedome:</hi> Vnto whom that businesse was more specially committed. Who thenceforth might not
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:775:105"/>
onely according to their honesty and discretion, take into their hands, such money, as shoulde be brought, from time to time, to the godly disposed, for the purpose mentioned: but also in the Apostles absence, agreeably with the fulnes of the holy Ghost, (whereby they held, the mysterye of faith in a pure conscience) were to teach,<note place="margin">1. Timo. 3.</note> to comforte, to moue, to confirme in the faith the brethren, in theyr parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular congregations or meetings: and likewise to offer their common praiers in al their names vnto the Lord, and to baptise the children of the faithfull.</p>
            <p>For the Apostles in appointing of these newe officers, had as well regard to the Soules of the people, as to their bodies. And because at that time, (which was the infancy and first spring of the Church) there were not such meete men, as might be made Priests, or (as they tearme them now a daies) preaching Elders: it pleased the Apostles, to haue them trained vp in that exercise, and to make the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Deacons, a degree and a step to the fulnes of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.<note place="margin">1. Tim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.</note> Which is expressed by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he saith of Deacons: <hi>qui bene ministrant, gradum bonum sibi acquirent: they that minister well, shal purchase to themselues a good degree.</hi> And this order or office of Deacons, being thus (as you haue heard) first instituted at <hi>Hierusalent</hi>: was afterward vppon the same occasions, and for the same ends ordained in other Churches: where, alwaies they executed, all the parts mentioned of their offices: so long as the Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>) that their Churches were disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, so as contributions &amp; collections ceased: yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, their preaching, their exhorting, and confirming, of the we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke brethren: their baptising of children, &amp; the rest of the duties mentioned, as they might be suffered and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:775:105"/>
of, wheresoeuer they came. Examples of such Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and offices, as here I haue spoken of, we haue in the scriptures deliuered to vs by S. <hi>Luke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 8 6.7.</note> wher he setteth down the actions of <hi>Steuen</hi> and <hi>Phillip,</hi> both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Deacons, how they preached: how <hi>Phillip</hi> baptized, and what is sayd of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of them; must be vnderstood of the rest. Vnto these examples, and for the further proofe of these premises: I might adde the generall consent of all the ancient Fathers, and the ordinary practise of all Churches, either in theyr times, or since: especially, for the continuall practise, of the Priestly part of the Deacons office.</p>
            <p>But as in times of dispersion, they could not execute the other part, consisting in collections &amp; distributions: so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, God blessed his Church in such sort, that indeed it needed not. For when great men, Lords, Princes, Kings and Emperours, had embraced the doctrine of Christ, so as men had the Gospell brought (as it were) home to their doores, and might frequent (with commendation) the publicke assemblies, and practise of religion, and withall, follow their owne trades, and particular callings more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently: when also the saide great men, Lordes, Princes, and Emperours, (besides many other well disposed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians) had prouided for the ministers, and for the poor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for the one, partly by the tithes, which are due vnto them, and partly by other gifts, according to their places: and for the other, (that is, the poor) by setting them on worke, (such as were able) &amp; by prouiding of hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, and such like meanes (for those that were impotent) that part of the Deacons office, became, to be in time su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous. And since, they haue applied themselues to the more materiall part of their office, whereby they might obtaine the other good degree of Priesthood.</p>
            <p>With these points, I thought good to acquaint you: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:775:106"/>
I came to the Disciplinary conceits, about Deacons. For euen now, as though there were no prouision made, either for the ministery, or for the poore: they are most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, for (I know not) what kind of Deacons. But as therin they haue cut off themselues from the truth: so are they at great disagreement one with another. Our <hi>Englishe</hi> refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers are all of them peremptory, that we must haue suche Deacons, as (they imagin) were in the Apostles times. But the <hi>Geneuia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> ministers, do think their platform of discipline to be the parago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, although they haue no such Deacons in it. There is in <hi>Geneua</hi> an Hospitall, whereof there are foure Proctors and ouerseers, and these foure are with them in steed of Deacons. For otherwise they haue not so much as the name of Deacons there. By which rule (if we shall square the pretended discipline) we haue such officers already, as may serue our turnes for Deacons, vz. Proctors of Spitle-houses, maisters and ouerseers of hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, as sufficient, honest, and fit me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to execute their places: as ther is any (I assure my self) in <hi>Geneua.</hi> But peraduenture the matter which they shoot at, is this. They would haue an Hospitall in euery parish. And yet there is no such thing at <hi>Geneua.</hi> In al their whole Territory, they haue but one hospitall.</p>
            <p>Wel, let <hi>Geneua</hi> therin do what it list: our men will needs haue another kind of Deacons: &amp; what kind is that? Surely no such kind as was in the Apostles times.<note place="margin">Admonit. 1. T. C. lib. 1. T. C. lib. 2. Beza cont. Sarauia. ca. 7.</note> But they know not indeed what they woulde haue. The Deacons which our men doe require, must not inter-meddle (for a 1000. li.) with any part of the office that belongeth to a minister. Their deaconship in no case may be reckned to be a step to the ministery. How beit som other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as wise &amp; as learned as they are, do hold a contrary opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. First, all the ancient fathers are generally against them, in both the points men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:775:106"/>
&amp; so is the practise of the church of God, euer since the Apostles times. All the learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Germanie</hi> (for ought I find) that maintaine the <hi>Augustane</hi> confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

So as there, to be one of the 4. proctors of their spittlehouse, is one good meanes to get into their ministery. But I will leaue these spittlehouse-deacons, to climbe as they can into their Consist.

            <p>It appeareth in the 10 Chapter, how prouidently it is ordered at <hi>Geneua,</hi> that none but councellers of the state, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be any Aldermen of their grande presbyterye: &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise how <hi>Beza</hi> a duiseth all other Churches, that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue their holy platforme, to endeuour asmuch as they can: that Noblemen &amp; princes may take that office vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>but as godly, wise, and worshipfull, as may conueniently bee found in the Congregation, maye not thinke themselues too good to minister vnto Christ in his members, and in the name of the Church.</hi> Awaie then with these base Artizans, that haue dreamed peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that if the Discipline were vp, they should bee (I know not what): awaie with them I saie; these Tailors, Shoemakers, Mercers, Drapers, and such like ignorant and contemptible persons: and giue place to your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the wise and worshipfull Gentlemen of the parish. Indeed where great Lordes and Princes are Elders: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as Deacons maie chaunce sometimes to be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Commission with them: It is verie meete they should bee men of worship. But yet mee thinketh all the partes of this Senate; are not fullie sutable. For where the Deacons are men of worship: where the Elders are Noblemen and Princes: what must the Pastors and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors bee? Surelie if proportion bee kept: they must bee some bodie: the Doctor a king, and the Pastor an Emperor.</p>
            <p>What needed the learned Discourser then to suspect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that peraduenture some men would bee loth to take the office of Deacons vppon them: when they should bee matched in this sorte, with such worthie and honorable Collegues. A great preferment no doubt for any aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring minde; and few gentlemen (ye maie be sure) will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it. But yet his suspition, doth rise of some thing.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:775:108"/>
For what if these gentlemen Deacons, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Pastors, Doctors, and their Noblemen-elders, were consultinge together; should bee thrust out of the doores, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their worships? I tell you truelie that pointe is not yet resolued. <hi>Bertrand de Loques</hi> a French Discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narian, affirmeth:<note place="margin">Bert. of the Church. c. 14.</note> that <hi>although the Consistorie is indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the Pastors and Elders: Yet the Deacons are receaued into it so farre foorth, and in as much as they shall iudge it to be expedient and profitable: to aduise, giue counsell, &amp; consider of the censures, and of that which is requisite &amp; necessary for the guiding and gouernment of the Church.</hi> Well: this is some thing for the Deacons: but the auncient Councell of <hi>Hage,</hi> which was held (as it hath beene saide) in the yeare 1586.<note place="margin">Concil. Hage Canon 35.</note> hath gone much further. For there it is decreed<hi>: That in those places, where there are but few Elders, Consistorio Diaconi adiungentur, the Deacons shall be adioyned vnto the Consistorie.</hi> Before they were to expect, vntill they might be receaued into the Consistorie: but now they are of it. Before they were but only to giue aduise; but now being of it, they must haue their voices in it.</p>
            <p>But what shoulde I insist vppon such paltrie proofes? You shall heare a Canon of the Ecclesiasticall discipline in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> resolued vppon (I know not) by howe manie Synodes, at <hi>Paris, Poictiers, Orleance, Lyons, &amp;c.</hi> There it is set downe for a Law in this sorte: <hi>The Elders and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons doe make the ecclesiasticall Senate or Consistorye:<note place="margin">Dis. of France. of the Consist.</note> wherein the ministers of the worde sit as chiefe.</hi> And with this French decree, the authors of the seconde admonition here in <hi>England</hi> do fullie accord.

               <note place="margin">Admonitio 2.</note> that <hi>the whole regiment of the Church, is committed ioyntly to the ministers, Elders, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</hi> Thus farre then the matter runneth well: for our
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:775:109"/>
worshipfull Deacons. Howbeit: now heare, what is said to the contrarie.</p>
            <p>You haue heard how the said Councels, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitioners haue ioyned the ministers, Elders, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons together: but now in commeth another sorte, and they will needes disiointe them. It would hardlie bee indured by the Ministers of <hi>Geneua,</hi> to haue one of the proctors of their hospitall, to sitte (by vertue of that office) cheeke by iowle with <hi>Beza.</hi> And therefore the generall resolution of all that are there; is quight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Deacons, in that behalfe. <hi>Beza</hi> in his treatise against <hi>Erastus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Beza de presb. Beza Epist. 85.</note> and else where, doth allow of none to be of the Presbyterie; but Ministers and Elders. <hi>Cartwright</hi> and all the rest of our reforming sconces (except the said Admonitioners) do wholie therein agree likewise, with <hi>Beza:</hi> So as I shall not trouble you with anie further allegation to this purpose, sauing one: and that you shall haue: because it containeth in it, not the iudgement on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of any particular man; but is the full resolution of <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and all his crue here in <hi>England</hi>; contained in a certaine booke of Discipline, whereunto the chiefest of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue subscribed: <hi>The presbyterye</hi> (saith that booke) <hi>is an assembly or senate of elders. By the name of elders are ment, ministers of the word, and those that are properly called Elders.</hi> They meane such as in their place I haue spoken of. Here then you haue that Deacons are of the presbyterie: and that they are not of the presbyterie. Chuse, which side you will belieue: I thinke they are bewitched. If I might aduise you: beleiue them both alike.</p>
            <p>But some will peraduenture saie, that it maketh no great matter, whether side hath the truth: that the point betwixte them is of no importance: and that I am too
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:775:109"/>
blame, to make so much of nothing. Whereunto I answere, that if there bee anie who shall so conceaue: he is not well acquainted with the depth of this matter. For indeed it worketh a meruailous alteration in the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons office. Admitte them to haue their places and voices in the Consistories: and then their authoritie is growen to bee verie great. Then they haue equall right with their pastors and Doctors, to ordaine mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters by imposition of their handes. Then, the forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and retaining of sinnes: doth appertaine vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then they are become the Apostles successors; and doe carry the keyes of the kingdome of heauen aswell as any of the rest.<note place="margin">Cart. &amp;c. newe discipline.</note> 
               <hi>For in Consistorio standum maioris partis senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae: In the Consistorye men must stande to the sentence of the greater part.</hi> One mans voice there, is as good as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And so in all other matters, that do belonge to the Consistorie, and which are to be executed there, iointly by them all together; the Deacons beare swaie &amp; haue a stroake with the best of them. Wheras on the otherside, if they be excluded out of the Consistorie: (as <hi>Beza</hi> &amp; our men would haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:) then they haue nothing at all to doe with any of these matters: but are restrained, &amp; drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into a more narrow co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe: &amp; must content the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:775:110"/>
that in the celebratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lordes supper, they may by their office carrie the cup to the communicants. M. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> goeth a little further, and telleth vs also, that they maie likewise distribute the bread. <hi>In all reformed Churches almost</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Deacons do assist the minister, in helping of him to distribute the cup,<note place="margin">T.C. lib 1: pag 61.</note> &amp; in some places also the bread.</hi> If none would be angrie with me: I would gladlie aske this question: vz. why the Deacons might not aswell helpe the minister to baptise, and to distribute the worde, as well as the Lordes supper? But, as I saide before of the Noblemen Elders, so do I also of our worshipfull Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. What a sight were it to see a Iustice of peace, peraduenture in his veluet cloake, his chaine of golde, and such correspondent attire, as is agreeable to that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; deliuering to the people (that I maie speake of so holie a sacrament, sacramentallie) the most blessed bodie and blood of our Sauiour Christ? And yet I allow the sight as reasonable, as to see the proctor of a Spittlehouse executing of that charge. Peraduenture it will here be said againe; that if there be anie deformitie in the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of either of these sights, it is not in them; but in the beholders. For they are ecclesiastical persons, as soone as they are made Deacons. And then why doth it not belong vnto them: to deale in ecclesiasticall causes? It is wel obiected. That point indeed would not be omitted.</p>
            <p>It is generallie agreed vpon amongst them (I confes) that their new found halfe-partie Deacons, are ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall persons. For our Counter-poisoner saith<hi>: That whosoeuer are called</hi> (as you must vnderstande their Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons are) <hi>to beare office in the Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Count. pa. 130</note> 
               <hi>with due examination and triall, and with the consent of those, to whom it appertayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and are with fasting and prayers, or with prayers onely, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:775:110"/>
with imposition of handes, separated or put a part to that office: they are al Ecclesiasticall persons, and not lay men, as they terme them.</hi> Surely, if our Noble men, were once become El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and our chiefest Gentlemen Deacons: and so both the sorts of them, Ecclesiasticall persons: what a clergy should we haue in <hi>England</hi>? Now there is no one calling, in the whole common wealth, that is growen, to be more contemptible with many, then the calling of Clergy men. But that would soone be recouered, when such men of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation, should bee in the account of Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. There was an old saying. <hi>Soluat Ecclesiae, let euery man pay to the Church.</hi> Which now is altered, and made aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the humor that now raigneth. <hi>Soluat Ecclesia, let the Church-men pay for it.</hi> And indeede, if we had suche Elders and Deacons, to be of the number of vs, that are Church-men and Ecclesiasticall persons: we might surely pay wel for it. At the least if their tenths &amp; subsidies should be in all respects rateable to ours. And there were no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that the Pastors and Doctors, men so farre in degree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Elders and Deacons, should finde lesse fauour, then their inferiours: or be more deepely charged, except their liuings were in true value, according to their degrees.</p>
            <p>But this would be the mischiefe of it: that the Discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary platformres, haue so far ouershot themselues already, as certainely they haue marred all these their former spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations. For they haue made the Deacons office, but annual. And I am perswaded, that if our noble men &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull Gentlemen, were but for one yeare to all respects become Ecclesiasticall persons, they would hardly be dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to continue in that calling the next yeare after. It was neuer heard of in the Church of Christ, for the space of a thousand and fiue hundred yeares, that the deacons office

               </gap>arry long in that office: and that therefore they are glad to haue them as they may, and to frame their lawes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. But you shall heare his owne wordes to Doctor <hi>Sarauia,</hi> who doth mislyke that the Deacons office is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall. <hi>Restitue igitur nobis faelicia illa Apostolicarum Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiarum tempora, &amp;c.

               <hi>and stirre vp suche men, in euery place if thou canst, who will not refuse this office with that condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See I pray you how weak in faith Maister <hi>Beza</hi> is. Tush (saith <hi>Cartwright</hi>) and some others, euen in the very like case: graunt vnto vs once, that we haue our Presbyteries established, and as concerning fit men to take vppon them the offices which are there required, God will stirre them vp thicke and threefolde: you shall be sure there will bee no want that way. You haue heard before, the place I meane,<note place="margin">T. C. lib. 1. pag. 180.</note> but such a good tale cannot be tolde too oft. <hi>When men are called</hi> (saith he) <hi>to a lawfull and profitable calling, and especially to a publick calling: God powreth his gifts on that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, (which is called) so plentifully: that he is as it were sodden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a new man.</hi> Now if this be true: of all the giftes which are most necessary in any man of calling, I take it, that this one may goe in the number: that a man hauing put his hand to the plow, should not looke backe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:775:111"/>
in the calling which he hath taken vppon him. So as then <hi>Bezacs</hi> aunswere is not worth a straw, to tell vs that the Deacons office, is not of such continuance now, as it was in the Apostles times: because men wil not now take that charge vppon them. For <hi>Cartwright</hi> either telleth him in effect: that Deacons must be chosen for their liues, as in the Apostles times, (except there bee some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary occasion to the contrary): and that then God will make them willing to continue in their office, according to their duties: or else if he shall restraine his sayd spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (which are generall) to his Elders, and so exclude their Deacons, from that sodain influence of Gods graces he talketh of: then certainely, I shall doubt, and so I think others will doe in like sort, that his Diuinity in that point, is much like his platforme of Discipline: that is, forged and counterfaite.</p>
            <p>But one thing yet more I am to aduertise you off: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the worshipfull Deacons. And it seemeth strange. Our men as you know, and as it is elsewhere mentioned, haue beene most earnest vppon this point: that the body of Christ must in no wise be deformed, neither by increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, nor diminishing, nor confounding of those officers and offices, which hee himselfe hath appointed in his Church, and to that end distinguished. Heare I pray you the Demonstrator: where he goeth about to proue, that a Deacon may not intermeddle, either with the worde or Sacraments.<note place="margin">Demon. ca. 13</note> 
               <hi>That which the Apostle</hi> (saith hee) <hi>maketh an ordinary and distinct office from other in the Church, must bee attended vppon by them, that are in the same office, and not to be mingled with any other. But the Deacons office is such a one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in distribution with simplicity, as</hi> Caluin <hi>and</hi> Beza <hi>&amp;c. doe affirme. And therefore consequently the Deacons office must

If his <hi>minor</hi> be true: vz. that the Deacons office, consisting in distribution, is of that nature, that it must be attended vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and may not be mingled with any other office: What would yee say to him, who shoulde affirme, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Elders and Deacons are distinct members of Christs body, and haue distinct offices appointed vnto them by Christ: yet those offices may bee mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one man may execute them both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Surely mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Beza</hi> is the man. <hi>As neere as wee can</hi> (saith hee) <hi>we</hi> (in Geneua) <hi>do choose our Deacons (being indued with good gifts) to bee likewise Elders: because (the censure and iudgement of manners, being no daily function) has duas simul functiones o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bire facilè possunt: the Deacons may easily discharge both these functions together.</hi> Indeede it was meete that the Proctors of their Hospitall (carrying the purse) should be intertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them, by one deuise or other. But in the meane while,<note place="margin">T.

            <head>CHAP. XIX. Of certaine widdowes, which are made Church officers: and of the disagreement, which is about them.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ouching this matter of Widdowes; I will not trouble you much with it. Certaine poore godly and impotent widdowes, that had neither goodes nor friendes, nor were able in anie wise to help themselues, were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Apostles times, with such mony, as was brought in, by the richer sorte, and layd at the Apostles feete. The places of scripture, wherin these widdowes are mentioned, the Papistes bring for their Nunnes, and our disciplinarian men, for a fift sorte of their ecclesiasticall gouernours: both of them (as I take it) with no great sinceritie. The office ascribed to Nunnes, was single life, fasting, and prayer. The office ascribed to the ruling Widdowes, is to wash the feete of the saintes, and to attend vpon the poore, that are sicke. This matter of Nunnes, is notably handled, by <hi>Chemnitius:</hi> and so is the other of the pretended ruling Widdowes, <note place="margin">Chemnit. ex. concil. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: par. 3.</note> by Doctor <hi>Sutcliffe.</hi> How grossely the Papistes haue erred in theyr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise:<note place="margin">Doct. Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesi. Discip. cap. 6.</note> I haue not nowe to deale with it. The disagreement which I finde in the other sort, touching their widdowes: is the point, which is propounded.</p>
            <p>First I see, there is some doubt, whether the persons, who, (as they say) did execute the office mentioned, in the Apostles times: were men onely, or women onely: or some of them men, and some of them women. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> he is for the women onely: where diuiding Deacons into
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:775:113"/>
two kinds, he saith thus of the second: <hi>Some had charge ouer the poore straungers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">T. C. lib. 1. pag. 190.</note> 
               <hi>and the sicke poore onely: and those S. Paul calleth in one place Diaconisses, and in another place widdowes.</hi> By his opinion then, they were women. But <hi>Trauerse</hi> in his discourse of discipline, where hee speaketh of deacons, and casteth them out into their orders: can find no other Church officers to haue executed that charge, in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times, ouer the sicke poore, but onely men deacons. A third sorte there is,<note place="margin">Discip. eccles. 118.119.</note> which depend vppon maister <hi>Beza</hi>: &amp; they will be sure not to misse their aime: &amp; therfore they hold, that both men and wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were then capable of that office. <hi>I agree to them (</hi> saith <hi>Beza) who thinke, that saint</hi> Paul <hi>in these words: (he that sheweth mercie with chearefulnesse:) vnderstandeth those which were appointed to cure the sicke: vt serè erant viduae: such as for the moste parte the widdowes were.</hi> Not alwaies widdowes, but for the most part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like it is a matter, after a sorte indifferent. Indeede in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi> they haue no such widdowes at all: <hi>but a phisition and a Surgion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Order of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</note> 
               <hi>maintained by the wages of the towne, to looke to the sicke in their hospitall.</hi> Nowe all these three sortes of men: haue their partakers. The moste hold for the widdowes, with <hi>Cartwright. Iunius</hi> giueth this reason why such wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were rather appointed to that office then men:<note place="margin">Iunius, eccle. lib. 2. cap. 4.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, <hi>aptiores sunt quam viri: they are more fit then men, to be about sicke persons, and to helpe them.</hi> The authour of the fruitfull sermon, he inclineth to <hi>Beza,</hi> where he saith; that a <hi>shewer of mercie is he, or rather she, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Trauerse,</hi> in like sorte is not without his adherent. Which disagreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest them, is not lightly to be regarded. For if wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes were appointed by the Apostles to that office, then men might not execute it: if men were appointed, then it was vnlawfull for women to take it vpon them: no more
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:775:113"/>
then it was lawfull for them to be eyther pastors, doctors, Elders, or men deacons.</p>
            <p>But bee this point, as it may bee: I will come to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond iarre. It hath gone a great while for good paiment from <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Cartwright, &amp;c.</hi> that the whole Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deuided,<note place="margin">Beza annot: Rom. 12. &amp; cont. Erast. T.C. lib. 1. pa. 190.</note> into ecclesiasticall gouernors and Idiots: the men or women that did attend the poore sicke, or rather the women (that I may vse their phrase,) were no more to be reckoned amongst the lay Idiots in their parish, but must be thenceforth accompted in the number of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors.<note place="margin">Learn. dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. Fruitfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> A widdow in a Spittle house, an ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: nay an ecclesiasticall gouernour &amp; commander. It see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that some haue beene driuen from <hi>Beza, Cartwright,</hi> and the rest of their associates: with the very cogitation of this so grosse an absurdity. And therfore to salue vp the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, (and yet to come as neer as they could vnto them) they haue displaced these widdowes from their seats of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and haue made them plaine Idiotes againe, as they were before. Or rather, which is much worse: whereas before they were gouernours of the Churche;<note place="margin">Fenner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence Fruitfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> they haue now thrust them into the lowest place, that may be, &amp; say, they are to be esteemed but as <hi>Church seruaunts, such as were appointed by the gouernours of the Church, and consent of the people,</hi> to that seruitude. Here is then a great fall, as I think. From a wise woman to an Idiot, or from a publicke person to a priuate condition: and from a Church gouernour, to a poore Spittle-house seruaunt. Who would wishe to his enemie a greater change<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Peraduenture there will be some distinction deuised, that shall stop vp this gappe: but if it be not a good one, it may so chaunce; that all their soueraigne rulers will be masshed with it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if these the foresaid helpers of the poore sicke,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:775:114"/>
should be men, as it is in <hi>Geneua,</hi> diuerse great questions will rise. As for example: <hi>where the holy Ghost hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed their qualities? How well seene, they ought to bee in phisicke and surgerie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who shoulde trie their skill before they were chosen? Being chosen, who shoulde admitte them? Whether the Eldershippe must bee able to trie them? And whether it bee an Apostolicall rule, that Phisitions and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons shoulde bee ordained for practicioners, by the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the handes of the presbyterie?</hi> And againe, on the other side also, if the said mercy shewers doe prooue to be widdowes, (although as they say, there is some kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of them in the Apostles first Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.</note> wherein they agree:) yet some thing will still fall forth, to be out of ioynt. Euery such widdow as they require, must be threescore yeares olde at the least, and such a one (sayth maister <hi>Caluin</hi>) as was, <hi>vnius viri vxor, the wife of one hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:<note place="margin">Cal. in 1. Tim. 5.</note> that is, was neuer married but once.</hi> And hee yealdeth this reason of that the Apostles order: <hi>because when a woman commeth to those yeares, and hath beene content all her lifetime before, to haue had but one husband: it is very likely, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward she will liue both continently and modestly.</hi> So then by maister <hi>Caluins</hi> iudgement, there might no widdowe haue attained to the said Church office, of gouerning the sicke poore: if she had beene twise married. But M. <hi>Cartwright relying vpon maister Bezaes</hi> annotations, will (as it seemeth) none of that: but saith, that <hi>it is sufficient, if such a widdowe hath had but one husband at once, and hath not been maried vnto another after an insufficient diuorce.</hi>
               <note place="margin">T.C. lib. 2. p. 116.</note> By whose opinion, euery such widow, might haue had in the course of her life foure or fiue husbands: without preiudicing her selfe thereby, from being as likely to liue continently, after she came to the age of threescore: as any other which should haue had
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:775:114"/>
but one husband at all. If the reason of the Apostles words depend any way vppon that point: peraduenture Maister <hi>Caluins</hi> exposition, will proue to be the better.</p>
            <p>But there are here two pointes, which I meruayle at. It seemeth that by the opinions of them all three, a widdow being once chosen to be a church-gouernour, might not afterwardes marry (at the least), and keepe her office. And why should the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either phisition or surgion that is married, haue that charge committed vnto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cannot an olde woman, that hath peraduenture as olde an husband, be as diligent and carefull about the sicke poore; as a phisition and Surgion of middle yeares, that may haue both of them peraduenture, young wiues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The second point I spake of, is this. Maister <hi>Beza</hi> in his exposition of the place men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: <hi>vnius viri vxor, the wife of one husband,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he knew Maister <hi>Caluins</hi> fore sayd interpretation of the same wordes to be opposite to his, and that he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vppon him to confute his reason before specified, vz. of the probability, that such women, as had been married but once in threescore yeares, were more likely to liue chastly afterward, then if they had beene married fower or fiue times: yet for the honour and reuerence (as I take it) of M. <hi>Caluins</hi> name, hee doth not once make mention of him. You will say, this is a slender meruaile. M. <hi>Caluin</hi> was his frend, and therefore he named him not. Indeede, that is the manner of the world. Men are oft fauoured: as they are frended. But it is pitty, that the auncient Fathers haue no more friendship, with <hi>Beza.</hi> For, that is the point I meruaile at. Heare him how he commeth ouer them, or rather how he descrediteth himselfe. <hi>Hac in re sanè &amp;c. In this thinge surely, I do not easely agree to the auncient fathers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially the latine writers.</hi> And againe: <hi>If any man shall oppose
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:775:115"/>
against my exposition, the authority of certayne of the aunciente fathers: ad verbum dei prouoco, I doe appeale to the word of God, and I desire, that the reasons, which I haue broughte for it; may be refelled.</hi> How crancke hee is with the auncient fathers? but not a word of M. <hi>Caluin.</hi> And his reason (as I take it) was this: bicause <hi>M. Caluins</hi> authority seruinge him much better, for the credite of diuers Disciplinary positions, then all the auncient fathers doe: hee is more desirous for the continuance of his reputation, then of all theirs. A fourth matter there is also, concerning these widdowes, which is of the greatest importance: and is yet no better agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then as you haue heard of the rest. Be it, that in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times there were such widdowes, as they affecte: yet the question is; whether it be necessary, that now there should bee such church-officers, or new colleges of wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, set vp in euery parish, to looke to the poore that be sicke or not? Some of their proctors, doe wauer much, in this point: some are resolute for them, &amp; some are as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute (to my vnderstanding) against them. First (I pray you) let M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> speak his pleasure.<note place="margin">T.C. l. 1. p. 190</note> 
               <hi>Saint Paule recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vp all the ordinary and perpetuall offices of the Church; of the Doctor, of the Pastor, of the Deacon, of the Elder, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not out so much as the Widdow.</hi> Againe. <hi>Now there is not so great vse of these widdowes with vs &amp;c. Part of the necessity (why they were first founded) grew both by the multitude of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers &amp;c. and by the great heat of those East countries, wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the washing and supplinge of feete, was required.</hi> Againe: <hi>For asmuch as there are poore, which are sicke in euery church: I doe not see a better order can bee deuised &amp;c. if there can bee any widdowes gotten.</hi> And againe. <hi>I conclude, that (if such may bee gotten) we ought to kepe that order in the church.</hi> In good time. It is a very substantiall conclusion.</p>
            <p>And is he come to this: <hi>If such can be gotten?</hi> Hath God
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:775:115"/>
appointed such officers to be in euery parishe, as cannot be gotten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He told vs before in the behalfe of his Elders, (as you shall heare againe the thirde time) <hi>that when men are called to a lawfull and profitable calling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">T.C. l. 1. p. 180</note> 
               <hi>and especially to a publicke calling, God doth powre his giftes on that person (which is called) so plentifully, that he is, as it were, soddainely made a new man.</hi> Whereuppon he inferreth, that doe but once make choice of such Elders, as he doth after: and God will by and by make them fitte persons to execute their offices. And may wee not then also affirme, by the Analogy of the same doctrine: that when God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth an ordinary and perpetuall office in his Church, he doth also prouide, either ordinarily or extraordinarily, that there shall be alwaies some to vndertake it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue haue his Elders aboue his Widdowes, that God hauing appointed them both alike, to beare a continuall office in his Church: the one sort should be so miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouided for, euen vppon the soddaine, and the other be suffered so farre to weare out, as that they cannot bee gotten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> May it not be as truely saide, sette vp the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in euery parishe, and God will prouide Widdowes: as set it so vp in the most Clownish parish in <hi>England,</hi> and God wil presently by inspiration, make the poor husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Carters, Thatchers and Dawbers, newly chosen to be Elders, such meet and able men, to gouern the church: as the keies of the kingdom of Heauen, may be safely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into their hands?</p>
            <p>Whether through these and such like other conceites, or vpon what grounds els I know not: but there is a second sorte of Disciplinary Widdowistes, that are very farre growen past <hi>Cartwrights, Ifs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fenner.</note> One that writeth <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the godlye Ministers,</hi> (as hee intituleth them,)
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:775:116"/>
hath in that Treatise, framed tenne argumentes of a wonderfull power, as many haue supposed. Wherein hee al'wayes comprehendeth the widdowes: &amp; nameth them as necessary partes of the forme of that Church-gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which Christ and his Apostles haue appointed to be <hi>the ordinary and perpetuall platforme</hi> for the guiding and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerninge of the Church, vntill the ende of the world: and maketh them, (by such force as his argumentes haue,) as necessary, for the ordinary continuance of them, as eyther Pastor, Doctor, Elders, or men Deacons. The learned dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser likewise agreeth with this Defence-maker; where hauing spoken of Widdowes, amongst the rest of their Church-officers: and of all their offices: he saith, that <hi>bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing instituted by the spirite of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Learned disc. pag. 104.</note> 
               <hi>for the necessary vse of the Church, which vse still continueth, they ought also to be retayned amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ngst vs.</hi> I may not here also omit the author of the <hi>Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sermon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fruitfull Serm. pa. 39.</note> who expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth so pretily, the similitude which <hi>S. Paul</hi> vseth of that mysticall body, whereof (as I take it) Christ is the head: that he excludeth the whole Church, from being any members of it, except they bee eyther Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, Doctors, Elders, Deacons, or Widdowes. <hi>A member</hi> (saith he) <hi>is such a parte of the bodye,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> as hath receiued from the head, some particular and necessary guifte, to helpe and benefite the whole body, and euery member therof.</hi> And so he reckoneth vs his members, as I haue sayd. His meaning therein is this, (as I thinke,) that the rest of the body, is but as it were a rude lumpe, which is to bee framed and fashioned, by the sayd members: by euery one, according to the office of it. And after for the necessity, vz. that euery one of his sayde members, <hi>no moe, no fewer, should allwayes continue in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>: he vseth these woordes, <hi>If nature lacke any one member, be it neuer so base,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid pag. 40.</note> 
               <hi>if it bee but one toe, shee is sorry, shee is
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:775:116"/>
grieued, she lamenteth, shee iudgeth her selfe maimed, yea shee would redeeme it with the perill of loosinge the rest, such is her loue and desire, to appear in her beauty &amp; perfection.</hi> As though he should haue said, that he and his fellowes are so far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with the desire of their Eldershippes; that rather then they will misse their Widdowes, euen the meanest members of it, they care not to hazard the being of the whole Church.</p>
            <p>Vnto this fruictfull sermoner mentioned:<note place="margin">Defence. pag. 135.</note> I will adde one of <hi>Fenners</hi> inuincible arguments, because it enforceth the sayd similitude of the members of the body so syllogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically. <hi>Whatsoeuer officers are ordinary me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the Church: are sette into the same of God for ordinary &amp;c perpetuall dueties, with ordinary and perpetuall giftes, wherein they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to abide, and wherewith the Church is commaunded to bee content: Those are ordinary perpetuall and the best, for no man may remoue the members of Christs body, hauing ordinary giftes and actions for the perpetuall vse of the body. But these of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Pastors, Elders, Deacons, Church-seruants, are ordinarye members of the Church: are set into the same of God, for ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duties of teaching, exhorting, ruling, prouision for the poore, and attendance vnto them: all which no man in his wits wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be perpetuall, and in these, expressely they which haue the giftes, are commaunded to abide, and to content themselues with them: Wherefore &amp;c.</hi> These men you see, must either haue their Widdowes, or else all is marred. And haue them they will, if distinguishing, similitudes, diuiding, sillogismes, and logicke, will get them. And besides you may perceiue what most vehement, patheticall, and peremptory men they are, in this behalfe.</p>
            <p>Howbeit you shall finde that other men, nay whole Churches (for all this heat) are of another opinion: and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:775:117"/>
withall, such men and Churches, as neither the defender, discourser, nor sermoner, nor all the priuate disciplinarye conuenticles in <hi>England,</hi> will presume in any sort to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themselues vnto them. Maister <hi>Beza</hi> doth not thinke the hauing of Widdowes, to be such an ordinary and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall institution, as it hath beene pretended. For at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi> not such a Widdow, if you would giue a pounde for her. And yet that platforme is either perfect by this time: or else there hanges some curse ouer it. But this I am sure of: that he who durst take vppon him, to tell them in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi> that by their omission of these Widdowes, they haue cruelly wounded the body of Christ: they had like despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ruffians, cut of one of his members: and that in these respectes, the forme of their Disciplinary regiment, is mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and deformed: might peraduenture repente him of it. Indeede either I am very much deceiued, or els this dreame of widdowes beginneth to vanish. The very principall, nay the onely place, vz. <hi>Hee that sheweth mercy with cheerefullnesse,</hi> wherevpon they haue hitherto builte, to proue them to be such Church-officers, as they haue i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined them to be: is boldly, and with mayne strength wrested out of their handes: notwithstandinge that Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Caluin, M. Beza,</hi> and <hi>M. Cartwright,</hi> had layde as fast hold vpon it, as they could. Or peraduenture I might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther say, that the two which bee aliue, seeing their tenure was nought, haue willingly giuen it ouer. The Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion I meane, that hath done this great deede, is Maister <hi>Trauers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">De disci.

            <p>But you must remember, that I doe referre you to his Latine booke: and not to the Englishe translation of it. Why? some may say: is it not faithfully translated? Shall we thinke that such zealous men, as had to deale therein, would serue vs as the <hi>Iesuites</hi> doe? It is, wee know, a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, with that false hypocriticall broode, to leaue out and thrust in, what they list into the writinges of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers: that thereby in time, nothing might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, which shoulde any way make against them. But wee will neuer suspect nor belieue, that any man who fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God: and least of all, that any of that sorte, which are so earnest against all abuses and corruptions, shoulde play vs such a prancke. Surely yee doe well to iudge the best: and I my selfe was of your opinion. But nowe I am cleane altered. How were some of <hi>Vrsinus</hi> workes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at <hi>Cambridge?</hi> And it is true that some other Bookes haue beene handled very strangely else-where. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the present point, this is the trueth. The tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator of <hi>Trauerses</hi> Booke, hath quite omitted the wordes which I haue alleadged: and all the rest that tendeth to that purpose, euen seuenteene lines together. So as if you see but the <hi>Englishe</hi> Booke, you shall not finde so much as one steppe, whereby you might suspect, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Maister <hi>Trauerse</hi> hadde carried so harde a hande ouer the pretended Widdowes. If the translator had recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any Commission from the author to haue dealt in that sorte with his Booke: yet it shoulde haue beene signified eyther in some Preface or in some note, or by some means or other: but to leaue such a matter out, and to giue no generall warning of it, I tell you plainely it was greate
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:775:118"/>
dishonesty and lewdenesse. It were better for them to giue ouer their platformes in the plaine field: then to seeke to maintaine them with such apparaunt falshoods.</p>
            <p>Well, let them take their course, and yet all theyr sleightes will not preuaile. But the Translator or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, or peruser, one or moe, or how many soeuer: they were but all of them sottes: if they thought by such their corruption, to bolster vp the credite of theyr Widdowe Church-gouernours. For it is euident (in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that eyther most of their owne men, doe beginne to come to Maister <hi>Trauerses</hi> opinion before mentioned, or else that generally it is helde by them, that the first or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of Widdowes, was but for a time, &amp; neuer meant to be an ordinary, and perpetuall institution to continue for euer.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Geneua</hi> (as I saide) there are no such Widdowes. <hi>Scotlande</hi> in their approued Booke after the <hi>Geneua</hi> fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth not once thinke of them. The <hi>Synodicall</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, for the Presbyteriall platforme of all the <hi>French</hi> Churches, doe make no mention of them. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell of <hi>Hage,</hi> and so all the Low Countries, haue wholly forgotten them in their decrees and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. In the platforme, and newe Communion Booke, which was offered once or twise to the high Courte of Parliament in <hi>Englande,</hi> (concerning these Widdowes) there is nothing but silence. Whereas also there hath beene great paines taken of later yeares, amongest the Disciplinary brotherhoode, and many meetinges, and Synodes helde, about another more particular draught of Discipline, for this Realme, till at the last they haue subscribed vnto it, to bee a necessary platforme for all places and times: yet you shall not finde, that they
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:775:118"/>
haue spoken, so much as one word, of those Widdowes. Whereuppon I conclude, that their cause is desperate: and so I leaue, both them and their patrons, with all their contrarieties, vncertainties, and wranglings about them: and will come to the consideration of another materiall point: vz. what charge this Consistoriall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise doth bring with it, to euerie parish.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the common account of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinarie deuises: there are diuers ecclesiasticall persons to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in euerie Parish.

But admit of the Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Senate in euery parish:<note place="margin">Pag. 131.</note> and then consider howe they shall bee charged. First the current assertion is; <hi>That in euerye Congregation there must bee a Pastor</hi>: but the learned Discourser sayth; there should bee two at the least. Then they must haue a Doctor. And for Elders, they maie bee moe or fewer: as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite of the Parish is. Except Maister <hi>Bezaes</hi> collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prooue to bee authenticall: and then their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber will bee greate. You haue hearde that wee must haue the forme, of the <hi>Iewes</hi> Sanedrim or Counsell in euerie Parish. And in that (sayth <hi>Beza</hi>) there were twentie foure Ecclesiasticall Iudges. By which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:775:119"/>
abating the Pastor and the Doctor: there ought to bee two and twentie Elders in euerie parish. You shall heare <hi>Bezaos</hi> wordes, and how heegathereth that there was such a number.</p>
            <p>There is mention made in the Apoca. of a throne: vppon the which Christ sitteth,<note place="margin">Apoca. 4.</note> and of the foure and twenty Seates about it, whereupon foure &amp; twentie El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders sate: who were cloathed in white rayment, and had on their heades Crownes of golde.<note place="margin">Beza: cont: E-rast. lib. script.</note> Now sayth <hi>Beza</hi> (concerning the said number mentioned of ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Iudges) 24. <hi>numero fuisse &amp;c, That they were in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 24. that is to saie, two of euery Tribe, it seemeth it may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the Apocalyps: where certum est, it is certaine, that those heauenly visions were framed or accommotated to the forme of the Israeliticall Church.</hi> Where by the way, it would be obserued; what a glorious church-regeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we are in time to looke for. Our Elderships must be framed, after the fashion of the Elderships which were amongst the <hi>Iewes.</hi> And if we doubt of the state and forme of the <hi>Iewes</hi> elderships; we must haue recourse to the Apocalips, where the glorie of Christ &amp; his Saints in the kingdome of heauen is set forth. And agreeablie to those heauenly thrones; we must set vp thrones for our 24. Elders in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parish. For this <hi>Beza</hi> is certaine of, that the heauenlye visions in the Apocalyps, were agreable to the forme of the ecclesiasticall regiment in <hi>Israell.</hi> But as touching the number of his elders: he is not as yet, for any thing I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, so throughly resolued. And therefore we are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie till wee heare to the contrary from him: to place moe or fewer in euery parish as we list.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Geneua</hi> they haue but 12. Elders.<note place="margin">Knox of elect of Elders.</note> And they either haue; or had once in <hi>Edenburgh</hi>: as many. Likewise, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

For the ministers of the worde there was neuer doubt made amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that they ought to haue their maintenaunce of the parish: and so likewise must the poore widdows. But as touching the rest, there hath been made some questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It was a good deuise of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>za,</hi> that princes &amp; nobleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might be elders: &amp; so was it of our learned Discourser that the worshipfull gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery parish might be chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Deacons. The rby indeed the parishes might saue charges. For if they be able to liue of themselues: then they must not burden the parish (in <hi>Cartwrightes</hi> opinion) but serue vpon their own charges. The Elders at <hi>Geneua,</hi> (being all of them states-men, I meane such as be of their Senates; men conueniently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to liue of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues) haue no allowance for any thing that I can find. But where the Elders are poore men, so as their attending vpon their offices, might greatly hinder them;<note place="margin">T.C. Lib. 1. pag. 187.</note> then M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> hath decided the question, &amp; affirmeth by S. <hi>Paules</hi> Rule (as he saith) <hi>that they ought to bee plentifully maintained by the Church.</hi> How far this word <hi>plentifully</hi> will be extended; I know not. But a man may gesse. The humble motioner would haue the Pastor and Teacher in euerye parish, to haue allowed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two hundred pounds yearly: in chiefer places more,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:775:120"/>
and in none lesse then two hundred markes. By which rate I imagine that their Elders (being so great men by their office and the gouernors of the parish) cannot well be alowed vnder fortie pound a peece yearely. The dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons that carrie the purse (if they be not well looked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) will bee their owne caruers: but surely their stipend will be for euerie one of them aboue fortie markes. As for the Widdowes they cannot well liue to attende the sicke and wash the Saincts feete: with lesse: then twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie nobles a yeare, how many of them so euer they are. All which summes, being cast together: will prooue a rancke charge, to be imposed vpon euery parish. But yet this is not all. For how shall the pastors &amp; doctors wiues and children liue: when their husbands and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are deade? This is also foreseene. <hi>Prouision must be made not only for the ministers sustentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> during their liues, but also for their wiues and children after them. For we iudge it a thing most contrarious to reason,</hi>

               <hi>godlines &amp; equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that the widow and children of him, who in his life time did faithfully serue the church of God, should after his death bee left comfortles of all prouision.</hi> In what sort, these widdows are to bee relieued: I finde not anye particulars of it. But they maie not bee, of the number, of the Church officers; except they be threescore yeares of age, or haue some priuileges by their late husbands for those roomes. And as touching the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ministers, this order is re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quired for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>

when they come to maturity of yeares, at the discretion of the Church &amp;c.</hi> Not at the peoples discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who must bear the charge: but as it shall please their Elderships to taxe them.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, and besides the officers and charges mentioned:<note place="margin">Disc. sacra.</note> it is also ordered by the new Booke of our <hi>Englishe</hi> Discipline, that <hi>there ought to be in euery parishe, a Colledge or certaine number of young Diuines: such as are meet for the exercises to Diuinity, and especially to expound the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: whereby they may bee trained vp by preaching. And all these must be likewise maintained, diuitum liberalitate, by the liberality of the richer.</hi> Here you see is charge vppon charge. But indeede it were a notable matter, to haue a Colledge of young Prophets in euerie parishe. In the Vniuersities there are Schooles, for reading of Lectures and for disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: but (as our platformers tell vs) these their parish Schooles of Diuinitie, are chiefly for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. They must preach priuatly amongst themselues by course: and hauing an auncienter Diuine with them, (I suppose it will fall to the Pastors lotte,) they are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to confer of the faultes or defects, which are found in the young preacher, and to tell him of them, that he may amend them. Certainely if these men had beene suffered to haue runne on foreward, I feare they would haue runne madde. What speculations be these? All their Elders must be such men, as Sainct <hi>Paul</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a Bishop to be: they must be able to preach in their Consistories, and priuately. And now you must haue in euery parish diuerse young men, such as are meet for the exercises of Diuinity before they be admitted. And where will they haue all these? It was precisely saide of Maister <hi>Cartwright,</hi> vz. thus in effect: Neuer let that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:775:121"/>
you: set vp the Eldership, choose your Elders, &amp;c. &amp; God wil make them fit for their charges vpon a soddain. It had been verie prouidentlie handled of him, if he had likewise taught the people, that they should neuer haue sticked for anie cost, which they were to bestow for the maintenance of the said Church-officers, though they should bee twise as many: because in bestowing their goods after that sorte, God will make them rich and fill their tubbes, their oile bottles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their barns and their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vpon the soddaine.</p>
            <p>It was but a simple suite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made by the author of the complaint of the comminalty:<note place="margin">Complaint of the commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty.</note> 
               <hi>that as the Papistes builte Seminaries to aduaunce the kingdome of the Diuell: so there might be more Colledges, and Seminaries of true Religion erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> For now you see, it is appointed: that there shalbe such a Seminarie in euery parish. And how the coiners of this deuise, did euer grow into anie such conceite: I cannot certainelie gesse, except it bee, because there is such a kinde of Schoole or Seminarie in <hi>Geneua.</hi> Indeed when the State there had seazed vppon the Church-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges: they erected a Schoole with some small allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, according as our <hi>English</hi> prouerbe runneth, of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away a goose and sticking down a feather. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which they haue by the one, exceedeth far the charge of the other. If now our men could inuent such a way for euery parish: peraduenture they might bee heard. They talke indeede of a matter, how to haue their Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships with all the appertenannces thereunto belonging,<note place="margin">Humble moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Complaint Trauersi dis. Eccles. The learned discourse.</note> and yet not greatly to ouercharge any parishes.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:775:121"/>
and rather then faile all the Abbaie landes, and such thinges as did belong to all the rest of the houses of Religion. If any parish in <hi>England</hi> should aske my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, whether I thought they might safely enter into such a present charge for the maintenance of so many Pastor, Doctor, Elders, Deacons, Widdowes, Ministers wiues, their children, and poor Students of Diuinities in hope that all the saide Church-liuings should be bestowed for their ease, vpon such their Church officers: I should say vnto them (if I spake my conscience) that I my selfe am far from anie such cogitation. No, no, for al the outcries that the Disciplinarians make (as in the next chapter you shall perceiue:) that all the Church-liuings, might bee emploide to the maintenaunce of them and their Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships: well they may procure in some other age, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impouerishing of the Church, but they shall be sure to be little the better for it.</p>

him alledged, of making a crooked sticke to be straight: but it is not to be allowed of in anie sort, in the course of Diuinitie. There it is reckned a point of great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, (and so it is also with the prophane writers,) to run from one extremitie to another. Manie examples I could bring of this weakenes: as how in manie places, men haue leapt from auricular confession, to the contempt of all priuate conference with their Pastor: from pharifai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call long praiers, vppon a paire of beades, three or foure times said ouer by tale, at one time, to little praier at all, two or three words, (if so manie) and farewel: (agreable to mens consciences, euen as the Prouerb faith.

Manie other such examples I might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of running from one mischiefe to another: but there is none fitter then of the course which hath beene held, in this verie matter, whereof I intreate.</p>
            <p>In times past, men thought they could not giue too much to the church, but now many suppose, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not take too much fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church. In times past there was so much giuen to the church, that the k. of <hi>England</hi> was fain to make a lawe for the staie of so great liberality,<note place="margin">Exod. 36.</note> (as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> did when there was sufficient prouision made for the building of the temple): but now mens harts are grown to such a contrary extremitie, and are so far from incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any danger in breaking that law for restraining the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as notwithstanding her most excellent M. hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued &amp; made her self, very many notable laws, that the church might keepe that which other men hath giuen her, and for the binding of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to pay their duties to the Church: yet euerie man seeth how vnder pretence of conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:775:122"/>
and by many other meanes the Church-goods are thirsted after, and how the poore ministers are most pittifully defrauded in the paiment of such duties, as do belong vnto them. Insomuch (by report) as now in son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie places, if they shal but seek or sue to haue their own: either they are greatlie misliked, or presentlie are indited for common Barators: or if they escape that, out flieth a prohibition from one place, a sequestration fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, and I know not what else, nor from whence.</p>
            <p>And the cause of these &amp; many other such extremities, I doe not impute so much vnto the laitie, as to sundrie men of the Clergie: whose proceedings haue ben great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by extremities. It was an extremitie, when <hi>Wickliffe</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that tithes (appointed by God himselfe) were <hi>merae eleemosynae, meere almes.</hi> But of all extremities, that passeth, where some now a daies would haue all taken from the Church, that so Ministers might liue, as they did in the Apostles times; that is, onelie vppon volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie contributions. And this they thinke, to be a part of the Apostolicall reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they seek for. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I (for my part) might peraduenture yeelde, if the laitie would be sworne before they tooke that from vs, which we haue alreadie: to deale with vs indeed for our prouision and maintenaunce, as preachers were dealt with all in the Apostles times.</p>
            <p>I know, what will here be aunswered. When wee see that you that be Ministers, are become such men as the Apostles were, we will vse you as they were vsed. What? will ye persecute vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No, we will bring that which wee haue, and laie it at your feete. I beshrew my heart if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue you. But if I did, the matter were not great. For there neuer were such men, nor euer shall be to the end
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:775:123"/>
of the world, as the Apostles were. So as where they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their liberalitie with that caution: it is asmuch as if they should saie: we would be glad to finger that which you haue, and then get more as you could. Nay it smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth surely of a greater prophanation. For your ministers do teach you now the same doctrine: that the Apostles taught. And would you desire more? Doe you look for it at their hands, that they should worke miracles? Is your pretended great zeale come to this, that now you haue neede of miracles?</p>
            <p>If anie man thinke I fight against mine own shadowe, and that there are none so wickedlie bent, as to wishe an vtter spoile of the Church: he is to be aduertised that M. <hi>Barrow,</hi>

Indeed the other sort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistorial reformers, are growen to be wiser. For a while, it is true, that manie of them dreamed of such a matter. They talked, how much of the church liuings, might be emploide this waie, and how much that waie. Tithes were Popish toies:<note place="margin">Humble mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion p. 100.&amp;c</note> yet laie men might haue them, and Ministers should be paide out of the Exchequor.

            <p>When reformation of Religion was first vrged, it was thought such an effectual motiue, as would procure attention, vz. to intitle Princes after a sort to the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goods. The learned men perswaded themselues, that if by anie pollicie they could ouerthrow poperie, it would be afterwardes a verie easie matter to recouer them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. If error and superstition had beene so beneficiall to the Church, they nothing doubted, but that truth and sinceritie would bring forth at the least as plentifull fruictes. Besides, they did not so yeelde ouer their right in those matters to Princes: but it was done with diuers cautions and prouisoes, by vertue whereof they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in time, to recouer all againe into their own handes. But it is not good to dallie with Princes. Indeede they plaide, <hi>warye beguile themselues:</hi> which since hath won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfullie mooued them. And now they (all of them in a manner) doe runne vppon this ground, vz. that Kinges and Princes are bound by the word of God to restore to the Church such goods, as heretofore they haue taken from her: and generally that nothing once separated from a common vse, and bestowed vppon the Church, may be afterwards alienated to anie other vse.</p>

            <p>And againe, the same maister <hi>Caluin</hi> in another epistle to <hi>Viretus</hi>: doth signifie vnto him, how he dealt with the magistrates of <hi>Geneua,</hi> at one especiall time, when there was speach about certaine stipends. <hi>When I sawe howe hard they were in that matter, acriter aurem illis vellicaui &amp;c.

               <hi>and men: Papam fuisse furem et sacrilegum, videndum ne simus successores, that the Pope was a thiefe and a church robber, and they were to looke to it, that they proued not his successors. I did vse a preface, that might cause attention:</hi> vz. <hi>That the woundes of a friend were
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:775:125"/>
better &amp;c. and that they should not seeke any Balaam, qui il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis in maledictione benediceret, who in their cursed estate should blesse them.</hi> Hitherto maister <hi>Caluin</hi>; whose wordes I haue set down at large: that you might the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, the estate of the most worthy Reformation of the church of <hi>Geneua</hi>: and how the discipline being there in her full prime and brightnes, it is not possible that anye grosse enormities should continue in that Citie. Indeed it is much, and I meruaile how it is endured, that maister <hi>Caluin</hi> should resemble the magistrates of <hi>Geneua,</hi> to such cruell, tyrannouse, and sacrilegious persons, <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> the Emperor, and the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> But most of all I wonder that maister <hi>Beza</hi> would publish such letters in print. Being but written to priuate men: the matter could not be great. Marry now they are thus offred to all posteritie: the testimonie of such tyrannous sacrilege will be euer had in memorie. For which kind of dealing: they are much beholden to <hi>Beza.</hi> It was indeed, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of him politickly. Of likelyhood the sacrilege men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned doth continue there still. But he being a proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man, thought it better that maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> being dead should tell them of it; then he himselfe being aliue, and therefore subiect vnto their displeasures. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise maister <hi>Beza</hi> for his parte, is as earnest against sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, as euer maister <hi>Caluin</hi> was: and it may be for ought I do know, or remember to the contrarie, that hee hath dealt himselfe as roundly with them. But sure I am of his iudgement: which doth appeare in his treatise of his three sortes of Bishops,<note place="margin">Beza.</note> where this question being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto him: vz. <hi>Whether these thinges which had beene once vowed to holy vses, might afterwardes bee otherwise employed:</hi> he maketh this answere: <hi>Concerning the goodes</hi>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:775:126"/>
               <hi>of the Church: first of all we suppose great heed ought to be taken, that none doth staine himselfe with handling the church goods. For if God hath taken reuenge of such sacrilege, euen amongst the very Idolaters, what trow we will his iudgement bee against them which haue spoyled his Church: and haue prophaned the thinges which were set a part for his true worship. Moreouer it is euident, that this turneth greatly to the reproch of the name of God, and of his holy gospell: as though for sooth papistrie hath beene abandoned not for the loue of the truth, but to robbe the Church of her goodes: as though new theeues haue entred into the roomes of the olde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. Viretus</hi> in like manner, for his earnestnes in this pointe,<note place="margin">Viret 3. dial. of white diucles.</note> is neither short of <hi>Caluin</hi> not <hi>Beza. The lesse authoritie that the ministerye and ministers haue: the greater libertie haue sacrilegers, theeues, extortioners, and other wicked ones.</hi> Againe, <hi>I know many which liked the gospell well, when in the beginning their preachers cryed against the abuse, that they sayd was in the Romish church, and in priests and monkes. They liked well also that the goods of the Church should be taken from Priests and Monkes, to haue the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them themselues, vnder colour that the Priests and Monkes abused them, and that they should be put to better vse: but God knoweth how euill they are bestowed vppon manye, and in many places. The worst is, that those which haue not done herein as they ought, and which dayly forget themselues more &amp; more, cannot now a dayes so much as suffer the preachers to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish &amp; reproue them, &amp; to stir the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp to bestow it where they ought to bestow it, according to the order &amp; discipline &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ibidem.</note> And in another place. <hi>These fellowes</hi> (that will not restore the church-liuings) <hi>may be likened to those Diuils, which cry: why art thou come to torment vs before our time? And the same fellowes also say: Qui nostra tollit, inimicus est: hee that taketh awaye ours, is our enemie. They regard not whether
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:775:126"/>
they haue gotten the goods, that they possesse, well or euill: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they esteeme all those to bee enemies, that in reason de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde restitution of them, and declare that it belongeth not vnto them, but that they haue stollen it awaye from the Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ibidem</note> Likewise <hi>afterwardes: I doubt not, but if they were called to account, for the bestowing of such goods: and if it were taken out of their handes, as it was taken from Priestes and Monkes,<note place="margin">ibidem</note> and giuen to such as should better bestowe it: they would take pepper in the nose, &amp; fall to playing the Diuels part.</hi> Lastlye, <hi>I put the case</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that a whorehunter or baude steale an honest mans wife, and the husbande commeth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth this wise of this russia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that hath stollen her away: and reuileth this Russian or Baude, for the wronge that he hath done him, and goeth to lawe with him, whereby there ariseth great strife: I would aske of thee, who were in the fault? Eyther the husband, who hath had this wronge: or the Rauisher who hath played him this wicked pranke?</hi> And the answere is thus framed: <hi>The whorehunter or baude, hath as much reason to complaine and bee angrie, as hath a theife or robber: which is called to account of thefts and robberies, which hee hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and which is called to iudgement for the same.</hi>

I could shew some reasons of this my perswasion, but I am a man not verie grateful to that sort of reformers. I will therefore spare that paines, and the rather, because their own maisters hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This onelie I will adde, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to their discretions, to be considered off at their leasures. There was neuer anie nation so barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but it thought there was a God. Againe, there was neuer any nation that thought there was a God, but it likewise acknoledged, that the same God had his priests to teach the people his will. Againe there were neuer as yet (to my knowledge) anie men in the world, but belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing there was a God, and acknowledging his Priestes, they haue alwaies either in truth, or at the least in shew, depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon their priests instructions, as touching the wil &amp; seruice of God. Which points being true, I would gladlie know, of anie Sacrilegious Disciplinarian, what sort of Priests they are, whose aduise he followeth. Some he must needs follow, except he will professe himselfe to be in the number of those, that say in their harts there is no God. Doth he follow the Priests of the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? why,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:775:129"/>
they euer thought that it was vnlawfull for anie man to spoil his God. Doth he follow the Popish Priests? There are no men (surelie) that crie out more earnestly against Sacriledge. Doth he follow the councell of any Priestes which haue embraced the Gospell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No Priest that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God will teach him so. Some Priests in this latter age haue beene mistaken. But if anie did euer teach so, he may perceaue, by that which I haue said, that they haue repented them of it.</p>
            <p>For nowe they tell all, who will be their schollers, that they may not indeuour to alienate the church-liuinges from the ministerie. Or if they will needes, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of zeale and shewe of religion, seeke to deuoure Christes patrimony; then they doe vtterfly disclaime &amp; renounce them, from being of their Disciples any lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Zuickius</hi> assureth them: that they are but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall christians. <hi>Caluin</hi> compareth them, (be they the Magistrates of <hi>Geneua,</hi> or of anie other countrie) to cruel tyraunts, and saith, they are the Popes successors in theft and robberie. Beza is resolute, that God will be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of such persons, &amp; telleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they are new theeues, that haue entred in place of the old theeues. <hi>Viretus</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them wors then friers &amp; monks: &amp; resembleth them to white diuels. <hi>Trauers</hi> saith in effect, that they are christs mortall enemies, and would crucifie him againe, for his coate, if they might laie their hands on him. <hi>Cartwright</hi> calleth them cormorants, and likeneth them to <hi>Iudas</hi> the Traitor: certifying them, that in spoiling of the Church, they purchase to themselues a field of blood. The whole comminaltie of <hi>England,</hi> complaineth and crieth against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that they hate Christ, that they defraud God of his glorie, that they are (all the sort of them) no better then

               <hi>Achan, Nabuchadnezar, Baltasar, Ananias</hi> or <hi>Saphira:</hi> that the punishment which did light vpon these church rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, shall light vppon them, either in this life, or in the world to come: and that they are to be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those vniust persons, that shall neuer enter into the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>So as this is the point, which (as I said) I doe commit vnto the inward cogitations of all prophane Church-robbers, vz. to thinke with themselues, what God they serue, and what Priests they are, that teach them suche lewd doctrine: or if none teach them so, whether in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king so execrable a course of their own heads, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne not themselues in their own consciences. There is here no refuge for anie such persons, that I knowe of, or anie replie to be made against the premises.

when for our sinnes it shall, manie mischiefes and great confusion will follow it. The Church-liuings, will serue but a few mens turnes.

               </hi> I might saie rather with Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> and <hi>Saunders:</hi> if he bee the author of the Booke intituled, <hi>Vindicie contra Tyrannos:</hi> as it was reported. For there hee saith that if anie <hi>Prince shall challenge to himselfe both Tributes</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">pag. 18.</note> authoritie aswell in Ecclesiasticall causes as ciuile: as by the circumstances of the place it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) <hi>hee doth, as if hee would (like the old Giaunts) scale hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and surprise it, and is guiltie of treason: and doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by forfeite his fee, that hee holdeth no lesse than a subiect or vassall shall, that vsurpeth the kinges royaltyes: and in this respect such kinges are very often depriued thereof, much more iustlye, then a vassall or subiecte maye bee: insomuch as there is some proportion of comparison betwixte a vassall or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and his Lorde: but betwixt God and the king, betwixt a wretched man and the Almightie, there can bee no proportion at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, <hi>Cartwright</hi> and some others with him do affirme,<note place="margin">T.C. lib. 2. pag. 411.&amp;c.</note> that <hi>Kings and princes do holde their kingdomes and dominions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Def. of ecclesi. diset 167.</note>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:775:133"/>
maintaine and defende it. And secondlye, that as God hath appoynted all Kinges, and Ciuile Magistrates his immediate Lieutenants for the gouernment of the worlde in temporall causes: so Christ, as hee is media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and gouernour of his Church, hath his immediate officers to rule in the Church vnder him; and those they saie are no other, then Pastors, Doctors, and Elders, to whom they ascribe as large authoritie in causes Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall.</p>
            <p>And all this (as I take it) they haue learned of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. For whereas maister <hi>Harding</hi> saith, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a King in it selfe is all one, euerie where: not onely amongst the Christian Princes, but also amonge the Heathen; and thereuppon concludeth; that a christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Prince, hath no more to doe in the deciding of church-matters; or in making ceremonies and orders for the Church, then a Heathen: <hi>Cartwright,</hi> alloweth of his iudgement,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. pag. 162. 163:</note> and doth expresly affirme: that hee himselfe is of the same opinion,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. pag. 147.</note> professing <hi>his mislike of those, who teach another right of a Christian and of a prophane magistrate.</hi> Whereat <hi>Trauerse</hi> his scholler aymeth in like sorte: when hee saith in effect: that <hi>heathen princes being conuerted to the fayth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Disc. of eccle. disc. pag. 148. 174.</note> 
               <hi>receiue no further increase of theyr power, whereby they maye deale in causes ecclesiasticall, then they had before.</hi> And lastly, it is no lesse agreeable vnto their seconde assertion: that whereas the Papists saye, the Pope with his Cardinalls and Bishops are a true representation of the Catholicke Church of Christ, vnder whom the Pope (being <hi>Peters</hi> supposed Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor) is the ministeriall and immediate chiefe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it here vppon earth: now <hi>Cartwright</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe affirme; that euerye particular parish ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

            <p>Hitherto then concerning all these puritane-popish as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertious (so much derogating from the lawfull authoritie of Christian princes.) There is but only this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

them &amp; the rankest Iesuits in Europe, that what the one sort, ascribe to the Pope and his shauelings: the other do challenge to themselues and their Aldermen. Vpon which occasion <hi>Cartvvright,</hi>

               <hi>vvhich vve doe not.</hi> It is reason in deed, you should not. But if you doe not, what doe these things mean? The author of the second admonition desireth, that he and his companions <hi>may be deliuered by act of Parlement, from the authoritie of the ciuile magistrates,</hi>

               <hi>and not from Christ as he is mediator: and that the authoritie of the svvord is the same ordinance of God, as vvell in heathen princes, as in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>: doth it not follow, that in his iudgement Christian princes haue no authoritie ouer any of their subiects, but only as they are men, and not as they are either Christians or priests?

               <hi>I.B.</hi> doth supplie, and that in proper tearmes, as if it please you to peruse the place, it will appeare vnto you. Besides, there goeth a letter from hand to hand, written by certaine gentlemen of Suffolke, to the Lords of her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties councell, wherein there is great complaint made in the behalfe of certaine of the brotherhood, as a matter fit to bee reformed: <hi>that being ministers they had at their

Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto then, this wall riseth vp but easily, especially if I should adde in this place, the brethren of Scotland, their diuinitie for this matter, when they (not the Papists) gaue the king and state occasion to make it (by act of Parlement 1584) treason,<note place="margin">Acts of par-lement. ca. 2.</note> for any man to refuse to answer before the king, though it were concerning any matter which was ecclesiasticall.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the second part of <hi>Cartvvrights</hi> wall,<note place="margin">T. C. 2.2. p. 164. lin. 29.</note> it is this: <hi>The Papists</hi> (sayth he) <hi>vvill haue the Prince to execute vvhatsoeuer they conclude, be it good or bad: vve say that if there be no lavvfull ministerie (as in time of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie Dauid did eat the shevv bread, vvhich vvas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise lavvfull for the priests only to eat of,) that then the Prince ought to set order: and that vvhen there is a lavvfull ministerie, if it shall agree of any vnlavvfull thing, the Prince ought to stay it.</hi> Surely you are very proper and right liberall sayers. Doth not your admonisher affirme, that if your platforme were once on foot, <hi>all men must stand vnto the determinations of your maiesticall church of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi> (that I may vse maister <hi>VVakes</hi> tearme) <hi>except it should happen in some matter of faith, they should make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees against the vvord of God?</hi> And (I pray you) if any such thing should happen, how could the king reforme it, or (as
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:775:136"/>
you say) stay it? He iudgeth their sayd orders to be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and perceaueth the mischiefes that do depend vpon them: but how shall he redresse and preuent them? Shall he compell the authors of them to assemble themselues together againe, and to retract and condemne all such their decrees? They are of that humor (as experience hath told vs) that it is vnlikely they will be compelled to any thing. No, it were too great a disgrace for them to yeeld in any thing, that once they haue broached, were it good or bad, but especially when it is decreed in any of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull meetings. And besides, if the king should presse them too far in such a matter, he might find them (perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture) but very ticklish subiects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cartvvright,</hi> to shuffle vp some blundering answer to these points,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. p. 167.</note> sayth: <hi>That if in such a case the church mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters should shevv themselues obstinate, and vvould not be aduised by the Prince, they should thereby prooue themselues to be an vnlavvfull ministerie, &amp; that vpon such an occasion the Prince might remooue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Remouethe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? How? By any ordinarie authoritie, which you do allow to the christian magistrats in causes ecclesiasticall? But you haue told vs before your mind herein. In effect, that it must be done by an extraordinarie authoritie, euen by the same right that <hi>Dauid</hi> did eat of the shew-bread, which (were it not in such a case of necessitie) none but the Priests might in any wise eat of. For otherwise (as it is before mentioned) where such a platforme is in execution, as they seeke for, the Prince hath not any thing to doe (by their doctrine, God knoweth) either with placing or displacing of church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</p>
            <p>Or, if <hi>Cartvvright</hi> will say that I wrest his words to the worst construction, and that he meaneth plainely as
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:775:137"/>
purposing thereby to confirme (for his part) her maiesties ordinarie &amp; supreme authoritie in those maner of causes: I am content he make the best of his owne words that he can, whether he meant ordinarie, or extraordinarie autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, so that when he hath done, he will stand vnto it. But let him say, what he is able, yet he hath a woolfe by the eares, and shall neuer be able so to shift his hands, but that it will follow, that both he, and all the pastors, doctors, and elders, that are combined with him, are by his words both obstinate and vnlawfull ministers, except he shall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw this part of his wall, as being to weake to make such a separation from the papists, as he pretendeth.</p>
            <p>For, notwithstanding that the present gouernment of the church of England, is established and confirmed by a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall synod, with the generall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of the whole land, to be a most lawful &amp; godly forme of gouernment, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that her Maiestie doth so thinke of it, and hath shewed herselfe many waies (as by her acts of parleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, her proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, her sundry speeches, yea by the punishing &amp; imprisoning of some certaine persons) vtterly to dislike of their pretended discipline, as being, in her princely iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a meere forgerie, &amp; vaine conceit of busie &amp; restlesse heads, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the word of God, and ancient practise of all the godly churches in the world, for 1500 yeares: all these things I say, notwithstanding, yet they haue rayled, libelled, &amp; raged against the said present gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. They haue, and do still, neglect, as well her maiesties setled iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the vnlawfulnesse of their decreed platforme, as also her lawes, her pleasure, and many commandements, that they should desist hereafter, from that their erronious deuise, and submit themselues quietly to the forme establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Nay, they are so far from yeelding, in this point, to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:775:137"/>
any authoritie of her maiestie; whether ordinarie or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie, as that they haue attempted by very vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and seditious means, to aduance their purposes against her highnesse will, and do plainly giue it out, that they wil not desist, they will not hold their peace, they will haue their desires, though they be driuen to vndertake such means for that end, as will make their hearts to ake, who are their cheese impugners.</p>
            <p>Stand now to your words, maister <hi>Cartvvright,</hi> if you meant plainly, <hi>vz. If the ministerie shall agree of any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavvfull thing, the prince ought to stay it</hi>: and then are not all the packe of you concluded, by your said answer, to be obstinat persons and a false ministerie? If you haue any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in the world, it is this; that whatsoeuer the said natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall councell, the learned mens opinions that do impugne you, the lawes of this realme, all the ancient churches, and her maiestie relying vpon them: whatsoeuer they altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do thinke &amp; iudge to be lawfull: you care not, or you are sory for it, but all that notwithstanding, you are sure, for that you haue decreed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst your selues, <hi>vz.</hi> that you haue not therein erred, and therefore they must all beare with you, though you rest your selues vpon the truth of your own decrees, &amp; giue no place either to councel, law, prince, fathers, learned men, or any other authoritie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, that maketh against you. And will not <hi>H.N.</hi> and <hi>Barovv,</hi> will not al hereticks &amp; schismaticks say as much? where is then the princes authoritie you spake of? For staying such kind of proceeding, what course shall he take? These ministers (as I sayd) conclude vpon their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises. The king considereth of them, and findeth them vnlawfull, but they denie it; what shall hee do? Your refuge, <hi>Cartvvright,</hi> is euerie Heretickes refuge.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:775:138"/>
If her Maiestie, with all the reasons mentioned, cannot stay you and your sect, let neuer any king or ciuile magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat looke by any authoritie, which you do giue vnto them in causes ecclesiasticall, to stay the fancies of any such fellowes. But the substance of all their deuises is nothing, but pretences of things that are not.

For the Papists holding this ground, that their Councels and Popes, in such their decrees and conclusions (as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them to make) cannot erre: that being graunted, it followeth of necessitie, that euery Christian Prince ought to put them in execution, and to punish those that shall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselues against them.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T appeareth in the latter end of the two and twentith chapter, how by a fine distinction, of raigning vnder Christ as he is onely God, and vnder Christ, as he is mediator: they first, would exclude all Christian princes from their lawfull authoritie in causes ecclesiasticall, ascribing no more vnto them, then as if they were heathens, except it be to execute their pleasures, and to maintaine them, which they say, is the dutie also of all the heathen rulers: and secondly how by the same distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they lift vp their own horns, as if it were so many popes, challenging euery one of them together with their elderships, to be Christs immediat vicars for church-causes, vpon earth. In the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of which doctrine although they do all agree, yet when they come to the particular grounds, whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they would gladly lay their foundations of it, there they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, and do confound themselues.

            <p>
               <hi>Cartvvright</hi> bestoweth soure leaues,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. a. p. 410. ad. p. 419.</note> to prooue, that no ciuile magistrat may be called the head of the particular church, within his dominion. And his cheefest reasons are drawn, from the parts of the distinction mentioned. Now, when he laboureth so much vpon this word <hi>head,</hi> hee knoweth that we meane thereby nothing els, but a chiefe authoritie: and he wrangleth of purpose, that whereas his opinion is direct, that no ciuile magistrat (as he is a ciuile magistrat) hath any office in the Church, he might dazle the eies of his reader, as though he could bee content to maintaine the right of the crowne, and did only insist vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word <hi>head.</hi>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:775:140"/>
pawned his iudgement, to backe the motioner in these points. For hee is wholy of the motioners opinion: <hi>Pater non nisi in persona filij manifestati in carne mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum regit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Annot. 10.5.6.22.</note> 
               <hi>God the Father (sayth he) doth not gouerne the vvorld, but onely in the person of his sonne manifested in the flesh.</hi> And agayne: he alloweth of the Fathers where they hold that <hi>Proprie humanae naturae respectu dicitur datum esse filio potestatem coeli ac terrae: vvhen it is sayd that povver is giuen to the sonne, of heauen and earth: it is spoken properly, in respect of his humane nature receaued.</hi> The world is gouerned only by Christ, as he is manifested in the flesh: therefore not onely (as <hi>Cartvvright</hi> sayth) as he is God. The gouernment of the world is committed to the sonne of God, as he is manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in the flesh: therfore (contrary to <hi>Cartvvright</hi>) he hath therein a superior. Christ the sonne of God hath the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of heauen and earth assigned vnto him proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in respect of his humane nature, which he hath recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and therefore not only as he is the sonne of God co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall with the Father, as <hi>Cartvvright</hi> affirmeth.</p>
            <p>So as, whatsoeuer either <hi>Cartvvright, Trauers,</hi> or any of their followers, shal enforce, against the authoritie of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian princes, in respect <hi>vz.</hi> that they with all the heathen gouernors do hold their scepters immediatly vnder christ, as he is God only, and not as he is their mediator: it is all but as vntempered morter, nothing fit for the purpose, as other of their friends do iudge: and (as it seemeth by <hi>Beza</hi> in the place quoted) might peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture (if it were thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed) touch them neerer then they are aware of, as men not fully persuaded of the most high and mighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of the person of Christ Iesus. But let that go, I am glad to heare that christian magistrats may haue somthing
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:775:141"/>
to do vnder Christ, as he is their mediator. And what if it may appeare, that holding their gouernment vnder him, as mediator, they may haue some authoritie also vnder him, as he is the head of the church? I know, that would come quite cam to <hi>Cartvvrights</hi> humor. Neuerthelesse it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that men should be heard.

               <hi>either in heauen or earth, not simplie as hee is God, but as he is Christ, God and man, and so the head of the church.</hi> Let these places of scripture, <hi>Ephesians</hi> 1. vers. 20, 21, 22, 23. and <hi>Colossians</hi> 1. vers. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. be effectually considered, (where there is speech of the great prerogatiue which Christ hath in the world, as he is head of the church) and they do wholy run that way.

               <hi>Except they meane to abolish

it altogether.</hi> Indeed, I like this exception well, and so I do also of his opinion. For me thinketh, that if kings and princes be ioint co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners vnder Christ the head, with their pastors, doctors, and aldermen, assigned by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle for the gouernment of the church, they might be well content, and reckon it no disparagement vnto the best of them, that the prince their soueraigne, should beare the chiefest and the greatest sway amongst them.</p>
            <p>And all this maketh directly against <hi>Cartvvright,</hi> euen as though men of purpose should haue studied to haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced him: which surely needeth not. For if his own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings were narrowly looked into, there is sufficient in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to discipher him in his colours.<note place="margin">Lib. 2. p. 470.</note> I meruaile what he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth when he writeth, that a king was necessarie for the Israelits, to shadow out to them the kingdome of Christ. Would he leaue his scholers at libertie to reason, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they should see their time? Christ is now come in the flesh, &amp; being our high priest, hath performed the worke of our saluation: therfore the priesthood of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> being but a shadow of Christs priesthood, ought now to cease. And euen so they, when they list: The kingdome of Christ, is now come vnto vs, &amp; therefore the hauing of a king being but a shadow of Christs kingdome, ought now to cease.

as needlesse instruments vnder Christ, for the building, feeding, and comforting of his church. For thus he argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:<note place="margin">Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. p. 413.</note> that for as much as <hi>Christ is neuer seuered from his body, nor from any part of it, and is able, and dooth performe that vvherefore he is called head, vnto all his Church, therefore there is no need of any subordinate head ouer any particular Church, or</hi> (as he sayth) <hi>there can be none.</hi> As if a man should reason thus: Christ is our sauiour, our priest, our prophet, and our king: Christ is our sheapheard, our doctor, and our archbishop: Christ is neuer absent from his church, nor euer will be: and he is able to performe that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called, our sauiour, our priest, our prophet, our pastor, our doctor, our bishop, our archbishop, our arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeder: therefore we need no priests, pastors, doctors, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or archbishops, neither ought there to be any such subordinate, or ministeriall meanes allowed of, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for the sayd benefits, of building, teaching, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the church. The collections (in my opinion) are both alike.</p>
            <p>Againe, by the same phrase of speech: that Christ, as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, is called by him els-where, <hi>the head of euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 2. p. 416.</note> 
               <hi>and in that respect euery particular church is tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his body.</hi> So Christ as he is the sonne of God only (to graunt him for a minute so much) being the head of euery particular kingdome: it may be said, that euery particular kingdome is his body. Now then, whereas he reasoneth thus, very grauely in his owne iudgement: <hi>If the church be the body of Christ and of the ciuile magistrat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 2. p. 412.</note> 
               <hi>it should haue tvvo heads, vvhich vvere monstrous.</hi> Why may not I in like sort make this inference? if the common-wealth be the body of Christ, and of the ciuile magistrat, it should haue two heads which were mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strous: which collection

being ridiculous (by his own phrase offspeech) his said ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is also ridiculous. For my part certainly I do thinke that the word heard, as it is yeelded to christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> princes, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying nothing els (as I sayd) but a cheefe ruler, I see no cause then, why it should be a more monstrous thing, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be subordinat rulers of the church vnder christ, then to see princes thrust downe, and six or seuen base persons, a malster, a brewer, a baker, a mason, a smith, a butcher, a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and such like aduanced, to that, so high an authoritie.</p>
            <p>Well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as our prouerbe sayth: Be it as it bee may, and that is no banning. If Princes will bee thus dallyed withall, let them for me, and they shall bee the first that will repent it. But vvhat should they do, when they heare their authoritie, so substantially impugned, by so worthie persons, with such inuincible arguments, such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, such collections, such concurrencie in their opinions, such concord, such notable agreement together, in their grounds, for that purpose? Indeed you will say so, when you shall see how, (after they haue foiled prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in such sort as it hath bene declared) they intitle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and their wise and worshipfull Eldermen to their authoritie. You cannot imagine mens bodies, to be faster tied together, with the strongest rope that euer was made of sand, then their minds, and iudgements are fast lincked, and vnited in this matter. As now it shall partly appeare, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I haue layd before you three or foure of their new quircks, very pertinent to this place: some of them haue bene alreadie touched, but you cannot heare a good thing too often.</p>
            <p>They affirme (if I can vnderstand them) that euery wel ordered parish,<note place="margin">Demonst. Mart. Thes. T.C. 1.2. p. 412.419.</note> hauing an Eldership in it, is the perfect bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ, &amp; that Christ is properly to be called as well

               <hi>as the members of the Catholike church, do make but one body of Christ: vvhereof hee is to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led especially the head.</hi> But I will not stand vpon these points, onely I touch them that it might still appeare how well they agree together.

            </p>
            <p>And now I draw nere to the pith of this matter. For as touching the gouernment of euery one of these particular bodies of Christ, or of euery one of these demie catholicke churches, they hold that (princes being iustly dispossessed) their pastors, doctors, and aldermen, are by right, Christs immediat and subordinat lieutenants, or vicars generall. But now, for as much as our sauiour Christ (say some of them) is a priest, a prophet, and a king, and all in respect that he is both God and man, our only mediator and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Here beginneth a new skitmish, from which of these his dignities they must deriue their interest, whether their said vice-gerents are to challenge their soueraigntie, from Christ, as he is a priest, from Christ as hee is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ, as he is a king. For as the great learned clearke, that made the booke of ecclesiastical and ciuile po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:775:143"/>
affirmeth,<note place="margin">I.B. de polit. pa. 68.</note> 
               <hi>vvhosoeuer is to be called Christs vicar, hee must be so tearmed either in respect of all those his three of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, or of tvvo of them, or of one at the least.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath bene commonly held heretofore, that Christ ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon him the ministerie of the gospell, to preach and teach the same, did ordaine his Apostles and disciples, to ioine with him, in that part of his priestly office. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof, it hath also bene defended, against the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, that euery lawfull minister, is as much the vicar of Christ, or his substitute, to teach his people, as the bishop of Rome, and that they ought, all of them equally, when they preach the word, pray for the people, or administer the sacraments, to be receiued, heard and intertained, as Christs embassadors, Christs ministers, euen as though Christ himself in his own person, did presently here vpon earth execute these offices. Besides, it is vrged by the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoizer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Countecp. pa. 12.</note> &amp; many other, that Christ hauing translated the Iewes <hi>Sanedrim</hi> into his church, he hath appointed vnto vs <hi>for the Ievves priests, our pastors, and for their teaching Leuits, our doctors, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby it followeth, that if the priests of the old law were Christs vicars, as he was their priest: the pastors ought so to be in the time of the gospel. But the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t politian,<note place="margin">I. B.</note> he vseth the matter in such sort, as by no means the ministers of the word, may haue any te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of their offices, vnder christ as he is priest. <hi>Ne ipsi quide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pastores erunt Christi sacerdotis vicarij, quod tamen falso sibi persuasit papa diaboli vicarius. The pastors themselues shall not be Christ's vicars, as he is priest, vvhich office notvvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the pope the diuels vicar, tooke falsely vpon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The pastors (he saith) <hi>shall</hi> not be Christs vicars, as he is a priest. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther is no remedie: They shal not. How shal they hold then, immediatly of him? as he is a prophet. That
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:775:144"/>
is it. <hi>They are his substitutes or vicars</hi> (saith hee) <hi>onely as he is a prophet.</hi>

               <hi>the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, Prophets, Euangelists, Ministers and Doctors, might be his vicars.

I dare say, you would smile, if it should so fall out, that all our consistorian ministers, will needs bee Christs substitutes, in that he is a king. Surely, I must tell you, it proueth so.</p>
            <p>For as touching <hi>I. B.</hi> they reckon him (I perceaue) but a simple politian. Christs kingdome, it hath bene truly vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, is not of this world: &amp; it is plea good enough against our bishops, but it holdeth not, to impaire the estimation of our petit consistorian kings.

it ought to be in this world. Do you not here desire to know what this kingdome is? That I may not keepe you long in suspence, it is the <hi>Geneuian</hi> Eldership, and euen the very same kingdome (saith our counterpoizer) <hi>vvhere of Christ spake many times after his resurrection,</hi>

            <p>I could adde here a number of strange sayings (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you shall here anon in some other chapters following) concerning this new presbiteriall kingdome. But now it is more pertinent, to make the point I haue in hand, more apparant vnto you.<note place="margin">T.C. lib. 2. pa. 440.</note> 
               <hi>Christ as a king, prescribed the forme of ecclesiasticall gouernment,</hi> saith <hi>Cartvvright,</hi> not as a priest, nor as a prophet, but as a king. With <hi>Cartvvright</hi> his scholler <hi>Dudlie Fenner,</hi>

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:775:145"/>
in the collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church, by the ministerie of the word and sacraments, and by the internall gouernment of his spirit, and the external of the ministerie. Here is indeed, very roiall preferment: for al the ministers of the word. But I meruaile how the ruling elders do hold their authoritie? They are neither priests nor prophets, of likelihood then, they must be little kings. Wel then, Christ is the king, the presbiterie is his kingdome, &amp; his immediat vice-gerents they are all of them. What? Surely, by the due course of degrees (which are acknowledged) the pastors must be all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as it were) emperors, the doctors kings, the elders dukes, and the deacons lords of the treasurie, &amp;c. And for the authoritie of euery such kingdom, it must needs fal out to be very soueraign. For if euery presbiterie (as it is before noted) be properly to be called the body of Christ, and the true portraiture of the catholick church, &amp; that euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is of equall authoritie: now that the officers in them are Christs immediat vice-gere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts within their own king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, who shall controll any of their doings, or whither should a man appeale, if he found himselfe iniuried.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">De presb. p. 124</note>I remember maister <hi>Bezas</hi> saying, <hi>That euery eldership is the tribunall seat of Christ.</hi> Which is all one almost, with the assertion of some Romish parasits, that the pope and Christ, haue but one consistorie. They tell vs of appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from an eldership, to a classis, from a classis, to a prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall synod, from a prouincial synod, to a nationall, &amp; from a nationall, vnto a generall councell. But as the papists do make euery appellation from the pope, to be as absurd, and all one, as if the appeale were made from Christ, so must it necessarily follow, to be as vntollerable to appeale from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny consistorie, it being (as it hath bene affirmed) the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall seat of Christ, and the officers in it, Christs immediat
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:775:145"/>
gouernors. And because it is pretended, that the regiment they speake of, is in the best perfection at Geneua, I would gladly know whither a man might appeale (vpon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) from that eldership there. The churches of <hi>Bern,</hi> or <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke,</hi> haue no more to do with the church of <hi>Geneua</hi> (they will say) then <hi>Geneua</hi> hath to do with them, or an eldership in Scotland, with another of the low countries. But I haue taried too long vpon this matter, in collecting vpon their contrarie assertions. Therefore to conclude, I would wish all christian and godly magistrats, that haue as yet in their hands, the lawfull authoritie in church-causes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto them by the word of God, to keepe it stil, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at the least these disciplinarie deuisers, be fully resolued, whether we must account the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priest, prophets, or kings: priests, if they be Christs substitutes, as he is a priest: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, if they be Christs substitutes, as he is a prophet: and kings by the same proprietie of speech: if they be Christs immediat substitutes, as he is a king. And so I will go to the next chapter, wherby you shall perceaue more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that (call them as ye list) they challenge authoritie, like princes, or rather popes, to deale in many matters.</p>

Now for that it might bee doubted how farre these words, <hi>Church causes</hi> should extend: they haue taken great paines to cleare their meaning in that behalfe, and so haue vsed the matter (to my vnderstanding) as that they haue left out no one cause, of what nature soeuer, but that either directly, or indirectly, by hooke or crooke, they haue brought it vnder their lee, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>within their compasse.

            <p>This is round dealing.

But if they will needs take so much vpon them, because they haue once said it; then if any man, be he prince or subiect, exceed the limits of his calling, where their elderships are established: it tendeth surely to their condemnation, that may reforme him, and doe it not.</p>
            <p>But it may be, that some wil say, we haue heard of <hi>Knox,</hi> of <hi>Danaeus,</hi> of the <hi>Demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strator,</hi> of the <hi>admonitioners</hi> of <hi>Sne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> of <hi>Cartvvright,</hi> and we know not whom: but what sayth <hi>Beza</hi> of this matter? we would be glad to heare him. I cannot blame you, for you shall be sure that he wil come in with one trick or other beyond his fellowes. You haue heard al the sinnes (almost) that are reckoned vp already, as falling within the bounds of the elderships iurisdiction. But if we shall beleeue <hi>Beza,</hi> and speake indeed properly, as he would haue vs: no sinnes (as they are sinnes) do belong to the elderships to be dealt in,<note place="margin">De excom. p. 46.49.</note> but as they are <hi>scandala,</hi> that is, as they offend the godly consciences of Gods children. For example: I heare a man blaspheme God, or breake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the first table; or I heare or see him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit some sinne against the second table, <hi>vz</hi> against his neighbor, as against my self by doing me some iniurie, either in word or deed, either in my goods, or in my name, now in this, there are offred me 2 kinds of iniuries, the first &amp; the cheefest is the greefe of conscience, that I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:775:148"/>
respect, that such a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods law, &amp; therby not only wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded my hart, but giuen an ill exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, which may peraduenture corrupt others. The second iniurie is, by his hurting me in my goods or fame. Now forsooth in this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond respect, I may go to the ciuile magistrat, but may not come to the eldership, by any degrees, but only in the first respect, <hi>vz.</hi> because my neighbor in hurting of me hath vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated the law of god, &amp; so wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science. Neither must I complaine to the <hi>eldership,</hi> with any mind either to haue him punished, or to haue my iniuries reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pensed, but only to bring him to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, &amp; to seeke the good of his soule. By this deuise you may perceaue that although he seeme in words to dissent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest that haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more bluntly, yet in effect he agreeth with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or rather hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased their prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded iurisdiction. For by this means, they may not only take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to enter into euery action, but they would bind euery particular man, whosoeuer, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an informer to their court. Besides, wheras he sayth, that in the said second respect, we may go to the ciuile ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat, it is but a mist that he casteth before mens eies. For be it in a matter of words, that I prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d my selfe to be gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and so complaine to their eldership: <hi>Beza</hi> &amp; al the rest do hold, that the partie cannot passe their fingers, vntill he haue submitted and reconciled himselfe vnto me. And in such a matter who will desire more? For if he looke for damages in monie, he will be held cruell. And then what is left for the ciuile magistrat? Againe, my neighbour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that I haue done him iniurie, either in his lands, goods, or fame, chargeth me with the particulars, which being indeed false, he saith are true, wherupon my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being wounded, that he should sin so horribly against God, first by lying, &amp; then by iustifying his lie: I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:775:149"/>
to the consistorie. The matter is heard, I am cleared. And except he submit himselfe both to aske God and mee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse, the censures of the church proceed against him: and so that way also he is debarred from the benefite of temporall law, in so much as he can haue no colour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin sute againe, for that, wherein hee hath acknowledged me to haue bene by him wrongfully charged. What is here then left for the ciuile state to deale in? Furthermore in a matter of iniurie done vnto me in my lands or goods: I pretend to that court, that such a man hath wounded my conscience, in breaking Gods commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by such his iniurie offered vnto me:<note place="margin">Beza. de ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. pa. 52.</note> well, it may be the partie will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it, and then <hi>my proofes must be produced.</hi> If I iustifie my complaint, the offender must likewise in this case submit himselfe vnto me, and acknowledge the iniurie. If hee will not so do, the censures proceed, and so he is debarred (as it is sayd before): if hee do, then on the other side, I must of necessitie, forgiue him the offence which gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued my conscience, or else I also do come within their compasse. Well, I do therefore forgiue him: and shall I neuerthelesse prosecute him in forme of law, for the iniurie done to me?

The iniurie is confessed afore. There shall need no triall of the fact, where so many witnesses may be vsed, to prooue his confession afore, if now he should denie it. All that the magistrat hath to do, is to set down what recompense I shall haue for my sayd iniurie, and to tax my charges. If you say nay, hee will heare the cause againe. Indeed I confesse he had need to do so. But so both I and the partie should be doubly charged and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. Besides, that course would turne to the vtter discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the presbyteries, that their dealings, fitting in the seat of Christ, should come to be scanned by those, that are but <hi>humane ordinations.</hi> For so some of them by colour of the Apostles words do debase magistracie. And therefore peraduenture they will thinke it meet, that vpon certificat from them, the magistrats should so pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceed to adiudge me a recompense, and to rate mine expenses without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adoo. Some such thing it is, (though not in this very case) which the ministers of the low countries haue desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

It is to bee wondred ar; that <hi>Beza</hi> should content himselfe, with such vnlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; so very improbable conceites. But it seemeth, that vpon some better aduisement with himself, and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe subscribers: they grewe all of them ashamed of these shiftes.<note place="margin">Beza de excom. pag. 106.</note> And therefore in his booke of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication (which hee lately published) hee is become in some sort another man.

            <p>Ah, very well: though they haue turned ouer an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lease; and for <hi>Probabile est,</hi> do bragge of most cleare testimonies: yet, concerning Christs wordes, they are gone backward. For his commandement, <hi>Vos autem non sic:</hi> is now turned, as you see, into <hi>Nunquam approbauit:</hi> which carrieth with it no other force, than is ascribed to a negatiue collection. But for all their most cleare te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, he must haue better eyes than mine, that can discerne any thing by them, sauing their inconstancie: and that there is cause, to suspect therby (as I said,) that when their credites are increased, they will not greatly

            </p>
            <p>So as now, if this question were once determined: whether, that may bee lawful, when there is a <hi>Christian</hi> magistrate, that is lawfull to bee doone, when there is none: there should (as you see) bee no more suites in law for <hi>ciuill</hi> causes in the lande: their Elderships haue intituled themselues vnto them, and ingrossed them all <hi>by right,</hi> into their handes. You will say; it is true, that they haue done so indeede, if that question were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but that point standeth vppon an if.

               <hi>which the Church had, before there was a

               <hi>doe receiue no further increase of their authoritie, than they had before, while they were in paganisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is well: By these rules then, all is theirs. They are Kings &amp; Princes: &amp; the very immediate vicegerentes of Iesus Christ vppon earth. And good reason they should then haue both the swords: nay, twenty swords if there were so many.

               <hi>&amp;c. then were it not lawfull for the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament to establish any thing, in the matters appertaining to the pure worship of God, but by theyr direction.</hi> Which is this in effect,<note place="margin">Admon. 2. p. 57</note> (if I vnderstand them:) <hi>that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should prouyde theyr new pretended gouernours, of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient maintenance, and set vp theyr Eldershippes</hi>; and then enact it likewise: that whatsoeuer they should ordaine in their assemblies and meetings, for the time to come concerning Church causes: should be in full strength, and for euer obeyed, vntill it might please them to make some alteration.

generall establishing of it. In which their purpose, if once they may preuayle: there shall neuer Parliament bee troubled againe in matters of religion: otherwise then (as I sayde) for making of lawes, that the people may obey their orders. For the whole gouernement is there ascribed vnto their Elderships, &amp; other assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; insomuch, as the ciuill Magistrate is not once mentioned in it.</p>
            <p>It is well knowne how vehement they haue been,<note place="margin">A Councellor.</note> and still continue, against the now Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, in that he is one of her Maiesties most honourable priuie Councell, accounting it vnlawful, for a Bishop or Minister of the worde, to holde anie such roome and authoritie.

Now I cannot possibly be brought to thinke, that the worde of God should deale so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially: but that it may bee as lawfull heere, as there, if it please her Maiestie, to haue a Bishop to bee one of her most honourable Councell.</p>
            <p>It is apparant in the former Chapiter, <note place="margin">Their Synods must bind.</note> what little account they make of generall Councels. The best are censured by them, and reprooued. It is not well borne by <hi>Cartwright,</hi> that the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> should be tearmed a famous Councell. And for other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, or Synodes; they are scarcely reckoned to bee worthie the mentioning. If you presse one of that

forte, with the authoritie of them all; though hee be not thirty yeares of age, hee will not sticke to make a tush at them: and tell you, that himselfe is of another opinion. No decrees made by them, will bind these fellowes. And as touching our owne nationall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes and Parliaments: they are prosecuted with the greatest contempt. The reformation of religion made by that authoritie: is tearmed a deformation. The articles of religion, are misliked in diuers points. The Iniunctions, Aduertisements; Canons, Orders, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and all thinges in a manner, are despised by them. For they are but mens preceptes (forsooth:) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man must trie them, and keepe or allowe what he list; at the least, if hee will but pretend, that hee dooth it of conscience. Howbeit, if they may haue once au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to establish their Elderships, and to meete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in theyr classicall, prouinciall, or nationall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, there to make such lawes and orders, as they shall thinke good: then see (I praye you) how they chaunge theyr song. <note place="margin">Gelibrand to Field.</note>

            <p>In their writinges generally, they exclayme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the high Commission, <note place="margin">Commission.</note> or at the least, against the Commissioners; as many of them as bee clergie men: affirming it to bee against the worde of God, that any such should bee of that Commission.<note place="margin">Acts of secret Counceil prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 1590.</note> And yet in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it was agreeable with the Scriptures, that fortie or fiftie at the least, Ministers of the worde, (as I conceyue it) shoulde bee verie great Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from the King, <hi>Anno</hi> 1589. to very manie great purposes: euen for the purging of that lande from all sortes of enemies, to the religion there professed.

and shoulde gouerne by the worde of God, and lawes of this Realme; there would rise more profit thereby to religion, than yet hath beene found by the Bishops.</hi> He would haue it in fiue hundreth places. <hi>Scotland</hi> is diuided into two and fiftie Eldershippes: and of likelyhood they would haue fiue hundred in <hi>England.</hi> And that, as I take it, is the mystery of his number of fiue hundred. To conclude, I finde another motion, which liketh wel, that if there were fiue hundred Elderships more or fewer established, yet there might <hi>be in euery great Towne,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Humb motion pag. 62.</note> 
               <hi>certaine Commissioners in causes ecclesiasticall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted: to looke that the Elderships did their dueties, &amp; if they did not, to compel them therunto by ciuill authority.</hi> So as therby it appeareth, that although our Bishops, &amp; other Clergie men may not be such Commissioners with vs in some few places: yet their Pastors, Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, &amp; Aldermen, may, in euery parish, or so many of them, (or I knowe not whom) as it should please her Maiestie, to assigne to euery greate Towne. Surely the worde of God is much troubled with such kinde of choppers and chaungers of it; euery giddy heade wresting and wringing it, to serue his owne deuise. Wee shoulde haue Commissions to thatch houses withall (I see:) if they might be our directors.</p>
            <p>They are offended with the authoritie that her Maiestie dooth giue vnto her Commissioners, <note place="margin">Purseuants.</note> for causes ecclesiasticall, as beeing vnlawfull, in that by vertue of that commission, they may sende some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for offendors to appeare before them, by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuants; and commit them to prison, as occasion shal fall out, and theyr faultes, misdemeanors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts shall require. But at <hi>Geneua,</hi> the like authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

(in effecte) is lawfull in their Eldership. <note place="margin">Lawes of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua. fol. 15.</note> For there the Consistorie hath a Beadle, sergeant, or purseuant, or as you lift to tearme him, appoynted by the ciuill Magistrates to attende vppon it: whose office is, to call such before the Consistorie, as the Aldermen shall appoynt him. And for imprisoning of any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors, and contemptuous persons; there is nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matter almost, for the which they may call a man before them: but one parte of the punishment of it, by the lawes of the Cittie, is imprisonment.

               <hi>or misname them, he is to be imprisoned.</hi> Besides, as I haue noted it before; theyr Elders are alwayes of the Councell of state: and seldome or neuer, but they will bee sure to haue one of the foure Syndickes, to bee of that bench. So as together, they raigne lyke Lordes in theyr Consistorie: and who dare say; My Lordes, why doe you so? If they direct: imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is but a small matter. I speake not agaynst that order there: let them vse it as they thinke good.

            <p>In that by the orders of our Church,<note place="margin">Subscription.</note> and the laws of the Realme, there is required of Ministers, a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription to her Maiesties lawfull authoritie in eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall causes; to the Articles of Religion, and to the Communion booke, &amp;c. greate quarrels haue beene raysed, and many exceptions are taken against it.<note place="margin">Humb. motion.</note> Insomuch as one, (a wise man I warraunt you) dooth ascribe all the daungers that haue beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotted against her Maiesties person by the traitrous

Papistes: the dearth of corne: the cause that we haue had such watching and warding <hi>by souldiers</hi>: and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Spanyards would haue inuaded this land; all these thinges are ascribed (I say) by him, vnto the exacting of the sayde subscription. Howbeit, yet <hi>Cartwright</hi> and his confederates, could take vppon them, in a seditious sort, to require a secrete subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongst theyr fauourers; vnto such a forme of newe Church gouernement, as hee with the rest of that crue, after many meetinges and alterations, had deuised. Wherein if theyr fancies might once take place, subscriptions would not seeme so daintie as now they doe. For there is subscription required v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon subscription. No man is to bee chosen vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ecclesiasticall office with them: <hi>Nisi qui disciplinae subscripserit; except he haue subscribed to theyr discipline:</hi> Whosoeuer is to bee of any of their assemblyes, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther classicall, prouinciall, or nationall, <hi>hee must first haue subscribed to their discipline.</hi> And not thus content, it is there also further ordred; that <hi>none shalbe admitted to the holy Communion, except they submit themselues vnto theyr discipline.</hi> So as heereby, euery temporall man; of what calling soeuer, is brought vnder theyr subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Of likelyhood they thinke, that no man can be a worthy receiuer of that holy Sacrament: that is not well perswaded of their counterfait platform. At <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi> whosoeuer is to be admitted into their schoole; he <hi>must first subscribe to theyr discipline.</hi>

               <hi>he sweareth to keepe theyr eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall ordinances</hi>; and consequently, the discipline there practised. All theyr Elders in like maner, thogh one of them be one of the Syndicks, doe take an oath to the same effect:<note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 9.</note> when <hi>they sweare, to perfourme theyr office faythfully, and to bring all thinges to the Consistorie, which are worthie to bee brought before it.</hi> As if the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne heere, should take an oath, to bee a promoter. But that which is moste of all: they haue preuayled so much with the Magistrates, (and there is good cause why) that it is made death, <hi>for any man, to lette, or stoppe,</hi>

               <hi>or cause to hinder, the worde and seruice of God, and his holy Gospell.</hi> Within which compasse, you maye bee sure, theyr discipline is comprehended. Our men as yet, talke in their platforme, but of subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but if once they had gotten so much, then forward must the rest, or els they would bee angry. How carelesly subscription is exacted in <hi>England,</hi> I am ashamed to report. Such is the retchlesnes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Bishoppes, on the one side: and theyr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to bee at ease and quietnes, to thinke vppon their owne affayres: and on the otherside, such is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie and intollerable pride of that factious sorte: as that betwixt both sides, eyther subscription is not at all required: or if it be, the Bishops admit them so to quallifie it, that it were better to bee omitted alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. If the best, and the learnedst man in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, were in <hi>Geneua,</hi> and shoulde oppose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

to any thing that the Church there holdeth: if hee escaped with his life, he might thanke God: but hee shoulde bee sure, not to continue as a Minister there. There is no Church established in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, so remisse in this point, as the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> For in effecte: euery man vseth, and refuseth what hee lifteth. Some few of late haue beene restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who had almost raysed the lande into an open sedition. But else, they followe theyr owne fancies: and may not bee dealt withall (forsooth) for feare of disquietnes.

You may not admit an accusation against an Elder, vnder two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. If you haue witnesses, why aske you vs? And many such like obiections are made, &amp; maintained. Howbeit this opposition is altogether without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and by them, that knowe not what they do.

I am sure, the brotherhood heere would bee verie loth, to oppose themselues against any point of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that is allowed of there.</p>
            <p>It fortuned vppon a time, that certayne persons meeting together, at one widdow <hi>Balthasars</hi> house in <hi>Geneua</hi> to be merrie, did there daunce. Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> hearing of this horrible sinne (forsooth) procured them all, both dauncers and beholders, to bee called before him and his Elders, in the Consistorie. When they appeared; <hi>Caluin</hi> tooke vppon him to examine them, and vsed (as hee tearmeth them) certaine <hi>holy obtestations,</hi> that they should tell him truely, whether there were any such dauncing or no, where it was, and who daunced, &amp;c. They denied the matter who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: which he expresseth Apostlelike in these words: <hi>Impudenter nobis &amp; Deo mentiti sunt:</hi>

There was also an other in that meeting, named <hi>Perrin,</hi> the Captaine of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (as I take it) a man with whome <hi>Caluin</hi> had many quarrels.

            <p>The like course against Vniuersitie degrees, was helde by the Anabaptistes, long since in <hi>Germanye:</hi> and was mightily encountred by that woorthy lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, <hi>P.

Whereupon <hi>Franciscus Iunius</hi> hath written a booke;<note place="margin">Iunij. Acad.</note> intituled his <hi>Academia</hi>: of purpose, to confute suche fantasticall persons. In the Epistle whereof, after he hath discouered the fooleries of the Anabaptists: he commeth to the other sorte: (I thinke hee meaneth <hi>Beza,</hi> and suche lyke,) whome hee honoureth with greate tytles of grauitie, learning: authoritie, and iudgemente. <hi>These men</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>with two wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons doo seeme to wound to death, the lawes of our Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: vz. with reasons, and with examples.</hi> The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he answereth: and I will not further deale with them, otherwise than by referring you to the sayde Epistle. But the reasons and his aunsweres, are the poyntes I ayme at. Theyr reasons he setteth downe in these wordes: (a man might thinke hee had reade <hi>Cartwrightes</hi> wordes before mentioned:) <hi>Quia plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rima sunt (inquiunt) superflua &amp; puerilia: abusus multi: omnia profecta à Pontificijs: Because manye thinges (they saye) are superfluous and childishe: there are manye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses: all suche orders and ceremonyes, came from the Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the first reason, hee sheweth suche or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and ceremonies as they vse, are neyther <hi>Reipsa, aut significatione; In theyr nature, or in theyr significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> eyther superfluous, or childish; and so not such at all as is obiected: and that they are vsed, <hi>sine super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitione &amp; iniuria vlla, Without superstition, or any iniury:</hi> and so proceedeth to other arguments for them.</p>
            <p>To the second reason, his aunswere is in effecte: that hee supposeth no man of learning will say, that <hi>The vse of a lawfull thing is to bee abrogated, Propter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignum illius vsum, For the vnlawfull vse of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:775:164"/>And to the last reason, that suche orders came from the Bishoppes of <hi>Rome,</hi> hee aunswereth: <hi>Esto sanè &amp;c. Bee it so; that I may graunt them so much. But whatsoeuer good, honest, or orderly thyng, wee haue recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the Popes, or Papistes, must wee reiect it, because it came from them? Nay rather; Whatsoeuer good, honest, and orderly thing they haue, lette vs haue it common with them, if they will suffer vs: if they will not suffer vs, at the least lette vs retayne it as well as they, for the publike good.

               </note> which our Bishoppes haue ouer other Ministers, than that in the Scriptures the name of Bishop, is likewise giuen to euery Minister of the worde. Whereupon they inferre with all confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as though it were impossible to bee otherwise, that because the name was then common, therefore theyr functions differed not, but were likewise all one. Heereunto, I knowe not how oft, they haue beene aunswered: that the communitie of names in
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:775:165"/>
the Scriptures, dooth not take away the distinction of offices. Princes are called Deacons: Apostles, are tearmed Priests, or Elders: and yet therby it may not be gathered, that there was no difference betweene the office of euery Deacon, and of Princes: between the office of the Apostles, and euery Priest, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the worde. And so wee saye of Bishoppes: that although the name of Bishoppes bee giuen in the Scriptures to other inferiour Ministers likewise: yet doth it not followe, that betweene the office of a Bishoppe, and of a Priest or Minister, there is, and should bee no difference. But all this, &amp; much more to this purpose, will not serue our turnes: and yet with <hi>Beza</hi> to another purpose, it is a maruellous suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient answere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Erastus</hi> goeth about to prooue, that the name of Elder, when it is taken in the newe Testament for an ecclesiasticall office: dooth euer signifie a Minister of the worde, and not anye of theyr counterfayte and vnpriestly Aldermen. And one of his reasons is this: <hi>Because in the newe Testament, the names of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe, and of Elder, are common</hi>: as if a man shoulde saye: hee that was a Bishoppe, was called an Elder; and hee that was an Elder, was called a Bishop: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theyr offices were all one: and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; euerie Bishoppe beeing a Minister of the worde, euery Elder must needes bee a Minister of the word.

not sometimes taken generally lykewise. Heereof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that the name of Apostles is attributed also to them, who by a more proper name were called Euangelistes: Saint</hi> Paule <hi>dooth call his Apostleship a Deaconship: And</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>calleth himselfe a Priest: and</hi> Luke <hi>calleth those, Priestes, who are afterward called of</hi> Paule <hi>by a more generall name, Bishoppes: Quitamen &amp; reipsa &amp; ijsdem specialiter acceptis nominibus, distincta esse illorum mune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, nemo dubitare possit: Whereas yet notwithstanding, both in deede or in nature, the same names beeing taken specially, no man can doubt, but that the offices of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, of Euangelistes, of Deacons, of Bishoppes, and of Priestes are distincte.</hi> See what respecte of persons there is amongst our pretended reformers. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, there is not one of them that will presume to encounter with this aunswere of <hi>Bezaes</hi>: and yet when other men, as learned as euer hee was, or will bee, made the same in effecte, it was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by some of them, not to bee woorth a strawe.</p>

            <p>There is great barking, against the church of <hi>England,</hi> for that by Act of parliament, some partes of the Canon. Law,<note place="margin">Canon Law.</note> are retained and to bee vsed by our Bishops, for the better gouernment of the Church: insomuch as the very name of the Canon law, is become odious; the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sort of simple men of the factious crue, verily supposing, that the name of such a law, rule, or institution, is popish, vnlawfull, and diuelish: and therfore they crie, out cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it, crucifie it, awaie with it, wee will not be ruled by it: we will none of it. As though they shoúld saye: we are lawlesse men: for rules and orders we detest them: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer seemeth good in our own eyes, that we will doe: at the least if we euer yeald our obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to any church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, it shall bee surelie of our own making: sie vppon all former Councels, sie vppon all those decisions, which the auncient fathers made; sie vpon all old and auncient constitutions. And thus in effect they write &amp; speake, in their libels, and ordinarie table-talke: whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, if there be anie thing in the Canon-law, that will serue their purposes, they can be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to steale it thence, &amp; to take to themselues thereby, the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation which is due to the true authors &amp; fathers of it. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> &amp; his fraternitie in their essentiall draught of discipline, haue drawen more then seuen partes of eight of it, out of the Canon-lawe, and auncient constitutions. <hi>Viretus</hi> perceiuing (but too late,) what hindrance grew to

the platforme of their new discipline, by the vtter aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the Canon-law at once, and as it were in a furie, (which, he supposed, did &amp; wold still haue bridled prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if it had been retained and still in force) sheweth his dislike of such rashnes in these wordes.<note place="margin">The 3. Dial. of white Diuils:</note> 
               <hi>They thought it a goodly reformation in the Church to abolish all the Canons &amp; decrees with the good statutes, which the auncient fathers and Doctors hadde ordayned, to mayntaine the good discipline in the church.</hi> The chiefe point indeed that grieued <hi>Viretus,</hi> (as there it appeareth at large) was this: because Princes by that meanes, had drawen their necks, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the yoke of discipline. A matter so much misliked by them, as that he is flatte of opinion: that it had beene better for the Church to haue kept the old Pope still, then by abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Canon law, and in giuing to Princes so great authoritie in causes ecclesiasticall; so to haue subiected her selfe to a new kind of papacie: euerie king &amp; prince, being (as he saith) a new Pope by that meanes: &amp; much worse then the olde. So that hereby, you see, what is the drift of our factious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sistorians in laboring, to make the name of the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law odious. You may not think, that they differ in substance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their M. <hi>Viretus</hi>: but they are growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more crafty. The matter that pincheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is this: that in the acts of Parliament which are in force, there is euer a <hi>Prouiso,</hi> that nothing therof shal be in force, which is contrary to the laws of this Realme, or to the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue roiall of the prince. If euer anie K. in <hi>England</hi> should be so far seduced, as that he would yeald to establish their counterfeit elderships in this Realme, with all the royall authoritie, which they challenge of right to belong vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; changing the two former <hi>prouisoes,</hi> should enact it, that all the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-law shold be in force, sauing so much, as
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:775:168"/>
should bee contrary to the orders &amp; prerogatiue of their elderships: If I shold then be aliue (as I trust I shall not) I durst before hand hazard a great wager vpon it, that they would most readily, &amp; with a great applause, receiue it, &amp; almost worship it. For as I said, you may not imagine, but that <hi>Viretus</hi> hath disclosed their verie hartes.</p>

            <p>And this answere, as it is in it selfe most true, so it hath ben hitherto generally receiued. Yet now another must be sought.

Knew they the distinction of the three persons in the blessed Trinitie, &amp; could they not find what difference Christ allowed off, to be continued in his Church, betwixt a Bishop and a priest? Is the darknes which pride carieth with it, growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be so light: and is the light that shewed it selfe so many waies in the ancient fathers (as in their singular learning &amp; great humilitie) become such darknes; that <hi>Cartwright, Trauerse, Fenner,</hi> and such like, (but the shadows of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men in respect) should be thought so clearly sighted? &amp; shall <hi>Ireneus, Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose, Hierome, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, Augustine, Gregory, Hilarye,</hi> and all the rest of those worthie men be reckoned blind?

haue beene reuealed, eyther by him or anie of his: that were vnknowen to those blessed men. Surely I know of none: except it bee that their Elderships are newly thrust into their Consistoriall beliefe. A point (I confesse) whereof those godly men were ignoraunt. Otherwise they were well inough acquainted with these quarrels. They had weighed them, and finding them too light, reiected them. They had skill to discerne of such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brideled spirites: and in their dayes greatly pittied them. In a worde to speake my opinion: they were in deede golde, if they be compared to <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and suche lyke drosse: who haue little in them, more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie men, but onely paynted colours, and Sophisticall shewes.</p>
            <p>Many other particulars of such their dealinges with the newe writers, might bee layd downe before you. But these to my purpose, are I knowe sufficient: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will come to their boldnesse and presumption a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst not this man or that man, but euen whole reformed Churches.

But when any confession doth approoue<note n="i" place="margin">Sect. 17. obs. 1.2.3. ad con. August.</note> the calling of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; yealding vnto them all lawfull obedience (if they will not force vppon men their vngodly traditions as of chastitie &amp;c.) or when their Aldermen or Consistories are impeached: then they looke about them: it is a nayle in a wound: they censure: they reiecte: they wrest and peruert, euery thinge at their pleasure, as partly I haue shewed in the ende of the Chapter: and as any man may further see that will take the paines to viewe those obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations.</p>
            <p>Which manner and cariage of themselues: I perswade my selfe no wise man will like of. For besides their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt dealinge, it is too Pope-like, to take so much vppon them, as there they doe. What a vanity is this, to say of other Churches; wee allowe this, and that; if it bee thus and thus vnderstoode: otherwise wee cannot like of it: wee thinke it vnlawfull, wee cannot disgest it? And yet I cannot blame them so much; as I doe our owne dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall counterfeites. They are in possession of a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement: and woulde bee therefore loth to loose it.
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:775:185"/>
They got it hardly, and doe feare euery thinge, that maketh against it. I am perswaded if they might bee sure to keepe it still: they would be content to graunt (of their owne goodnesse) great liberty to all Churches in their owne matters. Whereas our make-bates, what furious and outragious courses haue they taken, against the Church of England; for the vse of those thinges, which nowe the Geneuians allowe of? And besides, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their pretended discipline: they will needes hold it before they haue it: and doe shewe allready as much or more contempt of those Churches, that dislike it, and are as sawcy with them: as any that I do know or heare of, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be their disciples Barrow and his companions.</p>
            <p>It hath pleased, that light headed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cockbraine, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to write a petition of late as vnto her Maiestie: and afterward like a seditious and vnduetiful person published the same to the people in printe (for what cause let wise men consider):<note place="margin">Polit. pag. 13.</note> amongest many other doultish vntruthes to affirme this; vz. <hi>that the Churches of Zuricke, Berne, Shaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fhusen, S. Galls, Rethia, Mylliane, Bieuna, Polonie, and Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia, haue commended (by their subscription to the second Heluetian confession) the gouernement of the Church by Elders, to be vsed in all Churches for euer.</hi> But let the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession bee viewed, and although I doubt not but that there was as much cunning vsed by the <hi>Geneuians</hi> about that subscription as might be; yet is there not one word in it, that tendeth that way.</p>
            <p>In that confession there are but two markes of the Church set downe: the thirde after the <hi>Geneua</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, is leste out. In the Chapter of the ministers of the Church: they are all of them as many: as are there named, reckoned for ministers of the worde and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:775:185"/>
That which is there, and might in any sorte be wrested to that purpose is this. <hi>And seeing there must needs be discipline in the Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conf. Helu.</note> 
               <hi>and in times past (apud veteres) excommunnication was vsed, and there were ecclesiasticall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes in the people of god, in the which this discipline was exercised by wise and godly menne: it shall also bee the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters part, to moderate this discipline, as it may edifie according to the condition of times, and the publique states, and as it shall bee necessarye.</hi> Which wordes are so farre from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendinge the perpetuall vse of the <hi>Geneua</hi> Eldershippe: that in mine opinion they are quite against it. For thus they say: First that there must bee discipline, which no man denyeth: secondly that excommunication was vsed in the times of the auncient fathers; this also is confessed: thirdly that amongest the Iewes there were ecclesiasticall courts, in which this discipline was exercised by wise and godly menne (who for anye thinge that is here sayde, might bee, of the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> and all of them priestes): and fourthly that it belongeth to the ministers to moderate this Discipline (that is) to vse it, or not to vse it, as times, states, and necessitye shall require.</p>
            <p>And that this my interpretation of this fourth pointe must needes bee the meaning of the <hi>Heluetian</hi> confession: it appeareth hereby: in that this forme of gouernement, (which the petitioner speakeh of) is not in anye Church in all <hi>Heluetia</hi> for ought I haue heard. They haue no such Aldermen: they haue no vse of theyr excommun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And hauing beene manye dayes solicited, to haue receiued it: for the better, reputation of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi> theyr aunswere hath euer beene: that euery Church is to haue an especiall eye to this pointe, what will most edifye: and that for-asmuch as they haue founde the

If hee would needes set downe his name, hee shoulde haue considered the example of the Apostle, who yet seldome or neuer mentioneth any minister of the Gospell by name, yea scarse anye professor, without some good marke of the grace of god in them. But this and a great deale more, both hee, and whosoeuer shall serue god, as they ought, in this cause of the further reformation of the Church, must account to endure of them, that oppose themselues to this most necessary seruice.

His request is, that you will giue notice thereof vnto the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of our conference, and also that by your meanes, there may bee some of vs appointed to exercise in priuate that day. If this his request connot conueniently bee performed, then I take it necessary thot you write so with some speede to M.

And these are the menne (for-sooth) that in all their spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches will pretende scriptures. But when they haue
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:775:194"/>
so done, tell them, that they peruerte the scriptures to serue their turnes: and that thus, and thus, they must vnderstand them according to the iudgement of all the auncient fathers: their aunswere in effecte is this. What tell you vs of the auncient fathers? <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> are the beste expounders of the scriptures. Maister <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> is a rare birde, a worthy wight, and as it were, <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe amongest his Apostles. They haue taught vs as wee teach: they are our fathers, who haue begotten in vs a loue and a likinge of the <hi>Geneua</hi> Discipline, and them will wee followe. In truth it is pitifull to consider: vnto what a height of pride many men are growen. It is lesse subiecte to offence, to reiect the authoritie of <hi>Saint Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, Saint Augustine,</hi> or anye of the rest: nay to refuse them alltogether; then to reiecte the iudgementes ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Caluin,</hi> of <hi>Beza</hi> or of <hi>Cartwright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> and maister <hi>Beza,</hi> I, doe thinke of them, and of their writinges, as they deserue. But yet I thinke better of the auncient fathers: I must confesse it. And for maister <hi>Cartwright,</hi> it is true, that hee hath many good partes in him: but the ouer-weening which he hath of himselfe, and which many besides haue of him, is like a lumpe of dowe, that sowereth both him and them all. You haue heard of what accounte, his writinges are with his sectaries: insomuch that one of them saith in effecte both for himselfe and for his brethren, that without <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrightes</hi> bookes they cannot come to the knowledge of the truth. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> bookes the way to the truth? To speake my conscience: they are the waye to manye grosse errors, and seditious fancies. Of all his bookes I woulde thinke, that should beare the price, which containeth the iustification of all his deuises; and is the last frutes of that
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:775:194"/>
Worthies wit: I meane his second reply. Touching the which booke, you shall heare <hi>maister Doctor Whitakers</hi> opinion: from whence, (especially if some one or two ioyned with him), the layer out of men in colours (as it hath been sayd) will not hastily appeale. Thus hee wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quem Cartwrightus nuper emisit libellum, eius magnam par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem perlegi. Ne viuam si quid vnquam viderim dissolutius, ac penè puerilius. Verborum satis ille quidem lautam ac nouam su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellectilem habet, rerum omnino nullam, quantum ego iudicare possum. Deinde non modo peruersè de principis in rebus sacris at que ecclesiasticis authoritate sentit: sed in papistarum etiam castra transfugit: a quibus tamen videri vult odio capitali dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidere. Verum nec in hac causa ferendus, &amp; alijs etiam in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus tela a papistis mutuatur. Denique vt de Ambrosio dixit Hieronimus, verbis ludit, sententijs dormitat: &amp; plane indignus est, qui a quopiam docto resutetur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, <hi>I haue read a great part of that booke which maister Cartwright, hath lately published: vz:</hi> (this second reply)<hi>: I pray God I liue not, if euer I saw any thing more loosely written and almost more childishly. It is true that for wordes, hee hath great store, and those both fine and new: but for matter, as farre as I can iudge, he is altogether barren. Moreouer he doth not onely thinke peruersly of the authoritie of Princes, in causes ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, but also flyeth into the Papistes holdes, from whome he would be thought to dissent with a mortall hatred. But in this point he is not to be endured: and in other partes also hee bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth his argumentes from the Papistes. To conclude, as</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome <hi>said of</hi> Ambrose: <hi>hee playeth with wordes, and is lame in his sentences: and is altogether vnworthy to bee confuted by anie man of learning.</hi> If anie shall heere obiect that maister <hi>Whittakers</hi> was not Doctor, when hee writ in this sorte:
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:775:195"/>
My aunswere is this. Hee writ this letter about the same time, that he beganne to write against <hi>Campian</hi>: when hè had attained alreadie vnto suche ripenesse of iudgement, as there is no more daunger hee should nowe be altered in this that hee hath written of <hi>Cartwrightes</hi> booke: then that he should alter heereafter from that trueth which he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained about the same time against <hi>Campian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is true: that hee neuer gaue a righter censure of anie booke in his life. Maister <hi>Cartwright</hi> must content himselfe with it: and so must his followers. He depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himselfe too much vppon <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi>: and so do many amongest vs vppon him. Such admiration of mens persons, and of their learning: must needes be very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. It hath euer been the cause of schisme. And there was neuer more mischiefe like to grow of it: then there is now. For I know not how it commeth about: but you shall seldome finde any; who hath once tasted of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinary potion, that is not forthwith possessed (as it were) with a wonderfull opinion, not onely of the chiefe confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctioners and fauourers of it, but likewise of themselues. And for all other men, Fathers, Councels, newe or olde, they little esteeme them; if they make any thing against them. I might heape vp in this place a number of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations, which haue been made many hundreth yeares since, as concerning suche like courses taken by many: and howe they neuer gat to themselues any true reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereby, but the contrary. But I will spare them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Onely, I cannot choose but tell them, that the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers were as wise and learned men, as they are: that the olde generall Councelles ought to be of as great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite with any but madde men, as their conuenticles or Synodes: that although wee ought to depend onely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:775:195"/>
the worde of God: yet for the interpretation of it, we may as safely follow the iudgementes of the auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of the first generall Councels, and of some other learned men: as of any of their chiefe patrones and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: that howsoeuer our owne men doe thinke of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, yet they are no better then other men: Nay there are many equall to the best of them, and many who are farre their superiours. And I take it, that he sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be their best friendes, who by telling them their wantes, can bring them to some humilitie. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <hi>Maister Cartwright</hi> is to thanke <hi>Doctor Whittakers</hi> for signifiyng his iudgement, touching that his great bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell of shreddes: which some rashe, and fond men doe so greatly admire. It is most certaine that although the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of Parasites, doth seeme to bee pleasant: yet the woundes of a louer are much more profitable.</p>

worlde stand very much vppon the auncient fathers, and bragge of their authoritie exceedingly. As <hi>Cartwright</hi> doth in these words most vntruly: <hi>We propound nothing</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the scriptures doe not teach: the writers both olde and newe, for the most part affirme, and the examples of the primitiue Churches confirme.</hi>
               <note place="margin">T.C. lib. 1. pag 7.</note> Did euer any manne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>Cartwrightes</hi> credite? who (considering what hath beene noted out of his bookes in this whole processe) doeth not pittie him, with all his harte, to heare him so farre to forget himselfe? Hee is a manne of good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which maketh mee to woonder at him. It is sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great pittie that euer hee was so maried vnto his Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe. For, it hath vtterly ouerthrowne all the good partes that bee in him.

            <p>Howe truely Maister <hi>Cartwright</hi> affirmeth: that he and his fellows do propound nothing but that the old writers, for the most parte doe affirme, and the examples of the primitiue church confirme: I trust it hath in part already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto you in sundry places, but especially in the 5. as I saide, and in the 27. Chapters. I haue heard some Councellers at lawe, vse the verye like course of speach: when notwithstanding the cause hath falne out most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against them, yet they haue cried out: Oh my Lord, wee haue these and these olde euidences to shewe, such and such depositions doe make for vs verye manifestly: wee haue yet many witnesses to bee examined, and thus they will proceed with many cracking wordes: as though there had beene nothing which had made against them.

               <note place="margin">T.C. li. 1. p. 113.100.99.</note> and <hi>Socrates:</hi> where they make mention of priests. I was once purposed to haue set downe the places themselues, which they so violently peruerte, to bolster out such theyr ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraunt falshood: and to haue aunswered them. But then I remembred howe effectually that had beene done allready by diuers learned and woorthie menne: and of late more fully and largely by two especiall persons, whose books one of them is in printing, and the other presently comming to the presse: and therevpon I altered my mind in that point.

            <p>Vppon some occasion falling out: maister <hi>Cartwright</hi> affirmeth,<note place="margin">T.C. lib. pag 183.</note> 
               <hi>that if the now Lord Arch-bishop of Canterbury had read the ecclesiasticall stories, hee shoulde haue founde easiely the Eldership most florishing in Constantines time: vz.</hi> in hauing then such Bishops and Elders as hee fancieth to himselfe. For he must bee so vnderstood.<note place="margin">D.W. pag 652.</note> To whome replie being made, that he should bring but one ecclesiasticall historie, that affirmed so much: after some three or fower yeares, hee brought two: vz. the historie of Magdeburge, and Eusebius. His testimony out of the first he setteth down in these words. <hi>The centuries must needes haue told him, that the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:775:197"/>
same orders and functions of the church were in that time which were before.</hi> And what would he inferre hereof? Surely if hemeane honestly, and doe not dally with the word (<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>) refering it further then the Centuries meant it, which was but to the age, that succeeded the Apostles, he could not haue directed a man, to any history now extant, that doth more directly confound his assertion. For there the authors of that history, doe most plainely affirme: that by and by after the Apostles death, <hi>necessitas coegit person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum gradus aliquos constituere et conseruare:<note place="margin">Cent. 2 de gub. eccl. Chap. 7.</note> necessity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled (the fathers then liuing) to ordaine certaine degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the church and to conserue them.</hi> This is most directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Cartwrights</hi> assertion: although for mine own part (to note it by the way) I thinke the Apostles, knowing the necessitie mentioned, had taken that order before. But to follow the said historie. There were <hi>three degrees then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</hi> say the said authors: vz. <hi>Episcopatus, presbyterium, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conatus: the degree, of Bishops, of priesthood, and of Deaconship.</hi> For the proofe whereof they cite <hi>Ignatius, Eusebius, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret, &amp;c.</hi> and the very place of <hi>S. Ierome</hi>: where he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how for auoiding of schisme, one was chosen amongst the ministers, to haue preheminence ouer the rest, and to whome the name of Bishop was peculiarly then attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And as concerning the priests or Elders they doe shew it out of <hi>Eusebius, Nicephorus, Irenaeus, Iustine, &amp;c.</hi> that their office was to <hi>preach the Gospell, and to administer the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.</hi> The Centuries thus we see; will not serue M. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> turne,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> to the iustifying of the florishing estate of his Eldership in Constantines daies.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is manifest (saith he) that the churches were gouerned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Constantine by Bishops, Elders, and Deacons: by that

For M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> running still his old biace, would haue men to thinke, that by Bishops, <hi>Eusebius</hi> meant so many parishe-ministers, and by priests or Elders, his said counterfaite Aldermen. And his authoritie is so greate amongest his sectaries, (who professe their <hi>Gleaninge</hi> after him,<note place="margin">1 Pag. R.B. sea. paos. 50.</note>) that what-so-euer he bringeth, they take it vpon his credit, and so runne on with a conceite, that not onely all other authorities, brought by him, out of the auntient Fathers mentioned, are truely by him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and applyed, but that also euen this place of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,</hi> is to bee vnderstood, as here he woulde haue it. Wherein surely they are much to blame, to depend so much vpon any mans credit. If they them-selues had euer read, either the Fathers, or the ecclesiasticall histories, they coulde neuer possibly, haue beene miscarried so palpably.</p>
            <p>A frinde of mine hauinge some talke, not many yeares since, with Maister <hi>Cartwright,</hi> about this place of <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> alledged and expounded by him, as you haue heard: vrged him verie earnestly, that he woulde indeede, tell him truely; whether hee (beeinge a man of learninge, and so coulde not bee ignorant of Eusebius meaninge,) did not sinne; euen against his owne conscience, when
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:775:198"/>
he cited that place, to such an ende and purpose, as hee had done. His aunswere was, that hee did not: and that hee was still of the same minde therein, that hee was before. Why Sir, replyed my friende. As <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> sayeth: that there were an infinit number of Elders and Deacons, which came to the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> with the 250 Bishops:<note place="margin">Socrat. lib. 1. cap. 8.</note> So it is reported by <hi>Socrates,</hi> that in the sayde Councell, it had beene decreed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops &amp;c. (but for <hi>Paphnutius,</hi>) that Bishops Elders &amp; Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, shoulde haue companied no more with their wiues: <hi>Quas cum erant laiui in matrimonium duxissent,</hi> which they had married, when they were lay-menne. And now must wee expound <hi>Socrates</hi> in this place, as you doe expounde <hi>Eusebius</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth <hi>Socrates</hi> meane by priestes there, your manner of lay Elders? was the Councell bent, to haue debarred such men from their wiues? Speake your conscience truely I pray you. Maister <hi>Cartwright</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered againe: that hee verily thought in his conscience, that by priestes there, <hi>Socrates</hi> vnderstood the saide Elders, and that the Councell meant, to haue seperated them from their wiues. And this reason was: because within a while after there was some question, whether Subdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons might marrie. My sayde friende replied againe, that hee was verie sory to heare his aunswere: and that he verily thought, the like interpretation of <hi>Socrates</hi> wordes, was neuer made before, nor would euer be made (hee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,) by anie after him. And so they parted.</p>
            <p>Afterwardes my sayde friend, findinge that when hee told some persons of great place, how M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde the said words of <hi>Socrates,</hi> they would hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him, but supposed rather that he had mistaken them: did write a letter vnto him, desiringe him most earnestly
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:775:198"/>
that if he c<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>otinued in the same mind he left him, he would be content to returne vnto him, in writing, some further reasons thereof, then formerly he made at his being with him. Maister <hi>Cartvvright</hi> hereupon, writ backe againe vnto my friend (I haue his letter in my custodie) excusing himselfe, that through want of bookes, he could not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his expectation so fully as he would. But for the point,<note place="margin">T.C. Lett. 18. Mart. 15.90.</note> I speake of, thus he writ. <hi>Touching that it seemeth strange vnto you, that the gouerning elders should haue bene in danger to haue bene forbidden mariage in the councell of Neece: I thought I had satisfied you, in alleaging, that not long after, there vvas great hold amongst the councels, vvhether Deacons, yea Subdeacons, should be married</hi> So as now, that which before stood only vpon the credit of the relator, is readie to be shewed vnder maister <hi>Cartvvrights</hi> hand, as it hath alreadie bene to diuers of this disciplinarie disposition: who (as I haue bene informed, and partly do know) all of them, haue vtterly signified their great dislike of that point. And yet either he must of necessitie so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret <hi>Socrates,</hi> or els be driuen to giue ouer <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and so both he and all his Aldermen, to take their leaue of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall histories, and bid them adieu.</p>
            <p>But yet there is another thing in maister <hi>Cartvvrights</hi> sayd letter, which is very fit for you to vnderstand, that so you may see how he foileth himselfe. <hi>One thing</hi> (sayth hee vnto my sayd friend) <hi>in your letter, I thinke you mistake me in: that you esteeme that I should hold a bishop and a minister of the vvord, all one, in the times of the Nicene councell. For notvvithstanding that I hold, that in the Apostles time, and vvith S. Paule, it is all one to be a bishop and to be a minister of the vvord, yet it vvere a foule ignorance in me, if I should not haue knovvne, that long before the councell of Neece, the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:775:199"/>
name of bishop vvas for the most part appropriated to one in a church.</hi> C<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>osider I pray you, how the man was mistaken? If by elders, <hi>Eusebius</hi> should haue meant his counteirfet laie rulers, must he not then by his 250 bishops most necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue meant so many parish ministers, pastors or parsons, except he will say that there was no such ministers there, which were as new a paradox as the rest. But how agreeth this? of the difference he confesseth betwixt a bishop and a minister of the word, long before the councell of Neece, with some other of his sayings else-where in print, such as there are.<note place="margin">T.C. l. 1. pa. 99.</note> 
               <hi>The bishop that Ignatius speaketh of, vvas but the minister of a particular congregation.</hi> Againe, <hi>Ciprians Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop vvas nothing els, but S. Pauls bishop, that is one that had cure and charge of one flocke.</hi>
               <note place="margin">T.C. l. 1. p. 100.</note> Again, <hi>the bishop vvhich S. Ciprian speaketh of, is nothing els, but such as vve call pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, or as the common name with vs is, Parson, and his church vvherof he is bishop, is neither diocesse nor prouince, but a congregation vvhich meet together in one place, and bee taught of one man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ioine these things together, and see what a Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mawfrie ye haue. May not a man misdoubt, that maister <hi>Cartvvright</hi> is not yet resolued of his owne opinion? Haue not his scholers great cause to reioyce in glaining after so constant an author? What can he pretend to salue his credit withall? Hee will neuer secke a refuge for shame out of these words, <hi>vz. For the most part.</hi> As though he should thus expound S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> where he saith, that when some began to hold of Peter, some vpon Paule, and some vpon Apollo (which was as I take it, in the Apostles times) it was then decreed throughout all the world, that for auoyding of schismes, one minister, who was called a bishop, should haue authoritie and iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:775:199"/>
ouer all other ministers in his diocesse, that is true (should <hi>Cartvvright</hi> say) throughout all the world, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept at Antioch and Carthage (two little hamblets) where <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> were but plaine parsons, euen like the parsons of Hitchin and Newington.</p>
            <p>Not many yeares since a friend of mine was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a certaine purpose, to contriue the cheese matters in controuersie about the pretended discipline, into certain questions. And it is pertinent to the matter I now speake of, to acquaint you with two of them. The first (because of the pretence which is made, as you haue heard, of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers) was this.<note place="margin">A Question</note> 
               <hi>VVhether can it bee shevved out of any ancient father, out of any councell, either generall or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall, or out of any ecclesiasticall historie, for the space of 1500 and od yeares, euen from the Apostles times, till of late, that in the ordinarie distribution of church-officers (since that time euer vsed) into Episcopos, Presbyteros, &amp; diaconos, Bishops, priests, &amp; deacons: vvhether can it (I say) be shevv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this vvord Episcopus, that is, Bishop, vvas at any time taken there, and vsed by the churches in any countrie, for a common and vsuall name to all ministers of the vvord and sacraments, vvithout, distinguishing thereby any one of them from another, or vvas: it not euer vvithin the time li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited taken and vsed only in the said distribution, for one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the ministers of the vvord and sacraments, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned the rest both of the ministers and people vvithin their circuits limited vnto them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This question with the rest was sent to maister doctor <hi>Raynolds</hi> in Oxford, to the intent he might returne his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them, which he forbare at that time to do, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of certain other businesse that he had in hand. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, maister doctor <hi>Robinson,</hi> (his especial &amp; most familiar

               <hi>I haue</hi> (sayth he) <hi>mainteined it in the pulpit, that the titles of honour vvhich vve giue to bishops, are no more repugnant to the vvord of God, then it is for vs to bee called vvardens, presidents, prouosts of colleges.

            <p>The second question before mentioned, being as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning priests or elders, was, as it followeth. <hi>VVhether can it be shevved out of any ancient father, out of any councell ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generall or prouincial, or out of any ecclesiastical historie, for the space of</hi> 1500 <hi>&amp; od yeares, euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostles times, till of late, that in the sayd ordinarie distribution, since that time euer vsed of church-officers, into episcopos, Presbiteros, &amp; Diaconos, Bishops, priests and deacons, whether I say, can it be shevved that the vvord presbyter, priest, or elder, vvas at any time taken and vsed for certain meere lay men, as crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, husbandmen, citizens, gentlemen or noblemen, such as should be chosen for a yeare or tvvo, to be assistants vnto the ministers of the vvord, for the better gouernment of the church, as to haue authoritie vvith others, to ordaine and impose their hands vpon a minister of the vvord and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to bind and lose sinnes, &amp;c. vsing in the meane time their seuerall vocations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they did before, and ceasing after the said one or tvvo yeres, vvithout any offence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be any longer presbyteri.

Now in the meane while, according to the order which hitherto I haue kept, it shall be sufficient for me, that the three sayd doctors, men well accounted of with maister <hi>Cartvvright,</hi> and his adherents, and such as will not bee thought to speake any thing partially, may deliuer their opinions, as touching this matter. For to my vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they are as direct in this point, what the word <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteri</hi> should signifie in the ancient fathers, as they were before, in the other of Bishops. If in the sayd ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the name of Bishop be appropriated to one that had a greater dignitie than was common to all ministers, and that by the name of Bishops, they neuer vnderstood the pastors of euery parish, as doctor <hi>Robinson</hi> sayth. If in the primitiue church, and in the Fathers language, they were called Bishops, that were the cheefe, and presidents ouer the rest of the priests or elders, euen such as our Sauiour himselfe, by the holy Euangelist S. Iohn, doth call angels, as doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> affirmeth. If by ancient vse of speech he was onely called a Bishop, which in the scriptures is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> If the elders that were subiect to these gouernours, were of one order and authoritie with them, in preaching the word, and administration of the sacraments, as doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> hath written, against the Iesuits: doth it not follow most necessarily, that all the Clergie being deduced into three degrees, <hi>vz.</hi> of Bishops,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:775:202"/>

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:775:203"/>
three of the especiallest men that <hi>Zosimus</hi> could find out, for such a purpose) did deale most expresly against the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Affrike,</hi> for the prerogatiue and iurisdiction of the see of <hi>Rome.</hi> In all the which contention, notwithstanding the sayd factors were such excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men, &amp; vsed the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of al the wit and learning that was in them, yet they could not find any one argument, in all the scriptures, nor in all the fathers, nor in all the world, whervpon they might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, but did wholy rely vpon a pretended cannon of the councell of <hi>Neece.</hi> Which cannon, after much trouble, many letters written, and answers receaued, was prooued to their faces, by the said <hi>Affrica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> bishops, to be a most false and a counterfeit cannon. At this time these arguments for the Popes authoritie had neuer bene heard of.

He neither vrged them with the Iewes Sanedrim, nor with their sinagogues, nor with tell the Church, nor with the elders that rule wel, nor with any such persuasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. It is true, that although when hee first deuised that plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, 1537. I suppose he had not thought of many places in the scriptures, wherevpon he might build it, yet before his sayd practises with them of <hi>Zuricke,</hi> 1553, &amp;c. hee had in some of his commentaries and other writings, made mention of those places specified: but yet hee had done it very modestly, rather thereby to prooue his owne plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to be lawfull, than to impeach the forme of church-gouernment, allowed of and established, in any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed churches. So as, when he dealt with them of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurine,</hi> for as much as he himselfe was persuaded that the forme of discipline then at <hi>Geneua,</hi> was not onely in it selfe lawfull, but for that place also, most fit and conuenient, he alleaged not any one text of scripture for the continuance of it there, but onely shewed what mischiefe would ensue in that place, if it were abolished: and therefore craued their assistance in manner and forme, as he gaue them direction.

And (as I take it) the reason thereof is this: because they haue found this phantasticall deuise, magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and extolled so exceedingly, by a most lewd applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all those places of scripture (in a manner) vnto it, which are written of the spirituall gouernment of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghost, in the harts of the faithfull (as hereafter it will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeare vnto you) that they almost care for no other points, so as they can bable of discipline, and whet their tongues like rasors, to wound all those that do impugne it.</p>

Maister <hi>Beza</hi> acknowledgeth <hi>Caluin</hi> for his maister, and doth euermore tearme him <hi>doctissimum inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretem, the most learned interpreter.</hi> And maister <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvright</hi> expresseth as much, but yet more fully.

            <p>This is then a controuersie betwixt vs.<note place="margin">T.C. l. 3. pa. 40.</note> Maister <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvright,</hi> and as many as cleaue vnto him, do affirme, that <hi>the eldership vvas ordained, &amp; in practise before the lavv.</hi> We denie it.

So likewise I do say againe, to as many as depend vpon maister <hi>Beza,</hi> if they will ioine with vs in the same issue, as reason is they should, maister <hi>Caluin</hi> being their leaders maister, and the most learned interpreter of the scriptures.<note place="margin">Beza. de presb. pag. 104. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Beza,</hi> and all such as are tied to his sleeue, do hold it (as I suppose) as an infallible ground for discipline, <hi>that Moses did institute this</hi> (pretended) <hi>eldership,</hi> which we denie: and let maister <hi>Caluin</hi> be the iudge. A number of places are brought out of <hi>Moses</hi> bookes, and out of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> by <hi>Beza, Cartvvright,</hi> &amp; all their schollers: for the proofe of such an eldership to haue bene in those times. But we are fully resolued, that all those places which they bring for that purpose, are wrested from their right meaning, and do constantly denie, that there was euer any such el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership in being, in those times. And therein also wee say, let maister <hi>Caluin</hi> be the iudge. Although peraduenture there may be diuers, that will refuse to stand vpon this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as attributing more skill in the scriptures to <hi>Beza,</hi> and to themselues, then they do vnto maister <hi>Caluin</hi>: yet <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvright</hi> is surely bound, to stand to his offer. Now then, what <hi>Caluins</hi> iudgement is in all these points: it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to be considered. Surely you haue heard it before in the fift chapter.<note place="margin">Cap. 5. pa. 81.</note> The summe whereof is this: that the sayd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended eldership was neuer thought of in the world, till after the captiuitie.

Chr. 19.8. <hi>Iere.</hi> 19, 1. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 8.1, &amp;c. where there is speech of elders, senates, and seates of iustice. Maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> you see hath giuen sentence against them, and doth in effect with <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi> expound all those elders of the people, &amp; all those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistories or senats (for ought I can find) to be ciuile officers, and ciuile courts, appointed for the ciuile gouernment of that people and nation. Besides also in the place of <hi>Leuiticus</hi> concerning the priests office, of putting a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the holy &amp; the vnholy, between the cleane and the vncleane (from which words maister <hi>Beza</hi> is enforced to set the institution, and iurisdiction of his eldership) maister <hi>Caluins</hi> exposition is there in like maner altogether against him, and wholy agreeth with <hi>Erastus</hi> mind. <hi>vz.</hi> that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Moses</hi> meaning was (as it is word for word set downe by the prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi>) that the priests should teach the people out of the law what was holy, what vnholy; what cleane, what polluted: and that as <hi>Malachy</hi> saith, the priests are and ought to be the interpreters of the law. Now, if maister <hi>Beza,</hi> maister <hi>Cartvvright,</hi> and the rest, will stand to maister <hi>Caluins</hi> iudgement, who is so excellent an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of the scriptures, what shall become of their elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship? Neither <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>Chronicles, Ieremie,</hi> nor <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> can helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and to haue <hi>Erastus</hi> expositions thus iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and theirs reiected, I suppose they will not indure it. Their only shift then, &amp; plea must needs be, as I take it, that
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:775:207"/>
first wher they extolled M. <hi>Caluin</hi> so highly, for his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the scriptures, their meaning was alwaies to except themselues, and secondly as concerning their offer, that they are yet content (if we wil, to refer it to M. <hi>Caluins</hi> iudgement, whether there ought to be an eldership or not in euery parish. Marrie for the proofes that must vphold it, for the time of the institution of it, and for such matters, therin they will leaue him, as neuer meaning to be iudged by him in those points, which is, as though the eye and the eare should say, the one that it could see better, &amp; the other that it could heare better, then he himselfe that made, both the eye and the eare. Wel, I am fully persuaded, that if M. <hi>Caluin</hi> were now again at <hi>Geneua,</hi> but for 3 or 4 daies, and should find M. <hi>Beza</hi> with al his partakers, <hi>Cartvvright, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> &amp; the rest, so mightily plunged for the maintenance of his deuise, as that they shuld be driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to run into <hi>Egypt,</hi> some into the wildernes to mount <hi>Sinay,</hi> some they know not whither, and al of them to run so far out of his paths, he would be greatly offended, &amp; much amased at the matter: could he take it in any good part, that <hi>Beza</hi> spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, being a man who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had made such choise of, to be a principal defender of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sistoriall discipline, should by his intermedling with the gouernment of other churches, haue pulled so many men vpon him, as that for the defense of his own at home, he should be driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to seeke the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of it in <hi>Leuit.</hi> 10. v. 10. &amp; either there to hunt it out, or to giue it ouer in the plaine field.

            <p>Many things haue bene spoken of throughout the whole course of this booke, which might be fit for this place, as their iarring and disagreement in euery chapter, almost hitherto, which alwaies doth rise, because that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them in effect (if he account himselfe to bee any body) will writh and expound the scriptures, as occasions serue, and his affections do moue him. The most of those places in the new testament, that maister <hi>Caluin</hi> dooth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, of pastors and preachers only: <hi>Beza, Iunius, Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvright,</hi> and others of the disciplinarie mould, (and no men els) do wrest, and violently draw them vnto their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen.<note place="margin">1.

Hereof you may see more in the sixt chapter, where they ascribe vnto them, all those names, that since the Apostles times haue only bene giuen to the ministers of the word. Maister <hi>Caluins</hi> authoritie is little regarded in this behalfe, euen of those men, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him the best interpreter of the scriptures that euer was in the world, these 1500 yeares. <hi>Cartvvright</hi> being pressed sometimes with maister <hi>Caluins</hi> authoritie, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding certaine places, to be meant of pastors and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the word, where he will needs thrust in amongst

So as both maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> and <hi>Gallasius,</hi> doe thinke, that here Christ speaketh, <hi>de te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stibus admonitionis, of the witnesses of admonition.</hi> And <hi>Gallasius,</hi> amongst other reasons for him selfe: alledgeth this. <hi>Non dicit Christus: voca testes, qui rem viderint &amp;c. Christ sayth not, call such witnesses as sawe the trespasse when it was committed: but take one or two. Vnus certe testis ad rem probandam non sufficeret: but one witnes</hi> (who may serue as after hee saith, to prooue a mans contumacie or repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) <hi>is not sufficient to conuince a man of a fact,</hi> if he deny that euer hee committed any such fact. Maister <hi>Caluin,</hi> being asked his iudgement hereof, by the ministers of <hi>Neocomum,</hi> as it seemeth: writ vnto them, after this sort: <hi>Quod postea &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cal. epist. Neo com. 55.</note> 
               <hi>That which followeth</hi> vz. <hi>(if hee heare thee not) hoc nostro iudicio intelligendum est, non de testibus delicti, sed admonitionis: This in our iudgement must bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode, not of the witnesses of the fact, but of the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Against this interpretation; heare now what <hi>Beza</hi> &amp; <hi>Alexander</hi> haue to saie. If this interpretation (saye they) should bee good:<note place="margin">Beza de presb. pag. 51, Gal, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Alex.</note> consider then, what inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences would followe of it: I will set downe two; and so referre you to <hi>Beza,</hi> for the rest. It maye fall out oftentimes (saie they in effect,) that the partie delinque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, confessing his fact to him, that came first vnto him, to admonish him of it, wil afterwards, when he shal bring one or two witnesses with him, denie that euer
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:775:211"/>
hee eyther did, or confessed anye such deed? And what then? Besides, it maie well inough come to passe, that hee vnto whom a man shall come, in such a charitable sorte, to admonish him; maie burst foorth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a choller, and saie, that hee is slaundered: and so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the said man (for his godly minde) into the law, as a slaunderer, make them witnesses of his pretended slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that came to be witnesses of his admonition. For these reasons therefore,<note place="margin">Alex. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Gal. Beza.</note> and for some other; <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> will not admit, that Christ should speake heere of such priuate offences, as none knew but one, but of such us that there might bee some witnesses of them, if the offenders should denie them. So as now in both their iudgements: Christ doth speake in this place, <hi>de testibus facti, of the witnesses of the fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Peraduenture you can bee heere content, to heare some aunswere to these obiections. They seeme to bee of great difficultie, and to carrie some matter with them:<note place="margin">Gal. con, Alex.</note> which may preiudice mayster <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasius.</hi> But what should men talke of difficulties, when the trueth appeareth. <hi>Incommoda et inconuenientia non soluunt regulam: Incommodities and inconueniences doe not</hi> (sayth <hi>Gallasius) dissolue a generall rule.</hi> It maye bee that the partye maie denie his facte, as it hath beene sayde. If hee doe: hee is to bee lefte to the great Iudge. Yea; but hee will take the Lawe against the Admonitioner: as a slaunderer of him. Hee maie doe so indeede (sayth <hi>Gallasius</hi> againe): and I haue seene experience of it. And there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedie but this: the graue men, that were brought to bee witnesses of the admonition, must
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:775:212"/>
tell the Iudge the whole matter, and for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they were brought to the plaintiffe. Whereby the Iudge, maye easilye vnderstande the iniurie offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and then, if he fauour the Church, hee will send the partye to the Eldershippe, or Ecclesiasticall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: or else <hi>vz.</hi> in effect, that the defendaunt in that action, must beare it off, with his heade and shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>It is no meruayle then you see; that our reforminge Generation, should crie out so mightelie, for the newe forme of discipline: it is so substantially compact toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at such great vnitie in it selfe. Vnto these caterbraules, and pittifull distractions, I might adde a great heape of other confusions: all of them procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge from such intollerable presumption, as is vsed in the behalfe of that Minion, by the peruertinge, and false interpretation of the sacred Scriptures. But I haue been too tedious alreadie in this matter, and therefore to grow towardes an ende of it. Of all the places of Scripture, which they pretende, to make for such partes of their discipline, as is disliked by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande</hi>: as either for their Iewish <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> their parish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, their vnpriestlie Aldermen; with their priestlye functions, their <hi>Geneuian</hi> presbyteries, or Elderships: of all the places of scripture (I saie) which they bring, for that purpose, I professe vnto you as in the presence of God, that I cannot find anie one, but by one meanes or other, they haue cast such a colour vpon it, as was neuer knowen in the Church of Christ, amongst all the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent godly Fathers, from the Apostles times, till these our troublesome and presumptuous daies.</p>
            <p>Well, It is not inough for men to alledge scriptures,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:775:212"/>
except they bring the true meaning of the Scriptures. For as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith: <hi>Heresies, and erroneous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">August. tract. in Iohn 18.</note> 
               <hi>doe not otherwise spring and grow vp, nisi dum Scripturae bonae intelliguntur non bene, &amp; quod in eis non bene intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, etiam temerè &amp; audaciter asseritur: but when the good Scriptures are not well vnderstood: and because that which is not well vnderstoode in them, is notwithstanding rashlye and boldly affirmed, to be the meaning of them.</hi> There was neuer anie thing hitherto so fondly deuised: but the authors of it, did euer pretend they had Scripture for it. For else saith Sainct <hi>Ierome</hi>:<note place="margin">Hier: ad Tit. 1.</note> 
               <hi>the garrulity of such persons, non habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret fidem, would neuer haue wonne any credite.</hi> All sectes and Schismes, haue risen (for the most part) vppon discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. And this a man may obserue, in the writinges of the auncient Fathers: that as many men doe marrie, and so beget children, before they know how to keepe them: so commonly it hath fallen out, in new &amp; strange opinions. Through pride and vanitie, they haue beene rashlie begotten: before the authors of them did know how to maintaine them. Marrie, when once they had engaged their credits, by broching of this and that, then they euer laboured, not to submitt them-selues and their opinions, vnto the trueth: <hi>Sed vt sibi scriptur as ipsi subijce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: but</hi> (as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) <hi>that they might bringe the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>

               <hi>Memorable is that rare, but right christian example of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odosius the Emperor, publicklye humbling himselfe vnder the hande of God, and professing his repentance for his bloodye commaundement, and the cruell execution done accordinge to it. A president well worthy so christian a prince, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Discipline, yea and of the whole church of that age. Such Theodosians haue the reformed churches of this age to speake off, to the high honor of almighty God, and his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye begotten sonne Christ Iesus, king of kinges. Wherein a Prince of bloode royall, and by birth within a step or two to one of the greatest Kingdomes of these partes of the worlde, and for princely giftes, worthy to haue borne a Scepter in his hande, and a Diademe vpon his heade, when as another Dauid, hee hadde been ouerthrowen by Sathan, and committed things, for which the name of God was euill spoken off, endured to heare the seruant of God (as Dauid did Nathan) to rebuke him: &amp; lamenting his offence openly before the publicke assembly of the Church, desired pardon of God, and reioyced heauen and earth, men, and Angels with his conuersion from sinne, to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the liuing God blessed for euer, Amen. Whose chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian president, both a crowned King, and also a worthie sonne of that noble Father, haue followed, after that by terror of as barbarous crueltie, as hath beene commited in any age, they had done otherwise then Daniell, and the yonge princes brought: vp with him did, in a case not vnlike to theyrs, &amp;c.</hi> Hitherto

               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:775:218"/>There is great difference we may perceiue hereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the opinions of these two sorts of men; concerning this presbyteriall forme of the new pretended discipline. If any that are possessed with the former mens conceites, shall lightly esteeme what this second sort of fellowes doe hold or thinke of their platforme: he is to be put in mind, that they are not so lightly to be regarded. Diuerse mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters well reckoned of heretofore for their learning: are lately fallen from <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and his secte, into another more new frenzy of <hi>Barrowisme.</hi> In a letter that was taken not long since: I find some points to this effect. <hi>The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Midleborow and Flushing, haue both giuen ouer their vnlawfull callings. M. Iohnson hath written a most learned dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, concerning the striking of a newe couenaunt, with some conferences had in that country.</hi> It is also reported, and I am perswaded, by that which I haue seene, that the report is true: vz. that maister <hi>Penry,</hi> is entered in like manner into this new kind of couenant. A matter, that would seeme very strange vnto me: but that I know the nature of schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes, to bee of such giddinesse: as that no one thinge will content them longe. What stirres hath hee kept in England: first with his two supplications vnto the high court of Parlaiment: his humble petition vnto her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie: his exhortation vnto the gouernours and people of Wales: his Theses and libells, which came out vnder the name of Martin and his children (wherein hee with his companion a certaine gentleman were, if not authors, yet especiall dealers) and then with his treatises out of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. That reformation (hee meaneth the setting vppe of <hi>Cartwrightes</hi> Eldershippes) is no ennemie to our state: his humble motion (if not made by him, yet procured by him to bee printed): His discouery against D.B. and
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:775:219"/>
with diuerse other pamphlets, and most rayling discourses? In all which bookes hee hath shewed such earnestnesse in the behalfe principally, of <hi>Cartwrights</hi> discipline: that hee hath offered to pawn his life many times for the iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Which course of his, by reason of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous vehemency, wrought very greatly, (as all menne knowe) with certaine rashe and vnstaied persons, who haue bene since so farre ouercaried, with an opinion of the argumentes there vsed: as it hath beene giuen out many times by them, that they coulde neuer bee aunswered. And yet now if he bee one of Barrowes church: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all his former writings and arguments, you haue heard his opinion, out of his brethrens mouthes: both of <hi>Cartwrights</hi> presbyteries, and of all those likewise that doe maintaine them.</p>
            <p>Some will saie peraduenture: that for <hi>Penry,</hi> they neuer made anye reckoning of him. And it is well. But what if one of their Patriarckes beginne to wauer? How if mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Trauerse</hi> bee inclined that way? For mine owne part: I doe not thinke him so simple a man. But yet you shall heare what goeth abroad amongest that brainesicke gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: as it is set downe in the letter before mentioned. <hi>There is good hope</hi> (saith the writer of it to one of his frends) <hi>of one Maister Trauerse about London, (as I thinke) but howe farre hee is come, or whereat hee stayes, I cannot at this time certifie you.</hi> But howsoeuer hee standeth affected, you may assure your selues, that this latter schisme groweth on very fast. In somuch, that as <hi>Cartwright</hi> and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren beganne, eight or nine yeares since, to set vppe, and put in practise, theyr <hi>Geneuian</hi> discipline: so doe these newe vpstartes, beginne to erecte in diuerse places, theyr Barrowish Synagogues, and I knowe not what cages of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:775:219"/>
franticke schismatickes. One <hi>Collins</hi> a man amongest them, not vnlearned (as it seemeth) doeth write in this sorte hereof. <hi>Ecclesia potenti eius dextra adiuta, &amp;c. The church assisted with the mightie right hande of God, hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen ministers: Maister Iohnson for her pastor: Maister Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood for her Doctor: Maister Studly and Maister George Knife, for her Elders: Nicholas Lee and Christopher Browne for her Deacons. The other assembly also (wherevnto are added, Iohn Nicholas: Thomas Michell: Iohn Barnes, and some others with mee.) with Gods assistaunce, will beginne out of hand, to create vnto it selfe ministers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus they goe on forward headlong, god knowes whether. I am perswaded, that if there be not good order taken in this behalf, there wil some mischief grow of it The number of them doth encrease daily more &amp; more. And for the repressing of them; it will not be sufficient (in mine opinion) to vse the ordinarie course by the ecclesiasticall censures or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission. For they are entered into a league a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest themselues, of all manner of secrecy for the not detecting one of another in any of their proceedinges, when by great chaunce some two or three are met with all. If you finde any writinges amongest them: you may thereby learne some thinge peraduenture: otherwise they will confesse nothinge. And offer them an oathe, not to accuse themselues, but to purge themselues; and as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, to signifie their knowledge in those pointes, they are to bee examined off,<note place="margin">Rh. Test. act. 23.</note> as touching other mens factes: they haue gotten the <hi>Iesuites</hi> doctrine (as you may see it in their annotations vppon the <hi>Rhemish Testament,</hi> and amplifyed lately by <hi>Cartwright</hi> and his crue,) that they may neyther accuse themselues, nor their brethren, for doynge of those
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:775:220"/>
thinges, which they allow off themselues. If their nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber should increase; so as they mighte bee able to doe, and set vp what they list, according to one of their grounds. vz. <hi>without any longer stayinge for the Magistrate</hi>; and so shoulde breake forth into open rebellion; they might by no meanes be examined vpon their oathes, because they will say they haue done nothing, but what they were bound to doe; and that therefore, they might detect no man, wherby to bring him, within the compasse of any law, for doing his duety.</p>
            <p>But I will not enter into this matter: the cause I mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, is the increasing of this schisme, and their league of fidelitie one to an other. I sayd the number of them would daily bee augmented: and you shall haue my reasons, why I thinke so. They are verily perswaded, that they holde almost nothing, but what <hi>Cartwright</hi> and his schollers haue taught them. One of them hath taken vppon him, to prooue the chiefest of their newe assertions, by their more auncient propositions. <hi>I like well</hi> (saith Greenewood in a letter intercepted) <hi>of the arguments you haue drawen against them from their own groundes.</hi> Againe: <hi>Surely it were a notable worke, and no doubt might doe much good in these times, for some one that God hath indued with sound iudgement and sharpe sight, to gather the maiors or antecedents, of all those scattered pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets of Penries or Martins &amp;c. and put newe minors or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions vnto them: and so in one little nosegay, but as bigg as an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack, to turne them vpon them-selues, and present them vnto them, for an answere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two especiall points, for the which we dislike them: their departing from our churches, &amp; the framinge to them-selues of a Church of their owne. And for both these points, heare what they may say, and what indeede in
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:775:220"/>
effect they doe say, and consider withall of these thinges, which here I will set downe: as sufficient matter for a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that Barrowe may worke vppon. Thus our holy consistorians haue written; vz. <hi>That the gouernement of our Church is by the popishe</hi>

               <note n="h" place="margin">Gilby pa. 2.</note> 
               <hi>that so we put no difference betwixt truth and falshood, betwixt Christ and Antichrist, betwixt God and the Diuell.</hi> A dunghill of such like sayings, might be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped together, which they haue cast vp, out of the froth of their zeale. Where-vpon nowe <hi>Barrowe,</hi> takinge his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage; doth frame his argumente in this sorte. It is not lawfull for the children of God to submit themselues to the gouernement of Antichrist, nor to ioyne themselues, to those congregations, which haue in their seruice, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but confusion, and in the Lordes Supper put no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene God and the Diuell. But such is the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Church of England, and such are their congregations. And therefore wee may not submitt our selues vnto that gouernement, nor ioyne our selues to their congregations. If now, the minor were true, which he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth from the Consistorians: you see how the argument would follow. So that as <hi>Penry</hi> &amp; some others haue done allready: let all the sort of the other crue adde but <hi>Barrowes</hi> maiors, vnto their owne minors: and foorthwith in this first pointe they are become meere <hi>Barrowistes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as concerning the second point wherein (as I sayd)
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:775:221"/>
we disalow them: it is, their framing to themselues a new Church platforme. Which doth thus farre agree with <hi>Cartwrightes:</hi> that they must haue (forsoothe) in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie assembly, their Pastors, Doctors, Elders, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and that the Church new framed after their fashion, must haue all the authority that <hi>Cartwright</hi> doth challenge to his Elderships: of dealing in all matters of maners and doctrine, and in executing their censures against any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son without exception whosoeuer. The chiefe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are betwixt them, are generally two. The first is vz: that whereas <hi>Cartwright,</hi> could haue been conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue erected his Elderships in euery parishe, taking them as nowe they are: they say the parish assemblies are popish and vnlawfull: they would haue them dissolued: and they will haue their Elderships set vp amongest no people, but first they must enter into a new couenant. The other chiefe difference in like sorte I take to bee this: that <hi>Barrow</hi> in all his platforme, will haue the people to ioyne with their Elderships further, then <hi>Cartwright</hi> doth allow of. And for his opinion heerein hee relyeth altogether in effect vpon <hi>Cartwrightes</hi> grounds.</p>
            <p>It is not vnknowen what a plausible course our English Disciplinarians haue taken, that thereby they might the more easily drawe the people vnto them. Hee that will peruse the first admonition, which <hi>Cartwright</hi> maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<note place="margin">T. C. lib. 1. pa. 35. lib. 2. pag. 325.121.221.225.226.229 &amp;c.</note> and consider withall, the places of his bookes that are noted in the margent: shall well perceiue, howe earnestly they intitle the people to a wonderfull interest in Church matters. They tell the people, that they are greatly iniuried in this and that: that they ought to choose their Ministers: that imposition of handes should bee in their names: that the censures of the Churche
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:775:221"/>
were to bee executed with the peoples consent: and what must bee done almost, but the people must haue an oare in it. Howbeit: (all this great shewe of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people notwithstanding:) <hi>Cartwright</hi> by snat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches heere and there doth so powder his matters:<note place="margin">T. C. lib. 284.193.213. &amp;c.</note> that in effect hee giueth them onely an emptie bottell to play withall. For his Eldership (forsooth) <hi>must go before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all their actions</hi>: that is, as though hee should haue said: what the Elderships thinke meete, those Angels, those interpreters of God, those tribunall seates of Christ, the people in all reason ought to content themselues with it, and to giue their consentes vnto it.</p>
            <p>Now heereupon <hi>Barrow,</hi> proceedeth. Hee taketh <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrightes</hi> reasons in the behalfe of the people: but denieth his shiftes to be currant, whereby he would take that from them againe, which hee had before giuen vnto him. And thereupon doth raile vpon him, and all the rest of that asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation: for such their dealing and abusing of the people. <hi>These reformistes</hi> (saith Barrow) <hi>for fashion sake giue the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a little libertie to sweeten their mouthes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bar. Discoue. pag. 195.</note> 
               <hi>and make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue they should choose their owne Ministers: yet euen in this pretended choyce do they coozen and beguile them, leauing them nothing but the smoakie winde of election onely.</hi> Againe. <hi>The counterfait reformistes, they woulde exclude the Church from the censures: assuming them onely into their owne handes: either into the Priestes handes with his silly presbytery or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership, which hee ouerruleth at his pleasure in euery particular congregation: or else into their Synodes and Councelles, which haue power ouer all Churches, and euerie member and action thereof to excommunicate and absolue, to make &amp; depose, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and abrogate without the priuitie or consent of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:775:222"/>
&amp;c. And thus they subuert the libertie of the Church: and peruert the ordinance of Christ.</hi> And againe: <hi>Howe vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall are those members, which thus separate and seclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bar: against Giff. pag. 76.</note> 
               <hi>yea rather sequester and seclude the whole from them: and arrogate and assume the publicke dueties and power of the whole, into their owne handes: as though God had giuen all giftes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: and they had no neede of others? And thus puffed vp with preheminence of theyr owne place, and excellencie of their owne giftes: they despise all the rest, as base, ignoraunt, vnworthye to bee in their consistorie, to haue any voyces of consent or dissent there, alledging them to bee tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, contentious, factious, vngouerned, ignoraunt, inclined to the worst, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is (as I said) the second especiall difference (as far as I can see) betwixt the Elder Consistorians, and these new Schismaticks. Wherinto how easily a man may fall, that hath digested, the <hi>Geneuian</hi> and <hi>Cartwrightian</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces made against our Bishops for the peoples interest: I commit the consideration of it, to your owne discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So that (as I saide): I say againe, and againe: that if good order be not taken, this schisme will daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and growe to be daungerous. But doe I call it a schisme? The worde is too milde. They are indeed all the sorte of that infection, a compounded masse, of (I knowe not) how manie heresies: but principally they are <hi>Donatistes</hi> in some respect, and meere <hi>Anabaptistes</hi> in some other. I haue thought vpon it a hundreth times, and haue meruailed at it: that the now L. Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> could foresee so directly, what would be the issue of the first admonition. If you would bee pleased to read his exhortation, before his confutation of that admonition:
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:775:222"/>
You shall find, that, what he hath there written long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this monster was hatched in England, he could not, if he were to write againe, wel write otherwise then there he hath done: sauing hee might say, that the mischiefe which then he foresaw, would come to passe, by reason of the boulstring of it, by those, that should haue had more wit and iudgement, is now apparantly beginning to shew it selfe to as many as haue eyes and wisdome to see.</p>
            <p>Surely those men, that haue bene made instruments heretofore, to commend vnto the whole realme, I know not what bookes and platforms, tending directly to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ouerthrow of the present gouernment of the church of England, with the whole forme of our seruice of God, and all our lawes, orders, ceremonies, and priuileges thervnto appertaining, &amp; to haue had the <hi>Geneua</hi> discipline establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in place thereof: may greatly reioice at their good discretion: considering, that if then they had preuailed, we had admitted of that forme of church-gouernment which the very cheefe supplicators, &amp; instigators of them at that time, do now themselues condemne (as you haue heard) into the pit of hell, and so they might haue bene as readie to haue set forward this second deuise, as they were for the former.</p>
            <p>But men I hope will be more carefull hereafter, then to be carried away with euery noueltie, if it haue but any shew of reasonable probabilitie. And maister <hi>Cartwright,</hi> with the rest of his chiefe adherents, might certainly do God and the church great seruice, if without any longer standing vpon the maintainance of their own credits, they would be content to confesse their former ouersights, in laying downe those false principles, wherevpon the new hereticks do build, and acknowledge the truth, <hi>vz.</hi> that
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:775:223"/>
the present gouernment of the church of England, as both holy and Apostolicall, and that the reformation of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on already made, by her maiesties most princely care and heauenly direction, is such a reformation (abuses there may be, and it were heresie to dreame of any puritie) as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good Christian ought to praise God for it, from the bottome of his heart: and not onely to allow of it, but to maintayne and defend it, both with his goods and life. Maister <hi>Cartvvright</hi> began well in his epistle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Harrison</hi>: but he should do better if hee would so continue and proceede forward. One extremitie is best discerned by the other. <hi>Barrovves</hi> folly may teach him wisedome. The consequence doth often shew the grossenesse of the Antecedent. And many learned men haue bene brought by the importunitie of such kind of aduersaries, to see their own mistakings, and so to grow vnto a farre better moderation. As euen in the chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and in this very cause of discipline, it will appeare I trust vnto you.</p>

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:775:223"/>
their obstinacie, to continue in the course which they haue begun, for the maintenance of their credits: they are not throughly agreed almost in any thing. To tell vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of a matter that should be necessarie, and withall to confesse in effect, that they know not what it is: should argue in my opinion, some very great rashnesse and follie. When maister <hi>Caluin</hi> dealt with maister <hi>Bullinger</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for their good fauour and friendship towards the continuance of his new deuised platforme in <hi>Geneua</hi> (as you haue heard at large in the second chapter) there was not a word (you may sweare it) of any necessitie, that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other churches should be enforced to submit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to that deuise. M. <hi>Caluin</hi> himselfe at that time (as I am persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) did not so much as dreame of any such matter. A very graue and learned man of the French nation, hath faythfully reported, that when the forme of the <hi>Geneua</hi> discipline, was first admitted of by the ministers of <hi>France,</hi> in one of their cheefest synods, which hath bene kept there of late yeares about the Church affaires, it was not then receaued by them in that assemblie, as a necessary or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der prescribed by Christ, that ought alwaies to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, but as a forme of discipline, conuenient and fit for the afflicted estate of their churches in those times, which might afterwards bee altered and changed, as occasions should require.</p>
            <p>And because you might not doubt of the certayntie of this report. You shall vnderstand, that the author of it was himselfe present in the sayd assemblie, and not a man of the meanest account amongst them. With whom also, another great person of that countrie, a man of state and great learning agreed, when hee affirmed to one of very good place in England (as the same partie
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:775:224"/>
hath told me) that the forme of discipline which is now receaued by the French ministers, was neuer meant by them to be otherwise admitted of, then for an <hi>interim,</hi> till things might be better considered of, and ordered. These testimonies I vrge no further then as reports: neyther would I haue you to giue any further credit vnto them: then as you shall thinke meet, vpon this my bare relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Howbeit whether the persons specified, did make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such report or not: it seemeth to mee, that the thing it selfe is true, which they are sayd to haue reported.

If I should deliuer these two points vnto you vpon my bare word, without any further proofe, I thinke you would scarsely beleeue me. Heare therefore my vvitnesses, not to be excepted against I tell you. And first for the pretended necessitie, maister <hi>Beza shevving the true markes of the church</hi> (saith <hi>Cartvvright)
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:775:225"/>
addeth to the tvvo former,</hi>

            <p>It is much that hath bene hitherto noted for the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded necessitie of this Sauoyan church-gouernment: but that is most memorable that <hi>Trauers</hi> affirmeth of the French churches, &amp; of the churches of the low-countries, <hi>vz.</hi> in effect that it is become alreadie to be one of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of their creed. Thus he setteth downe their words following, contayned (as hee sayth) in their confessions. <hi>VVe beleeue the true Church ought to bee gouerned by that policie and discipline vvhich our Lord Iesus Christ hath ordayned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Confess fidei minist. Gal. Act. 25.</note> 
               <hi>namely so that, there bee in that, Pastors, elders, and deacons.</hi> And the Churches of the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: <hi>VVe beleeue that this true church ought to be ruled and gouerned by that spirituall policie, vvhich God himselfe hath taught vs by his vvord:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 30.</note> 
               <hi>so as there bee in it, pastors and Ministers, Elders and Deacons, vvho may make the Seigniorie of the Church.</hi> By that which here is sayd,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:775:226"/>
being compared with that which hath bene sayd before, of our Englishmens pretended deacons (how they are altogether excluded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing any place in their seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orie) it appeareth that they disagree from the Churches of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and of the Low-countries, in some of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of their beleefe. But you shall heare maister <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers</hi> very graue collections vpon the sayd two of those Churches confessions: <hi>It is very vvorthie the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that these Churches,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Def. of eccl. Discip. p. 21.</note> 
               <hi>vvherein there are an infinite number of godly men, &amp;c. in such a confession as they declare their fayth in: haue thought it a necessarie article, to set dovvne this point of the pollicie or disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the church: and that in declaring of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they say not vvhat they suppose, but vvhat they beleeue, vsing the same vvord vvhich they do vse in the articles of faith and doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The papists talke much of the Colliers faith, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued as the Church beleeued: but what the church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued hee knew not. And truly as <hi>Trauers</hi> sayth, it is worthy the obseruation indeed, that seing (as I sayd, and haue at large shewed it in the former chapters) there is not a church in Europe, which hath receaued that plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, that can tell for her life, which way as yet to turne her selfe, for the full maintainance of it: there should bee any that would presume to thrust it into their beleefe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they do approue of the Colliers faith, and will say, they beleeue whatsoeuer maister <hi>Beza</hi> beleeueth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though neyther he himselfe, nor they do know, what hee beleeueth in that point. I do rather therefore incline to thinke that <hi>Trauers</hi> wresteth their words against their meaning, and that they only purposed by that phrase of speech (we beleeue) to shew, but their minds and opinions
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:775:226"/>
of that forme of discipline, not suspecting that any man would inforce that they euer meant therby to make it an article of their beleefe. But howsoeuer either they or any other haue formerly meant in the heat of their desires, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their beloued platform, and so haue gone much too far in vrging the necessitie of it, as being an essentiall note of the church: yet vpon better aduise, it seemeth that they are growne a little more coole.</p>
            <p>Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> loued the eldership as well as the best of them, because it was the workmanship of his own hands: but yet he thought it not meet, to make it an essential note of the church, or a matter of the importance of saluation. The Anabaptists with whom he dealt in his time,<note place="margin">Cal. instruct. ad v. Anaba.</note> kept him from that extremitie, and made him to reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce other churches, and to acknowledge them for such churches of Christ, although they wanted the forme of his censuring discipline, as that it was not lawfull for any Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, to separat himselfe either from their assemblies, or from the receiuing of the Lords supper with them. But if any so did, he assigneth him his place amongst certain old hereticks. <hi>Olim duae fuerunt haereticorum sectae, &amp;c. In times past there vvere</hi> (sayth he) <hi>tvvo sorts of hereticks, vvhich troubled the Church greatly. The one sort of them vvere cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Puritans, the other Donatists. And both of them vvere in the same error, that these dreamers are in: seeking for a Church vvherein there should vvant nothing that might be desired. Therefore they diuided themselues from the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall society of Christians, least they should be defiled vvith other mens impurities. But vvhat came of it? Dominus eos cum tam arroganticoepto dissipauit. The Lord himselfe scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them, vvith that their proud attempt,</hi> Where, by the way, it is meet to be obserued, that a man may sticke so fast
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:775:227"/>
to the <hi>Geneua</hi> discipline, as he may prooue himselfe to bee either a puritane, or a Donatist, or both.</p>
            <p>Maister <hi>Beza</hi> in like maner, by reason of some oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which hath bene made against the <hi>Sauoyan</hi> platforme, is growne as it seemeth to some kind of moderation. For speaking of the pretended necessitie of it: hee sayth, that the <hi>doctrine onely,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bez. de pres. pa. 119.</note> 
               <hi>vz. vvhat vve are to beleeue, is absolutely necessarie</hi>: and also further addeth, that <hi>seeing a man some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may be saued vvithout the participation of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the same may bee sayd much more of the vvant of ecclesiasticall discipline.</hi> Now verely we are to thanke him, he hath done much for vs. We may be saued though the memorie of this discipline were vtterly buried. But the point which I chiefely note, is this: that there is great difference in maister <hi>Bezaes</hi> iudgement, betwixt the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of the first two notes of the church, and this third, of his own deuise. And therein he giueth in effect, the flat lye to maister <hi>Cartvvright,</hi> for charging him to hold: that all the said 3 notes, as they are notes, were equally necessarie. And <hi>Trauers</hi> also is checked by his good maister, in that he wil needs make, as it hath bene said, the censures of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sistories, to be in the same absolute degree of necessity, both with the word and sacraments. But I wil follow M. <hi>Beza</hi> whilest I haue him in his good mood. <hi>The vvhole church vvanted circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cision in the vvildernes</hi> (saith he) <hi>&amp; vvhilest they vvere in Babylon, they neither had temple nor sacrifices, and yet neuerthelesse, they ceassed not to be the people of God. And the same may then be said much more of the ecclesiastical discipline, vz. Ecclesias vt illa careant, tamen ecclesias verè pias &amp; Christianas esse posse, si doctrinam praecipuoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum pura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ac sincera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> habuerint, That the churches that vvant that discipline, may notvvithstanding bee indeed godly and
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:775:227"/>
Christian churches, if they retaine the doctrine of the cheefest grounds, pure and sincere.</hi> Now if <hi>Beza</hi> will giue this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of a church that wanteth both his discipline and the sacraments, hauing but only the principall grounds of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: what should he say of those churches which haue not onely a better discipline, then that which hee vrgeth: but also the said sincere grounds, with the doctrine &amp; true vse of both the holy sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, in as great reuerence, at the least, as they haue them at <hi>Geneua</hi>? You shall heare him what he is driuen to say, of the present estate of the church of England. The places haue bene cited in the eight chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to another purpose. He must be pardoned to come in with his <hi>If</hi>: because any thing from him, that soundeth not after the <hi>Geneua</hi> tune,<note place="margin">Beza contr. Sarrau. pa. 111.</note> is very much. <hi>But if the churches of England</hi> (sayth he) <hi>being vnderpropped vvith the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Bishops and Archbishops do firmely abide, as this hath happened in our memorie to that church, that shee hath had men of that order, not onely vvorthie Martyrs of God, but most singular pastors and doctors: fruatur sane ista singulari Dei beneficentia, quae vtinam illi sit perpetua, Let her enioy this singular goodnesse of God, vvhich I pray shee may so do for euer.</hi> And in another place, speaking likewise vvith some good tearmes of the Church of England, and of our Archbishops and Bishops: he turneth himselfe cleane about,<note place="margin">Beza ibid. pa. 127.</note> and sayth, that <hi>they of Geneua do not prescribe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny church to follovv their peculiar example, like vnto ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant men, vvho thinke nothing vvell but that they do themselues.</hi>

            <p>He seldome hath vttered a truer speech. But how these sayings do agree with that which he hath sayd before in the third chapter, you may not curiously scanne it. Indeed he should seeme to be farre now from his former opinion, when he sayd in effect:<note place="margin">Epis. 24.</note> 
               <hi>That it vvas to little purpose for any
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:775:229"/>
church to admit of the gospell, and to reiect his discipline.</hi> But he writeth in mine opinion, as (it hath bene sayd of old time) some courtiers in the world do vse to speake: that is for the most part, as the present occasion serueth their turnes. Such companie they may fal into, as they wil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to the skies, whom not past an hower before, they had in an other company depraued peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture most egregiously. And maister <hi>Beza,</hi> you must imagine, hath bene an old courtier, and knoweth wel what policie mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. Plaine dealing certainly is best: but often-times it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out that it is not the readiest way, for hammering and busie farre reaching heads, to compasse their purposes. If this excuse do seeme too simple, let any that list make a better. No man doth wish it more heartily (as I thinke) then my selfe, that maister <hi>Beza</hi> should thinke well of the present church-gouernment established in England: so he do it plainly, faithfully, and directly, which will not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen (I feare it) in hast. Neither haue I alleaged his former words to that purpose, as though I tooke all that for gold, which he can make to glister. The point I prosecute, is this: that you might perceaue, how they begin to leaue off from vrging the <hi>Geneuian</hi> platforme, with such important necessitie, as formerly they haue done.</p>
            <p>But most of all it pleaseth me to see, how maister <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvright</hi> draweth homeward. For as the Anabaptists by their madnesse kept maister <hi>Caluin</hi> within some good compas, and as maister <hi>Beza</hi> hath bene compelled in some sort, to retire himselfe from his former eagernesse: so assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly the phrenetical giddinesse of these our new vnbride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led schismatickes, who for pretended puritie are many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees beyond al the Sauoyan disciplinaria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, hath wrought a miracle (to my vnderstanding) vpon M. <hi>Cartvvright.</hi> For
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:775:230"/>
heare him, how for feare of falling into flat <hi>Donatisme,</hi> he was fain to plead against one (that had bene his scholer) in the behalfe of the church of England, so bitterly before by himselfe impugned.<note place="margin">Th. Cartw. to Harrison.</note> 
               <hi>The ordinarie assemblies</hi> (sayth he) <hi>of those vvhich professe the gospell in England, are the churches of Christ</hi>: which he proueth in this sort. <hi>Those assemblies vvhich haue Christ for their head, and the same also for their foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are Gods churches. Such are the assemblies of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, therefore, &amp;c.</hi> Againe, <hi>they that haue performed vnto them the speciall couenant vvhich the Lord hath made with his churches, of pouring his spirit vpon them, and putting his vvord into their mouthes are the churches of God: but such are the assemblies in England, therefore, &amp;c. Hereunto may be added</hi> (sayth he further) <hi>the iudgement of all the churches of Christ in Europe, all vvhich giue the right hand of socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the house of God, vnto the assemblies vvhich are in England.</hi> Againe, to prooue that the church of England is the church of God, notwithstanding it want the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded discipline: he vseth this distinction: that <hi>as it is in mans body, so is it in this matter, there are certaine parts essentiall, and such as vvithout the vvhich a man cannot stand, and some seruing either to his comlinesse, or to his continuance.</hi> And of this latter sort he maketh the discipline, and lastly he writeth thus: <hi>To say that the church of England is not the church of God, because it hath not receaued this discipline, me thinks is all one vvith this, as if a man vvould say, It is no ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, because it hath no vvall: or that it is no vineyard, because it hath neither hedge nor ditch.</hi> Thus farre maister <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which his manner of speech, you find a very great alteration, from his ancient stile. And as concerning the necessitie whereof I intreat, the wind you see is turned.
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:775:230"/>
There is no more necessity in England of the <hi>Geneua</hi> plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, then that euery citie in this realme should be walled about. And besides, the pretended discipline is become not to be any longer of the essence of the church, but as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the comlinesse of it. But how these things will accord with the premises, &amp; namely his subscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before mentioned, to the new booke of discipline, where the same discipline is made to be essentiall, or whether maister <hi>Cartvvright</hi> hath changed his iudgement againe, since he writ that answer to <hi>Harrison</hi>: I will leaue it to be discussed by them that know his vnreuealed mind better then I do. In the meane time, that which he hath graunted, I thinke it meet to take hold of. And this I will adde vnto it, that if maister <hi>Cartvvright</hi> would but conferre with some that haue skill in fortification, to know of him whether an old thicke wall of lime and stone, made many hundred yeares since, or a new sleight wall slubbered ouer, and wrought with vnte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pered morter some few yeres ago, whether (I say) of these 2 walles are of better defence for any citie: I should be in good hope, that he would in short time, leaue the disciplinarie walles of <hi>Geneua,</hi> and content himselfe with the ancient fortifications of the church of England, and the rather because he seeth (as I sayd in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) what a giddie and itching humor, his nouelties haue bred, in the vnstayed sort of many fantasticall people.</p>

            </p>
            <p>These are singular commodities indeede which these Elderships woulde bring with them, if these men might be trusted. But haue they brought forth these fruicts and effectes in those countries where they are established? or are they but vaine wordes of ambitious men, that by such godly pretences doe little else but seeke their owne glory? Consider I pray you, what very learned and graue men haue written in other countries of these, and such like men as these and their fellowes are: together with the estate of some of those countreis, wher they haue their Elderships.</p>
            <p>Maister <hi>Bullinger</hi> writing to a Bishop in England of our English innouators,<note place="margin">A letter Mar. 10. 1574</note> saith thus. <hi>They imitate in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion those seditious Tribunes of Rome, who by vertue of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grarian Lawe, bestowed the publicke goods, that they might pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately inritch themselues: that is, that you</hi> (meaning the Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops) <hi>being ouerthrowen, they might succeede in your places, &amp;c. But they goe about to erect a Church which they shall neuer aduaunce as they desire: neither if they shoulde, can they euer be able to continue it.</hi> And after in the same Letter. <hi>I woulde to God, there were not in the Authors of this Presbytery, libido dominandi, an ambitious desire of rule and principality: Nay I thinke it ought especially to be prouided for; that there be not any high authoritye giuen to this Presbytery, &amp;c. Whereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thinges might bee saide: but time will reueale many thinges which yet lie hidde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Maister <hi>Gualter</hi> in like sorte, writeth thus to the Bishop of London, for the time being. <hi>Many doe vrge in these daies vnder a plausible name of Ecclesiasticall Discipline, I know not what a platforme, without the which they denie that any Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:775:232"/>
can continue. But I doe greatly feare least they bringe vs in an Aristocratie, which will shortly degenerate into an Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchie: and become the beginning of a newe Papacie. For their onely labour is to sette vs vp a Presbyterie, whereinto certaine honest men, are indeede admitted: but yet so as the Ministers will doe in a manner what they list. It was of late decreed by the Ministers at Heidelberge, that no man should bee admitted to the Lords Supper: except he first offered himselfe to the Pastor. For</hi> Paules <hi>rule is not helde sufficient there: vz. that euerie man should trie himselfe. The Elders did not agree to this decree: but yet notwithstading it is vrged in the name of the Presbytery, nay of the whole Church &amp;c. But there was not long since suche an example of a new tyrannie there, as may iustlie feare anie, that careth for the liberty of the Church. There is there an</hi> Helue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian <hi>the Gouernour of the Colledge of Saint</hi> Denis, <hi>as innocent and godly a man as liueth. Howbeit</hi> Oleuianus <hi>the Pastor war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him by the crier of the Presbyterie, in the name of all the Elders, that he should not come to the Lordes Supper: adding this cause, that he could not admit him, absque animi sui offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione, without the offence of his minde. The party tooke this dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (as it was reason) in euill part: and defireth to know what he hath committed that deserued such a punishment. But they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him not otherwise, then that they continued in the same minde. Whereuppon he offered a Supplication vnto the prince Elector, that he would compell them to shewe the fault, if there were any, that he had committed. But vntill this daie he coulde extort nothing else in effect from them. This is their goodly order: this is their Discipline. Quare video nobis seriò vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landum esse, ne ex Romanae hydrae vix domitae vulneribus noua capita pullulent: wherefore I see we are to be vigilant, least new heads doe budde out of the woundes of the Romish hydra, scarsely yet subdued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="454" facs="tcp:775:233"/>And in another letter,<note place="margin">Marche 16. 1574.</note> to the Bishop of Ely, of the same matter he addeth: that the Prince Elector vppon the said parties complaint, did moue the Elders to shew, what hee had committed that they dealt so with him. <hi>Sed ne hoc ab illis impetrare potuit: but he could not preuaile so much. Marry at the last</hi> (<hi>saith Maister</hi> Gualter) <hi>being many waies more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly vrged thereunto, they fell to coining of lies, and perswaded the Prince that he abstained from the Lords supper of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: and now of that his voluntary forbearing woulde knowe the cause of them. Many such things are done which it woulde be too long to rehearse. Seeing they beginne in this sorte, hauing not as yet any full possession of their new kingdom, what shall we thinke they will doe: si merum imperium obtineant, if they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine an absolute authority?</hi> By this letter also it seemeth, that long since, by <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> meanes, notwithstandinge Zwinglius withstood it: there was such a like forme of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment erected in <hi>Basill: but shortly after</hi> (saieth Maister <hi>Gualter</hi>) <hi>he was compelled to giue it ouer againe, learning by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that he had attempted a matter of greater discommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then profite. I cannot therefore dislike of them, that oppose themselues to these endeuours, who so busily in these daies pleade this for matter, &amp;c. There are in Germanie, and in another cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I doc containe my selfe that I may not bee saide to haue begonne the fight: Sin illi Classicum cecinerint, but if they sound vp the Alarum, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not choose but defend the doctrine of truth, and the libertie of the Church: not doubting but that many will ioyne with mee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same <hi>Gualter</hi> also again in another letter to the said Bishop of Ely.<note place="margin">26 August. 1574.</note> 
               <hi>I shall not neede to vse many wordes what I
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:775:233"/>
thinke of your innouators, sith I haue done it in my last Letters. And surely I am greatlie confirmed in my former opinion, by the examples, which such like innouators in Germany doe bring forth. Video enim illis hominibus nihil ambitiosius, nihil inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentius, nihil ineptius, fingi posse. For whereas there are many thinges most wickedly done by them daily, yet they are not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to pretende the zeale of God, in excuse of those thinges, which contrarie to the worde of God they deuise both wickedly and maliciouslie against the seruauntes of Christ. But as farre as I canne coniecture: many by whose counsaile and assistaunce the frame of this Discipline was chiefely erected, are nowe asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which Maister <hi>Gualter</hi> writte the same yeare to Bishop <hi>Sands,</hi> is most pertinent. <hi>I vnderstand that the strife amongest you, procured by certain turbulent innouators, doth wax hotte, and that they are gone so farre, that vnder the plausible ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of good order and Discipline, they desire the whole gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pollicy of the Church of England to be vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen. Surely I should meruaile at the immodesty and wilfull desire of contention in these men: but that I see the same in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise else-where, especiallie in all those places where the authority of the bretheren of Geneua is so greatly esteemed, that Geneua is accounted the Oracle of all Christendome. God hath indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned that Church with diuerse excellent gifts,: and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters thereof: amongest whom, Maister</hi> Beza <hi>I haue alwaies reuerenced and loued, and doe so still. But yet I would wish them modestiùs &amp; humiliùs sapere, and not seeke to draw their shooe vppon euery mans foote, &amp;c. What hath beene done in the Palsegraues Countrey, I writte vnto you before. Surely the state there as touching Discipline, and the gouernement of the Church, all men that come thence doe say, it is worse then it was before, and it is sure, that many doe repent that they euer admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:775:234"/>
these mens counsaile. But yet the Geneuians doc still ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to thrust that their Discipline vppon all Churches. And if they shall deny this, they may bee sufficiently conuinced by the Booke of Theologicall examples, that</hi> Beza <hi>published this other yeare: that they suggest their arguments and councels not onelye to you Englishmen, but in like sorte to the Germans, Phrisians, Polonians and Hungarians: whereby amongest those that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greede well together before, rixae &amp; turbae enascuntur, brawlings and quarrels doe arise, &amp;c.</hi> And so hauing signified what troubles the innouators beyond the seas as well as in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land doe procure to the Church, he moueth the Bishop to doe as he and Maister <hi>Bullinger</hi> did: that is, to moderat such busie wittes (as they might) for a time. For (saith he) <hi>spero aedificium hoc nouae Disciplinae breui propria mole ruiturum, quando satis constat, iam eius pertaesos esse, qui priús illud admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur. I hope the frame of this new Discipline, will in short time fall, of it selfe: considering that many are nowe become wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of it, that had it, before in admiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An other likewise, a <hi>Gantois,</hi> a very graue and learned man, as well acquainted with this Discipline, as Maister <hi>Cartwright</hi> is: being desired to write his opinion, whether it had brought forth such effectes in Holland, as is before pretended it would doe in England, for aunswere saieth. <hi>Is any man able to repeate the monstrous Heresies and errors, that Holland doth nourishe &amp;c. vnder the shadowe of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med religion? this is aimed at, vz. that the turpitude of all blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, being couered with this cloake, may lie hid, and that it may be lawfull without controlement, if anie list to recall the old Paganisme, or to professe Mahomets Religion, or what worse is, if there be anie thing worse.</hi> Againe, <hi>the Magistrates haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded the Church-goods. The Ministers haue little allowaunce. There is no respect of the study of Diuinitie. The Magistrates
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:775:234"/>
doe suspect the forme of Ecclesiasticall gouernement: first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>use they feare, least it will degenerate into a worse tyrannie then the Spanishe Inquisition: Secondly, for that they see a new Senat of Elders in their Townes, to exercise with the Ministers, a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of manners without lawes, but such as they make themselues, and without anie lawfull forme of Iustice. The olde Canon law is abrogated, and the Magistrates will allow no new. For they feare, that the new would prooue worse then the olde. Besides, they will not committe the fame of themselues and theirs, to the arbitrement of ignoraunt men, such as for the most parte their Elders are, who may abuse their authority rashly, and laie such an infamy of adulterie or other grieuous offence vpon a mans backe, as hee shall not afterwards easily cast from him. The Ministers desire, that the Magistrates would punish those that disobey their commaundements: which they will neuer doe, except they may first by due course of law heare the cause, they of that Consistory being either actors or accusers: and that, the Ministers and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders refuse to doe, &amp;c. Besides, some of the Ministers themselues that professe the Gospell, are not free from those swarmes of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, which doe make their hiues there, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in an other letter, speakinge of the generall euent of that kinde of discipline: <hi>Vereor ne exemplum Geneuensis ecclesiae, et quarundam aliarum ecclesiaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quae eam secutae sunt, maiorem quàm vulgo creditur perniciem ecclesiae adferat: I feare least the example of the church of Geneua, and some other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that followe her, may bring greater mischiefe to the Church, then is commonly beleeued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One William Hart a minister, &amp; the preacher, not long since at <hi>Emden, notwithstandinge all their goodly reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in those partes, yet writ in this sort therof, vnto his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret friend M. Field. Corruption by custome is so strong, that none can abide the yoake, and wonder you would, if you sawe what
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:775:235"/>
grosse thinges the best ministers doe cleane deuoure, and those of the middle sort, doe earnestly stande and pleade for. If you did see the confused state of the Churches of these countries: you would say that England, (howe badde soeuer) were a paradise in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison: and yet I haue not forgotten the blots and wantes thereof. The trueth which he speaketh of the Church of England, is to bee imbraced: for the rest, you may ascribe it vnto his factious humors.</hi>

            <p>Hitherto this learned preacher: Whereby a man may see, that some countries may be in as euill a case, that haue the <hi>Geneuian</hi> platforme, set vp amongest them: as some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that care not a figge for it.</p>
            <p>But oh say the authours of the first admonition:<note place="margin">Admo. 1. pag. 13.</note> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation good for <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and can it be euill for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is Discipline meete for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and is it vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for <hi>England</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Againe: Surely God hath set these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples before your eyes, to encourage you to go forward to a through and speedy reformation.<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> And likewise maister <hi>Cartwright</hi>: Whereas maister Doctor would bring vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a foolish paradise of our owne selues, as though we need not to learne any thing of the Churches of <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi>
               <note place="margin">T.C. lib. 1. p. 194.</note> he should haue vnderstanded, that as wee haue been vnto them an example, and haue prouoked them to follow vs: so the Lord would haue vs also profite and be prouoked by their example. Whereunto I make no other aunswere but this: that I pray vnto almightie God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all my very soule, for the long and happy continuance of the blessed example, which this Church and realme of <hi>England</hi> hath shewed in this last age of the worlde, vnto all the kingdomes and countries in the earth, that professe the Gospell with anie sinceritie: and that also of his infinite mercie, not onely the kingdomes of <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>:
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:775:236"/>
but all other Christian kingdomes and countries may taste so plentifully of his heauenly graces, as that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dayly better and better examples to stirre vp ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the right and true pathes of all godly vnitie and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, of heartie and sincere profession of religion, and of such righteousnesse and holinesse of life, as may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the professors of the same. This onely I trust I may say without any offence: that (as I thinke) we haue better causes of incouragement at home to pray for the present forme of Ecclesiasticall gouernment and Discipline, that we may haue it still: then we can finde abroad (the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of this chapter being true) why wee shoulde eyther wish or desire to haue any forraine platformes or practises, of I knowe not what kinde of <hi>pragmaticall</hi> discipline brought in amongst vs.</p>
            <p>A Discipline deuised at <hi>Geneua</hi>; established there by cunning: and obtruded by practises vppon other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. A Discipline, the more it is looked into by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers of it: the moe doubtes and imperfections, they daily finde in it. A Discipline the originall whereof is vnknowne: and therefore hath no warraunt in the worde of God. A Discipline so lately hatched: that as yet it hath no certaine name agreed vpon. A Discipline of that nature: as they know not well how to bestowe her. A Discipline, that banisheth such <hi>Apostolicall Bishops,</hi> as Christ appointed: &amp; admitteth like an adulteresse of those, who indeede shoulde serue her, to haue an equall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement ouer her. A Discipline, that will haue <hi>Doctors</hi> of her owne: and when she hath them, she know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not howe to bestowe them. A Discipline of such humilitie, as forsooth Princes and Noblemen, must bee,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:775:237"/>
but her inferior officers. A Discipline so disdainefull, as she forgetteh the very names of her sayde officers, or at the least knoweth them not, though they be Noblemen or Princes. A Discipline, that wil needs seeke in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for those new kind of rulers; but she is ignorant where to finde their qualities. Whether she would haue them to be Lay-men, or Ecclesiasticall; shee is not yet resolued. A Discipline, that when she entertaines her seruants: cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them of againe at her pleasure, without anye offence committed by them. A Discipline that hauing seruants, doth want a warrant for their imployment: either in their particular, or in their generall offices, which she woulde faine assigne vnto them. She would haue Lay-menne to make her ministers: to be her confessors: and to bind and loose her sinnes. A Discipline, that will needs haue her particular officers, both men and women, after her owne humor: to doe nothing else, but carrie her purse, and wash her feete. A Discipline, that by reason of her traine: would be very chargeable. A Discipline, that hopeth to turne all the Church liuinges, which either are or haue beene (belike) into <hi>Nunries:</hi> and so to become herselfe the Prioresse of them all. A Discipline, that will needes be a new Pope <hi>Ioane,</hi> and haue to deale in all ecclesiasticall causes, either by hooke or crooke: nay almost in all sortes of matters whatsoeuer. A Discipline of such partiality: as what she condemneth in others she approueth in her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. A Discipline, that disdaineth the auncient fathers and generall councells. A Discipline, that dareth to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace any of the new writers, if they take not her part. A Discipline, that seemeth to allowe of nothinge but scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: &amp; yet dependeth alltogether vpon her owne friends
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:775:237"/>
and Synods. A Discipline, that sometime to dazle mens eies withall; can be content, to pretend, that the auncient fathers and councells, doe plead for her estate: but shee doth peruerte them. A Discipline, that to serue her turne doth wringe and wrest the scriptures, this way and that way as she is disposed. A Discipline, that possesseth men with so greate selfe-loue and pride, as for wante of good neighbours, they are faine to take paines to commende themselues. A Discipline, that is contented to bee mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and exalted, against all that is called god vpon earth. A Discipline, that is vtterly forsaken, by many that haue beene her friendes. A Discipline accounted by those, that do stil remaine her best friends, not to be so necessarie, as heretofore she hath beene reputed. A Discipline, that promiseth mountaines: and bringes forth Myce. A Discipline, that is greatly disliked for her pride: her making of debate, where she comes: her taking vpon her like an Empresse to commaund and rule at her pleasure. In these respects, and many other which I could alleadge, she is (I say) a discipline, that is greatly disliked of sundry of her neighbours: and euen of them, who when she was at the last gaspe did reuiue her: little suspectinge that euer shee would haue proued so ambitious a creature: as since by experience they haue found her to be. And therefore for mine owne part: seeing I finde no country as yet, that is so greatly to be enuied for any especiall happines, that this pretended Cherubin hath brought forth or procured, where shee is receiued: I will continue my former praier, that the Church of England, be neuer troubled with such a discipline: but that our olde and present Apostolicall forme of Church-gouernment, vnder her excellent Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:775:238"/>
by <hi>Arch-bishops</hi> or <hi>Arch-builders</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> practised in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, approued by all the auncient fathers and generall councells, and continued in this land since the time, that it first professed christianitie, may together, with her Highnesse, our most Soueraigne Lady, be long &amp; many happy yeares mainetayned, blessed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued amongst vs. The which allmightie God graunt, for his Sonne Iesus Christs sake our Lord.</p>
