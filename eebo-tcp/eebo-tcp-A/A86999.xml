            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Make no queſtion, but you have had a large account given you of the Battle which was fought here in this City, wherein the Mercies of God were very eminent towards us, and is as a Crown to all thoſe bleſſings which the Lord hath vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us formerly. This City is indeed become a ſad Spectacle and was very noyſome, by reaſon of the multitudes of dead carcaſſes, both <pb n="2" facs="tcp:165945:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 18 -->of man and beaſt, (for the Fight was very fierce, and the ſlaughter of the Enemy great) till care was taken for their removal (by Gods bleſſing) to prevent Infection. We hope the Malignants of this place will learn by the preſent calamities, to ſee into their own Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and behold the hand of God upon them in thoſe miſeries which they have drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Themſelves, by their former and later compliances with the Enemie; their remiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Government, their murmuring and complaining of wants; for, under that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in our greateſt extremity, the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scottiſh Armie entred the City, not five pounds could be raiſed among them for preſent ſupply, though now their Plunder be rated at an extraordinary value. His Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the Lord General hath been very noble in all things, and hath infinitely won the hearts of the Inhabitants of this City, who repent them of their former malignancy, and proteſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be faithful to the Parliament, &amp; to live and die in defence of the preſent Government.</p>
            <p>Duke Hamilton is dead of the wounds which he received in the late Fight; a little before he dyed, lying in great extremity with <pb n="3" facs="tcp:165945:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 18 -->the pain of his leg, and every hour expecting to be diſſolved, he declared before ſeveral Officers of the Army, and divers Gentlemen of quality who were preſent with him, That he was heartily ſorry that ever he engag'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament; and that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident his coming into England was contray to the Will of God; wiſhing that he had been admoniſhed by his Grandmother, who Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically told his Father in the Year 1648. when he came with that numerous Scotch Army into England, which was routed in Lancaſhire, that if he did engage againſt England, it would be the ruine of him and his Poſterity; ſaying further, That ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that the Army would be totally rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Family of the Stuarts would in very few yeares be utterly extirpated both in England and Scotland.</p>
            <p>Whoſe words hitherto have proved Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; for his Father being taken priſoner, was beheaded at Weſtminſter, and the ſon mortally wounded in the late Fight here, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yeſterday of his VVounds in this City; he ſeemed very ſorrowful for his ſins, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired thoſe about him to joyn in <pb n="4" facs="tcp:165945:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 19 -->prayers with him to the Lord, that he might find mercy and forgiveneſſe.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners of the Militia are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding their Militia Forces, and with ſome endeavours of ſatisfaction to them, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their willingneſſe in the Parliament's Service; and that in ſo great a number. They are likewiſe careful in ridding the Country of ſtraglers; alſo in ſeizing and ſecuring the perſons and eſtates of ſuch as adhered to the Scottiſh King, moſt of which were Papiſts of this Country; and in Summoning the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to level the new VVorks and Fortifications about the City.</p>

            <p>LIevrenant Gen. Monk is now Maſter of the field in this Nation, all parts falling down before the power of the Parliament of England; yet there is a malignant ſpirit in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they are not to be truſted, onely with an hand of awe over them. The old Cavalier par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty curſe the Presbyterians, and ſay that they <pb n="5" facs="tcp:165945:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 19 -->and their pride and inſolency hath been the cauſe of all this evil that hath befaln their King and his friends; and the Presbyterian party accuſe the old Royaliſts for being ſo heady to run with their King ſo faſt in his own way: But we ſay it is the wickedneſſe of the one, and perfideouſneſſe of the other hath provoked the Lord to humble them. The Lord grant they may make a right uſe of it.</p>
            <p>Here is old (or rather new) howling among the Ladies in Scotland, for their Husbands, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Sons, Friends, that are flam and taken in England and Scotland, and it ſeems ſome of them (like Pilats wife) gave their Husbands warning, begging of them not to go out in this VVar. The Marqueſſe of Arguile would fain make pretence that he hath not been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the late tranſactions, though he had too great an hand in the Treaty with the King, and ſomething ſince. Indeed he had ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it ſeems into the Scots Kings deſigns, that he juſtly began to fear, that if he proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he ſhould find the ſame feward that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſſe had from him and his party, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſo far obſtructed that party that he ſaw deſigned to undermine him, that the very <pb n="6" facs="tcp:165945:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 20 -->common Souldiers have juſled him and abuſed him, as he went along the ſtreets, before the Scots King marched into England.</p>
            <p>The Scots Gentry lay much fault upon their Miniſters, that they preached to them as if the Engliſh Deſignes were far otherwiſe then they find them: But we find much falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in this Nation, yet ſome we hope are godly.</p>
            <p>We have fallen upon ſeverall Parties in Scotland, where they were reſpectively, and every day almoſt ſome priſoners are brought in, or ſome place reduced; ſo that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lord hath wonderfully appeared for us, Montroſſe and Aberdeen have ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
