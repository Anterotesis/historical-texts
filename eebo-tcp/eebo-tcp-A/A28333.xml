            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile in a Charitable deſire of the Churches and the whole Kingdoms Peace, I firſt meditated the matters treated of in theſe enſuing Papers, though but for the Excitation and Encouragement of a leſſer Auditory; and was afterwards perſwaded, that if ſent abroad, they might (through the Divine
<pb facs="tcp:42635:3"/>
Bleſsing) conduce in ſome meaſure to the benefit of more: I was thereupon willing to caſt in this poor mite of mine into the common Treaſury. For this cauſe, and merely to this end, without any other reſpect that my heart knows, or any the leaſt deſire to gall or grieve the Spirits of any; I do here humbly offer my Well-wiſhings of this kind, to the publick view, beſeeching our Gracious God, the God of Love and Peace, ſo to bleſſe my weak (but cordial) endeavours, that they may find in the first place, acceptance with Him, and then (through his power) a prevalency with Them, who together with my Self (though of the meaneſt and loweſt rank) are concerned in this holy and great Affair.</p>
            <p>It is not Ambition, but Reverence, that hath induced me to ſend them thus forth under Your Lordſhips Patronage, and ſo to tranſmit them (as through Your hands) to the Prudent Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Reverend Fathers and Brethren in the Miniſtry; eſpecially thoſe whom it hath pleaſed God, and (next under him) our Dear Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, to recommend unto Your Lordſhips care. Nor do I herein preſume to give Inſtructions, or to preſcribe Rules to them, that are in my own juſt
<pb facs="tcp:42635:3"/>
esteem ſo much my Betters, (alas, who am I, that in ſo Grave and Venerable a Society of Learned men, ſhould harbour but a thought of ſo doing?) No, the bent of my Soul is, with a ſoft and gentle breath to quicken up their Holy Zeal, and humbly to beſeech them (every one in his Place and proper Station) to imploy the choiceſt of their greater and more flouriſhing Abilities, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the allaying of thoſe unkindly heats, and the making up of thoſe deſtructive breaches, which the irregular fancies of this looſe age, (through the juſt Judgement of God upon us for our ſins) have brought upon the Nation, to the downfull (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt) of our Religion, and conſequently the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing of this once flouriſhing, and (let me ſpeak it, on the one ſide without Envy, and without Flattery on the other) truly Apoſtolical Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unity in the Church, if founded upon Truth, is a ſweet Ornament, and a great ſupport: and truly, whatever ſome may conceive, I believe the wiſer ſort will Judge, that a decent and wholeſome Uniformity is a ſpecial help, as to the firſt beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſo to the conſtant preſerving of that Unity. Whereas, on the other ſide, a Lawleſſe Multifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb facs="tcp:42635:4"/>
(ſuch as that was which of late years hath born ſo great a ſway, and by an impetuous violence carried down all before it) may justly be reputed among the greateſt and ſoareſt Enemies of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable accord, which Christianity perſwades.</p>
            <p>How Dolorous and Direfull the effects have been of this many-headed Monſter, to the great diſturbance of our Peace, and the diſſolving (well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh) of that goodly Order which St. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Church at <hi>Coloſſe, chap. 2. 5.</hi> yea, and how much the Un-brotherly contending for ſome fancied particles of a Negative Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in reference to the mere outward Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion f our Holy Things, hath ſharpened, I ſay not only the Tongues and Pens, but the Swords and Pikes of the miſ-guided Multitude, our own dear experience can ſadly recompt, and the late twice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repeated Inſurrection of a Rebellious Crew (whoſe deſign, it ſeems, was to have ingaged us once more in a Deſperate and Bloody War) doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>The truth is, no better Fruit can be expected from ſuch a Tree. And therefore, what leſſe can the conſideration hereof work in us, (after an humble Recognition and penitent Contrition, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb facs="tcp:42635:4"/>
to our own manifold demerits) than a Prudent and Zealous care of contributing what we can toward the Quenching of theſe unnatural and inteſtine Flames, together with our most inſtant and hearty Prayers unto Almighty God, for his Gracious Direction, and Fatherly Benediction, in and upon our diligence and endeavour that way. And, oh that it would p'eaſe the Divine Goodneſſe (in whoſe hand are the hearts of all men) ſo to inlighten our minds, and faſten our affections upon the Fundamental and Eſſential points of Faith and Godlineſſe, that, laying aſide theſe fierce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and heart-dividing contentions about Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial Niceties, we might all meet and joyn together in a juſt and Peaceable Conſormity, and ſo (at once) exerciſe our Piety to God, our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion to Authority, and our affectionate reſpects of love and kindly aſsiſtance one towards another, ever ſtudying (as much as in us lies) the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Unity of the Spirit, in the bond of Peace; the beſt and readieſt way (as wiſe men deem) to ſilence the Clamours, prevent the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and (if the good pleaſure of God be ſuch) to rectifie the Apprehenſions, and reconcile the Hearts of the yet-remaining <hi>Sanballats, Tobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aos,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:42635:5"/>
and <hi>Geſhems</hi> of the time, who by force and fraud, do what they can to interrupt and hinder us (as their Fathers ſometime did that good <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah)</hi> in repairing the Ruines, and raiſing up the Walls of our <hi>Engliſh Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in Order to all this, that Your Lordſhip and the reſt, who labour under you in this part of the Spiritual Vineyard, may thrive and proſper in your Holy Undertakings, the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſo Bleſſe and Crown your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with good ſucceſſe, that his Name in all things may be glorified, his Truth ſetled, his Peace resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, your Souls bleſſed, and the whole Church every day more and more both comforted and enlarged!

            <p>WHen the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were yet in the way to <hi>Canaan,</hi> it pleaſed God by <hi>Moſes</hi> to make known unto them his gratious purpoſe, that when they ſhould be quietly ſeated in that promiſed Land, and be at reſt from all their enemies round about, he would then appoint a Place, where to ſix his Sanctuary, as you may read, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 10. &amp;c. And accordingly his will was, that at ſome certain times of the year, <hi>(viz.</hi> at Eaſter, Pentecoſt, and the feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles) all the Males of the people ſhould come up thither, to perform their religious ſervices unto him, as you may ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 16. compared with the former paſſage. So carefully did, the Divine Wiſdom project for the eſtabliſhment of a well-ordered Uniformity of Religious Worſhip in a ſettled State, to prevent diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and to preſerve Unity among the people.</p>
            <p>After this, for the ſpace of many hundred years, the Iſraelites (notwithſtanding) remained in ſomewhat an unſetled condition; and the Tabernacle, with the Ark,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42635:6"/>
were oftentimes removed (as in a ſtate of migration) from place to place, until the time of King <hi>David.</hi> So long it pleaſed God to exerciſe his peoples faith, and to hold them in an humble expectation of his performance.</p>
            <p>But at length, when the ſeaſon (which God had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined within himſelf) was now at hand, it pleaſed him to make known unto <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Judab</hi> ſhould be the City, and Mount <hi>Sion</hi> the place, where his Ark ſhould reſt, and where alſo he would have a Temple built unto his Name, as you may gather from thoſe expreſſions of his, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 11, 19. compared with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 1, 2. &amp; 78. 67, 68. With much gladneſs did King <hi>David</hi> liſten to this Oracle of God; and accordingly he had it in his heart, to have performed the whole work himſelf in his own dayes: but being commanded of God to leave the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to his ſonne <hi>Solomon,</hi> that ſhould ſucceed him, he contented himſelf as to that particular; only he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for it ſome materials aforehand; and in the mean ſeaſon addreſſed himſelf to bring up the Ark of the Teſtimony from the houſe of <hi>Abinadab</hi> (where it then was) unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which from thenceforth became the ſolemn ſeat, both of Religion, and of the Kingdom. And here by the way we may obſerve the Piety and Zeal of this good King, in that, together with the well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Civil State, he took into his Princely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the right ordering of affairs in reference to the Church and houſe of God.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, he calls unto him the choſen men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo with one unanimous conſent they chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſet upon the work. And although their firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt miſcarried, by reaſon of ſome failing in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, at which God was diſpleaſed: yet their ſecond en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours (which were undertaken with better caution, and more regularity of Devotion) obtained a better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe; for (as we read, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 15, &amp;c.) <hi>They brought up the Ark of the Lord with ſhouting, and with the ſound of the</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42635:6"/>
               <hi>trumpet, and ſet it in his place, in the midſt of the Tabernacle that David had pitched for it.</hi> Their failing at the firſt time was, partly in that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzab,</hi> being but an ordinary Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, preſumed to touch the body of the Ark, which God allowed not to any but the Prieſts: and partly for that (in imitation of the Philiſtines) they carried the Ark upon a Cart, whereas God had required that it ſhould not have been borne, but upon the ſhoulders of the Levites. The error in both theſe was now at this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time reformed, and ſo the work ſucceeded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.<note n="*" place="margin">See 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 12, 13. verſes.</note> So then, though the intentions of Men in med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the things of God be never ſo right, yet the ſucceſs will not anſwer our deſires, unleſs it be managed by ſuch hands, as God hath called and conſecrated to the work.</p>
            <p>Well, now all is right, and on they go, as full of Joy as of Devotion: and to further them in both theſe, the King (as it is conceived by moſt Expoſitors) had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht them aforehand with this Pſalm, with a charge to ſing it by the way, as the Ark of God was thus carrying up unto <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and for this cauſe partly, and partly alſo (it may be) for that it was to be ſung with an elevated voice, it was called <hi>a Pſalm of Aſcenſions</hi> or <hi>Degrees.</hi>

            <p>An excellent Pſalm indeed, and very oppoſite unto the occaſion, whereupon it was compoſed. It is of a mixt kinde, as containing in it expreſſions of ſeveral ſorts: for it begins with Joy and Exaltation; it goes on with Praiſe and Commendation; and then concludes, partly with Exhortation to the People, and partly with Proteſtation for his own particular.</p>
            <p>The Exhortation takes up the two firſt verſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this good Prince profeſſeth his joy for the gratious temper of his people, expreſſed in their chearfull for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, to frequent the place of Gods publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and their reſolution to be conſtant in their holy performances of that kinde. <hi>I was glad</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42635:7"/>
               <hi>they ſaid unto me, let us go into the houſe of the Lord: our feet ſhall ſtand within thy gates, O Jeruſalem.</hi> See here, how much a zealous and well ordered people in the matters of Gods worſhip do contribute to the comfort of their Prince: and how apt a good Prince is to rejoyce in their well-doing, eſpecially of that kinde.</p>
            <p>The commendation follows in the three next verſes, and ſets forth the praiſes of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in a threefold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that is to ſay, Firſt, to the unanimity and ſweet agreement of the inhabitants among themſelves, <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is built as a City that is compact together,</hi> verſ. 3. Secondly, to their devout and holy deportment towards God, <hi>Thither</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Tribes go up, the Tribes of the Lord, unto the Teſtimony of Iſrael, to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord,</hi> verſ. 4. Thirdly, to their care of Juſtice in the equal diſtribution of rewards, <hi>For there</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are ſet Thrones of judgement, the Thrones of the houſe of David,</hi> verſ. 5. Lo here, the three great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and indeed the ſtrong ſupports of a Kingdom, or Commonwealth, Love, Religion and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The exhortation, which he annexeth to both the former, is briefly ſum'd up in the two next verſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he adviſeth them (every one in his place) to ſollicite the Throne of Grace for the confirmation of this their ſweet accord and proſperous condition, without being interrupted by any, either hoſtile oppoſition from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or unbrotherly diſſention from within. The firſt, in theſe words, <hi>Pray for the Peace of Jeruſalem; they ſhall</hi> (or as ſome read, <hi>let them) proſper that love thee,</hi> verſ. 6. The ſecond, in the next words, wherein he adviſeth them to pray again, and ſay, <hi>Peace be within thy walls, and Proſperity within thy Palaces,</hi> verſ. 7. whence we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the favours which God indulgeth to a Church or State, are rendred the more comfortable and laſting by the bleſſing of Peace ſuperadded to them; and that therefore in the midſt of all our enjoyments, we muſt beg that bleſſing at Gods hand, yea and call in others
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42635:7"/>
to concurre and joyn with us in their Devotions for that end.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, the Proteſtation, which King <hi>David</hi> maketh for himſelf, and wherewith he concludeth the whole Pſalm, is ſairly laid down in the two laſt verſes, wherein he ſeriouſly declares his own hearty intentions to practiſe what he did adviſe, and to do in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon what he would gladly ſhould be done of others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. The inference is, <q>as if he had thus ſaid unto the people then about him, You may perceive by what I have already ſpoken, how greatly your forward zeal towards the houſe of God hath affected me to joy: and I have laboured (as I could) to blow up that zeal of yours in a greater flame, partly by minding you of the manifold bleſſings of God upon this place; and partly by exhorting you (as much as in you lies) to promote the peace and welfare of it; that ſo, not only you for your own particulars, but your Poſterity alſo after you, may live happily under the continuance of theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and in your ſeveral ſucceſſive generations all along enjoy this liberty of coming into Gods Courts, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in his holy Ordinances. This I have urged: and yet, I would not herein be miſ-underſtood, as if, while I call upon you for this performance, I my ſelf would be exempted; or as if (in all this) I had no further aym, than only the ſecuring of my own affairs: No ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but I will joyn with you in this good work, and bring on the beſt of my endeavours for it: and that alſo, upon four other and better motives, than my own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal or Domeſtical concernments. I can with truth enough ſay unto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> her ſelf, for whom I plead before you, <hi>For my Brethren and Companions ſake, I will now ſay, Peace be within thee: becauſe of the Houſe of the Lord our God, I will ſeek thy Good.</hi>
               </q>  This I conceive to be the inference of theſe words upon the former: and from hence we may conclude the ſweet temper and candid diſpoſition of this godly Prince, in that, while he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42635:8"/>
commended ſo pious a duty to the obſervance of his people, he was no leſſe forward to lead them to it by his own example.</p>
            <p>And thus having brought you home to the words of my Text, let us now ſtay a while, and take a view of them as they lye; They are elegantly brought in by the way of Apoſtrophe, wherein this good King, though in the hearing of the people, doth yet for the while look off from them, and turn his ſpeech unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his hearty zeal for the promoting of her welfare, together with the motives inducing him thereunto. <q>They are in effect, as if in other words he had thus ſaid, Thy inhabitants, O <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the reſt of thy free Deniſons, whoſe weal dependeth upon thy ſafety, are of my near and dear Relation. I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, firſt as my <hi>Brethren,</hi> not in the fleſh only, but in the faith; and then, as my <hi>Companions,</hi> not meerly in the participation of the ſame outward bleſſings, but in the profeſſion and practiſe of the ſame holy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and therefore, even for their ſakes, as much as for my own, I will now ſay, <hi>Peace be within thee.</hi> Not only, Peace from without, but a bleſſed immunity from the violence of foreign Power; (though that alſo I wiſh) but Peace alſo within by a ſweet accord and loving agreement of thy Children among themſelves. Nay further yet, thou art (O <hi>Salem)</hi> the ſeat of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the place where God hath ſet his holy Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the Ark of his preſence, where alſo he gives forth his holy Oracles, and requireth our Service, and communicateth his Bleſſings unto us his people in a more ſpecial manner: and therefore, even in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, <hi>Becauſe of the houſe of the Lord our God, I will</hi> (yet much more) <hi>ſeek thy Good.</hi> Seek it (I ſay) not by my Prayers only, but by my endeavours too; not only my tongue, but my heart, yea my hand and all, ſhall contribute what they can toward thy preſervation and wellfare.</q> This is (as I conceive alſo) the true
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42635:8"/>
ſtrain of theſe words being indeed no other than a holy mixture of reſolution and reaſon, while he ſayes, <hi>For my Brethren and Companions ſakes, I will now ſay, Peace be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee, becauſe of the houſe of the Lord our God, I will ſeek thy Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Words worthy to be written in Letters of Gold, and to be treaſured up in our deareſt remembrance, that ſo they may ſerve unto us as a pattern, whereby to regulate and ſquare our practice: which alſo that we may the better do, let us ſee the particular oppreſſions, as they are here couched in the Apoſtrophe of King <hi>David</hi> to his <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Firſt, he tells her what he will ſay, and what he is reſolved to do in her behalf: What he will ſay, I will ſay now, <hi>Peace be within thee:</hi> what he will do, <hi>I will ſeek thy good.</hi> Her peace and wellfare is the main of his intendment; and for the compaſſing of that, he will bring on all his endeavour: he will not only wiſh well, but do well to his power: he will begin at the heart, but not reſt there: all that he is, and all that he hath, ſhall be employed about it. Secondly, he acquaints her with the grounds and motives, whereupon he took this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to himſelf, and they are ſpecially two; the one more civil, an Argument taken from Humanity, <hi>For my Brethren and Companions ſake;</hi> the other more ſacred, an Argument drawn from Religion and Piety, <hi>Becauſe of the houſe of the Lord our God.</hi> Theſe were (as indeed they thought) among the chiefeſt motives, which quickned him up to this performance, that is to ſay, a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the good of his Brethren, with whom he was in communion; and a hearty well-wiſhing to the thriving of Religion, and the ſervice of God, in that place where he had his being.</p>
            <p>By this time I hope you ſee in ſome meaſure, the drift and meaning of theſe words: I ſhall now proceed to make ſome Obſervations from the whole; and indeed (as you may perceive) the Text is very fruitfull in that kind; all which, if preſſed, would ſeaſonably conduce
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42635:9"/>
to our inſtruction. But becauſe the time, and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is to follow, will not permit me to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many, I ſhall only (for this preſent) faſten upon one, which you may take (if you pleaſe) in theſe words, That, <hi>It is both the duty and property of a Godly man, to be affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately zealous for the peace and wellfare, as of the Church in general, ſo of that Church in ſpecial, to which (in a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate manner) be doth relate.</hi> A point of needfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration at all times, but eſpecially now; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly I ſhall give you, firſt the proof of it, as by plain teſtimony from the Scripture, ſo by many very pregnant reaſons from the Bowels of my Text; and then after a ſhort Application of the whole, commend both you and all that hath been or ſhall be ſpoken by me, to the good bleſſing of God. And the Lord for Chriſts ſake ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me to ſpeak, and you to hear, that in the mutual diſcharge of our ſeveral duties, his Name may be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his Church comforted, and our poor Souls edified.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, I ſay this is a good mans duty, ſuch a duty as I confeſſe we owe (in ſome ſort) to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Mankind, for even they alſo (though in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a larger ſence) are our Brethren and Companions; and it is likewiſe poſſible (if God will) that they may be brought within the compaſſe of Gods houſe, and therefore we may not altogether exclude them, either from our well-wiſhing, or well-doing in their behalf, as occaſion ſhall preſent. The very Law of Humanity doth oblige us to the contrary; But then, in a more ſpecial manner, we owe all this to the Society of the Saints, as thoſe with whom we are more nearly linked, and to whom we ſtand in a more intimate and dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. As therefore the bond of Nature prompts us to do good unto all, ſo the bond of Grace calls upon us to do our beſt for theſe, in a more ſingular regard.</p>
            <p>This ſurely was the Judgement of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as you may ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>As we have opportunity</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let us do good unto all, but ſpecially to them who are of the Houſhold</hi>

ſanguinity, and Chriſtianity; that you would heartily incline to Peace and Love, and ſo ſtudy the compoſing of your minds, and the tempting of your wills, together with your affections, paſſions, and expreſſions, that though your heads may (in ſomethings of leſſer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) have different notions, yet your hearts may be one; and that you may ſay, and ſay truly, both of and to our Engl ſh <hi>Sion,</hi> as it is here in my Text, <hi>For our Brethren and Companions ſakes we will now ſay, Peace be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee: becauſe of the Houſe of the Lord our God, we will ſeek thy Good.</hi> And to this end, among many other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable conſiderations, which your own wiſdoms can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon, I do earneſtly beg your practical aſſent unto theſe few Particulars, whereof ſome refer to Almighty God, ſome to your ſelves, and ſome to your Brethren.</p>
            <p>In reference to Almighty-God, I beg of you, that in the firſt place you would humble your ſelves under his hand, and lye low at his foot-ſtool, under the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of your miſcarriages heretofore, in what kinde ſoever, and particularly of your failings this way among the reſt. Secondly, that you would earneſtly implore the Divine mercy, for his gracious pardon of all that his pure eyes have eſpied to be amiſs in you to this very day, whether habitual deordinations, or actual deviations, in every reſpect. Thirdly, that you would petition him, out of his abundant goodneſs, to beſtow upon you the Spirit of Wiſdom, Humility, and Love. Of Wiſdom, that you may diſcern rightly between things that differ, and lay no more ſtreſs upon the Conſcience than Himſelf hath impoſed. Of Humility, that you may, not onely know, but alſo keep within the bounds of your own ſtation; and ſo, meekly and quietly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves, where you owe obedience, agreeable to his Command. Of Love, that in all your demeanours you may be ever ſtudious to obſerve that Golden Rule of the Apoſtle, wherein he calls upon us, to preſerve the <hi>

            <p>In reference to your ſelves, my hearty deſire is, that you would practiſe your own Prayers, and bring on the beſt and choiceſt of your endeavours by all good means to compaſs that which you have prayed for. And, as tending hereunto, give me leave to preſent you with theſe enſuing Requeſts.</p>
            <p>My firſt Requeſt is, that you would diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Theological Verities, and Problematical Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: in which latter (you know) many learned and godly men have and may have apprehenſions contrary to our Conceptions. And here, our Duty is, not to be too confident and forward in our own Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. We muſt remember, we are but men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not infallible, but ſubject (not ſeldom) to miſtakes. And upon this ground, it will become us (as ſober Chriſtians) to be rather humbly modeſt, than peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily cenſorious.</p>
            <p>My ſecond Requeſt is, that you would put a difference between the eſſentials of Religion, and the outward circumſtantial adminiſtration of it: that is, between things of abſolute neceſſity, as preſcribed of God; and matters of indifference, wherein our lawful Superiours have a juſt power to interpoſe, for orders ſake. And here we muſt remember, that in theſe latter (ſeeing God hath not laid either his Command or Prohibition) the Inferiour is bound to ſubmit himſelf to his Superiour. It is ſo in the Family, and in the Common-wealth: And why not likewiſe in the Church?</p>
            <p>My third Requeſt is, that you would not believe, that, by the intervening Command of your Superiours about Things indifferent, you are any way abridged of your Chriſtian Liberty. Your Liberty is the ſame ſtill, as to the thing ſimply in it ſelf conſidered; and ſo you are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42635:10"/>
taught: onely your conformity to the Command of your Superiours is for the time (while the Command remaineth in force) of neceſſary obſervance: I ſay of neceſſary obſervance; for though the thing commanded be ſtill (as it was before) in its own nature in different yet the uſe of it (for the time) becomes neceſſary to us by vertue of that higher Command of God, which, doth enjoin us (in ſuch caſes) to yield obedience to our lawful Superiours.</p>
            <p>My fourth Requeſt is, that you would take heed, how under the ſuppoſed notion of Religion, you ſlip (ere you be well aware of it) into the guilt of Superſtition. There is (you know) a two fold Superſtition, the one affirmative, the other negative. Affirmative, when a man conceives himſelf obliged to this or that, as a thing intrinſecally holy, which yet in its own nature is but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary. Negative, when a man ſo judgeth of things arbitrary, as if (in the very nature of them) they were wicked and ungodly. And truely (for my part) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, which of theſe two is the greater Superſtition. Onely, this I know, that in the ſecond Commandment, where God forbids the worſhipping of Images, there alſo he forbids the worſhipping of Imaginations. And to ſay truth, what elſe are theſe Imaginations, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or mental Images, which the fancy of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triveth and carveth within it ſelf, and ſo ſets them up as the object, or (at leaſt) the Rule of Adoration?</p>
            <p>My fifth Requeſt is, that you would not hold your ſelves bound to maintain for ever what you have once ſaid or done upon a miſtaken ground: or that it will be any diſparagement to your perſonal repute, if now (upon a true conviction) you recede from thoſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, which formerly you both allowed in your ſelves, and preſſed upon others. I fear, this hath been to many (I do not, I dare not ſay, it hath been ſo to you) a great obſtruction to ingenuity. But, my Brethren, let us not deceive our ſelves; for certainly, what ever men
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42635:11"/>
may think, we cannot (in this caſe) better conſult, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our acceptance with God, or our credit with goodmen, than by profeſſing our ſelves to be overcome of Truth. Indeed, this is not ſo much as a foil, as an honour; for, in being thus conquered, we our ſelves obtain a noble Victory. Let us reflect here upon that famous Worthy, the great St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who purchaſed to himſelf no leſs venerable eſteem in the Church of God by his Book of Retractions, than he had done former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his other Writings communicated by him to the world.</p>
            <p>My ſixth Requeſt, as conſequent upon the former, is, that you would not overmuch regard the applauſes of the vulgar, or (it may be) the good opinion of ſome well meaning (but miſtaking) Chriſtians. Oh, this itch after Popular eſteem is a thing of very evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and will ſurely hazard us (if not ſeaſonably cured) to many inconveniences. Indeed, it will make us unfit to be Maſters of our own judgement; yea, it will ſo weaken our ſight, and for the preſent ſo blinde our eyes, that we ſhall not be able to diſcern Truth from Error, Peace from Faction, or the Lovers of Peace from the Troublers of our <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Requeſts, which I thought good at this time to preſent you with, in reference to your ſelves, I told you, there is ſomewhat elſe, which I would alſo beg at your hands in reference to others: and the Particulars are two.</p>
            <p>Firſt I would entreat, that in caſe you be not yet ſo cleerly ſatisfied, as to all your ſcruples, and in every circumſtance, you would not however thereupon grow clamorous, &amp; by that means endeavour to engage the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude into the participation of your diſcontent. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Brethren, if the miſtake be on your ſide, your ſin in ſo doing will be greatly aggravated, firſt in regard of the Power, which you diſobey; ſecondly in regard of the Perſons, whom you miſlead; thirdly in regard of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42635:11"/>
your ſelves, by adventuring ſo far (in a diſputable point) upon your own miſapprehenſions. But ſuppoſe (and for this diſcourſe lake, I but ſuppoſe it) ſuppoſe I ſay, you may be in the right, yet let me entreat you once more to conſider, whether the thing (you contend for) be of that importance, as for the ſake thereof to embroil a whole Church? Or whether (on the contrary) it be not an act of as great imprudence ſo to do, as for a man to burn his houſe, that he may waſt an egg? Brethren, you know, that all Truths are not of the ſame alloy; and that therefore (as the caſe may be) ſome harmleſs and quiet miſtakes in judgement may be (comparatively) bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than ſome unruly Truths. Surely, he was a wiſe man, and an Orthodox and well ſtudied Divine <note n="*" place="margin">That ſweet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured and holy man of pretious memory, Dr. Joſeph Hall, late Biſhop of Norwich.</note>, who ſaid, <hi>Though I love Peace well, yet I love main Truths better:</hi> and again, on the other ſide, <hi>Though I love all Truths well, yet I rather conceal a ſmall Truth, than diſturb the common Peace.</hi> Remember I beſeech you, the Truths, wherein we all agree, are fundamental: and me thinks, our a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>greement in them ſhould tye us faſter, than for every pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty difference to fall aſunder. Give me leave here to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you that ſeaſonable and wholſom advice of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Philip. 3. 15, 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where he ſaith, <hi>Let us (as many as be perfect) be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this alſo unto you. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, whereto ye have already attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule, let us mind the ſame thing.</hi> To be hot in our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes about Suppoſals, and in the mean ſeaſon (even by the violence of ſuch diſputes) to hinder the growth of Reals, Oh how unbeſeeming! how much better would it become us, in matters of this kind, to leave off contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to fall a ſupplicating, firſt to God, and then unto Authority, that all theſe obſtacles and rubbs in the way of Peace, on either ſide, may be lovingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved?</p>
            <p>Brethren, we are now (thanks be to God for it) under the bleſſed influence of a gratious Prince, whoſe heart
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42635:12"/>
(as we may gather from the effects) is compoſed and made up (as I may ſay) of Truth and Juſtice, of Love and Tenderneſs, to God and Man; To God, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of his Service; To Man, for the procuring of his Good: and how can we but hope for an anſwerable Care in him to ſettle Peace and unanimity among us, by a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious condeſcention in things convenient to weaker ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? Beſides, under the Government of ſo good a Prince, you may reſt aſſured, that no rational Expedient, which may really conduce to the Publick ſatisfaction of all ſober and modeſt Chriſtians, will be with-held: much leſs, the indicting (if need be) of a free, National, and well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>compoſed Synod, if you will humbly wait the time for it. A fair way, I confeſs; and indeed a way which God hath bleſſed from the very infancy of the Church, toward the ſilencing of diſputes, and the repreſſing of ſtirs in this kind: which alſo our late Saintly Soveraign of dear and glorious memory (of whom, nor we, nor, as the Apoſtle phraſeth it in a like caſe, <hi>the world was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy)</hi> did Himſelf chalk out and recommend unto us in his laſt dying words, when his pretious Soul was (as I may ſay) upon the wing toward his heavenly Reſt. Now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the expectation of all this, I beſeech you quiet your own minds, and let my words find acceptance with you, while I ſay (as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſometime did unto his brethren) <hi>See that you fall not out by the way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſecondly, there is one thing more, wherein I muſt needs crave your charitable endeavours: and that is, that you would not onely be thus quiet your ſelves, but alſo do your beſt to quiet others. As our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> upon another occaſion, ſo ſhall my Exhortation be to every one of you, <hi>Et tu converſus confirma Fratres.</hi> In a common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion, it is not enough to forbear the bringing of more fewel to maintain the fire: but every good Citizen muſt be forward to his power toward the quenching of the flame. Beloved, you cannot be ignorant, that there are (at this time) great thoughts of hearts for the Diviſions

of our <hi>Reuben.</hi> Oh now, for the Spirit of meekneſſe, humility, and love (ſuch as was in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes)</hi> to intervene, and ſay as they did in effect, <hi>Sirs, why do ye ſtrive thus, ſeeing you are Brethren?</hi> Why do ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, and ſmite, and wound each other by your unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable janglings? Even thus ſurely it would become us (each one in his place, and within the compaſs of his own Calling) to expoſtulate with our Brethren, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour (as we can) with a ſweet and gentle calmneſs to allay the boiſterous and tempeſtuous violence of hotter ſpirite, and with a grave and ſober importunity to call them back (if poſſible) unto a right Chriſtian moderation; that ſo, theſe ſparks of contention (which are but in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance) may dye away, and never have the power to kindle into a flame.</p>
            <p>Give me leave here, as a hearty well-wiſher to the Churches Peace, to tread in the foot-ſteps of a gratious Soul now at Reſt with God, and (upon this occaſion) to revive the memory of that ſweet and heavenly Spirit of holy <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who, when he ſaw the bitter contentions between <hi>Jerome</hi> and <hi>Ruſfino</hi> (two great and famous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church in his dayes) <hi>Heu mibi</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>qui vos alicubi ſimul invenire non poſſum,</hi> &amp;c. Alas, that I can never find you two together! How would I fall at your feet? How would I embrace them, yea, and weep over them? How would I beſeech you, either for other, and each for himſelf, both of you for the Church, and therein eſpecially for thoſe weak ones for whom Chriſt died, and who (not without their own great danger) do ſadly look on, and ſee you two thus fighting one againſt the other in this Theatre of the world? Loe here, the lovely tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and peaceful diſpoſition of the Holy Man: a pattern, well worth our imitation. Indeed, we have the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, which (it ſeems) he miſſed, yea, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that he had it not: and therefore, let us do (at leaſt) what he ſaid he would do; let let us beg and ſeek for Peace, as we would for life.</p>

For my own part, I do make it this day my humble Requeſt unto you all; and could wiſh now (if poſſible) that my Ribs were as ſtrong as Braſs, and my voice as Ioud as Thunder, that the ſound thereof might reach over the whole Land, to the kindly affecting every heart. But Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God (I truſt) hath his Agents abroad: And may his Bleſſing make their labours fruitful?</p>
            <p>In the mean ſeaſon Brethren, as to you that are preſent, I ſhall conclude my plea for Peace and Moderation in a few words. It is to me an uncertain thing, whether I ſhall ever meet you thus again together in this place: God onely knows, but it is probable I never ſhall. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as if now taking my laſt leave of you) let me breath out the very longings of my Soul into your boſoms, and ſhut up all with the words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11. <hi>Finally (Brethen) Farewell! Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of Peace ſhall be with you.</hi> To him, and to the Word of his Grace, I commend you: and he mercifully grant, that every one, who both heard me this day, may comfortably return to his own home, <hi>aut ſanior, aut ſanabilior!</hi> either actually more ſound, or (at the leaſtwiſe) in a nearer diſpoſition to be made ſound!</p>
            <p>And even ſo, O Holy Father, ſo be it; for the ſake of thy dear Son Jeſus Chriſt! to whom, with thine own Majeſtie, and thy bleſſed Spirit, three Perſons and one God, be all Glorie and Honour, Thanſgiving and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, now and for ever, Amen.</p>
