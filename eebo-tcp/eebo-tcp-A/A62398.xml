            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>To the Right Honourable, and Generous Lord, IOHN Lord YESTER,</head>
                  <p>Appearand EARL of <hi>TWEDDALE;</hi> Son to <hi>Iean</hi> Countess of <hi>Tweddale,</hi> who was Daughter to that Valiant Lord, <hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Buckcleugh,</hi> Your Honours worthy Grand-Father.</p>
                  <p>AS the Graces, the Vertues, the Senses, and the Muses are embled or alluded to your noble Sect; as all these have ample residence in your honourable and worthy Disposition: to whom then but your felf, being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so compleat, should I commit the Patronage of that worthy Lord, <hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Buccleugh;</hi> and though I an unliterate Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, have not apparelled them in such Garments of Elocution, and ornate Stile, as befits their Honours, and Eminency of the least part of their excellent Worthiness; Yet, I beseech your Honour to accept for your own Worth, and their Worthiness; for if it were not but that I am assured, that your noble Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in all parts is suitable to the in-side of this Book, I should never have dar'd to dedicate it to your Patronage: as it hath an honest Intention, so hath your Breast ever been fill'd with such thoughts, which brings forth worthy Actions; as it is a Whip or Scourge against all Pride, so have you ever been an unfeigned lover of courteous Humanity and Humility: I humbly beseech your Honour, although the method and stile be plain, to be pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give it a favourable Intertamment; for Records and Histories
<pb facs="tcp:35850:3"/>
do make memorable mention of the diversity of qualities of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry famous persons, Men and Women, in all the Countries and Regions of the World: How some are remembred for their Piety and Pity, some for Iustice, some for Severity, for Learning, Wisdom, Temperance, Constancy, Patience, with all the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues Divine and Moral. God who of his infinite Wisdom made Man, of his unmeasured Mercy redeemed him, of his boundless Bounty, immense Power, and eternal Eye of watchful Providence, relieves, guards, and conserves him. It is necessary that every man seriously consider, and ponder these things, and in token of Obedience and Thankfulness, say with <hi>David, What shall I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</hi> &amp;c. Men shóuld consider, why God hath given them a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this life? no man is owner of himself. My Age is Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three, it is Fifty seven years since I went to <hi>Holland</hi> with your honourable Grand-father, <hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Buckcleugh,</hi> in the year 1629. I was at that time not full Sixteen years of Age, or capable to carry Arms in so much a renown'd Regiment or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as his Honours was; I was in no more estimation than a Boy, yet waited upon a Gentleman in his Honours own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; notwithstanding it is known, that I am a Gentleman by Parentage, but my Fathers having dilapidate and engaged their Estate by Cautionry, having many Children, was not in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to educate us at School after the death of my Grand-Father, Sir <hi>Robert Scot of Thirlstone;</hi> my Father living in a highland in <hi>Esdail muir,</hi> and having no Rent at that time, nor Means to bring us up, except some Bestial; wherefore in stead of breeding of me at Schools, they put me to attend Beasts in the Field; but I gave them a short cut at last, and left the Kine in the Corn, aud went as aforesaid; and ever since that time I have continued a Souldier abroad, and at home, till within these few years that I am become so infirm and decrip'd with the Gout, which hath so unabled me, that I am not able, neither to do the King, nor my self Service; so this being entred into my consideration, it is sufficiently known,
<pb facs="tcp:35850:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that my intention and meaning was not to make any Profite to my self; for I know, I do but little deserve, by reason I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver write a Line in my life; neither will my ability keep one to Write to me; and I living two or three Mile from a School; yet is constrain'd by my own wilful Will, sometimes to hire one School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, and sometimes another, yet knows not whether they can spell true <hi>Scots</hi> or not, by reason I cannot read their Hand, and there is none by me that can, for many times the Writer mistakes the Word from my deliverance; Therefore I hope your Honour will excuse the failing of my unlearned Muse.</p>

                        <l>The Owners pitifully cry'd out they were undone,</l>
                        <l>Then to the Governour they came, and seriously did complain:</l>
                        <l>The Lord Scroup heard their whole complaint,</l>
                        <l>And bade them go home again, and no more lament,</l>
                        <l>For before the Sun did rise or set,</l>
                        <l>He should be reveng'd on Kinment:</l>
                        <l>Anone he charged the Trumpeters, they should sound Booty-sadle,</l>
                        <l>Iust at that time the Moon was in her prime,</l>
                        <l>He needed no Torch-light:</l>
                        <l>Lord Scroup he did to Scotland come,</l>
                        <l>Took Kinment the self same night:</l>
                        <l>If he had had but ten men more, that had been as stout as he,</l>
                        <l>Lord Scroup had not the Kinment tane with all his Company;</l>
                        <l>But Kinment being Prisoner, Lord Scroup he had him tane,</l>
                        <l>In Carlile Castle he him laid, in irons and fetters strong:</l>
                        <l>Then scornfully Lord Scroup did say,</l>

                        <l>In this Castle thou must ly,</l>

                        <l>Even take thy leave of me;</l>
                        <l>He mean'd that he should suffer death before he went away,</l>
                        <l>By the Cross of my Sword says Willy then,</l>
                        <l>I'le take my leave of thee,</l>
                        <l>Before e're I go away, whether I live or die;</l>
                        <l>These News came furth to bold Buckcleugh,</l>
                        <l>Lord Warden at that time,</l>

                        <l>Lord Scroup must understand,</l>
                        <l>That he has not only done me wrong,</l>
                        <l>But my Soveraign Iames of Scotland:</l>
                        <l>My Soveraign Lord King of Scotland</l>

                        <l>Without leave asked and given;</l>
                        <l>Thou stole into my Masters Land,</l>
                        <l>Which is within my Command,</l>
                        <l>And in a plundering hostile way,</l>
                        <l>I'le let thee understand;</l>
                        <l>Besore Day-light came thou stole a man,</l>
                        <l>And like a Thief thou run away;</l>
                        <l>This Letter came to Lord Scroups hand,</l>
                        <l>Which from Buckcleugh was sent,</l>
                        <l>Charging him then to release Kinment,</l>
                        <l>Or else he should repent;</l>
                        <l>Scotland is not a sitting part,</l>
                        <l>I suppose England is the same;</l>
                        <l>But if thou carry a valiant heart, I'le fight thee in Holland;</l>

                        <l>This Message by a Drummer sent,</l>
                        <l>To the Governour Lord Scroup,</l>
                        <l>A frivolous Answer he returned,</l>
                        <l>Which made bold Buckcleugh to doubt;</l>
                        <l>That he must into Carlisle ride,</l>
                        <l>And fetch the Kinment out,</l>
                        <l>The Armstrong was a hardy Name</l>
                        <l>Into their own Country;</l>
                        <l>But like Clim of the Cleugh and little Iohn,</l>
                        <l>On England they did prey,</l>
                        <l>Kinments sirname was Armstrong,</l>
                        <l>He from Giltknocky sprang;</l>
                        <l>But Mengertoun he was the chief</l>
                        <l>Of the Name of Armstrong,</l>
                        <l>It was not for their own respects,</l>
                        <l>That Buckcleugh turned their Guardian;</l>
                        <l>It was for the honour of Scotland,</l>
                        <l>By reason he was Lord Warden;</l>
                        <l>He stormed that any should presume</l>
                        <l>To enter the Scots border,</l>
                        <l>Either Cornish, Irish, English, Welch,</l>

                        <l>To enter the Scots-ground, he had call'd up his Rear;</l>
                        <l>But since he mist him in all Scotlands bounds,</l>

                        <l>They neither knew the Cause, nor what the Cause might be,</l>
                        <l>Before they came the length of Netherbie;</l>
                        <l>Although his Honours trusty Friend did ken,</l>

                        <l>Which History was never yet read through,</l>

                        <l>Mr. Michael had been dead above five hundred year,</l>

                        <l>He said, Gentlemen in Galloway by fate,</l>
                        <l>Had fallen at odds, and a Riot did commit,</l>
                        <l>For in these days, as he did say,</l>

                        <l>These Characters that remains, the truth they let us see,</l>
                        <l>Sir Alexander Scot of Hassinden was Knight,</l>
                        <l>With good KingIames the fourth, he was kill'd at Flowdon fight,</l>
                        <l>From Hassinden did spring before that time</l>
                        <l>The Families of Wall, Delorian and Haining,</l>

                        <l>They never sought to be Chronicliz'd:</l>

                        <l>Of brave Iohn Scot the Original of Buckoleugh;</l>
                        <l>And because thou art weary, as I suppose,</l>

                        <l>Good Lancelot Scot, I think his Book be true,</l>
                        <l>Old Rankelburn is design'd Buckcleugh now,</l>
                        <l>Yet in his Book no <hi>Balls</hi> read he,</l>
                        <l>It was Buckscleugh he read to me;</l>
                        <l>He told me the Name, the Place, the Coat,</l>
                        <l>Came all by the hunting of the Buck:</l>
                        <l>In Scotland no Buckcleugh was then,</l>
                        <l>Before the Buck in the Cleugh was slain,</l>
                        <l>Nights-men at first they did appear,</l>
                        <l>Because Moon and Stars to their Arms they bear,</l>
                        <l>Their Crest, supporters, and hunting-horn,</l>
                        <l>Showes their beginning from hunting came;</l>
                        <l>Their Name and Stile the Book did say,</l>
                        <l>Iohn gain'd them both into one day:</l>
                        <l>The very place where that the Buck was slain,</l>
                        <l>He built a Stone-house, and there he did remain;</l>
                        <l>He built a Church into that Forrest hie,</l>
                        <l>There was no man to come to it, but his own Familie,</l>
                        <l>The Houses Ground-work yet is to be seen;</l>
                        <l>And at that Church, I many times have been,</l>
                        <l>A burial place it yet keeps out,</l>
                        <l>For any poor folk that lyes round about;</l>
                        <l>To the Paroch Church it's long fix mile,</l>
                        <l>Therefore they bury yet to save travel;</l>

                        <l>My Guid-sir Satchells, I heard him declare,</l>
                        <l>There was nine Lairds of Buckcleugh buried there;</l>
                        <l>But now with rubish and earth it's fill'd up so high,</l>
                        <l>That no man can the Through-stones see,</l>
                        <l>But nine Tomb-stones he saw with both his eyne,</l>
                        <l>But knew not who was buried under them;</l>
                        <l>Also they built a Miln on that same burn,</l>
                        <l>To grind Dogs-bran, though there there grew no Corn,</l>
                        <l>For in my own time Corn little there hath been,</l>
                        <l>There was neither Rig nor Fur for to be seen,</l>
                        <l>But Hills and Mountains on every side,</l>
                        <l>The Haugh below, scarce a hundred foot wide;</l>
                        <l>Yet there's a Miln-steed in that Brook,</l>
                        <l>And the Church-walls I have seen them all up,</l>
                        <l>It is two reasonable myle,</l>
                        <l>Between the Miln-steed and the Kirk-style,</l>
                        <l>My Guid-sir told me there he had seen,</l>
                        <l>A holy Cross, and a Font-stone;</l>
                        <l>The Paroch being twenty myle about,</l>
                        <l>But hardly sixteen folks remain in it,</l>
                        <l>All the Corn I have seen there in a year,</l>
                        <l>Was scarce the sowing of six Firlots of Bear;</l>
                        <l>And for Neighbours to come with good will,</l>
                        <l>There was no Corn to grind into that Mill,</l>
                        <l>If Heather-tops had been Meal of the best,</l>
                        <l>Then Buckcleugh-mill had gotten a noble grist</l>
                        <l>Now wearied Muse to rest thou may resort,</l>
                        <l>Whilst I alitle Prose report.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>I Heard my Guid-sir tell, that he had heard all men say, the the reason why the Lairds of <hi>Buckcleugh</hi> did build that Milne, was, for the use of their Houses, for grinding of Flour, Meal and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35850:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Malt, but especially Bran for his Dogs, and the Corn came out of other Barronies, which was then in his possession, as the Ewards in Tweddale, the Barrony of <hi>Eokfoord,</hi> Grimslies in East-Tivlotdail, and other Barronies, and Lands under his command, this is spoken by tradition to this time; but sure if such things were, as it hath been by all appearance, it must be long after the beginning of the honourable Family of Buckcleugh; for at that time, Buckcleugh must needs be a Person of much Honour and Renown, and of a very competent Estate, when he built a Church, and a Milne, in such a Wilde Forrest, as <hi>Rankelburn,</hi> now called Buckcleugh, where there was no People to come to the Church, except his own Family, nor girst to his Milne, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what he caused to come for his own use, near twenty myle in each side of his own residence. My Guid-sir <hi>Satchells</hi> told me, that he was with <hi>Walter</hi> called the good Lord of Buckcleugh, after he came from the Schools, and <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Thirlston,</hi> after Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> they being come from the Colledge of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> where they had been at Learning, by reason King <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth was of that University, my Lord and Sir <hi>Robert</hi> being of the Kings Age, in the year one thousand five hundred and sixty six, was desirous to pass their time there, and at their return, the Lord Buckcleugh being ready to go to his travells, was curious to see these Tomb-stones of his Ancestors, which was in that Kirk, in the Forrest of <hi>Rankelburn,</hi> the most part of the Wall was standing then, and the Font-stone within the Kirk, and a Cross before the Kirk-door; The Rubbish and Earth being casten out, and the Stones clean sweept, the Lord, and many of his Friends came to see them, where they did discern one Stone, which had the antient Coat of Arms on it; That is to say, two Crests, and a Mulet born on a Counter-scarf, with a Hunting-horn in the Field, supported with a Hart of Grace, and a Hart of Leice, alias a Hound, and a Buck, and a Bucks-head torn from the Crest, which only seem to be from Hunters and Forresters, the other Stones had drawn
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35850:26"/>
upon them like unto a Hand and Sword, and others of them had a Sword and a Lance all along the Stone; <hi>Robert Scot</hi> said, that he believed, that it was four hundred years since the last of these Stones had been laid, and it was near an hundred year since that time; I judge the <hi>Lord Buckcleugh</hi> was about twenty one, or twenty two years at that time, so it must needs be near to an hundred years since.</p>

                        <l>The Tide against them, and the VVind was harsh,</l>

                        <l>With rumbling and tumbling on the rowling Main,</l>
                        <l>The boisterous breaking Billows of the curl'd Locks,</l>
                        <l>Did impetuously beat against the Rocks,</l>
                        <l>The wind, which like a Horse, whose wind is broke,</l>
                        <l>Blew thick and short, that they were almost choack'd,</l>

                        <l>The gust like dust blown in the brimish waves,</l>
                        <l>And thus the Wind and Seas these boy sterous gods,</l>
                        <l>Fell by the ears stark mad at furious odds,</l>

                        <l>Alost, or Low, as Storms and Floods did please,</l>
                        <l>Sometimes upon a foaming mountain top,</l>
                        <l>Whose hight did seem the heav'n to under-prop,</l>
                        <l>Then straight to such prophanity they fell,</l>
                        <l>As if they div'd into the depths of Hell,</l>
                        <l>The Clouds, like ryp Apostoms burst and showr'd,</l>

                        <l>They all agreed to sauce them in a pickle;</l>
                        <l>Of water fresh and salt from seas and skyes,</l>
                        <l>Which with our sweat joyned in triplicity,</l>
                        <l>Bright Phoebus hid his golden head with fear,</l>
                        <l>Not daring to behold the dangers there;</l>
                        <l>Whilst in that strait and exigent they stand,</l>

                        <l>Like rowling hills the billows beat and roar,</l>
                        <l>Against the melancholy benchy Shoar,</l>
                        <l>That if they landed, neither strength nor wit,</l>
                        <l>Could save their Ship from being sunk or split;</l>
                        <l>To keep the sea straight puffing AEolus breath,</l>

                        <l>The waves amain oft boarded them,</l>
                        <l>Whilst they almost six hours did there remain,</l>
                        <l>On every side with danger and distress,</l>
                        <l>Resolv'd to run a Shoar a dungeonness,</l>
                        <l>There stood some thirteen Cottages together,</l>
                        <l>To shelter poor Fisher-men from wind and weather;</l>
                        <l>And there some people were, as they supposed,</l>
                        <l>As though the doors and windows were all closed,</l>
                        <l>They near the Land, into the Sea soon lap,</l>

                        <l>They knockt and call'd at each from house to house,</l>
                        <l>But found no Mankind-form, Cat, Rat, nor Mouse,</l>
                        <l>These news all sad, and comfortless and cold,</l>
                        <l>Amongst the Crew it presently was told,</l>
                        <l>Assuring them, the best way they did think,</l>
                        <l>Was to leave their Ship, whether she split or sink,</l>
                        <l>Resolved thus, they altogether please</l>
                        <l>To put her Head to Shoar, and her Stern to Seas;</l>
                        <l>They leaping over-board amidst the Sea,</l>
                        <l>Almost desperat whether to live or dy,</l>
                        <l>Then from top to toe they strend,</l>
                        <l>Pluckt off their shirts, and then them wring'd,</l>
                        <l>Till Wind and Sun their want supply'd,</l>
                        <l>And made both out-side and in-side dry'd,</l>
                        <l>Two miles from thence a silly town there stood,</l>
                        <l>To which they went to bring some food:</l>
                        <l>The Town did shew their pity, but for what?</l>
                        <l>They made them pay triple for what they got,</l>
                        <l>But what they got Thirleston-stood not for to pay double;</l>
                        <l>But these peasants made him to pay twice triple,</l>
                        <l>Because these Harbours where their Ship rod still,</l>
                        <l>Belong'd to men which in that Town did dwell,</l>

                        <l>At Thirlston's request they did send a man,</l>
                        <l>To possess the Crew in that hospitable Den,</l>
                        <l>With a brazen Kettle, and a wooden Dish,</l>
                        <l>To serve their need, and dress their flesh and fish:</l>
                        <l>Then from the fleshers they brought Lamb and Sheep,</l>
                        <l>Ale from the Ostler-house, and besoms for to sweep;</l>
                        <l>Their Cottage for want of usage was moisty,</l>
                        <l>Myrish, sluggish and dusty,</l>
                        <l>There twenty days they did roast, boil and broil,</l>
                        <l>And toyl and moyle, and keep a noble coyle:</l>
                        <l>For only they kept open house alone,</l>
                        <l>And he that wanted Beef, might eat a Stone,</l>
                        <l>Their Grand-dame Earth with beds did all befriend them;</l>
                        <l>And bountifully all their lengths did lend them;</l>
                        <l>That laughing, or else lying down did make,</l>
                        <l>Their backs and sides sore, and their ribs to ake;</l>
                        <l>Mean time in the Town Thirlston did remain;</l>
                        <l>His Lodging was litle better than them:</l>
                        <l>On Saturnday the winds did seem to cease,</l>
                        <l>And brawling Seas began to hold their peace:</l>
                        <l>Then they like tennents, beggarly and poor,</l>
                        <l>Intended to leave the key beneath the door:</l>
                        <l>But that the Land-lord did that shift prevent,</l>
                        <l>Who came in pudding-time and took his Rent:</l>
                        <l>Then Thirlston came before the Sun was peeping,</l>
                        <l>They lanch'd to sea, and left their house keeping,</l>
                        <l>When presently they saw the drifting skyes,</l>
                        <l>Grin pout and lowr and winds and seas 'gain ryse,</l>
                        <l>Countrey-men wish Thirlston go by Land,</l>
                        <l>To a Harbour that was near at hand;</l>
                        <l>The name of it was Fresenbered,</l>
                        <l>And there their Ship might by report, be reared:</l>

                        <l>But their council was not worth a Plack,</l>
                        <l>He'd never leave the Ship, to ride on horses back;</l>
                        <l>Yet Fortune brought them to the Harbour there,</l>
                        <l>Where that their Ship they somewhat did repair,</l>
                        <l>And then to Sea, with mounted sails on hie,</l>
                        <l>They bound for Scotland, and left Norway:</l>
                        <l>There was but small amendment all that time,</l>
                        <l>The weather was much in one kind.</l>
                        <l>The wind and weather plaid on each so wild,</l>
                        <l>As if they meant not to be reconcil'd;</l>
                        <l>She, whilst they leapt upon these liquid hills,</l>
                        <l>Where Purpoises did shew their Phins and Gills:</l>
                        <l>Yet after that both water, wind and seas,</l>
                        <l>And a pleasnat Gale blew from the North North-east,</l>
                        <l>AEolus and Neptun privat, and no way brief;</l>
                        <l>By providence they did arrive at Leith.</l>
                        <l>That troublesome toilsome Iourney, to be brief,</l>
                        <l>Fifteen weeks was between London and Leith.</l>
                        <l>To all Ages it should ne're be forgot,</l>
                        <l>The pains that Patrick Scot of Thirlston took.</l>
                        <l>AEneas on Anchises he took pains enough,</l>
                        <l>But Patrick Scot he took more of the Earl of Buckcleugh;</l>
                        <l>All that men can do, when Princes do command,</l>
                        <l>Their Loyalty to show, and venture Life and Land:</l>

                        <l>He enjoy'd all Sintons Lordship,</l>

                        <l>And say that he was not a Gentleman;</l>
                        <l>He wanted nothing of Gentrie,</l>
                        <l>But only the title of Dignitie:</l>
                        <l>The first Lady that he did gain,</l>

                        <l>The first Walter Scot of Hardin:</l>
                        <l>Then Hardin did to Riddel ride,</l>

                        <l>Then they left the young Folk in Hardin,</l>

                        <l>Walter of Erckleton these mis-reports may clear,</l>
                        <l>For he was called nothing but Shepherd fourty year,</l>
                        <l>And yet he is the just and very man,</l>
                        <l>Whose Goodsir and Grandsir was Lairds of Erckleton;</l>
                        <l>Even though Horsliehill were to sell at this time,</l>
                        <l>And William Elliot were he that should it gain,</l>
                        <l>It were but a Suspension he had underline,</l>
                        <l>Being truely descended from that self same kind,</l>
                        <l>And though that his Grandsir was a Servant-man,</l>
                        <l>For the want of Means to the Laird of Hardin,</l>
                        <l>And he by his Service and good Husbandry,</l>
                        <l>Had purchased Means might set Horsliehill free;</l>
                        <l>But being not to sell he purchas'd other Lands,</l>

                        <l>Doth that make out that he's not a Gentleman,</l>

                        <l>And the Elliots of Selkirk they are of the same,</l>

                        <l>For their Grandsirs were two Brother-sons,</l>
                        <l>Though in Occupation there was difference,</l>
                        <l>The one a Magistrat in Selkirk Town,</l>
                        <l>The other kept the Sheep upon the Doun;</l>
                        <l>The one did live by Polling of the Poor,</l>
                        <l>Being Magistrat was counted great Honour;</l>
                        <l>The other was a Shepherds Swain, and reliev'd the Poor that came,</l>
                        <l>VVith Bed and Board, though but a Servant-man,</l>
                        <l>Sixty years ago I have both heard and seen,</l>
                        <l>And knew that Robert Elliot was the Laird of Hardins man,</l>

                        <l>But for the Magistrat few Poor he did relieve,</l>
                        <l>He was still ready to take, but never to give:</l>
                        <l>Sir Baillie, if't please your Worship,</l>
                        <l>Was the word of every one,</l>
                        <l>The other was Will or Hab,</l>
                        <l>Yet both from Brethren came,</l>
                        <l>Their foresaid Marriages they are set down by me,</l>
                        <l>To be a truth I will affirm, and that they are no ly;</l>
                        <l>I have both eat and drunk, and merry with them been,</l>
                        <l>All of them except the first William,</l>

                        <l>Take not a Shepherd Swain to be a vulgar name,</l>
                        <l>For Kings and Emperors have gloried in the same,</l>
                        <l>Therefore no Shepherd Swain my Muse will e're deride,</l>
                        <l>And far less VVilliam Elliot the good Laird of Swoonside,</l>

                        <l>Not like Envy, all consum'd to Skin and Bone.</l>
                        <l>Sir, I do declare what Labour thou hast spent,</l>
                        <l>VVas neither to Honour nor Vertues detriment;</l>
                        <l>And thrice worthy Sir, thy Vertues do proclaim,</l>

                        <l>And when thou the head-strong Taurus soon forsakes,</l>

                        <l>Since I was born, when Wit was out of Town,</l>

                        <l>Into your gentle hands, Sir, I do commit,</l>
                        <l>Iohn Elliot the Laird of Thorilshope,</l>

                        <l>For a man must more than humane wit possess,</l>
                        <l>To escape the Baits and Snares of wickedness,</l>
                        <l>The Artist of the Scripture can dispute the same,</l>
                        <l>That one would deem him a Religious Man;</l>
                        <l>Since that God gave Life to Herbs, and Plants, and Trees,</l>
                        <l>A beast hath Sense, and Life, Moves, Feels and Sees,</l>
                        <l>For if they wanted Life, how could they then grow,</l>
                        <l>And in some sort, do both good and evil know;</l>
                        <l>But man he is before all Creatnres in degrees,</l>
                        <l>God, Life, Sense, and Reason, He unto him gives;</l>
                        <l>And least that these blessings should be transitory;</l>
                        <l>He gave him Life and Sense, Reason, Grace and Glory;</l>
                        <l>So I hope Thorlishope shall keep his Golden-fleece,</l>

                        <l>Thus doth he hate the Parator and Proctor,</l>

                        <l>Now he Earths weeping 'gins to dry,</l>
                        <l>With Eolus breath and his bright Heavenly heat,</l>

                        <l>Thus when the Worlds Eye-dazler takes his time,</l>
                        <l>At the Celestial Ram then Winter's done,</l>

                        <l>Thus when Apollo doth to Aries come,</l>

                        <l>Thus have I prov'd the Ram a lucky Sign,</l>

                        <l>He needs no Helmet, nor no Head-piece wear;</l>

                        <l>Our tilts and turneys did beginning take;</l>
                        <l>For as the Rams retire, and meet with rage,</l>
                        <l>So men do in their warlike equipage;</l>
                        <l>And long ere pouder from hel's damn'd den,</l>

                        <l>The Ram, an Engine call'd a Ram did teach,</l>
                        <l>To batter down a Wall, or make a Breach,</l>
                        <l>And now some places of defence 'gainst shot,</l>
                        <l>Have from the Ram the name of Rampiers got,</l>
                        <l>First warlike Trumpets that I e're heard nam'd,</l>
                        <l>At Iericho were all of Ram-horns fram'd,</l>
                        <l>For at the Ram-horns Trumpets fearful blast,</l>
                        <l>Their curled Walls were suddenly down cast.</l>
                        <l>Thus is the Ram with many vertues stor'd,</l>
                        <l>And was in AEgypt for a god ador'd;</l>

                        <l>Thus have I prov'd a Sheep a Beast of price,</l>

                        <l>The Fables of the Golden Fleece began,</l>
                        <l>Because Sheep Wool yields store of gold to men;</l>
                        <l>For he that hath great store of Wooly Fleeces,</l>
                        <l>May when he please have store of Golden Pieces:</l>
                        <l>Thus many a poor man dieing hath left a Son,</l>
                        <l>That hath transform'd the Fleece to Gold like Iason.</l>
                        <l>And here's a Mystery profound and deep,</l>
                        <l>There's sundry sorts of Mutton are no Sheep,</l>
                        <l>Lac'd Mutton which let out themselves to hyre,</l>
                        <l>Like hackneys whill be sir'd before they tyre,</l>
                        <l>The man or men which for such Mutton hunger,</l>
                        <l>Are by their Corporations Mutton-mongers,</l>
                        <l>Which is a Brother-hood too large and great,</l>
                        <l>That if they had a Hall, I would entreat,</l>
                        <l>To be their Clerk, or keeper of accounts,</l>
                        <l>To shew them unto what their Charge amounts.</l>
                        <l>My brain in numbring then would grow so quick,</l>
                        <l>I should be Master of Arithmetick,</l>
                        <l>All States, Degrees, and Trades, both bad and good,</l>
                        <l>Afford some Members of this Brother-hood;</l>
                        <l>Great therefore then must be their multitude,</l>
                        <l>When every man may to the Trade intrude.</l>
                        <l>It is no freedom, yet these men are free;</l>
                        <l>No savers, but most liberal spenders be;</l>
                        <l>For this is one thing that doth them bewitch,</l>

                        <l>The Flesh doth cost more than the Broth is worth;</l>
                        <l>They all are Ews, yet are exceeding Ramish,</l>
                        <l>And will be dainty fed, who ever famish,</l>
                        <l>Nor are they marked for any man, or no man,</l>
                        <l>As mine, or thine, but every man is common,</l>
                        <l>Fine Heads, and Necks, and Breasts they yield some store,</l>
                        <l>But scarcely one good Liver in ninescore;</l>
                        <l>The Liver being bad, it's understood,</l>
                        <l>The Veins are fil'd with putrified blood,</l>
                        <l>Which makes them subject to the scab, and then</l>
                        <l>They prove most dangerous dyets unto men;</l>
                        <l>And then the Proverb proves no ly or mock,</l>
                        <l>One scabed Sheep's enough to spoil a Flock;</l>
                        <l>But yet for all this there's many a Gull,</l>
                        <l>Loves Mutton well, dips not his bread i'th' wool,</l>
                        <l>And were a man put to his choice to keep,</l>
                        <l>'Tis said a Shrew is better nor a Sheep;</l>
                        <l>But if a man be yoked with such an Ewe,</l>
                        <l>She may be both a Scabbed Sheep, and Shrew,</l>
                        <l>And he that is so matcht, his life may well,</l>
                        <l>Be compared unto an earthly hell;</l>

                        <l>I at this Mutton must have one cut more;</l>
                        <l>These kind of Sheep have all the World o'regrown,</l>
                        <l>And seldom do wear Fleeces of their own;</l>
                        <l>For they from sundry men their pellets can pull,</l>
                        <l>Whereby they keep themselves as warm as wool;</l>
                        <l>Besides in Colours, and in Shapes they wear,</l>

                        <l>But let us make man that the rest excells,</l>
                        <l>According to our Image let us make,</l>
                        <l>Man, and then the Almighty red earth did take,</l>
                        <l>With which he formed Adam every Limb,</l>
                        <l>And having made him, breathed life in him.</l>
                        <l>Lo thus the first man never was a Child,</l>
                        <l>No way with sin original defil'd;</l>
                        <l>But with high Super-natural understanding,</l>
                        <l>He over all the Word had sole commanding;</l>
                        <l>Yet though to him the Regency was given</l>
                        <l>As Earths Leivetennant to the God of Heaven,</l>
                        <l>Though he commanded all created things,</l>
                        <l>As Deputy under the King of kings,</l>
                        <l>Though he so highly here was dignified,</l>
                        <l>To humble him, not to be puft with pride;</l>
                        <l>He could not brag nor boast of high born birth,</l>
                        <l>For he was formed out of slime and earth;</l>
                        <l>No beast; fish, worm, fowl, herb, wood, stone, tree,</l>
                        <l>But are of a more antient house than he;</l>
                        <l>For they were made before him, which prove this,</l>
                        <l>That their Antiquity is more than his;</l>
                        <l>Thus both himself, and his beloved Spouse,</l>
                        <l>Are by creation of the younger house;</l>
                        <l>And whilst they liv'd in perfect holiness,</l>
                        <l>Their richest Garments were bare Nakedness,</l>
                        <l>True Innocence were their chiefest Weeds;</l>
                        <l>For Righteousness no Mask or Vizard needs;</l>
                        <l>The Royalist Robes that our first Parents had,</l>
                        <l>Was a free Conscience with uprightness clade;</l>
                        <l>They needed not to shift, the Cloaths they wore</l>
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:35850:86"/>
                        <l>Was Nakedness, and they desir'd no more,</l>
                        <l>Until at last, that Hell-polluting Sin,</l>
                        <l>With Disobedience sold their Soul within,</l>
                        <l>And having lost their Holiest perfection;</l>
                        <l>They held their nakedness in imperfection;</l>
                        <l>Then being both asham'd, they both did frame,</l>
                        <l>Garments as Weeds of their deserved shame:</l>
                        <l>Thus when as sin had brought Gods curse on Man,</l>
                        <l>Then shame to make Apparel first began;</l>
                        <l>E're men had said most plain it does appear,</l>
                        <l>He neither did, nor needed cause menswear;</l>
                        <l>For his Apparel did at first begin,</l>
                        <l>To be the Robs of pennance for his Sin;</l>
                        <l>Thus all the brood of Adam, and of Eve,</l>
                        <l>The true use of Apparel may perceive;</l>
                        <l>That they are Liveries, Badges unto all,</l>
                        <l>Of our Sins, and our Parents woful fall;</l>
                        <l>Then more than mad the Mad-brain'd people be,</l>
                        <l>Or else they see, and will not seem to see,</l>
                        <l>The same Robs of Pride that makes them swell,</l>
                        <l>Are tokens that our best deserts are Hell,</l>
                        <l>Much like unto a Traitor to his King,</l>
                        <l>Which would his Countrey into destruction bring,</l>
                        <l>Whose treacheries being prov'd apparently,</l>
                        <l>He by the Law is justly Iudg'd to die;</l>
                        <l>And when the Books for his deserved Death,</l>
                        <l>A Pardon comes, and gives him longer Breath,</l>
                        <l>I think this man most madly would appear,</l>
                        <l>That would a Halter in a Glory wear,</l>
                        <l>Of Life to be quite dis-inherited;</l>
                        <l>But if he should vain gloriously persist,</l>
                        <l>To make a Rop of Silk, or Golden Twist,</l>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:35850:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <l>And wear, it's a more honourable show</l>
                        <l>Of his Rebellion than course Hemp, or Tow;</l>
                        <l>Might not men justly say, he were an Ass,</l>
                        <l>Triumphing that he once a Villan was,</l>
                        <l>And that wears an halter for the nonce,</l>
                        <l>In pride that he deserv'd a hanging once.</l>
                        <l>Such with our Heavenly Father is the case,</l>
                        <l>Of our first Parents, and their fruitful Race,</l>
                        <l>Apparel is the miserable Sign,</l>
                        <l>That we are Traitors to our Lord Divine,</l>
                        <l>And we like Rebels still most pride do take,</l>
                        <l>In that which still most humble should us make,</l>
                        <l>Apparel is the Prison for our Sin,</l>
                        <l>Which most should shame, yet most we glory in,</l>
                        <l>Apparel is the sheet of shame as it were;</l>
                        <l>For man apparel never did receive;</l>
                        <l>Till he Eternal Death deserv'd to have:</l>
                        <l>How vain is it for Man, a clod of Earth,</l>
                        <l>To boast of his Progeny or Birth,</l>
                        <l>Because perhaps his Ancestors were good,</l>
                        <l>And sprung from Royal, or from Noble Blood,</l>
                        <l>Where Vertues worth did in their minds inherit,</l>
                        <l>They enjoy'd their Honour by Desert and Merit,</l>
                        <l>Great Alexander, King of Macedon,</l>
                        <l>Dislain'd to be his Father Philips Son,</l>
                        <l>But he from Iupiter would be descended,</l>
                        <l>And as a god be honour'd and attended;</l>
                        <l>Yet when at Babylon he prov'd but a Man,</l>
                        <l>His god-head ended foolish as't began;</l>
                        <l>There was in Cicily a proud Physician,</l>
                        <l>Menecrates, and he through high ambition;</l>
                        <l>To be a god himself would needs prefer,</l>

                        <l>And would forsooth be deemed Iupiter;</l>

                        <l>The Fool god disguis'd to be a great Beast,</l>
                        <l>Who by himself was at a Table plac'd,</l>

                        <l>The other Guests themselves did feed and sill,</l>
                        <l>He at an empty table still sat still;</l>
                        <l>At last with humble low Sir Reverence,</l>
                        <l>A fellow came with sire and frankincense;</l>
                        <l>And offered to his god-ship, saying then,</l>
                        <l>Persumes were fit for gods, and meat for men;</l>
                        <l>The god in anger raise incontinent,</l>
                        <l>Who laughed, and in hunger homeward went.</l>
                        <l>The Roman Emperor Domitian</l>
                        <l>Would be a god, was murdered by a man.</l>
                        <l>Calligola would be a god of wonders,</l>
                        <l>And counterfit the Lightning and the thunders,</l>
                        <l>Yet every real heavenly thunder crack,</l>
                        <l>This cateif in such fear and terrour strake,</l>
                        <l>That he would quake, and shake, and hide his head,</l>
                        <l>In any hole, or underneath his bed;</l>
                        <l>And when this godless god had many slain,</l>
                        <l>A Preband dasht out his ungodly brain:</l>
                        <l>And thus the Almighty still against pride doth frown,</l>
                        <l>And casts ambition head-long tumbling down.</l>
                        <l>Great Pompey would be all the Worlds Superior,</l>
                        <l>And Cesar unto none would be Inferior;</l>
                        <l>But as they both did live ambitiously,</l>
                        <l>So both of them untimeous deaths did die:</l>
                        <l>The one in AEgypt had his final fall,</l>
                        <l>The other murdered in the Capital.</l>

                        <l>Which shows the miserable fall of Pride;</l>
                        <l>For Pride of State, Birth, Wisdom, Beauty, Strength,</l>
                        <l>And Pride in any thing will fall at length;</l>
                        <l>But to be proud of Garments that we wear,</l>
                        <l>Is the most foolish Pride a Heart can bear:</l>
                        <l>Know that of thine own thou doth possess,</l>
                        <l>Nothing but Sin and woful Wretchedness,</l>
                        <l>A Christian's Pride should only be in this,</l>
                        <l>When he can say, that God his Father is;</l>
                        <l>When Grace and Mercy well apply'd afford,</l>
                        <l>To make him Brother unto Christ his Lord;</l>
                        <l>When he unto the Holy Ghost can say,</l>
                        <l>Thou art my School-master whom I will obey.</l>
                        <l>When he can call the Saints his Fellows, and</l>
                        <l>Say to the Angels for my Guard you stand;</l>
                        <l>This is a laudable and Christian-Pride,</l>
                        <l>To know Christ, and to know him Crucified.</l>
                        <l>This is that meek Ambition, low Aspiring,</l>
                        <l>Which all Men should be earnest in desiring;</l>
                        <l>Thus to be proudly Humble is the thing,</l>
                        <l>Which will us to the state of Glory bring;</l>
                        <l>But yet beware of Pride Hypocritical,</l>
                        <l>For Pride in every thing will have a fall,</l>
                        <l>A lofty Mind with lowly Cap on Knee,</l>
                        <l>Is humble Pride and meek Hypocrisie,</l>
                        <l>As a great Ship ill suited with small sail,</l>
                        <l>A Iudas mean'd all Mischief, cry'd all hail,</l>

                        <l>To wring themselves into Opinions view:</l>
                        <l>Thus Pride is hateful, dangerous and vile,</l>

                        <l>Thus Pride is deadly Sin, and Sin brings Shame,</l>
