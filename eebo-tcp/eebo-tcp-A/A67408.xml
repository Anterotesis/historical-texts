            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
Seventh LETTER
Concerning the
Sacred Trinity.</head>
            <p>IN a Postscript to my Sixth Letter (which should
have been Printed with it; but came, it seems,
too late, after all the Sheets were Printed off,) I
gave notice, That I had received from <hi>London</hi> the
Night before <hi>(March 27.)</hi> another Letter from
<hi>W. I.</hi> of a like import with his former; but somewhat
fuller.</p>
            <p>That, what in it did directly concern me, was but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of Thanks, Respect, and Approbation. For
which I knew not how otherwise (than by such a way)
to return him my acknowledgment: Because he did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
signifie who he is that writes; nor do I know any
in <hi>London,</hi> to who's Name the Letters <hi>W. I.</hi> do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
            <p>That, there were Reflections in it, on some Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a Learned Author: which Expressions I do not
see that I am at all engaged to defend: And did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wave them.</p>
            <p>That, to say, <hi>The three Divine Persons,</hi> are <hi>Three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56321:3"/>
Beings (three substantial Beings, three Spirits,) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Distinct, (though mutually conscious,)</hi> is more, he thinks,
than that Learned Author needed to have said; (And I
think so too:) And that it is more Safe, to be less Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Particular, as to what the Scripture leaves in
the dark. And his Answer (I think) would not have
been less valid, (against those he undertakes to answer,)
though such Expressions were omitted.</p>
            <p>That, I did forbear to publish that Letter without his
Order; because I was loth to engage the Learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thereof in a <hi>Publick Dispute</hi> against that Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
unless he please.</p>
            <p>Since which time; considering, that the Postscript
came too late to be Printed with that Letter of mine;
and, that the Letter of this Reverend Divine (for such
I take him to be by the contents of it,) seems to be
penned with that care and caution, as if he were willing
to have it publick; and without any intimation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slike
for my having published his former Letter in like
Circumstances: I have thought not amiss (nor unagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his mind) to publish this also. Which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:
(supplying the Date from the Post-mark at
<hi>London,</hi> denoting what day it was given-in to the Post-Office
there.)</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOur Repeated Letters, give me a just occasion of Repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my hearty Thanks to you. And I hope you will
give me leave to join both my good Wishes and Endeavours
to promote that <hi>Moderation</hi> which you seem to Aim at, in
stating the <hi>Mysterious</hi> Truths concerning the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
we might be easily perswaded to this; by the Difficulties
which all men find in <hi>conceiving</hi> those <hi>Mysteries:</hi> Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Consequences which some make from them; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon us as Certain and Sacred Truths.</p>
                  <p>Sir, Because I would have you lose as little of your Time
as may be in reading my Letters; I will enter immediately
upon the Subject proposed; and consider, not some lesser Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but the Two <hi>Main Points</hi> in the Doctrine of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
and the Difficulties which our Vnderstandings represent
to us in the Conception of them.</p>
                  <p>The Two Main Points are these: The <hi>Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>
notwithstanding the <hi>Distinction of Three Persons:</hi>
And the <hi>Equality</hi> of those Three <hi>Persons,</hi> notwithstanding
their <hi>Derivation</hi> one from another.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Divine <hi>Persons;</hi> The Hypothesis which we
referred to formerly (and shall still follow) asserts these Three
Things. <hi>First,</hi> That they are <hi>Three Beings</hi> (or <hi>Three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
Beings) Really Distinct. Secondly,</hi> That they
are <hi>Three Substantial Beings,</hi> Really <hi>Distinct. Thirdly,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56321:4"/>
That they are <hi>Three Infinite Minds,</hi> or <hi>Three Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
Really Distinct.</hi> And to these, I think, we may of
course add a Fourth Character, That they are Three <hi>Compleat
Beings, really Distinct.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are not <hi>Inadequate</hi> or <hi>Partial</hi> Beings. <hi>For a Spirit
infinite in Perfection,</hi> as each of these is represented, can
want nothing to compleat its Being or Perfection.</p>
                  <p>Let us now, if you please, run over these Characters; and
observe the most obvious Difficulties, that occurr to our Minds
in the Conception of them.</p>
                  <p>For the first, <hi>Three Beings really distinct.</hi> According
to the plain Tract of humane Reason, Every real Being hath
its Essence; (that is the Basis it stands upon, as distinguished
from Non-Entity, or a Fictitious Being). And every Distinct
Being hath its Distinct Essence: I mean, Numerically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct.
And therefore, according to this Principle, there ought
to be Three <hi>distinct Essences</hi> in the Godhead, seeing there
are Three Beings, there, really distinct.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore; If you give one single Essence to Three Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
really distinct, you must either Divide it, or Multiply
it. Either each of these Beings must have a <hi>Piece</hi> of this
Essence; and then you Divide it: or each must have the
<hi>Whole;</hi> and then, being but one Whole, you cannot give it
to Three without Multiplying of it.</p>
                  <p>This is still made more difficult to conceive, when the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
allows these Three to be as Distinct as <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and
<hi>John.</hi> For if they be as Distinct as <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John;</hi>
they are One but as <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> For every degree
of Distinction takes away a degree of Vnity: As every degree
of Heat, takes away a degree of Cold.</p>
                  <p>We proceed to the second Character. The Three Divine
Persons, are <hi>Three Substantial Beings, Really distinct.</hi>
That is, in plain English, are Three <hi>Substances</hi> Really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct.
As a <hi>Spiritual Being</hi> is a Spirit; a <hi>Corporeal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
a Body: so a <hi>Substantial Being</hi> is a <hi>Substance;</hi> (put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56321:4"/>
onely Two Words for One.) And the Author must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it so; because he makes them Three <hi>Spirits</hi> afterwards:
and therefore they must be Three <hi>Substances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, what are they, 'pray, if not Substances? they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Modes, or bare Relations. I know some <hi>Platonists</hi> call
them <hi>Super-Substances.</hi> Or, if you will think them lower, and
call them <hi>Semi-Substances,</hi> (as some Philosophers do their
<hi>Substantial Forms:</hi>) All this is but playing with Words.
For there is nothing represented to our Faculties, but as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
Modes, or Relations; excepting what is meerly No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
                  <p>And the Learned Author must not debar us the use of the
Word <hi>Substance,</hi> under pretence that it sounds <hi>Corporeally.</hi>
For two Creeds make use of it: and the Scripture it self, upon
a fair interpretation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
                  <p>To proceed therefore. Here are <hi>Three Substances</hi> Really
Distinct, whereof each is <hi>a God (pag. 47. l. 13. p. 98. l.
23.)</hi> and yet there is but <hi>One God.</hi> This is very hard to
conceive, as contrary to all our Idea's of <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, we may conceive these Three Substances, in strict
Vnion one with another, notwithstanding their real Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
But <hi>Union</hi> is one thing, and <hi>Unity</hi> is another. For
Vnity excludes all Plurality and Multiplicity; which Vnion
doth not, but rather supposes it. Vnity also, in simple Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
excludes all Compositions: which Vnion, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
always Implies, in one kind or other.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly; Substances, upon Vnion, are not Confounded
or Identified, or brought to Vnity of Substance: But, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
numerically distinct Substances, acquire some Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
or Communication of Operations: namely, of such Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Passions as they are respectively capable of.</p>
                  <p>Let us consider Instances of these things, in the chief uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are known to us. Our Soul and Body are two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
really distinct, and in close Vnion with one another:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56321:5"/>
But, notwithstanding this, they continue distinct Substances
under that Vnion. In like manner, the Humane Soul of Christ
is in Vnion with the <hi>Logos,</hi> or second Person of the Trinity,
which we call an <hi>Hypostatical Union:</hi> But neither doth this
Vnion make any Vnity of Substance; for the two substances of
the Divine and Humane Natures, continue Distinct under
that Vnion. Which must not be allowed in the Vnity of the
Godhead, where there can be no Plurality or Multiplicity of
Substances.</p>
                  <p>The Learned Author does acknowledge <hi>(p. 87, 97.)</hi> that
these three Substances, if they were separate, would be three
Gods: but being Inseparate and Inseparable, they make but
One. This is again uneasy to conceive, that Substances Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Distinct, should not be separable. For the notion of a
Substance, is, of that which may subsist by it self: And what
mark have we of separability but Real Distinction? Things
that are only Modally or Notionally distinct, we allow cannot
subsist separate: But if they be <hi>Really</hi> distinct, as Substances,
why may they not be separated Really? When we have proved,
the Real Distinction of the Soul and the Body, as two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
we think we have sufficient ground to assert the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rability
of the Soul from the Body. And from the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
we assert the Parts of Matter to be Separable, as being
Really distinct Substances, let their Vnion be otherwise what
it will. For, if our Faculties be true, what things we clearly
conceive Really distinct <hi>(ut res &amp; res)</hi> may (possibly) be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated.
Clear and Distinct Conception being to us the rule of
Partibility.</p>
                  <p>But however! Suppose, if you please, this Vnion Indissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
this does not change it into Vnity. If the Soul of Man
was made to be in Perpetual Conjunction with Matter, as some
<hi>Platonists</hi> affirm: that doth not make Matter and the Soul,
One and the same substance; nor Matter cease to be Matter,
or the Soul a Spirit. So, if you suppose these three Divine
Substances to be under an Indissoluble Vnion; that doth not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56321:5"/>
make them cease to be three Substances, but, it makes them,
Three Substances in an Indissoluble Vnion.</p>
                  <p>What the learned Authour says concerning Matter and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension,
may be returned upon him in reference to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
<hi>(p. 80. l. 9, 10.)</hi> He supposes Extension to consist of
Parts, if they be only Assignable parts, whether they can be
divided or not: so, say we, (according to this opinion) The
Godhead may consist of several Substances, if they be only As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signable
Substances, whether they can be Divided or not: And
you may as Distinctly Assign, by your Vnderstanding, Three
Substances in the Godhead, that of the Father, that of the
Son, and that of the Holy Ghost; as you may Assign Three

                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> There is no Substance lost or destroyed in this or
any other Vnion, Dissoluble, or Indissoluble: Therefore, as
to Substances, they are the same, whether in Conjunction or
Separation.</p>
                  <p>We come unto the Third Character. <hi>(pag.</hi> 50. 166. 258.
see also <hi>p. 93.)</hi> The Three Divine Persons are <hi>Three Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Minds,</hi> or <hi>Three Holy Spirits:</hi> And yet <hi>but One God.</hi>
This rises still higher than the former as to its Vnconceivable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
It seems to say and unsay the same thing, with the same
breath. An <hi>Infinite Spirit</hi> is compleatly a God, as to Essence
and Attributes: Therefore three such are three Gods. <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
mens infinitè perfecta est Deus; Tres sunt mentes
infinitè perfectae; Ergo Tres sunt Dii.</hi> Where is the fourth
of this Syllogism?</p>
                  <p>This Character seems to assert <hi>Three Infinites:</hi> Whereas the
<hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed, which stands at the highest pitch of any, is
yet very tender and cautious in giving the number <hi>Three</hi> to
any thing but the <hi>Persons.</hi> It will not allow three <hi>Eternals,</hi>
nor three <hi>Incomprehensibles,</hi> nor three <hi>Almighties:</hi> But,
<hi>three Infinites</hi> include all these.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Infinite Spirit</hi> (as I said before) is a God, (I mean,
Infinite in Perfection, as our Authour doth,) And three Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56321:6"/>
whereof each is Infinite in Perfection, are Three Gods:
As, three Creatures, whereof each is a Rational Animal, are
three Men. Both these Propositions go upon the same ground,
namely, That the Definition, and the thing Defined, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
and of the same extent. Now as we have no better De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of a Man, than that he is a <hi>Rational Animal;</hi> so
neither have we a better Definition of a <hi>God,</hi> than that he is a
<hi>Spirit infinitely Perfect.</hi> And as so many Animals Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
so many Men; so likewise, so many Spirits infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
so many Gods.</p>
                  <p>I speak this according to the use of our Faculties. For,
what the true and precise state of things is, in themselves,
when the question is concerning Infinite Natures, I do not
presume to determine.</p>
                  <p>But thus much, I think, we may safely determine, That in
such cases where our Faculties are at a loss, the safest way is
to keep close to Revelation and the words of Scripture. And
that's the Conclusion I drive at.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> To put a plain question, which will come into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one's mind: Here are Three Spirits infinitely Perfect; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are <hi>Gods,</hi> or they are <hi>Creatures?</hi> They must be one
of the Two. When we speak of <hi>a Spirit infinitely perfect,</hi>
we describe an absolute, <hi>compleat,</hi> entire Being. Which must
be of some Denomination, either a God, or a Creature; for
we know nothing of a middle nature betwixt these.</p>
                  <p>Possibly they will Answer this by a Distinction; namely, that
they are three Gods considered Separately; but considered col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively
and in Vnion, they are but One God: And seeing
they cannot be really separate, it would be improper to call them
Three Gods. But, pray, Why not as properly three Gods, as
three Infinite Spirits? seeing these terms, <hi>A Spirit infinitely
perfect,</hi> and <hi>A God,</hi> are terms equivalent or identical. What
partiality is it then to allow the one, and not the other? And
if these Infinite Spirits be Inseparable, why do you grant the
number <hi>Three</hi> to that name, and not to the name of Gods?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56321:6"/>
seeing they are both the same Thing, and equally Insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>We observed before, that this Learned Authour is liberal
in his <hi>Threes;</hi> three Intelligent Beings, three Infinite Minds,
three Holy Spirits, three Divine Glories, three Majesties;
but not three Kings. 'Tis the Name, it seems, is scrupled, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the Thing.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I will add no more upon these Heads. But will consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
now the grand Principle which is designed to take off all
these Difficulties; And that is, <hi>mutual Consciousness;</hi>
whereby all these <hi>Threes</hi> are made <hi>One;</hi> and reduced to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Numerical <hi>Unity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not spend time in telling you what the Author means
by <hi>mutual Consciousness,</hi> nor how he applies it to the present
case: You know them both sufficiently. But methinks this
Vnitive Principle is defectively expressed, by the word <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness.</hi>
For bare Consciousness, without Consent, is no
more than bare Omnisciency. As God is Conscious of all our
Thoughts, good or bad; and of all the Devils thoughts; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Vnion, as without Consent. If a good and bad Angel
were made mutually Conscious of one anothers mind, they would
not thereupon become One, being still of different Wills and
Inclinations.</p>
                  <p>It may be the Author will say, <hi>Consciousness</hi> involves
<hi>Consent,</hi> as he says, <hi>Knowledge</hi> involves <hi>Power,</hi> or is the
same with it. But, besides, that I cannot well reconcile the
Author to himself in this point, (See <hi>P.</hi> 9. l. 3, 4. compared
with <hi>p.</hi> 72.) I have given you Instances in a former Letter
to the contrary. To which you may add, if you please, this
further consideration: If Knowledge be the same thing with
Power, then actual Conception is the same thing with actual
Execution. And if so, then You and I may sit quietly in our
studies, and, with our Thought and Pen, build Palaces, and
take Towns and Cities. For we know the Methods of both, and
can distinctly conceive them and delineate them. And as these
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56321:7"/>
are not the same thing in us, so neither can we conceive them,
in all respects, the same in God. For, from all Eternity, God
had a clear Idea of the frame of the World, and of the manner
of producing it: therefore, if Gods Conception or Knowledge
had been the same with his Power, the World had been produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from Eternity.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, Let us give this Principle its full strength,
<hi>Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Consent:</hi> they would not together make
a perfect Vnity of <hi>Operations</hi> in the Deity, much less of
<hi>Substance.</hi> We noted before, that Vnity and Vnion are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
things. And this is more apparent now, when Three
Spirits are to be united into One. For how that can be done
without some sort of Composition, is an unconceivable Mystery.
You may indeed conceive these Three Spirits, singly and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
as simple Beings: But if you conceive these three sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Beings united into One (without Annihilation of any one)
that <hi>One</hi> must be a Compound Being, according to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
                  <p>Then, as to Vnity of <hi>Operations:</hi> Besides the Energies
peculiar to the Father and the Son, this Author allows (<hi>p.</hi> 67.)
that every one of these three Minds, notwithstanding their
Vnion, hath some Distinct Consciousness, not common to the
other Two: therefore the Godhead, which consists of these
Three Minds, cannot be One as a single Mind is One; where
there is an intire Community and Sameness of Consciousness,
in all Operations.</p>
                  <p>In my opinion, if this Hypothesis were prest to speak out,
the plain language of it would be this; There are Three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Substances, three Holy Spirits, infinitely Perfect, and,
in truth and reality, three Gods: But, for some Reasons,
not fit to be called so. These three Beings, by Similitude of
Nature, mutual Consciousness, Consent, Cooperation, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the greatest Vnion possible; and, in that state of Vnion,
do constitute the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Intire All, comprehensive God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
This, I confess, books something like a conceivable
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56321:7"/>
thing: But the Christian Trinity does not use to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
thus. For this amounts to no more than a kind of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatical</hi>
Vnion of Three Divine Spirits.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I will trouble you no further upon the first general
Head, The <hi>Distinction of the Persons.</hi> I proceed now to
consider the <hi>Equality of the Persons.</hi> Which I will dispatch
in a few Words.</p>
                  <p>The first Argument against their Equality may be this (<hi>pag.
99. l. 29. &amp;c.</hi>) The Father is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>self-existen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,
self-originated:</hi> whereas the other Two are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
and originated from another.</hi> Now this cannot but
make, according to our Faculties, not only some Difference,
but also some Inequality. For 'tis a fundamental Perfection to
be <hi>self-originated:</hi> and what is not so, is not Equal to that
which is so.</p>
                  <p>You will say possibly, Though the Son and Holy-Ghost are
produced of the Father, yet 'tis not in such a way as Creatures
are produced. That is, by a voluntary External Act; but
This, by an Internal, Necessary, and Emanative Act.</p>
                  <p>We will allow your Distinction; and admit that the Son
and Holy-Ghost have a different Origin from that of common
Creatures. But this does not remove the Difficulty. It shews
indeed a great Difference and Inequality betwixt any of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Persons, and bare Creatures: But it does not shew any
Equality amongst the Divine Persons themselves. 'Tis true,
the Dependance which a Creature hath upon the Creator for its
Being, is of another kind and degree from that of the Son or
Holy-Ghost. But however, they are Derivative Beings, in
some way or other, and dependent upon the Father. And we
cannot but conceive some Inequality betwixt an Original and
a Derivative, a Dependent and Independent Being.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That Act whereby the Son is Generated by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is some Energy and Perfection: Nay, 'tis an Energy of
the Highest Perfection; Because the Result of it is the most
Perfect Being that can any way be produced; or the Noblest and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56321:8"/>
Greatest Product in Things. Creation, or that Energy that
produceth a Creature, hath not a Term or Effect so Noble or so
Great, as that Energy whereby the Son is generated: And
consequently it is not so great a Perfection to Create a World,
as to Generate the Divine <hi>Logos.</hi> This being so; there is,
you see, not only Self-Origination in the Father, which is not
in the Son: but also an Active Perfection of the highest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
possible, in the One, which is not in the other. And
therefore we cannot in either respect, conceive these two Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
equal.</p>
                  <p>Besides, if you make them all three Equal, and all Infinite;
they will be Co-ordinate, (I mean internally, &amp; as to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Nature: For, External Subordination, as to Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
signifies nothing in this case.) And are no more One, than
three Individuals of the same Species are One; that is, than
<hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are or may be One. And this, I
think, was the Doctrine of the <hi>Tritheites,</hi> or very near it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> You may please to reflect upon the various Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Expressions of the Ancients, concerning the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Preheminence of the Fathers, (which you know are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Petavius (de Trin. lib. 2. c.</hi> 2. &amp; l. 8. <hi>c. 9. §. 15.)</hi>
and consider their Consistency or Inconsistency with perfect E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality.</p>
                  <p>Sir, As I do not write this with any Disrespect to that
Treatise, (which contains many Excellent things:) so neither
to represent absolute Truth or Vntruth: But the Difficulty of
our conceiving things of an Infinite Nature. From which
Consideration I would willingly infer Two Conclusions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That we ought to keep close to Scripture in these
Mysterious Doctrines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we should not impose Consequences hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely
made, with the same Rigour as divinely revealed
Truths.</p>
                  <p>The Anti-trinitarian System is not at all suited to my Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.
Yet I would not stretch our Trinitarian Doctrine so
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56321:8"/>
far, as to set it at a distance from Scripture as well as from
Reason. <hi>Secret things belong unto the Lord: but those
things that are Revealed, belong to us and our Children.</hi>
Deut. 29. 29. And the Angels, it may be, think us as foolish
and ridiculous, for pursuing these Notions, as we think our
selves wise and learned in such pursuits.</p>

                  <p>I Am obliged to you for the Kind and Respectful Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
which you are pleased to afford me in Both
your Letters. I am not at all displeased (but thank you
for it) with a like <hi>Moderation</hi> in Yours (to what you
commend in my Letters) as to the <hi>Mysterious</hi> Truths
concerning the Sacred <hi>Trinity:</hi> And do fully close with
what you say in the Conclusion, <hi>That the Angels may
think us as Foolish and Ridiculous, for pursuing these Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
further than they are Revealed, as we think our selves
Wise and Learned in such pursuits:</hi> Like as You or I should
Laugh at a <hi>Blind</hi> man (who had never <hi>seen</hi>) that should
undertake to Conceive in his Mind, and Express to us
in word,) a Distinct and Perfect Notion or <hi>Idea</hi> of
<hi>Sight, Light,</hi> and <hi>Colours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56321:9"/>
He may Hear the Noise or Sound of those three <hi>Words</hi>
(supposing him, though Blind, not to be <hi>Deaf</hi> also,)
and may Believe that they signifie <hi>Somewhat.</hi> But, what
that <hi>Somewhat</hi> is, he cannot Tell; having never had an
Idea thereof in his Mind, nor a Perception thereof by
his Senses.</p>
                  <p>And if You or I (from that Notion which our selves
have of it) would Explain it to him: We could do it no
otherwise than by the Use of such Words (in a sense
Analogical) as do properly belong to somewhat of which
he hath (from Experience) some Idea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sight,</hi> we might say, is a certain kind of <hi>Sense</hi> or <hi>Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
in our <hi>Eyes</hi> (which we have not in our Hand, Feet,
or other parts of our Body,) whereby we can (as it were)
Feel with our Eyes, the <hi>Shape, Figure, Bigness</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi>
of a Body at a Distance; as we might, with our
<hi>Hands</hi> if within our Reach. Whereby he might Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
that there is some kind of Resemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Seeing and Feeling; but, what indeed it is to <hi>See,</hi>
he cannot comprehend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Light,</hi> we might tell him, is a Necessary <hi>Requisite</hi> to
<hi>such a Feeling with our Eyes,</hi> as that for want of it (which
Want we call <hi>Darkness</hi>) we can no more <hi>so Feel,</hi> or <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,</hi>
by our <hi>Eyes,</hi> such Shape, Figure, or Bigness; than
we could, with our Hands, that (suppose) of a Piece of
Money locked up in a Box which we could not open; but,
by the Admission of such Requisite, we are inabled <hi>so to
Feel</hi> it with our <hi>Eyes,</hi> as we might with our <hi>Hands,</hi> if the
Box were opened whereby we might come to Handle
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Colour,</hi> we might tell him, is somewhat of such a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as that, on a Plain Board (or the like) on which by
our Hand we can Feel nothing but Smooth and Uniform;
by it may be Represented (to be <hi>so Felt</hi> with our Eyes)
as great variety of Shapes and Figures, (suppose, of a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56321:9"/>
Horse, a Bird, a Ship, a House, or any Shape whatever)
as by our Hand we might, if we had such Shapes formed
in Wood or Stone; and the different Motions of such.</p>
                  <p>But, after all this, it is not possible for this Blind man,
to have that <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Notion</hi> in his Fancy, of <hi>Sight, Light,</hi>
and <hi>Colour,</hi> which we have who <hi>See.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is much more Impossible for Us (who have
no Notions in our Mind, other than what we derive,
Mediately or Immediately, from Sensible Impressions of
Finite Corporeal Beings) to have a Clear and Perfect
Notion, of the Nature, Unity, Distinctions or Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of an Infinite Spiritual Being; or otherwise to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
them than by some Imperfect Analogies or Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
with things we are conversant with; and by
words in a borrowed sense from such.</p>
                  <p>I do therefore fully agree with you in your <hi>Two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions;</hi>
namely, That it is Safe and Prudent <hi>to keep close
to Scripture in these Mysterious Doctrines;</hi> (since we know
nothing of them otherwise than as there Revealed:)
And, <hi>not to impose Consequences of Humane Deduction, with
the like Rigour as Divinely-revealed Truths.</hi> For, even in
common affairs, when things are represented onely by
the Analogy or Resemblance which they bear to some
other things; it is seldom that the Similitude is so Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
between them, but that there is some Dissimilitude
likewise. Much more when the Distance is so great as
between Finite Corporeal Beings, and what is Infinite
and Incorporeal. So that we cannot always argue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
from one to the other.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the words <hi>Nature, Essence, Vnity, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
Father, Son, Person, Beget, Proceed,</hi> (and the
like,) when applied to <hi>God</hi> in a borrowed sense from
what they properly signifie as applied to <hi>Creatures,</hi> must
not be supposed to signifie just the same, but somewhat
Analogous to that of their Primary signification; nor
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56321:10"/>
Consequences thence to be deduced with the same Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</p>
                  <p>It would be mere Cavilling for any to argue, that,
Because <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> are separable in Man;
Therefore, what in God we call by those names, are so
in God; and that, consequently, it may be Possible for
the All-wise God, not to be Almighty; or the Almighty
God, not to be All-wise.</p>
                  <p>So, if we should argue from the <hi>manner</hi> of our <hi>Loca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
or <hi>Duration,</hi> to God's <hi>Vbiquity without Extension,</hi> and
his <hi>Eternity without Succession;</hi> the Inferences must needs
be Lame and Inconsequent. With other Inferences of
like nature.</p>
                  <p>And, (even without proceeding to Infinites) if we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a <hi>Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man, to be void of <hi>Parts</hi> and
Local <hi>Extension,</hi> and therefore (as the Phrase is) <hi>tota in
toto &amp; tota in qualibet parte</hi> of that Space or Matter to
which it is compresent: And should yet argue (as you
do in a like case) <hi>If one single Spirit be compresent with
three or more really-distinct Parts of Space or Matter; we must
Divide or Multiply it: Either each of these extensive Parts
must have a Piece of that Spirit; and then you Divide it:
Or, each must have the Whole, and (there being but one
Whole) you cannot give it to each, without Multiplying it:</hi>
Such <hi>Inference</hi> upon such a <hi>Supposition</hi> (which <hi>Supposition</hi>
I am loth to think <hi>Impossible,</hi>) must needs be Lame.</p>
                  <p>Yet such are commonly the Cavils of those who study
to pick Quarrels with the Doctrine of the Trinity as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in Scripture. And (in particular) though, amongst
Men, <hi>Three Persons</hi> are sometimes (not always) so used
as to import <hi>three Men;</hi> we may not thence conclude,
that the three <hi>Divine</hi> Persons, must needs imply <hi>three
Gods.</hi> Or, if the word <hi>Persons</hi> do not please, (though
I think it a fit word in the case; we can spare the word,
without prejudice to the Cause, (for 'tis the <hi>Notion,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56321:10"/>
than the <hi>Name,</hi> that we contend for,) and content
our selves to say, They be <hi>three Somewhats</hi> which are but
<hi>One God.</hi> Or, we may so explain our selves, That, by
<hi>three Persons</hi> we mean <hi>three such Somewhats</hi> as are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with being <hi>One God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hitherto, I suppose, that You and I do well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
agree.</p>
                  <p>Now, as to what you observe concerning the Learned
Author (Dr. <hi>Sherlock;</hi>) I shall begin where you end:
And agree with you, that the <hi>Treatise (to which you refer)
contains many Excellent things.</hi> The Strength and Weight
of his Arguments, as to those to whom he undertakes
Answer, doth not depend upon those Expressions against
which you object: But his Arguments against those,
are of equal Force, though these Expressions were spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>As to those Expressions of his, by you noted, That the
<hi>three Divine Persons</hi> are <hi>Three Beings (three Intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
three Substantial Beings, three Holy Spirits,) Really
Distinct,</hi> even as distinct as <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> and
<hi>One God</hi> onely as they are <hi>mutually Conscious:</hi> I was (I
confess) Unsatisfied therein (as You are) from the first;
Looking upon them as Expressions too Hardy for one to
venture upon, (and so I find are most others with whom
I have discoursed about them:) and wish he had decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them.</p>
                  <p>Yet I did not think it necessary for me to write against
them (though I did not like them) but chose rather to
wave them, and express my self otherwise. (For it
would be Endless if I should make it my business to write
Books against every one who hath some Expressions
which I cannot approve, amongst many others wherein
I think he doth well.) Nor shall I Aggravate the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
which you have Urged against them; But leave
them as they are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56321:11"/>
I might perhaps mollifie some of his Expressions, by
putting a softer sense upon them than at first view they
seem to bear; (for I find some Men, in such matters, do
use words at a very different rate from what others do:)
But I have not (where now I am) the Book at hand;
and have read it but once (a good while since) when it
first came out: and therefore am not willing to say much
without Book, least I should miss his sense, or not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it to his mind.</p>
                  <p>That learned Author may, if he think fit, so Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
or Explain those Expressions as he shall judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient:
Or he may (which I had rather he should)
Decline them, without prejudice to his main Cause;
(which, in my opinion, he may as well defend without
them:) and thereby less expose himself to the Cavils of
the Anti-trinitarians; who are catching at every colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
pretence of Objecting, though not against the main
Cause concerning the Trinity, if but against some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of those who maintain it.</p>
                  <p>Thus far, I think, He and both of Us do agree;
namely, That there is a <hi>Distinction</hi> between the <hi>Three,</hi>
more than meerly <hi>Notional,</hi> and even more than that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
(what we commonly call) the <hi>Divine Attributes;</hi>
yet not so as to be <hi>Three Gods,</hi> or more Gods than <hi>One:</hi>
(which is as much as we need maintain against the Anti-Trinitarians:)
And, that the word <hi>Person</hi> is no unfit
Name to denote that Distinction. And thus far we may
close with him, notwithstanding some other Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Expressions.</p>
                  <p>And if it be agreed that these <hi>Three</hi> (thus distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
are but <hi>One God</hi> (each Communicating in one and
the same Numerical Essence,) then they are all <hi>Equal</hi> (as
to that common <hi>Internal Essence,</hi> and the common Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
thereof:) and then an <hi>External Subordination, as to
Oeconomy</hi> (you grant) <hi>signifies nothing in this case.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:56321:11"/>
Now, Sir, if you look back upon your own Discourse:
You will find, that the whole Edge of your Arguments
is directed against those Expressions, <hi>Three</hi> Beings, <hi>Three</hi>
Substances, <hi>Three</hi> Spirits; (and I do acknowledge, that,
as to these, the Arguments seem to me sharp enough,
and to do their work.) But if, instead of these, he say
(as I think he should) that The <hi>Three Persons</hi> are <hi>One</hi>
Being, <hi>One</hi> Substance, <hi>One</hi> Spirit, (like as he says they
are <hi>One God</hi>) that Edge will be taken off<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>That (I conceive) which did impose upon him in this
Point, is the <hi>forced sense,</hi> which, in our Language, we
sometimes put upon the word <hi>Person,</hi> for want of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
English Word (answering to <hi>Homo</hi>) which might
indifferently respect <hi>Man, Woman,</hi> and <hi>Child:</hi> and a like
<hi>forced sense</hi> put by the School-men upon the word <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
for want of a Latin word which might equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> as signifying an <hi>Intelligent Being.</hi>
Whence he was induced to think, that <hi>Three Persons</hi>
must needs be Three <hi>Intelligent Beings.</hi> Whereas <hi>Persona,</hi>
in its true and ancient sense (before the School-men put
this forced sense upon it) did not signify a <hi>Man</hi> simply;
but, one under such, and such, and such <hi>Circumstances,</hi>
or <hi>Qualifications.</hi> So that the <hi>same Man</hi> (if capable of
being qualified thus, and thus, and thus,) might sustain
<hi>three Persons,</hi> and these <hi>three Persons,</hi> be the same Man.</p>
                  <p>Now if (as he says of himself elsewhere in a like case)
he have not been taken to be <hi>a Fool:</hi> Yet a wise Man
may sometimes, upon second thoughts, see Reason to
change his Opinion (as in that case he did) or rectify his
Expressions. And if then he consider, how much easier
it will be (and less obnoxious to Exceptions) to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56321:12"/>
his Hypothesis thus Rectified: He may think I have
done him no ill Offices thus to suggest.</p>
                  <p>Having thus given you my thoughts of this Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis:
If you press me further (as between our selves) to
tell you, What <hi>Degree of Distinction</hi> (as in our Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks
they are wont to be Reckoned up) I take this to
be, between the Three Divine Persons: I think we need
not much trouble our selves with such niceties. And if
I do tell you; it is only <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> as what doth not
much concern the main question in hand; (which is safe
enough without it:) Nor that I so prescribe therein, as
to require others to express their Sentiments just as
I do.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Degrees</hi> of Distinction commonly mentioned in
our <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> are such as these: <hi>Distinctio rationis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinantis,</hi>
(which is purely Notional, and depends meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on our Imagination:) <hi>Destinatio rationis ratiocinatae</hi>
(which is otherwise said to be <hi>secundum inadaequatos con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptus
ejusdem rei:) Distinctio Modalis,</hi> (either <hi>ut res &amp;
modus,</hi> or <hi>ut modus &amp; modus,</hi>) which is otherwise said
to be <hi>ex parte rei sed non ut res &amp; res:</hi> And <hi>Distinctio rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
or <hi>ut res &amp; res.</hi> Though, in the Names of these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Degrees, all Writers do not always speak alike.
One perhaps by a distinction <hi>ex parte rei,</hi> may mean the
same which another means by <hi>Distinctio Realis:</hi> And so
of the rest. And these thus marshalled are but a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of our own. They might, for ought I know,
have been made more or fewer if the Contriver had so
thought fit.</p>
                  <p>But these Degrees of Distinction, I take to be prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
fitted to our Notions of <hi>Created</hi> Beings. And are not
intended as applicable to God, otherwise than by <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy;</hi>
as other Words properly fitted to created Beings
are wont to be so applied. And therefore I should choose
to say, that (in strictness of speech) our Metaphysicks
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56321:12"/>
have not yet given a Name to these Distinctions: Nor
do I know any need of it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Divine Attributes,</hi> we use to say, are distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>ratione ratiocinata,</hi> or as <hi>inadaequati conceptus ejusdem
rei.</hi> And it is well enough so to say, to those that have
not a mind to be captious; but are willing to understand
Figurative Words in a Figurative sense. But, to those
that have a mind to Cavil, I would speak more cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and say, It is, in God, somewhat Analogous to
what we so call in Created Beings. And, That of the
<hi>Divine Persons,</hi> somewhat Analogous, in the Deity, to
what, in Created Beings, is called <hi>Distinctio Modalis,</hi> or
<hi>Distinctio à parte rei, sed non ut res &amp; res.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be asked, What that Distinction is which is thus
Analogous: I say, that I cannot tell. You must first tell
me (and enable me to comprehend) what is the full and
adaequate import of the words <hi>Father, Son, Beget, Proceed,
&amp;c.</hi> when applied to God, in a sense Analogous to what
they signify as to Created Beings. If you cannot tell
me, precisely, what they are: How should I tell you,
How they Differ?</p>
                  <p>But what need we trouble our selves with these Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or Names of these Degrees of Distinction? (Which,
when we have all done, will by divers Men be diversly
expressed.) I think it is enough to say, The Distinction
is Greater than that of (what we call) the <hi>Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes;</hi>
but not so as to make them <hi>Three Gods.</hi> Or, That
they be <hi>so Three,</hi> as yet to be but <hi>One God.</hi> And I am
content to rest there.</p>
