         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

IN order to the detection and unmasking of the four Jugling Impoſtures, (firſt above-named) I take my ſelf obliged (in diſcharge of my Duty towards God and Man) to caution the Readers, or Patients, (as they tender their own eaſe, the Cure of their Diſtempers, or their own Lives) ſeriouſly to weigh, and impartialy to remark theſe Obſervations, following; wherein I do repreſent nothing but what I can duly and ſufficiently prove, (as divers perſons of known Integrity and worth, in this City, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, know to be true,) <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Thomas Witherden,</hi> (Pag. 1. of his Licencious Pamphlet) ſaith, that Providence put into his hands the Deſcription and preparation of an Excellent Liquour, which he <hi>now</hi> calls his true and perfect <hi>Elixir Salutis,</hi> (obtained of an Eminent Perſon) and that he (reſolving to make a narrow ſcrutiny into my <hi>ELIXIR)</hi> traced me, 'till he Centred in the ſame Author with me; whereunto I the ſaid <hi>Anthony Daffy</hi> do anſwer, That of his Centring with me in the ſame Author of my <hi>ELIXIR,</hi> there is no other proof, than that of his own <hi>iste dixit,</hi> or bare ſay ſo: And what place that, (though the Word of a Gentleman, as himſelf alſo ſaith) will find in Impartial and Judicious Readers beliefs, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from a perſon ſpeaking for lucres ſake, in his own caſe,) I leave to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And further, I do in the preſence of the Almighty ſearcher of hearts affirm, that (many years ſince) I the ſaid <hi>A. D.</hi> did by my own Experience and Reading, add a conſiderable number of Ingredients unto that Receipt, for making <hi>ELIXIR,</hi> (then tofore, by my worthy and honoured Friend conferr'd upon mee) and did alſo much vary from the ſaid Receipt, both in the Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Qualities of thoſe Ingredients in the ſaid Receipt ſpecified: And I do further affirm, that neither my ſaid Friend, himſelf, (from whom, at firſt, I had the ſaid Receipt) or any other man (my ſelf only excepted) either doth, or at any time did know all the Ingredients, (much leſs, their quantities) which I have (for many years paſt) made uſe of (and do ſtill uſe) in the preparing and making of my <hi>ELIXIR.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid Mr. <hi>Witherden</hi> (pag. 2.) ſaith, that (to pare of my gain,) he ſells his Drink, (certainly, more exactly prepared than mine, if he be not miſtaken) for 4s. the Pinte; whereunto I the ſaid <hi>A. D.</hi> do anſwer, that I know not what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients he uſes, and how cheap they are, that he puts into his <hi>Drink,</hi> but do find my own, a coſtly preparation, and ſo coſtly, that if my <hi>ELIXIR</hi> were to be Sold at his <hi>Drinks</hi> price, the Vendors gain would upon the matter, equalize my own, and without any conſideration for my Skill, and my own, and Servants great labour in preparing and making it: Beſides, it is well known, that I freely give away a great part of my gains by the Rich, unto the Poor: And I do (with others, that are more acquainted with Mr. <hi>Witherden</hi>'s Drink than my ſelf) ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naly conclude, that his Patients (if any in Nature) might (with far more ſafety) give <hi>iiij s.</hi> for a Pint of Pump water, than pay him <hi>iiij d.</hi> for his <hi>Elixir.</hi> There
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57289:2"/>
was with me this day, (being <hi>Saturday</hi> 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>June,</hi> 1674) a Gent. of great Quality, for ſome of my <hi>Elixir,</hi> acquainting me, that he (dwelling in <hi>Kent,</hi> as I take it) and having taken ſome of Mr. <hi>Witherden</hi>'s Drink) doth (not without great cauſe) repent he ever medled with it; and having taken a ſmall parcel thereof, comes often to me, ſaying he will keep cloſe to my <hi>Elixir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid Mr. <hi>Witherden</hi> (in the 3. page of his Pamphlet) expreſſes himſelf in theſe words, <hi>viz. That which is called the</hi> Elixir Salutis, <hi>that it is the ſame with mine I affirm; And for the Truth thereof, I appeal to any Judicious perſon, who will but try them both, and I will abide by his Impartial Cenſure,</hi> &amp;c. then breaks out into ſcurrilous Impertinencies, and <hi>Moccado</hi> ends of <hi>Latine,</hi> which I the ſaid <hi>A. D.</hi> (humbly conceive) might as well have been omitted; and the Senſe, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and Orthography, better minded: See page 2. line 19. and other places of his Pamphlet; very much miſbeſeeming ſo learned an Oracle as he would be deemed. Yet, as to Mr. <hi>Witherden</hi>'s Affirmation concerning his <hi>Elixir,</hi> I, the ſaid <hi>A. D.</hi> ſhall not Controvert, (the perſon affirmant being a Gent.) but ſhall (in ſome Caſes) grant him: For indeed (here at <hi>London)</hi> we well know, That the Balderdaſh ſtuff, foiſted out by Moſt of the Counterfeiters of my <hi>Elixir,</hi> is by themſelves and others (as wiſe as they) called the <hi>Elixir Salutis,</hi> and that by way of preheminency (no doubt) unto all other: Yet, of ſuch kinds of Balderdaſh liquours, the Judicious perſons under <hi>Londons</hi> Meridian (let thoſe in the Country be as prodigal of their healths and eaſe as they will) have reaſon enough about them, to let others make Tryal, before they venture; for that ſome fool-hardy people have Tryed away their eaſe, others, their healths, and ſome their lives; (as is too well known.) Yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the weight and validity of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Witherden</hi>'s Proof by Appeal, and his Promiſe threupon; (admitting his Rhetorique do prevail upon a Judicious perſon to take his Drink, having taken my <hi>Elixir</hi> before; I, the ſaid <hi>A. D.</hi> do affirm that the ſaid Promiſe is grounded upon Cautelous and Subterfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous terms, whereby he reſerves a latitude to himſelf of Decrying, Excepting againſt, and Exploding the Judgment of any perſon, as Partial, and Injudicious, (if againſt his liquor) be the ſame perſon (in all Judicious unconcern'd mens eſtimations) never ſo judicious and unbyaſs'd, and skilful alſo in the Smells, Taſts, and Tinctures of Drinks.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Mr. <hi>Witherden</hi> (the <hi>Latin</hi> Interpreter) in the 3. page of his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, vainly tells me of an old Proverb, <hi>Nè Sutor ultra Crepidam,</hi> to intimate unto the World, that I have heretofore followed the Trade of a <hi>Shoo-maker,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ſham'd of it, that it is a thing with me, not unfrequent, (when any occaſion preſents) to acquaint ſome, (that I judge ſtrangers to me) that I have been formerly of that Profeſſion or Trade: And it is in <hi>London</hi> very well known, that (in thoſe days,) I lived in as good repute, (paying ſcot and lot) and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57289:3"/>
ſpent as much in Houſe-keeping in one Year, as ſome of the Country Gent. may afford to ſpend in two: And certainly, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Witherden</hi> will fare better than his Betters in <hi>Drink-dabling,</hi> if he do not (at the foot of the Account) read himſelf a <hi>Cobler,</hi> and one neceſſitous of a thread of the Charity of thoſe great Friends (he boaſts of) wherewith to botch up his own Reputation: But to return from that impertinent Digreſſion, this Mr. <hi>Witherden</hi> hath vainly drawn me into; I would fain know from this learned Mr. <hi>Witherden;</hi> (for ſo he will have himſelf deem'd) <hi>faſque nefaſque;</hi> that is, right or wrong; How much leſs effectual did the late Dr. <hi>Trigg</hi>'s having been a <hi>Shoo-maker,</hi> render his Medicaments? or, admitting he had been a compleat Gentleman, that is, by Extraction, Education, and Poſſeſſion; what Additament could his Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility have made to the virtual efficacy of his Medicine?</p>
            <p>The ſaid Mr. <hi>Witherden,</hi> in the 4. p. frumps me with crabbed words, pickt from others, Glorying that his own former Induſtry hath freed him from any neceſſity of Soaring with borrow'd Wings: Whereto I, the ſaid <hi>A. D.</hi> do anſwer, I am altogether unconcern'd whether he flys or lyes, or whether thoſe Wings, he hath, be his own, or borrow'd: That matter concerns others in this City, more than it doth me, or (as I hope) ever ſhall: For my own part, I am not of any ſo quick and volatil Spirit, or have I the cuſtody of any Wings, either my own, or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed; or the leaſt skill in Soaring; therefore, were I in Debt, and my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors neverſomuch inrag'd againſt me; I muſt neceſſarily ſtand my Ground; yet do I acknowledge, that (were I deſirous of ſuch a kind of Learning, as this Gentleman ſaith he hath by his former Induſtry acquired) I would never read over the voluminous Legends of <hi>Tom Thumb,</hi> or Ranſack the Colledge of <hi>Gotham</hi> for a Tutor; ſince my knowledge hath been ſo enrich'd with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Mr. <hi>Witherdens</hi> lofty lines; whom therefore I ſhall (by way of caution) humbly put in mind of <hi>Ovids</hi> old <hi>Pentameter</hi> Verſe upon <hi>Iccarus, viz. Iccarus Iccariis nomina fecit aquis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whether will this Gentlemans wild Digreſſion lead me? into the language of the Beaſt? to ſwim with borrowed Bladders, out of the reach of our own Reaſon and Underſtanding? We muſt know that poor <hi>London</hi> hath neither of the <hi>Accademies</hi> in her; no, the Country muſt enjoy them both; and therefore I will implore this learned Country Gentleman Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> to let me know (with as much ſpeed, as the matter requires haſte) how nigh unto the <hi>White</hi> my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Gueſs at this Verſes meaning, comes, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <l>He that Soars ſo nigh the Sun, as to melt the Wax, that fastned his Wings, may chance to craze his empty Sconce upon the Rock of Ignorance.</l>

            <p>The ſaid <hi>Jane White,</hi> ſhe alſo hath Dabled together, what ſhe calls a <hi>Famous and wonderful never-failing Cordial Drink of the World,</hi> and (wanting a Father for this poor Brat) ſhe (raking under the Toombs) lighted upon the aſhes of a long ſince deceaſed Doctor, whom ſhe calls Dr. <hi>Bostock,</hi> ſhe looking upon this

Drink-dabling, is altogether, as good, as that of his nameleſs Patients; And further; That his Preſumption concerning the Fountain-head of my <hi>Elixir,</hi> is equivalent unto that Art of his, according whereunto, he prepar'd it; And that his <hi>Never failing Cordial</hi> is as Authentick, as the beſt of his own Judgement, or <hi>Hindes</hi> either.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Edward Willet</hi> alſo, hath lately publiſhed a licencious Pamphlet, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Elixir Triphera Solutinae,</hi> or the Famous <hi>Never-failing Cordial,</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced (as himſelf ſaith) by many, for cure of the <hi>Gout, Stone, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo goes on in an Apiſh Imitation of my, the ſaid <hi>Anthony Daffy</hi>'s ſealed Books, taking the ſum and ſubſtance of my (long ſince publiſh'd) Experiences, of my <hi>Elixirs</hi> Virtues, and Directions alſo: And doth (for lucres ſake) miſapply them to that his <hi>Never-failing stuff,</hi> endeavouring thereby (what in him lies) to bring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon my <hi>Elixir Salutis;</hi> and to foiſt his own ſtuff upon miſ-informed People, in liew of it; he ſaith his ſtuff is ſold for <hi>iij s.</hi> the half Pinte Bottle, ſealed up, but mentions nothing of the Coat of Arms, or Impreſſion of the ſeal; It ſeems, he is void of fear of any mans changing, or ſophiſticating it; but that matters not much.</p>
            <p>Yet foraſmuch as the Counterfeiters of my Original, ſincere, and Famous <hi>Elixir Salutis,</hi> do ſwarm ſo in every corner; and moſt diſcreet People being awakn'd, and (not without good ground) very cautious what they receive into their Bowels; I the ſaid <hi>A. D.</hi> do affirm, that (if Mr. <hi>Willets</hi> Cordial be by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Experienced ſuch a <hi>Never-failing ſtuff,</hi> for the Cures, he talks of, he detracts much from his own profit, and alſo from the good of the publick, in not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning (out of thoſe pretended many) one, or two perſons names and abodes, that have ſo experienced the <hi>Never-failing</hi> Virtue of his <hi>Drink:</hi> If he Prints again, I adviſe him not to forget it then, as wilfully as 'tis omitted now.</p>
            <p>Yet another Counterfeiter of my <hi>Elixir Salutis,</hi> by the ſame name; This is ſo young a Cub Quack, with its ſwadling Clouts ſo cloſe about it, and its Teeth not come, that the Animal cannot tell you its name, ſex, or place of abode, (if any it hath) It may be deem'd a Monſter, for (notwitſtanding its Non-age) it begins betimes, ſtealing (not only) the name of my <hi>Elixir,</hi> but the ſum and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of my (the ſaid <hi>A. Daffy</hi>'s) ſealed Book, (nigh <hi>verbatim),</hi> and great part of my Directions alſo: But (being very provident) it doth (in its licencious Libel) chop up my ſealed Books, &amp; my Directions together, for ſaving of Paper-charge; telling the world, that the Bottle is ſealed with the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> and <hi>Ermins,</hi> and that its new-found Dibble dabble is for many years experienced by divers perſons in and about this City, whoſe names it were too tedious, there to inſert: Note that this young Quack is not ſo courteous as (with the reſt, to let the world know, how its ſecret knack of Drink-dabling was acquir'd; or whether it dropt out of the Clouds upon it, nay it is ſo ſullen, that it will not inſtance, by name, ſo much as one of thoſe divers Perſons (in its Libel mentioned) that have experienced the leaſt good by that its Famous Stuff, as it ſelf tells you.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57289:5"/>
But this Animal (in a ſhort time) finding the vain inſufficiency of its ſaid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Libel; ſets the ſame thing out again, in another Dreſs; the new ignorant and nonſenſical Libel is ty'd, (tayl to tayl) to the Scurvy-Graſs-paper, which as I am credibly informed) is alſo ſtollen from another Author: The nameleſs Animal, now, (for ſo it ſtill remains) bethinks it ſelf of one of its omiſſions in the former Libel; and in the new Libel, talks like an old Man (as it were) ſaying, that the original of its Drink, was from Dr. <hi>Buttler,</hi> in King <hi>James</hi>'s days; and that this Doctor (at his death) left this Receipt in <hi>Engliſh</hi> to his Kinſman, Dr. <hi>Trigg;</hi> forgetting to tell us by what line this Receipt deſcended from Dr. <hi>Trigg</hi> upon it ſelf, and how it knows it the ſame Receipt; yet the matters not much.</p>
            <p>The Table of this learned Animals conceipted Famous <hi>Cordial Drink,</hi> is Apiſhly varniſht over, with this Golden Inſcription, <hi>Elixir Salutis,</hi> Rightly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd, according to Art: And the poor Innocent thing, moſt unjuſtly hang'd up to rights upon <hi>Alderſgate;</hi> and that by great miſtake, inſtead of its Author, at <hi>Bethlehem-gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I preſume that no perſons, (well in their wits) will take into their Bowels they know not what, from they know not whom; eſpecially, when they cannot ſee or hear of the Author that made it, or any one, that took it, and liv'd a Month after.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, That no one, of the 7 aforenamed Counterfeiters, of my <hi>Elixir,</hi> or the laſt mentioned nameleſs one, (though all cloath'd and clog'd with Impudence too much) dares to nominate any one perſon, beſides themſelves in particular, if ſuch may themſelves (ſpeaking for their own gain, and in their own caſe in particular) be believed; that hath made any advantagious Experiment upon any of their Drinks; which is indeed the cunningeſt and ſafeſt courſe, they could have taken.</p>
            <p>Courteous Reader; Thus much I have (as I ought in bounden Duty to God, the publick Good, my own, and my <hi>Elixirs</hi> known reputation) declared to the World, for the prevention of further miſchief by theſe Mercenaries and, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiters, that do (for a piece of bread) ſeek to endanger, not only Peoples Eaſe, but their Healths, and Lives too.</p>
            <p>If (notwitſtanding all this) any perſons be inclined to meddle with any of their Drinks; I have done my duty; let them uſe their liberty: they may, (as well as other have done,) feel and ſadly experience the weight of this caution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
