            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And ſurely (gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) I willingly confeſſe vnto thee, that I am glad I haue ſome skill in muſicke, which is ſo ſweete, ſo good, ſo vertuous, ſo comely a matrone among other artes. Wherefore I ſhal not iuſtly blame thee, if thou think, that loue and affection hath preuailed much with me in publiſhing of this pamphlet: for therein thou ſhalt giue teſtimonie vnto me, that I haue perfourmed the part of a kinde and gratefull ſonne, in beſtowing the beſt of mine abilitie, to the aduancing of ſo gratious a mother. Neither would I haue thee ſo much to ſtand vpon this conceit, as if reaſon had no place in this action: conſidering that affection without reaſon, is a blind and vniuſt iudge of any matter. May it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pleaſe thee, no otherwiſe to iudge of my labour, than the reaſons therein alleaged ſhall giue thee iuſt occaſion: and if it happen thou come to the viewe hereof with a preiudice, yet conſider that nature hath therfore giuen thee two eares, that thou ſhouldeſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well applie the one to the defendant, as the other to the plaintife. For as in ciuill matters, ſo in this,

            <p>So I make anſwere to them that paſſe their ſenten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces of condemnation vpon me, that they do in no wiſe diſgrace me, but Hierome, Ambroſe, Auguſtine, Baſil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gregorie Nazianzen, and the holy Fathers of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, whoſe authorities are here alleadged men farre better than themſelues, and not worthy to be condemned vnder a ſeſſion of their pieres. I know a blemiſh is ſooneſt perceiued in a comely body, and the greater the man is that doth offend, the greater ſeemeth his offence. Becauſe one ſmale wart is a ſtain to be a beautifull face, and ſome litle fault committed, that might otherwiſe ſeem tollerable in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mean eſtate, is inexcuſeable in a greater perſonage: So fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it with muſick, which becauſe it is excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; for that naturally ſubiect to the enuie and malice of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is therfore ill ſpoken of, becauſe it falleth out, that ſhee is oftentimes blemiſhed with the faults of them, that profeſſe to haue ſome knowledge in hir. Hence it commeth to paſſe, that the faults of the perſons are attributed to the art, and that whatſoeuer is amiſſe in this or that lewd muſicion, is ſaid to proceed from hir, which ought by better reaſon to obſcure and ouerſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe the fouleſt blottes which are incident to men, than ſhe by them ſhould be diſgraced.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15418:24"/>
leſſe beloued of the people: But <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centus</hi> was verie merrie, pleaſaunt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, louelie, curteous, acceptable vnto all menne, and cleane contrarie to the diſpoſition of his brother, thinking it more glorious to bee beloued than fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Whereby hee did not only get the loue and liking of all his Subiectes, but alſo putte his Father into a greater doubt which of them hee ſhoulde inſtitute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritour of his Scepter. Therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a ſolemne meeting, hee asked the Counſell of the Nobles and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Lande, as <hi>Muſitians, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ettes, Oratours, Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines</hi>: and in concluſion their conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had this iſſue, that neyther ſhoulde be preferred before other, but both ſhould equally inherite their Fathers Scepter and Dominions. Whereof I gather (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all other circumſtaunces) that as <hi>Accentus</hi> which is <hi>Grammar</hi> ought not to be diſinherited, becauſe of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie therof in ſpeech: ſo <hi>Concentus</hi> which is <hi>Muſicke,</hi> coulde not but bee eſteemed as woorthie of preheminence, for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delectation. And for as much
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15418:25"/>
as that was the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both of <hi>Muſicians, Poets, Orators, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> both <hi>Moral</hi> &amp; <hi>Natural,</hi> and <hi>Diuines:</hi> ſo much the more is to be aſcribed to the ſweetneſſe of Muſicke, as theſe Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours are of better iudgement than other men. But I will not ground the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that on fictions and conceipts: which neither in it ſelf needeth the colour &amp; ſhadowes of imaginations, being aboue all conceiptes: nor in the pleaſure thereof any externall ornament: being ſweeter than canne be counterfeited by fictions, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by fantaſies. Wherefore leauing theſe, I will as neerely as I can, declare the reaſon of that delight which Muſicke yeeldeth. And this firſt is euident, that Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke whether it be in the voyce only as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> thought, or both in the voyce and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body as <hi>Ariſtoxenus</hi> ſuppoſed: or as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> was of opinion not only in the voyce and motion of the body, but alſo in the agitation of the minde: hath a certaine diuine influence into the ſoules of men, whereby our cogitations and thoughts (ſay <hi>Epicurus</hi> what he will) are brought into a celeſtiall acknowledging of their natures.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:15418:25"/>

But this which I haue ſaid may ſeem peraduenture to be too profoundly handled: I will therefore confirme it by naturall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience &amp; examples.

other liuing creature exempt from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the pleaſure of Muſicke.</p>

And for this cauſe is it, that children are ſo delighted and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with rattels and bels, and ſuch like toies as make a ſound. Now as ſtrength &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment increaſe in man, ſo Muſicke pleaſeth and delighteth him more and more: ſo that whether he be noble or ignoble, yet the ſame delight of minde groweth to perfection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with the body.<note place="margin">

Now I meane by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie demonſtration, to proue the delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof from the effects to the cauſes. For it cannot be but that as the conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15418:32"/>
and agreement which muſicke hath with our nature, is the cauſe of the delectation thereof: So the pleaſure and delectation is alſo the cauſe of thoſe effectes which it worketh as well in the minds as bodies of them that heare it. Muſick being in it ſelfe wholly moſt effectuall, importeth much of his force and efficacie, euen to the peculiar partes and portions thereof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon auncient writers make the diſtinction of ſongs and notes in muſicke, according to the operations which they worke in their hearers: calling ſom of them chaſt and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate: ſome amarous and light, otherſome warlike, others peaceable, ſome melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke and dolefull, other pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull. And yet this diuiſion is not ſo auncient as that other which was in vſe in <hi>Orpheus</hi> &amp; <hi>Terpanders</hi> time: for <hi>Plutarck</hi> in his treatiſe of muſick recordeth that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Muſici</hi> were alſo diſtinguiſhed by the names of nations: ſuch were principally theſe foure, <hi>Modus Dorius, Modus Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, Modus Lydius,</hi> and <hi>Modus Myxoly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius.</hi> Hereunto were added as collaterall other three <hi>Hypodorius, Hypoludius,</hi> and <hi>Hypophrygius:</hi> making ſeuen in number,

aunſwerable to the <hi>7.</hi> planets: whereunto <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> addeth an <hi>8.</hi> which is called <hi>Hypermyxolydius,</hi> ſharpeſt of them al and attributed to the firmament. Theſe ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſtinctions of notes in muſicke do not ſo farre diſſent in name and appellation, as they do neerely accord in effects and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For <hi>Modus Dorius,</hi> beeing a graue and ſtaied part of muſicke, aunſwereth to that which I called chaſt and temperate. <hi>Modus Lydius</hi> vſed in comedies, in former times, being more lighter and wanton than <hi>Dorius,</hi> anſwereth to that which I termed amarous and delightſome. <hi>Modus Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> diſtracting the mind variably, alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bacchicus</hi> for his great force &amp; violence aunſwereth to that which I called warlik, And <hi>Myxolydius</hi> moſt vſed in tragedies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing in melodie thoſe lamentable affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are in tragedies repreſented, aunſwereth to that which before I named Melancholike and dolefull.

iudgement of <hi>Galene,</hi> which will not ſuffer that to be called an Art, that bringeth no profitte to our life. Wherefore before I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into that which is the marke whereat I aime, I meane, the vſe of Muſicke in the church, I muſt adde to theſe former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, ſomething, as of the neceſſity of it in fewer wordes, ſo of ciuil vſe thereof more at large. And firſt concerning the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: I confeſſe, that Muſicke is not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for man, as meates are for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of life, and clothing for the defence of the body: (for ſo he were not a man, that were not a muſicion:) but as in meates ſome are courſe, and others delicate, which both neuertheleſſe are neceſſary, the one to thoſe of meaner, the other to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of higher degree: and as laboring men vſe meane apparell only to defend their bodies from the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the weather, and gentlemen finer, not only ſo, but for an ornament alſo, which both are neceſſary, to diſtinguiſh callinges: ſo Muſicke is as the more delicate meates, and as the finer apparell: not in deede neceſſary ſimply, but profitablie neceſſary for the comlineſſe of life. And therefore <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> &amp; <hi>Plato,</hi> &amp; all the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15418:38"/>
their yong men and maydes in the knowledge of Muſicke, not to the prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wantonneſſe, but to the reſtraining and bridling their affections, vnder the rule and moderation of reaſon. For they, becauſe youth naturally is moueable, &amp; deſirous of delight, &amp; yet vnfit to receiue any ſeuere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, thought it conuenient &amp; neceſſarie, to acquaint their children with an honeſt oblectation of Muſicke in their youth, that being brought vppe in that liberall delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they might learne to refraine from other illiberall and inordinate pleaſures. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the eight booke of his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiques,</hi> which is wholy of that argument, giueth counſell that noble men &amp; gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be inſtructed with Muſicke,<note place="margin">

               </note> firſt to auoide idleneſſe, becauſe the idle time which is in a mans life, doth require to be buſied in the knowledge &amp; learning of ſome profitable thing: ſecondly becauſe Muſicke after a ſort belongeth vnto vertue.<note place="margin">

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15418:39"/>
therefore <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Scholers, as <hi>Tullie</hi> recordeth,<note place="margin">

               </note> were woont, both to giue certaine hidden and ſecrete precepts in verſes, and to with-drawe their mindes from intentiue and deepe cogitations, with ſinging and with inſtrumentes: yea and manie of the auncient Grecians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whome this Art was in highe eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, inſtructed their children in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, as profitable to the correction of life and manners, that thereby they might bee incited to temperance and honeſtie: for it is the property of liberall Sciences, to ingenerate a gentle, and liberal action in their hearers. Wherupon <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the ſame place doth infer, that albeit arts are to be learned not for any vain pleaſure or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation, but for ſome good and profitable vſe, yet if muſicke were neither neceſſarie nor profitable at all, it ought to be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted of &amp; embraced, for that it is liberall. And yet <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth not ſo far co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend Muſicke to noble men, that he would rather wiſhe them the practiſe, than the ſpeculation and knowledge thereof: But as he would haue none but thoſe that profeſſe it to be the practiſers of it: ſo hee counſelleth
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15418:39"/>
noble men rather to vſe it for their priuate ſolace, than publike oſtentation, and rather to bee able to iudge of other mens cunning, than willing to ſhewe their owne. For the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> ſaith he, a warlike and noble people, haue this as a ſinguler com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, that although they ſeemed not to haue any ſkill in Muſicke, yet they could eaſily diſcerne, which ſound agreed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed moſt. And he maketh it a generall obſeruation, that in all poets of any credit and name, <hi>Iupiter</hi> is neuer made to ſing, or to plaie vpon any inſtrument, although they deny him not moſt exact knowledge and iudgement.<note place="margin">

Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>22.</hi> of that name which was himſelf a good muſicion, &amp; wrote a booke thereof: in the ſecond chapter of his booke attributeth thus much therunto. Great is the neceſſity of Muſicke, and the vſe thereof not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned: for it maketh him that is ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15418:40"/>
therin, able to iudge of that which he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, to amend that which is amiſſe, and to make a newe. And thus much he aſcribeth to the neceſſity of the art.

Antiquitie which nowe adayes euerie greene head will needes ſet to ſchoole, and make ſubiect to the ouerlaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pregnancy of his yong wit, deriues her euen from <hi>Saturnes</hi> time, when the worlde was ſkant ſheld:

For how is it credible, if beaſts haue bin ſnared, birdes allured, fiſhes bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſerpentes charmed, yea and rent in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with Muſicke, that her ſtrength ſhould become weakeneſſe in the wiſeſt and moſt reaſonable creature, without an infallible preiudice of a moſt vntoward nature?

heades. But theſe lawes being matters of ſtate and gouernment, and therefore too hard meate for ſuch yong ſtomackes to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, and deeper leſſons than to match their ſhalow capacities, they vſed Muſicke ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as a Schoolemaiſter, by faire meanes and gentle allurements to mitigate the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie of their taſkes. Which if it bee ſo vnprofitable as it is made now adayes, why was it accepted in ſo famous and populous a countrie? why borne out and maintained by ſo graue authority? why admitted to thinges of ſo great importance? wherein ſtandeth the life and ſoule of all Kingdoms? why inſtilled to youth for pliableneſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture eaſily corrupted, and for their hope the beſt ſeede of the next harueſt?

Muſicke is not at their ſtinting: her charter (how large let al the world iudge) was graunted by nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by preſcription of time out of mind,

and eſtabliſhed by the vſe of all places, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and conditions.

ſentences of Scripture which I ſhall here cote, for confirmation of the ſame, meaning in one concluſion, to proue thoſe two things which are in queſtion: that aſwell artificial as alſo inſtrumentall Muſicke may be vſed in Gods congregation. My grounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are theſe: firſt the teſtimonies in the old Teſtament, whereof I will cite ſome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all are infinite. Pſal. <hi>33.

And ſurely if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery action of Chriſt be our inſtruction, and an example, wherunto we ſhould frame our ſelues: why ſhould Chriſt haue bin author of that which he allowed in himſelfe, &amp; in his Apoſtles: if hee were not willing, that wee ſhould take example therby to imitate both the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; him? Now if we conſider to what end the cuſtome of ſinging was vſed: wee ſhall perceiue, that it was not ſo vſed, as that ſing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing &amp; the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of organs, ſhold be a deed meritorious, to obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes and life eternall (as the Iewes imagine of their ſongs, and the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſonnets) or as the hypocriticall Monkes and Friers ſang their ſeuen canonicall houres that the doing of that work, whether w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out vnderſtanding, it was not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,

            <p>Doubtleſſe there can be no greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for a penſiue ſoule, than to thinke, that he is partaker of the ſame ſaluation, with the Sainctes. And no one thing can pierce deeper into the heart of manne than that hee is called, to the ſame ſtate of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and lauding GOD, with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Angelles. Howbeit becauſe I would diſpleaſe no man, nor giue iuſt occaſion of offence vnto any: I put this as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: that as nothing is to be taught,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:15418:73"/>
ſo nothing to bee ſong in the Church, but either that, which is ſet downe in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe word of God, or that may certainly be ſhewed to be collected out of it. For I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that rotten rythmes of popery, &amp; ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious inuocation or praying vnto Saints doth not giue greater cauſe of vomit to any man than to my ſelfe: &amp; al either vnwritten, or vnwarra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table verities, I ſo far abhor, as that I iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fitter for Grocers ſhops, &amp; fiſhmongers ſtals,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Perſius</hi>
               </note> than for Gods congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So that I thus far agree with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt aduerſaryes of our profeſſion, that I would not admit any other matter, than is contained in the written word of God, or conſonable therunto: only herein we differ, that they would haue no great exquiſite art or cunning thereunto, neither the noiſe of dumbe inſtruments, to fil vp the meaſure of the praiſes of god: &amp; I alow of both. Wherin if I be not too much affectioned, me thinks they do great iniurie to the word of God, in that they can contentedly permit it to bee ſong plainly, denying the outward helpes &amp; orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of art, to adde more grace &amp; dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity thereunto. And truly if in all other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, it be not only lawfull, but commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:15418:73"/>
alſo, as in painting &amp; ſpeaking, to ſet out their matters with coulors &amp; eloquence of words: I ſee no reaſon, why to adde more grace to the ditty, with the exquiſitenes of Muſick, ſhould be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable in the church. Wherfore I am of opinion that few of our aduerſaries can anſwere this reaſon, which ſeemeth to me a general rule, &amp; infallible de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monſtration for the allowing aſwell of the cunning &amp; exquiſite art of ſinging, as of the vſe of organs and dumbe inſtruments. The Pſalmes may bee vſed in the church as the authour of them appointed: But the holy Ghoſt, the author of the Pſalms, appointed and commanded them by the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> to be ſong, and to be ſong moſt cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to be ſong with diuerſe artificiall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Muſick, and to bee ſong with ſundry, ſeuerall, and moſt excellent notes &amp; tunes: Therefore in our Engliſh church, the pſalmes may be ſong, and ſong moſt cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, and with diuerſe artificiall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Muſick, and ſong with ſundry ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall and moſt excellent notes. For proofe that the holy Ghoſt would haue them ſong, hee calleth diuerſe Pſalmes by the name of the Hebrew word <hi>Shir,</hi> which is a ſong, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:15418:74"/>
ſuch a ſong, as ought of neceſſity to be ſong: as Pſalme <hi>7.</hi> and <hi>120.</hi> That he would haue them ſong moſt cunningly, hee directeth many Pſalmes eſpecially and by name <hi>Lamnazzeath,</hi> that is, to the ſkilfull chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to him that excelleth in Muſicke, as Pſalm <hi>4,</hi> &amp;c. That he would haue them ſong, with diuerſe artificial inſtruments of Muſick, <hi>gittith</hi> and <hi>neginoth,</hi> and diuerſe other kinds of muſicall inſtruments are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the titles of certaine Pſalmes, as Pſalm <hi>6.</hi> &amp; <hi>8.</hi> That he would haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſong with ſundry ſeuerall and moſt excellent notes and varietie of tunes, in diuerſe parts and places of ſundry Pſalmes, it is to bee ſeene by the word <hi>Sela</hi> ſet downe in ſundry places, as Pſalme <hi>77.</hi> &amp;c. which Hebrewe word properly ſignifieth, now change your voice and that cunningly, now lift vp your voice, and that with an other excellent tune, that the people may be more attentiue; and the word <hi>Sela</hi> is neuer written, but where the matter of the Pſalme is moſt notable.</p>

            <head>A REFVTATION OF OBIECTIONS AGAINST the lawful vſe of Muſicke in the Church. CHAP. XII.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this laſt part of my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe I might ſeem to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a matter far aboue my ability: were it not that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their obiections were too weake to proue theyr purpoſes: or thoſe which are of any force, miſtaken and grounded vpon falſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Neuertheleſſe that I may proceede orderly therein, it ſhall not be amiſſe, to ſee what diuerſity of opinions are concerning this matter: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Some miſlike not all kinde of ſinging, but that which is ſong by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters alone, or by ſinging men duputed for that purpoſe: and theſe are they, which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with exquiſite and cunning Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, nor with the ſounde of inſtruments in the Church, but meaſuring all thinges by their owne humors, thinke plaine ſong farre more meete for Gods congregation. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Others there bee that diſallowe all kinde
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:15418:75"/>
of Muſick in the church. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And we do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly permit ſinging contrary to the latter, but alſo cunning and exquiſite ſinging cleane repugnant to the former. My meaning is therefore, firſt to ſee what reaſonable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere may be made, aſwell to thoſe which are againſt exquiſite muſick, which by yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſomthing, make a great ſhew of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as thoſe which wholy baniſh all Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke out of diuine ſeruice: who therefore ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:15418:75"/>
that the very ditty cannot be vnderſtood, much leſſe any edification taken. If any thing will ſatisfie theſe men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </note> me thinks this which I ſhall ſay may bee in ſteede of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable anſwere: That the ſinging of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts togither, cauſeth the ditty not to be vnderſtood, it is <hi>vitium hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non artis,</hi> the fault is in them that ſo ſing, and not in the art. For no doubt but a full quire of good &amp; diſtinct voices, may be aſwel vnderſtood, as two or three pronouncing the ſame thing. Againe, becauſe in deede this obſcuritie can hardly be auoided, it hath bin wel proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for in the church, that nothing ſhould ſo be ſong, but ſuch things, as are very familiar and known vnto the people. And whereas they obiect the often repetition of the ſame thing, as a fault, me thinks they blame that, which by their own reaſon ſhould rather be commended. For if ſome things by the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the voices bee hardly vnderſtood at once, then ſurely the 2.3. or 4. repetition is a mean to cauſe it to be vnderſtood the better: neither if it bee vnderſtoode at the firſt is it therefore a fault to repeat it againe, becauſe the often ingeminating and ſounding the ſame thing in our eares doth cauſe the thing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:15418:76"/>
repeated to take deepe roote, and worke ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually in our hearts. The third reaſon is, becauſe exquiſite Muſick maketh vs more inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue to the note,<note place="margin">

               </note> Verily I do in no wiſe allowe that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the reading of the chapters ſhold walke in the bodie of the church, and when the Organs play, giue attentiue heede thereunto: as if the whole and better part of ſeruice did conſiſt in Muſicke. For this is a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful abuſe. But if they would learne to lay the fault where the fault is, they might eaſily learne to ſatisfie themſelues herein: For it is not the fault of muſicke if thou bee too much therwith allured, but thine own. And Sainct <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in that place doth not condemne Muſick for the ſweete ſound thereof, but his owne fraile and weake na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which tooke occaſion of offence at that, which in it ſelfe was good. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as it carieth awaie ſome men, with the pleaſure of the note: ſo for a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, it cauſeth ſome other, to giue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:15418:76"/>
heede and attention to the matter: euen as the ſound of the trumpet in the warre is to the daſtardly, and white liuered knight, a cauſe of feare, but to the valiaunt ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, a hartening and incouragement. Wherefore for a finall aunſwere vnto theſe, mee thinkes a man out of their owne wordes, may gather this good collection againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

If ſome intemperate perſon, take ſurfeit of pleaſant and holſome meates, are the meates to be reprehended, or the man? And although God bee a ſpirite, and will bee worſhipped in Spirite and trueth, yet foraſmuch as hee hath made both the ſoule and the bodie: as well the faculties of the one, as the partes of the other are to bee referred to his glorie.

Now as theſe men being otherwiſe wiſe and politique, as diuerſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their actions teſtifie, tooke not herein a right courſe of reforming thoſe faultes which were amiſſe, becauſe they might better haue taken order againſt couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:15418:79"/>
and drunkenneſſe, by permitting a lawfull and decent vſe of mony and wine, than by quite aboliſhing of them: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo thoſe which reprehende certayne thinges in Church Muſicke, may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reforme them in permitting a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vſe, than in plucking it vppe by the rootes: For as a manne may bee coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous without monie, and drunken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wine: ſo a fraile and weake minde, will finde other prouocations to call it from the dittie, though Muſicke ſhoulde bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Wherefore for concluſion of this matter, as I eaſily graunt to Maſter <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger,</hi> that this is no good argument: The Eaſt Churches vſe ſinging, the Weſt Churches vſe not ſinging: Therefore the Weſt Churches are no Churches.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dec. 5. cap. 5.</hi>
               </note> So I hope Maiſter <hi>Bullinger,</hi> and anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good man whatſoeuer will graunt as much to mee, that this is as falſe a collection: The Weſt Churches vſe not ſinging, the Eaſt Churches doe vſe ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore the Eaſt church is no church. Seeing then, that there is no precept in the newe Teſtament, whereby Church-Muſicke is eyther commanded or forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:15418:80"/>
as it is apparant, that as thoſe Churches which vſed it not, cannot be compelled to receiue it: ſo thoſe churches which doe vſe it can by no place of the Scripture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be condemned. And this is the reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al our late diuines, <hi>Bucer, Bullinger, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> and the reſt, which with one conſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that it is an indifferent thing, hauing no hurt, but rather much good in it, if it bee diſcreetly and ſoberly vſed. Why then is it not as lawful for me to incline to this part, that it ſhould or may be vſed, as it is for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to incline to the contrary, that it ſhould not or may not in any wiſe be vſed, conſidering that neither my ſinging maketh me leſſe the ſeruaunt of God, nor their not ſinging them the more holy and deuoute men?</p>
            <p>Laſtly therefore it remayneth that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing anſwered the chiefeſt arguments that make againſt vs, I now bring certaine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for my poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt therefore Muſick is rather to bee vſed in the church than not, becauſe it is the excellent inuention and gift of God himſelfe, ordained to the honor and glory of God: neither doth their cauill auaile any thing at all, which ſaie, that if this reaſon were good, then all the liberall
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:15418:80"/>
ſciences &amp; the knowledge of the ciuill law, and all good and honeſt artes, might by as good reaſon be vſed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church becauſe they are alſo the inuention &amp; good gift of God. For if they knew, howe to refer euerie of theſe things to their neat &amp; proper end, they might perceiue that as the end of thoſe other ſciences, is firſt to know, and then to ſerue to the glory of God, ſo the vent and only end of muſicke is immediatly the ſetting foorth of Gods praiſe and honour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond reaſon of mine aſſertion is, becauſe muſick with the concinnitie of her ſound, and the excellency of harmony, doth as it were knit &amp; ioyne vs vnto God, putting vs in mind of our maker and of that mutuall vnitie &amp; conſent, which ought to bee as of voices ſo of mindes in Gods church and congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly if there were no other reaſon, yet this were of ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t force to perſwade the lawful vſe of Muſicke: in that as a pleaſant bait, it doeth both allure me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the church which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would not come, &amp; cauſeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are there to continue till the diuine ſeruice bee ended. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly men doe more willingly heare, &amp; more firmely cary away with them, thoſe thinges which they heare
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:15418:81"/>
ſong than thoſe which they hear barely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and pronounced. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Laſtly the vſe thereof is ancient and of great continuance, for it was vſed in <hi>Traian</hi> his time as I before ſhewed, and it was tranſlated from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious of the heathen, which in hymnes and ſonges, yeelded all reuerence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to their gods of wood &amp; ſtone. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if there be any one thing in man, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than another, that is Muſicke: and therefore good reaſon, that hee which hath made vs, &amp; the world, and preſerueth both vs &amp; it, ſhould be worſhipped &amp; honored with that thing which is moſt excellent in man, diuiding as it were his ſoule from his body, and lifting vp his cogitations aboue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
