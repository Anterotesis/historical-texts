            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving lately seen a Printed Paper, the Title whereof is, [<hi>A Letter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring a just and merciful regard of the Roman Catholicks of Ireland, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven about the end of October,</hi> 1660. <hi>to the then Marquess, now Duke of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, and the second time L. Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of that Kingdom</hi>:] Subscribed by P. W. And finding it in effect, whatever the words of it are, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely undutiful to his sacred Majesty, very disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectful to the Duke of Ormond L. Lievtenant of Ireland, and most scandalous not onely to the Protestants of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but also to those of the same Religion in his sacred
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60274:3"/>
Majesties other Kingdoms</hi>: I have esteemed my self obliged, <hi>as a faithful subject to the King, as an humble servant to the L. Lievtenant, and as a son of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Church,</hi> whose Members are as highly as falsly asperst by it, to expose in print an Answer to that Letter, which before I enter upon, I will onely say, P. W. professing not a little to be his Graces servant, if he meant not this Letter as a respect to his Grace, why was it <hi>written?</hi> if he did, why was it <hi>printed?</hi> But P. W. despairing to receive from his Grace the effects of his <hi>unjust desires</hi> for his Countrey-men, chose this way to acquaint them, 'twas not for want of <hi>his sollicitation.</hi> He would let them see, since he could not make them beholding to <hi>My L. Lievtenant,</hi> that they were so to <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since I shall often have occasion to name IRISH PAPISTS, I have thought fit here, once for all, to declare, That I mean not thereby in all, or any part of my Answer, any of those <hi>Worthy Persons</hi> of that Nation and Religion who have <hi>still faithfully ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King,</hi> whose merit I highly respect, and the more, because it has been preserved from <hi>infection</hi> even in a very <hi>Pest-house</hi>; nor any of those, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been truly sorrowful for it, and in the <hi>constancy</hi> of their subsequent services to his Majesty, have <hi>washt themselves clean</hi>: For I take a perfect delight in any change from <hi>bad to good</hi>; and I heartily wish, that every one of them had not so much indangered their being <hi>polluted</hi> again, as interceding and pleading for their guilty Countrey-men does amount unto. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60274:3"/>
thus made this necessary digression, I shall now proceed.</p>
            <p>The parts separate of this Letter are three. First, a Preface. Secondly, a Petition. Thirdly, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion or concluding Wish. P. W. prefaceth; First, <hi>the Fears and Iealousies</hi> of those whom he calls the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Secondly, <hi>His own affection to, and confidence in his Grace the Duke of</hi> Ormond.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fears and Iealousies</hi> are no less than must in reason be expected in the <hi>Generality of the Irish Papists</hi>; For though the <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>indulgence</hi> of the best of Kings may make their condition <hi>safe</hi>: yet the <hi>conscience of their own guilt</hi> will never suffer them to be <hi>secure.</hi> Pretended <hi>Fears and Iealousies</hi> were the Forerunners, if not Causers of <hi>Troubles past</hi>; I hope P. W. intends them not as <hi>such, for Troubles to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fear</hi> is founded on, at least attended with <hi>Hatred</hi>; and if one of the Best of his Majesties Servants, one of the chiefest of his Ministers, be thus 1. <hi>Vniversally,</hi> 2. <hi>Intensly fear'd,</hi> and therefore 3. <hi>hated,</hi> 4. as P. W. says, by his <hi>own Countrey-men</hi>: (but let all that P. W. prints, <hi>stand</hi> or <hi>fall,</hi> as this <hi>last particular</hi> is <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false</hi>; for his Grace is neither his <hi>Countrey-man</hi> by <hi>birth, Religion,</hi> or any other relation to which that Name is appliable;) yea 5. by his <hi>own</hi> Fiduciares (as is expressed in the Printed Letter.) If, I say, all this be not true, why does P. W. say it? if it be true, what can others expect? For if the flame be so in the <hi>green</hi> Tree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what will it be in the <hi>dry?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Irish Papists in their former and later Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60274:4"/>
for the horridest of Rebellions, have not to this very day (within any of his Majesties Dominions) even pretended publickly any other cause for their Rapines, Murthers, Massacres and Treasons, but what resolves it self into <hi>Fears and Ielousies.</hi> And if their <hi>Passions</hi> be the same, it is to be fear'd their <hi>Wills</hi> are not alter'd. And if their <hi>Wills</hi> be the same, nothing under God, can prevent the <hi>effects,</hi> but want of <hi>strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Especially considering that 1. in 1641. no such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent <hi>animosities</hi> or <hi>hatreds</hi> had prepared matters for <hi>Fears and Ielousies,</hi> as by the worst of Rebellions is now become even <hi>nationally</hi> violent, (but by the way, it seems to me somewhat hard, that those which give the rise for the Cause, should first cry out in the Effects.) 2. In 1641. these <hi>Fears and Ielousies</hi> (if really in any) were but in a <hi>Few</hi>; but now P. W. confesseth, <hi>That they have seized upon almost all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Gentry and others, yea the Generality of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks of Ireland, even the constant Believers of, passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sticklers for, and fastest Friends to his Grace the Duke of Ormond</hi>; and this so <hi>intensly,</hi> that it produceth <hi>the loss both of Faith and Hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it may well be observed what temper they are of, whom P. W. pleads for; <hi>Ielousies, Fears</hi> and <hi>want of faith</hi> are so inseparable from them, that those in 1641 were onely said to be derived from his Majesties <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> but <hi>now</hi> (all such by the mercy of God being blown away) they are derived from <hi>his Majesties chief Minister of State of this Kingdom</hi>; and who is made
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60274:4"/>
               <hi>such,</hi> as P. W. saith, and as I most heartily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, <hi>by his own great deserts.</hi> What is it can suppress the <hi>Fears and Ielousies</hi> of P. W's. Countrey-men, when his Majesties free Election of a chief Governor, and such a one as the Duke of Ormond is, cannot do it? This acknowledgment of P. W's. fully proves, that the Irish Papists <hi>Fears and Ielousies</hi> of the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of this Kingdom in 1641, were onely taken up by <hi>those,</hi> and not cause given for them by <hi>these.</hi> The plain English is this, though his Majesty should from time to time nominate for Lord Lieutenant of this Kingdom, the wisest and the faithfullest of his Subjects; yet because the King commissionates them, or because they are such, or both, many (I wish I could not say most) of the Irish Papists will be jealous and fearful of them.</p>
            <p>Concerning P. W's. <hi>affection</hi> to, and <hi>confidence</hi> in his Grace the Duke of Ormond, exprest by several instances <hi>of free and frequent access to him, of his and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reliance on his word, of his daily care and trouble to support his esteem, and of blaming distrusters as guilty of ignorance of State affairs, and the Intrigues obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting,</hi> as yet; <hi>or of inconsideration of those wiser ways, though slower, than folly or rashness could chalk out, or of prejudice and evil Passion.</hi> I will onely say, That though P. W. would make us believe, as if some word in secret had post by his Grace to the Irish Papists, which they dare thus mention to himself, and publish to the world; at least that he who is a profest Enemy to the English Interest, and Protestant Religion, is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60274:5"/>
his Graces intimate and familiar Confident; and by such as visible, as false arts, endeavour to infect the Protestants with the disease of him, and his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; <hi>Ielousies and fears of the L. Lieutenant.</hi> Yet I dare as truly, as confidently aver, though P. W's. Oratory were as great as his malice, his insinuations could not shake, much less overthrow that irremove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able confidence his Majesties Protestant Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave built with great reason and experience upon his Grace, even on the double Accompts, of his <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practises.</hi> To attempt to betray with a Kiss, is neither a new <hi>art</hi> nor a new <hi>sin.</hi> But he that would destroy by undermining, would do it <hi>by open force,</hi> if his <hi>power</hi> proportion'd his <hi>will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning P. W's. affection to his Grace, he says no more for that in particular, than he says in general for his Countrey-mens having a right to the Peace made in 1648. Therefore I believe his Grace will take his measure of <hi>the former, by his knowledg of the later.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Preface, P. W. <hi>petitions, That his Grace would no longer delay, than shall be necessary, yea that he would in this present conjuncture, effectually demonstrate that justice and favor he intended to the Catholicks of Ireland, in the Articles of Peace made in</hi> 1648.</p>
            <p>Though P. W. in the first clause, petitions onely that his Grace <hi>would no longer delay than shall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>; yet as if struck with the Fears and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of his Countrey-men, and not daring to submit the determination of that period of necessity to his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60274:5"/>
Graces judgment, he petitions <hi>limitedly,</hi> if not <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> in the later clause, for <hi>the present conjuncture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the subject matter of that Justice and Favor pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition'd for, may be measur'd (as is exprest) by his Graces intendment, I am confident the Protestants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> should his Majesty think fit) will freely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their All, to that Decision; without either <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticling</hi> with him first; or <hi>breaking Articles</hi> after the guilt of making them.</p>
            <p>P. W. inforceth his Petition by Arguments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to

            <p>But <hi>Freely</hi> in this instance, if it signifies ought <hi>meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously,</hi> it signifies the same as <hi>gratis</hi>; when as it was made, 1. upon <hi>Articles</hi>; 2. even upon <hi>such</hi> Articles, as forced from his Majesty all the <hi>Regalia,</hi> both <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi>; 3. when as at such a <hi>season,</hi> and in such a <hi>Tempest</hi> every good Subject should <hi>freely</hi> have cast his Goods over-board, to prevent the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wrack,</hi> even then the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> would not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60274:6"/>
contribute to prevent one Leak, but at a <hi>Rate</hi> unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate, and as the Tempest or Leaks <hi>increased,</hi> so <hi>increased</hi> their <hi>Rates.</hi> But to show how <hi>freely</hi> the Irish put themselves and their power into his Majesties hands, I need but rehearse his sacred Majesties own words, in the preamble of his Majesties Gracious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the 30. of November 1660. page 3. <hi>viz. We well remember the Cessation of the Peace, which Our Royal Father of blessed Memory had been</hi> FORCED, <hi>during the late Troubles, to make with his Irish Subjects of that Our Kingdom, and by which he was</hi> COMPEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LED <hi>to give them a full pardon for what they had before done amiss, upon their return to their duty, and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of giving his Majesty a vigorous assistance.</hi> In the same page of the same Declaration, soon after follow these words, <hi>viz. We could not forget the Peace which Our selves was afterwards</hi> NECESSITATED <hi>to make with our said Subjects, in the time when they who wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly usurped the Authority, had erected that odious Court for the taking away the life of Our dear Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That which his Majesty calls <hi>Forced, Compelled</hi> and <hi>Necessitated,</hi> P. W. calls <hi>Freely putting themselves into his Graces hands</hi>; so that that untrue suggestion of his needs no other refutation as to the <hi>time past,</hi> and as to the <hi>time to come,</hi> I wish I had not cause to doubt, if ever they put themselves into his Graces hands, that which they <hi>will call Freely,</hi> will be an effect of <hi>compulsion, force</hi> and <hi>necessity.</hi> Whatever the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> was in 1648. and how <hi>free</hi> soever pretended; yet the express letter of those Articles, (Article 18.)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60274:6"/>
precludes all <hi>offences</hi> which shall be committed or done after their Date; and <hi>after that,</hi> the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> instead of <hi>freely putting themselves and their powers in the L. Lievtenants hands,</hi> signally declared their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> of him, <hi>Disobedience</hi> to him, and <hi>Opposition</hi> against him. For proofs whereof, among many, I shall set down one undeniable instance of each.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For their <hi>Contempt</hi>: In April 1650. by a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage they desired the L. Lieutenant to <hi>Leave</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and commit the Government to <hi>one of their own election,</hi> in whom they could <hi>confide.</hi> That which <hi>Now</hi> P. W. varnisheth with a modester phrase of <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Iealousies,</hi> was <hi>Then</hi> contempt and diffidence. At the same time that they own'd the L. Lievtenants Authority, they desire him to resign it, without his Majesties consent, nay so much as his knowledg; yet this is but consonant to the whole Series of their practises, never to acknowledg the <hi>Kings Right,</hi> but to <hi>affront it, or to get their ends by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For their <hi>Disobedience</hi> when the L. Lieutenant refused upon weighty reasons of Piety, Duty and State, to conform to this Message, and leave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; in August following they by their publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration professed their Disobedience in these very words: <hi>We do hereby manifest to the People, that they are no longer oblig'd to obey the Orders or Commands of the Marquess of</hi> Ormond. Words which so clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence their Rebellion, and the vastness of it, that they need no Comment, nor ought but the Text it self to prove both those Truths. Nor is there need
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60274:7"/>
of any other proof to evince their intire breach of those Articles, which they now so fiercely plead for the benefit of. They are so far from giving proofs of their duty to the King, and of their gratitude for his mercy extended in those Articles; that least any should suspect them guilty of <hi>those,</hi> they declare their power <hi>paramount to his Majesties authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They proceed from <hi>bad</hi> to <hi>worse,</hi> from <hi>worse</hi> to <hi>worst</hi>; from <hi>Contempt</hi> to <hi>Disobedience,</hi> from <hi>diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> to down-right <hi>Opposition.</hi> And accordingly the very next month they cause their Clergie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate <hi>not onely the L. Lievtenant, but all that should feed, or adhere to him. That which Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to do to our Enemies; (if thy Enemy hunger, feed him;)</hi> and that which even common Charity makes us do to the very beggers at our gates, they not onely refuse to do to him they so recently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have his Majesties Authority, nay who had the honor to represent his person: but also they prohibit all others to do it, and upon no less penalty than Excommunication; and that nothing may be wanting to sublimate their wickedness to the highest, Religion is made the instrument of their iniquity.</p>
            <p>The Notoriety whereof, and of many other acts diametrically opposite to that <hi>free</hi> submission imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately pretended, is so undeniable, that P. W's. own Conscience <hi>squeezeth</hi> out this confession, <hi>I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that some have after transgressed in a high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But first, the aforementioned Declaration runs in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60274:7"/>
the name of the <hi>Catholicks of Ireland</hi>; now <hi>some,</hi> was then <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, All the premised instances of <hi>Contempt, Disobedience</hi> and <hi>Opposition</hi> were not the acts of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, but of <hi>publick</hi> persons, even of those publick persons <hi>into whose hands the Irish Papists may truly be said to have gratis put themselves and their power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The general silence and <hi>submission</hi> of the Body of the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> to the premised instances, conclusively argues, <hi>a general consent</hi> thereunto, at least <hi>subsequent,</hi> if not <hi>antecedent</hi>; for either they were <hi>generally consenting,</hi> or <hi>dissenting</hi>; if <hi>dissenting,</hi> why did not that Generality punish the Transgressors, or even oppose and deny the Transgression? if <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally consenting,</hi> that extenuating particle <hi>some,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares more affection in P. W. to those <hi>Consenters,</hi> than either to his Majesty or his Viceroy.</p>
            <p>The next Argument respecting the <hi>General Case,</hi> is propounded by way of <hi>Comparison,</hi> and that as frequent as untrue, charging, (1) <hi>Protestants,</hi> (2) <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Protestants,</hi> (3) <hi>Many thousand Protestants,</hi> (4) <hi>In the three Kingdoms</hi>; 1. <hi>To have been more hainously criminal</hi>; 2. <hi>To have contributed, or intended as little for the bringing home of his Majesty, as the most wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly principled of the Roman Catholicks of Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ever any, this Comparison is odious, between <hi>Many thousands Protestants</hi> in the three Kingdoms, and not barely the <hi>Irish Papists,</hi> but the most <hi>wickedly principled</hi> of them: So that if P. W. may hold the scale, the Crimes of those Protestants shall weigh
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60274:8"/>
more, and their <hi>Services</hi> for his Majestie, at least their <hi>intendments,</hi> less.</p>
            <p>But let P. W. prove any one of those many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands thus wickedly principled to be a <hi>Protestant,</hi> and and he will with the same labour <hi>disprove</hi> his charge. Let him prove his charge in any one particular, and he will with the same labour <hi>disprove</hi> his instance to be a <hi>Protestant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe most in the three Kingdoms have been first or last hainously criminal, <hi>so that every Mouth must be stopped.</hi> But certainly their guilt gradually differs, and the most <hi>wickedly principled of the Roman Catholicks of Ireland</hi> deserve not the lowest degrees in it. Yet possibly some others in the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms may run parallel with them; But I assume, such are more closely allied both in Principle and Practise, to the <hi>Irish Papist,</hi> than <hi>English Protestant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppose all be involved in one Common guilt, <hi>is the eye of P. W. evil, because his Majesties is good?</hi> or, is there any necessity to extend the same <hi>Grace</hi> to all; or to render a Reason, where onely <hi>Grace</hi> makes the difference? I presume P. W. expects a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of favor than many others of his Countrey-men, and therefore his <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Iealousies</hi> are less; his <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> more; and may not his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Grace make a general as well as personal diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence?</p>
            <p>Lastly, As God who is <hi>glorious</hi> in all <hi>perfections,</hi> doth magnifie his <hi>Mercy</hi> above all his works: so his Majesty who abounds in all Royal virtues, doth above
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60274:8"/>
all abound in <hi>Grace and Goodness,</hi> and from that <hi>Grace and Goodness,</hi> without the least pretension of <hi>merit</hi> (the <hi>Popish tenent</hi>) or <hi>Articling,</hi> (the <hi>Irish practise</hi>) the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Protestants confess to derive their All. Yet they humbly conceive, there are rational inducements for his Majesty in the degrees of his Grace, to discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate between the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> and the <hi>English Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In all <hi>Societies</hi> the publick acts of <hi>FREE Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives,</hi> virtually and interpretatively include all, who declaratively <hi>oppose</hi> not. But the <hi>English Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative,</hi> though under a Force, would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to cast off his Majesties Authority, and as soon as freed from Force, brought home his Majesty; the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish when at most freedom, and after a submission pretended, distrusted, disobeyed, opposed his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Authority; yea banish'd and excommunicated (him <hi>in effigie</hi> in) his Viceroy; and his, namely, all that should <hi>feed</hi> him or <hi>adhere</hi> to him; nor did they ever as a <hi>publick Representative,</hi> either witness their repentance, or contribute to his Majesties Restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>English</hi> Protestants, as became <hi>Subjects,</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Majesty <hi>freely</hi> and absolutely; but the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> as became <hi>Enemies,</hi> not onely Articled with his Majesty, but <hi>compelled</hi> him in the day of their <hi>height</hi> and his <hi>necessity,</hi> to such Articles, as they knew nothing but <hi>necessity</hi> could compell him to. The <hi>English</hi> Protestants may therefore claim his <hi>Majesties Grace,</hi> which is as <hi>great</hi> as their <hi>Guilt</hi>; the <hi>Irish</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60274:9"/>
can onely claim what is due by <hi>Articles,</hi> the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation whereof being dissolv'd on their parts, they can justly claim nothing by them, though his Majesties Mercy has given them much.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>forfeited</hi> Estates of the <hi>English</hi> Protestants were fully at his Majesties <hi>dispose,</hi> and might be freely <hi>remitted</hi>; but the <hi>forfeited estates</hi> of the Irish Papists were <hi>sold</hi> by his late Majesty of blessed memory, and that sale, for the satisfaction of the Adventurers, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced and declared in Parliament, and therefore the forfeited Estate of the Irish Papists could not be <hi>remitted</hi> without satisfaction to the <hi>innocent</hi> Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His Majesty may rationally expect more future <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>loyalty</hi> from <hi>English</hi> Protestants, than <hi>Irish</hi> Papists; For (1) the <hi>English</hi> Protestants are the <hi>Conquerors,</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists the <hi>conquered</hi>; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient as well as modern experience has made it appear, the <hi>conquered</hi> never did (some think morally never will) love the <hi>Conqueror</hi>; and though his Majesty should give the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists not the half onely, but the whole of this Kingdom: yet they will never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably forgive the <hi>English</hi> Protestants for conquering them, nor consequently heartily love that <hi>Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> which first commissionated the Protestants to do it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Untill these last unhappy and unnatural trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the English Protestants in Ireland were never charg'd as guilty of any <hi>Rebellion</hi>; but the <hi>Irish</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists in all opportunities never other than <hi>rebellious.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60274:9"/>
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was the mirror of her age, yet during all her Reign the Rebellions of the Irish Papists in Ireland were very frequent. King <hi>Iames</hi> was another <hi>Solomon,</hi> a Prince of peace, yet was his peace inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Rebellion of Irish Papists, and by that onely. King <hi>Charls</hi> the First was a greater than that <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the wisest of men thought the Irish Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists fasten'd in 1641. to his Majesty by the best of Governments; and to the English Protestants, by the strictest Ties of interess, friendship, marriage and (which is more in their esteem) <hi>Gossiping,</hi> &amp; <hi>fostering</hi>; to the Publick Peace, by their as <hi>flourishing,</hi> so <hi>free condition</hi>; and to all, by those <hi>Royal Graces</hi> which his sacred Majesty at that time indulg'd their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,</hi> such as themselves could desire; <hi>'twas then but ask and have</hi>: yet all this <hi>honey</hi> turn'd into <hi>gall</hi>; for at that very time in which the King was exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing such high acts of Grace to them, the Irish Papists plotted, and soon after perpetrated the worst of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions; the worst <hi>extensivè,</hi> exulcerating generally; and <hi>intensivè,</hi> breaking forth with more perfidy, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barism and cruelty than can be parallel'd in any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Principles of <hi>Religion</hi> ingage <hi>English</hi> Protestants to submit to the King as <hi>Supreme</hi>; but Principles of Religion ingage <hi>Irish</hi> Papists to advance as <hi>Supreme</hi> a Forreign Prince, and limits all their obedience, with a <hi>Saving to the pretended Apostolick See.</hi> Certainly his Majesty may expect more future obedience from Protestants, whose <hi>consciences</hi> ingage them to Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60274:10"/>
than from Irish Papists, whose consciences are ingaged to the Pope. Can his Majesty trust them, if they be not faithful to their Conscience-ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and if they be, can he trust them when their <hi>Consciences</hi> ingage them to his Enemy?</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The next sort of Arguments respect some special Cases, as (1) of the <hi>Transplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> (2) of the <hi>Corporation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>Transplantation,</hi> P. W. perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily concludes, <hi>That it cannot be continued on account of their Crimes since</hi> 1648. <hi>nor stand with the Articles, or with the equity of the Laws, much less with the Iustice of the Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This Conclusion without any <hi>proof,</hi> with the same facility as it is said, may be <hi>gainsaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>foundation</hi> of those Articles, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>Articles</hi> themselves are thrown down by the <hi>Irish Papists</hi>; wherefore it matters not as to his Majesty, what can or cannot stand with them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Many other <hi>Countreys</hi> and Ages have formerly on less grounds used <hi>Transplantation,</hi> and been justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied therein as <hi>just</hi> and <hi>equal,</hi> by Lawyers and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Observe his Sacred Majesties Royal and Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indulgence even to those Irish Papists, who being <hi>Innocent,</hi> sued out Decrees, and obtained possession of Lands in the Province of <hi>Connaught</hi> and County of <hi>Clare.</hi> First, <hi>Positively</hi>; for though they had bound
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60274:10"/>
themselves up therein by their own Act, in which though his Majesty saith in the 14 page of his Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Declaration of the 30 of November 1660. <hi>We might without any injustice deny to relieve them</hi>; yet his Clemencie is so great, That in the same 14 page of his said Declaration, he breaks those fetters which they had bound themselves in, and orders them to be restored unto their former estates.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Comparatively; his Majesty uses those innocent Irish Papists with more tenderness than even those which He honors with the high Title of his <hi>Friends in England and Ireland,</hi> as appears in the 18 and 19 pages of the said Declaration: <hi>For though such are not to expect that his Majesty should pay back to them the Moneys they were compelled in the evil times to disburse for their Compositions, the payment whereof they would have avoiden had it been in their power,</hi> as much as the Irish Papists would have avoided their Transplantation: yet his Majesties <hi>Friends</hi> are not relieved from their own Act, when the innocent Irish Papists are relieved from theirs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Observe the insolency of P. W. for though his Sacred Majesty in Council, by his said Declaration published to the world in print, declared that some other transplanted Irish are to stand bound by their own Act, and not to be relieved against it; yet <hi>P. W.</hi> is so far from acknowledging and magnifying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Mercy in using the innocent Irish Papists with more favor, than even those happy persons whom his Majesty honors with the high title of being his <hi>Friends,</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60274:11"/>
that P. W. peremptorily says, <hi>viz. The Transplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be continued on account of their crimes since</hi> 1648. <hi>nor can it stand with the Articles, or with the equity of the Laws, much less with the Iustice of the Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. That the Justice of his Sacred Majesty in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil may appear to be <hi>such,</hi> in not breaking so much of the Transplantation, as is confirmed by the said De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, I desire these following particulars may be throughly considered:</p>
               <p n="1">(1) If such transplanted Irish Papists into <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught</hi> and <hi>Clare</hi> should plead that the Force of the late horrid Usurpers constrained them to go thither in person; I answer, yet no Force lay upon them to sue out Decrees, and obtain possessions of Lands there in liew of their former forfeited Estates in the other Provinces. And it is onely in point of Land that the said Transplantation is continued: so that their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what they could not avoid, is not made conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive to them, but onely their doing of that which they could avoid, and yet sollicited and brought to effect, is made binding to some of them. To which I shall add, that those to whom it is made obliging, are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such as having no title to innocency, (for all Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents are freed from Transplantation) have no title to any of their former Estates. And therefore this confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in the compensation of that, to which they had no right, should invite them to acknowledg his Majesties Mercy, which yet P. W. in their behalf exclaims against as injustice.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:60274:11"/>(2) Though all these guilty Transplanted Irish have forfeited their right to the Articles extorted from his Majesty in 1648. and though by those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles (had they been as punctually observed by them, as they have been generally and often violated by themselves yet) his Majesty was not obliged to hinder them from making an unequal <hi>bargain</hi> or <hi>exchange</hi> for those their forfeited Lands, which by his mercy they were restored unto, nor to confirm to them those Lands which they sued for in satisfaction of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Estates; yet his sacred Majesty confirms to them, in confirming their Transplantation, those Lands which they themselves had obtained from the Usurpers, as a compensation for the Lands they left, and to which they had not the least shadow of a Title, because they had broken, yea often, if not always, the said Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of peace <hi>vouchsaved</hi> to, and extorted by them, in the year 1648.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) The persons themselves who are transplanted, have by their publick Agents made the continuance and settlement of the Transplantation the subject matter of several Petitions and Addresses to the <hi>RVMP</hi>: therefore as for them to decry it now, argues in them a fuller readiness to obey <hi>Force,</hi> than <hi>Right</hi>: so the continuance of it being in effect but a granting of their own desires and petitions, they can justly blame none but <hi>Themselves.</hi> To prove the truth of this, I shall set down the Titles and chief Heads of two petitons presented to the <hi>RVMP.</hi> The one is in print, and thus addressed: <hi>To the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60274:12"/>
Authority the Parliament of the Commonwealth of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c. The humble Petition of Sir</hi> Robert Talbot <hi>Baronet and</hi> Garrot Moor <hi>
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> on the behalf of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and the distressed Irish, Submittees upon Articles of War, and others who are to have a certain proportion of their estates by the Act for the settling of</hi> Ireland, <hi>held forth in the year</hi> 1652. Wherein, to use their own words, They <hi>humbly show, That the Petitioners upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of enjoying the benefit of several Declarations and Articles of War held forth unto them by Authority of this Parliament, &amp;c. did readily subject and put their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, Lives and Fortunes as in a secure Sanctuary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of this Commonwealth, having ever since walked peaceably and in due conformity to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, without the least defection therein; That since the Interruption given to the sitting of this Parliament in the year</hi> 1653. <hi>No Christian Nation can parallel the sufferings of the Petitioners, &amp;c. which render the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners as fit Objects of your Honors piety, justice and compassion, as any who may challenge your protection. Notwithstanding the Petitioners withered hopes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer confidence, being afresh revived by your Honors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the management of the present Government, and their propensions so great to peace and quietness, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ravel into the settlement, They do</hi> willingly <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in the Transplantation, albeit it was not executed by any legal power, as not being derived from your Honors.</hi> Soon after in the same Petition follow these words: <hi>They do apprehend that contrary to your Honors pious intentions manifested in the said Act for settling of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60274:12"/>
they may be postponed or neglected, unless provided for in the Act of settlement now to be established: And therefore the Petitioners humbly pray, &amp;c.</hi> This Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was delivered by the said two Agents for the Irish Papists at the door of the House of Commons in <hi>England,</hi> and entered by the Clerk of the <hi>Rump.</hi>

               <p>The other Petition was in writing, and subscribed <hi>Robert Talbot, Garret Moor</hi>: the Title of it is, <hi>To the Supreme Authority, the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, &amp;c. Supplications humbly tendered by Sir</hi> Robert Talbot <hi>Bar. and</hi> Garret Moor <hi>
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> for and on the behalf of themselves and the distressed Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks of Ireland, in order to be therein relieved by the Act of Settlement now to be passed.</hi> Their second Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in this Petition is set down in these words, viz. <hi>That the estates assigned unto the Petitioners in the Province of Connaught and County of Clare be</hi> confirm'd <hi>unto them.</hi> The third Supplication in the said Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in these words, viz. <hi>That the Decrees obtained by any of the Petitioners pursuant to the Articles and Qualifications be put in a way of satisfaction and for the time past put in equal condition with others who have had the benefit of their Decrees.</hi> The fourth Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Petition is expressed in these words, viz. <hi>That there having been no time limited by this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for the Petitioners to enter and prosecute the claims according to their respective Qualifications, and the interruption given to the sitting thereof soon after the Act of Settlement, having hinderd many from doing the same; and that others through absence, poverty, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60274:13"/>
the short sitting of the Court for the adjudication of Claims, appointed since the said Interruption, could not do it, That a farther time be allowed unto such to enter and prosecute (as aforesaid) their Claims.</hi> The fifth Supplication is expressed in these words, viz. <hi>That several of the Petitioners are able to make appear their constant good affection and adherence to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, for whom a competent time to be allowed to make out the same, is humbly supplicated, and that these and such of the Petitioners as have already done the same, may have the benefit held forth unto them by the Act for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These expressions being verbatim in the said two Petitions, I shall onely observe from thence what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, 1. The persons who presented these Requests to the <hi>RVMP,</hi> did it not onely for themselves, but for the Papists of Ireland, in whose behalf they own themselves to be Sollicitors. 2. Those two Gentlemen (their publick Agents) were persons of too much knowledg and discretion to have done any thing, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of so high a nature as this, for so great a body of people, without sufficient power from themselves so to do 3. That these their Agents Addresses to the <hi>RVMP</hi> were by allowance and command from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, needs not better to be proved, than by the Irish Papists ever since continuing those their two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents in publick employment for them, even to this day.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To that very <hi>RVMP</hi> by whose immediate Commission the <hi>horridest of Murthers</hi> was acted, they scruple not to make their application, and even by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60274:13"/>
the stile of the <hi>Supreme Authority</hi> the Parliament of the Commonwealth of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> and that twice. If P. W. should say they were necessitated to petition, and that their petition would not be received with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it were so directed, I answer, No consequence of their suffering could be so great, as the guilt of own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>RVMP</hi> by the twice before mentioned Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. The single Advocate of the Irish Papists, viz. P. W. lays it as a guilt upon <hi>all</hi> the Protestants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that <hi>some</hi> of them fought under one of the Regicides to recover their own Estates, and punish the guilt of the first Rebellion, and their often vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their Articles; and yet their publick Agents in behalf of <hi>all</hi> the Papists of <hi>Ireland,</hi> own <hi>all</hi> those Regicides to be that <hi>Supreme Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. But if the Consciences of the Irish Papists were hardened enough to run into a <hi>certain sin,</hi> but in the expectancy of an <hi>uncertain advantage,</hi> why yet in their printed Petition did they use these guilty expressions, viz. <hi>They did readily subject and put their CONSCIENCES, Lives and Fortunes as in a secure Sanctuary under the protection of that Commonwealth.</hi> Though if they would petition, they may say there was a necessity to stile the RUMP, the Supreme Authority; yet sure they cannot say there was a necessity in the body of the Petition to insert such criminal words: therefore since the <hi>Body of the Petition</hi> is <hi>more</hi> than consonant to the <hi>Title of it,</hi> it is but reasonable to believe, the Title they gave the <hi>RVMP,</hi> was as voluntary as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions with which they treat them. If they would
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60274:14"/>
but make his Sacred Majesty, what in print they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the <hi>RVMP</hi> was to them, viz. <hi>A secure Sanctuary to put their Consciences, Lives and Fortunes in</hi>; if what is past could not be <hi>remedied,</hi> yet the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs to come might perhaps be <hi>prevented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But as if the immediate before mentioned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to the <hi>RVMP</hi> had not been sufficient, they pay them others, professing in these words, viz. <hi>Their withered hopes and former confidences are a fresh revived by the RVMPS return to the management of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under which their propensions to peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness are so great, that they willingly ACQVIESCE in the TRANSPLANTATION.</hi> Would they be but as joyful for his Sacred Majesties restauration, as they say they were for the <hi>RVMPS,</hi> and had they been as willing to express their propensity to the peace and quietness of this Kingdom, under his Majesties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Authority, as under the <hi>RVMPS</hi> usurped power, P. W. had been exempt from the Guilts of <hi>writing</hi> and <hi>printing</hi> his Letter, and I from the trouble of answering it. The Irish Papists are not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to declare, <hi>They willingly acquiesce in the Transplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>; but to heighten the merit of that performance, they add these words, viz. <hi>Albeit it was not executed by any legal power</hi>: yet had they stop'd there, those their last words had been true, and sure the <hi>RVMP</hi> would have had arrogancy enough to have assumed to themselves, without an explanation from the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners, that thereby was meant, what their Agents positively say in the immediate next following words,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60274:14"/>
viz. <hi>As not derived from your Honors.</hi> Though the Irish Papists in their ingagements, nay Oaths to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are not without their <hi>Equivocations</hi> and <hi>Mental reservations,</hi> &amp;c. yet to the <hi>RVMP,</hi> when they might have left themselves, (as to the last expression,) to a fair explanation, they voluntarily cast it behind them, in these clear words, <hi>As not derived from your Honors.</hi> Those which now pretend to such Loyalty to his Majesty, voluntarily confess, <hi>No execution was legal that was not derived from the RVMP</hi>; is not this <hi>implicitely,</hi> if not <hi>explicitely,</hi> an owning in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Papists the legality of the RUMPS <hi>power,</hi> even in the <hi>Bloudy Murther of his Sacred Majesty,</hi> that being derived from those the Irish Papists call <hi>Their Honors.</hi> But it is no wonder, that those to whom the Irish Papists did <hi>rerdily subject themselves, and put their Consciences, lives and fortunes as into a secure san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,</hi> should have so much <hi>plainness, kindness</hi> and <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> for them. May we not too from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr, till they consider his Sacred Majesty, as they profess'd they considered the RUMP, his Majesty may not well expect from them, that <hi>ready subjection and propensity to peace,</hi> which in their said Addresses they promised to those Usurpers.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Observe, all this is <hi>said</hi> and <hi>done</hi> since the Peace of 1648. yea part of it, and that the most cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal too, but some few months before his Majesties blessed restauration; with what face could the Irish Papists by the same Agents plead for the Articles of peace before his Majesty, as inviolable observers of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60274:15"/>
them; who but a few weeks before owned the RUMP for the Supreme Authority: owned that they readily did subject and put their Consciences, Lives and Fortunes, as in a secure sanctuary, under their protection: owned their withered hopes and former confidence was afresh reviv'd by the RUMPS return to the management of the Government: ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, their propensions to peace and quietness under the RUMP to be so great, that as one evidence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they willingly did acquiesce in the Transplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; with these superlative expressions, Albeit it was not executed by any legal power, as not being derived from their Honors. The very Murtherers of his late Majesty of Glorious Memory are the elected <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of the Irish Papists, not onely for their lives and fortunes, but even for their <hi>CONSCIENCES</hi> also. That bloudy Power which made the Royal Line of <hi>England,</hi> and all good Subjects of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> so long wither, is by their return to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that onely which makes the hopes of the Irish Papists to <hi>revive</hi> and <hi>spring.</hi> That Power is by the Irish Papists owned to be the onely <hi>legal</hi> one, by which all our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> were <hi>cut up</hi> even by the very <hi>roots.</hi> Were there nothing but this to make them forfeit the Articles they so plead for, it were but <hi>too much</hi>; if this be their observance of their Recognition of his Majesty, though the <hi>Pope</hi> may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve them, <hi>God</hi> will not. Sure P. W. cannot prove any <hi>one</hi> of the Protestants whose <hi>whole</hi> number he so calumniates, to be so criminal, as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60274:15"/>
even the <hi>Generality</hi> of the Irish Papists to be, in this one particular; <hi>I bate him many others.</hi> And doubtless 'twas a less sin in the seduced Protestants to submit for a while to him, who cast down those English Murtherers, and helped them against these Irish Murtherers, than readily to subject their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, Lives and Fortunes to those Parricides, yea to own them as their secure Sanctuary for <hi>all,</hi> and so pathetically to exult in their second Usurpation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In the many forementioned passages, both of the written and the printed Petition, they press for the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the <hi>Transplantation,</hi> and the benefit of the Rules for adjudging of Qualifications, and make the granting thereof to be effects of the RUMPS <hi>Piety, Iustice</hi> and <hi>Compassion.</hi> The Irish Papists are pleased to beg that <hi>Grant,</hi> as an act of <hi>piety, justice</hi> and <hi>compassion</hi> in the RUMP, which his Sacred Majesty confirming, (and much more to the advantage of the Irish) P. W. calls an <hi>Injustice.</hi> And in the 6. and 7. Paragraphs of the said written Petition, they set forth that <hi>several of the Petitioners are able to make appear their constant good affection and adherence to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, that some have already actually done it</hi>: And in effect, That the number of those <hi>so adhering and of constant good affection to the Commonwealth</hi> was so great, that they sue even for a longer time than had been allowed, for the proving thereof; they being so many, that they were streightned in time to make out that Truth.</p>
               <p>There are other clear <hi>observations</hi> and <hi>inferences</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:60274:16"/>
which I could make out of those two Petitions, which I decline; enough having been said to evince what I promised to prove upon this Head: and I have much behind to answer, to which I hasten.</p>

               <p>The 2. special Case concerns the Irish <hi>Corporations</hi> which P. W. with his usual confidence determines, <hi>cannot be excluded on any account that may stand with his Majesties Gracious Concessions; nor can there be any reasons of State which may accord with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to exclude them</hi>; yet he confesseth with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, <hi>That two or three of them deserved punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Limerick a severe one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Corporations of <hi>Ireland</hi> that P.

(so much and groundlesly pleaded) 1. searched (to use his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces own words) <hi>with force and arms for the L. Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as if they judged him a Traitor.</hi> 2. They treated with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to be Protector of Ireland, as if they judged themselves Lords of all. 3. They <hi>refused to admit</hi> any Garrison commissionated by his Majesty's authority, and surrendred that Town (as if they esteem'd themselves a Free State) without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting the Marquess of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> then L. Deputy, though resident within few miles thereof, and though he were of P. W's. own Nation and Religion. But I will not say that even those <hi>double Ties</hi> were less powerful to beget a <hi>respect</hi> for him, than his represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Kings person,</hi> and his own <hi>worth,</hi> were incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to P.

deny'd a <hi>passage</hi> to the L.

               <p>What <hi>falsehood</hi> will P.

But P. W. as farther motives of favor to the said Corporations, adds and says, 1. <hi>The hand of God hath punished them</hi>; 2. <hi>Some were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful amomg them</hi>; 3. <hi>The English Protestants are more cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>The hand of God hath punished them:</hi> But that the Magistrate should <hi>spare,</hi> because God <hi>punishes,</hi> is a <hi>non sequitur.</hi> Though the Lord sent hornets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Israel to drive out the <hi>Hivite</hi> and the <hi>Canaanite,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:60274:17"/>
and the <hi>Hittites</hi>; yet he commands Israel to destroy those Nations, and their name from under heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. P.W. says, <hi>There have been many faithful subjects in those Towns, even in the most criminal of them; and God was so far from involving the just in the destruction of the wicked Sodomites, that if he could find there but ten just men, he would for their sake pardon all the rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The sin of <hi>Apostacy</hi> seems worse in some respect than other sins; and therefore on this sin, <hi>Lots wife,</hi> whom God had rescued from the destruction of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, though but for looking back to it, is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately turned into a <hi>pillar of Salt.</hi> I heartily wish the Irish Apostates would remember <hi>Lots wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Though God would not involve the <hi>righteous</hi> in the punishment of the <hi>wicked</hi> but <hi>delivered just Lot</hi>; yet he <hi>transplanted</hi> him into <hi>Zoar,</hi> and condemned So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Gomorra with an overthrow, making them an <hi>Example</hi> to those that after should live ungodly. Even so his Majesty hath taken care for the <hi>innocent,</hi> in his Gracious Declaration, without justifying the <hi>wicked,</hi> and for the <hi>innocent</hi> has provided a <hi>Zoar,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their souls may <hi>escape</hi> and <hi>live.</hi>

               <head>The Guilt of English Protestants and Irish Papists compared.</head>
               <p>Thirdly, P.

               </p>
               <p>As to the first, <hi>That the Irish Papists are not Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides</hi>; let it be considered, That the Doctrine of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicide</hi> is common in the Romish <hi>Schools,</hi> and the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise in their <hi>Courts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That to touch the <hi>Annointing,</hi> is virtually to touch the <hi>Annointed.</hi> Take away the <hi>Regalia,</hi> and in effect you tak away the <hi>King.</hi> The Irish Papists were so guilty hereof, that they not onely usurped all the <hi>Royal peculiars,</hi> but also set up a Government distinct from, and opposite to his Majesty's in a General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly; yea therein they Enacted, <hi>viz. That no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Government or Iurisdiction should be assumed, kept or executed in</hi> Ireland, <hi>or in any Province or County thereof, other than what should be approved or instituted
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60274:18"/>
by their General Assembly.</hi> Had the <hi>Devil</hi> had leave to touch <hi>Iob's person,</hi> he would not have spared him, when he touched <hi>all that was his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Did not the <hi>Irish Papists, distrust, disobey, oppose</hi> and <hi>excommunicate</hi> the <hi>L. Lievtenant,</hi> and absolutely disclaim his <hi>Majesties authority</hi> in him; did they not conspire to Murther Him, or which is worse (if worse can be) <hi>to deliver</hi> him to the <hi>worst</hi> sort of <hi>Murtherers?</hi> Surely those who dealt thus with such a <hi>Servant,</hi> if the <hi>Son</hi> had been <hi>sent</hi> to them, would not have scrupled his <hi>Murther,</hi> that the <hi>inheritance</hi> might wholly be theirs.</p>
               <p>As to the 2. That <hi>when England, Scotland and the the Protestants of Ireland wholly deserted the Royal Cause, the Irish Papists fought against the Regicides in defense of his Majesties right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is no less calumnious than false, to charge <hi>England, Scotland and the Protestants of Ireland to have wholly deserted the Royal Cause</hi>: and it is amazing to consider how any Irish <hi>Papist</hi> (I am loath to say <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>) dare thus by a Letter even to the <hi>Duke of</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, and printed paper to the whole <hi>World,</hi> impeach the Nations of England and Scotland, and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of Ireland <hi>to have wholly deserted the Royal Cause</hi>: what may not <hi>Forreigners</hi> credit against us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, if P. W. dare thus to charge us at <hi>home?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a Narrative of the matter of <hi>Fact</hi> is the clearest expedient to refute this <hi>slander</hi>: wherein let England and Scotland answer for themselves; (if any Answer seem necessary to so palpable a falsehood) and let the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60274:19"/>
Protestants of of Ireland excuse my zeal, if I urge some clear instances (though I pretermit many) for their vindication.</p>
               <p>Those which P. W. slanders with having deserted the <hi>Royal Cause,</hi> when the Irish Papists fought against the <hi>Regicides</hi> in defence of his Majesties <hi>Rights,</hi> were even the very first in Ireland which <hi>proclaimed</hi> his Majesty, my L. Lieutenant also at the head of them; and that duty was performd by the <hi>Protestant</hi> Army in the Province of Munster, the same year in which by giving the Irish Papists some considerable defeats, the said Papists were reduced to a <hi>real</hi> necessity of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to his Majesty, which yet they but <hi>seemingly</hi> did. But possibly P. W. was at that time so busie in preparing those <hi>Articles of Peace</hi> which were to <hi>fetter</hi> his Majesty, that he had not leisure to hear how his <hi>Protestant Subjects</hi> freely proclaim'd him. It is also undeniably true, that a considerable Body of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> of Ireland under the L. Lieutenant, though mingled with the <hi>Irish Papists,</hi> fought constantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Regicides, nay after the said Irish Papists would have been <hi>Kegicides</hi> themselves, at least so far such as conspiring to murther his Majesty <hi>in effigie</hi> at <hi>Waterford &amp;c.</hi> did amount unto, and never declin'd that quarrel, till by the infidelity of their Accusers, they were not onely disabled to prosecute it, but as several of themselves have confest, were reduc'd at last, even for the preservation of their lives, to keep as strict Guards against the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> as against <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi> All which his Grace having found was but too
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60274:19"/>
true, he withdrew himself at last out of the Kingdom and permitted those Protestants to withdraw them selves from the Irish: Therefore let any unbyassed person judg whether the Irish Papists or <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Prte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> were wholly <hi>the deserters of the Koyal Cause</hi>; or which of them fought longest against the <hi>Kegicides</hi>: if the insolence and disloyalty of the Irish Papists were such, even when <hi>Cromwell</hi> was at their gates, what would it not have been without that <hi>Curb.</hi> But I see though P. W. remembers what he should not, yet he can forget what he should remember.</p>
               <p>In the years 1641 and 1642, the Protestants in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land not onely fought as his Majesties Subjects, but by his <hi>command</hi> and with his <hi>Commission</hi> against the Irish Rebels; in the year 1643, a Cessation was concluded by his Majesties Authority, and the Irish engaged by <hi>Articles</hi>; both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> by <hi>duty,</hi> to transport their Armies to England for his Majesties service. The English did it, the Irish onely made a show (till the English were gone) of doing of it, and then plotted and attempted the destruction of the <hi>few</hi> English re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in <hi>Munster,</hi> whereby the Lord of Inchiquin, who then commanded in that Province by the <hi>Kings</hi> Commission; and the English with him were necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to stand on their own defence, yet this is the first pretence which the Irish Papists make, that the English Protestants deserted the Royal Cause. Can even <hi>Malice</hi> it self judg, the Protestants designed the deserting of the Kings Service, when they sent their Army to the King, by which onely they were capable
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60274:20"/>
of disserving him: nay sent it in that very Juncture of time, wherein they had as much cause to fear the <hi>ruine</hi> of themselves and Families, from the often <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> of the <hi>Cessation</hi> by the Irish Papists, <hi>after</hi> that Cessation was made, as from their inhumanities <hi>before.</hi> But yet, when his Majesties Service required it, though the answering thereof, by transporting their Armies into England, threatned more than a probable ruine to them at home from the Irish Papists, who then <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed,</hi> and indeed never <hi>after</hi> would send an Army to the King into England; yet the Protestants did not so much as hesitate, but <hi>cheerfully</hi> exposed themselves to the <hi>danger,</hi> to pay the <hi>duty,</hi> and receive the <hi>honor</hi> of their obedience.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>infidelity</hi> and <hi>Treachery</hi> which Munster, and the parts more remote first <hi>experienced,</hi> the L. Lieutenant and the Protestants with him at <hi>Dublin</hi> at last <hi>tasted</hi>: And his Grace was thereby compelled in the year 1647. (with his Majesties permission, if not Order) to resign <hi>Dublin</hi> and all the adjoyning Garrisons into the hands of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which is the second pretension for this slander.</p>
               <p>On these occasions the English Protestants of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (not by <hi>choice</hi> but <hi>necessity,</hi> (and a <hi>necessity</hi> onely created by the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> themselves) not by the Protestants own <hi>private acts,</hi> but the <hi>necessitated</hi> acts of those that were set over them by his <hi>Majesties au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>) came into the <hi>Stream,</hi> with the violence whereof they confess themselves afterwards <hi>hurried</hi> into such miscarriages as made their <hi>hearts ake</hi>; yet
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60274:20"/>
(they hope) less criminal than those in the Irish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, or to any degree of Apostacy, which deserves the scandal that P. W. lays on them, of <hi>wholly desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Royal Cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. Notwithstanding the violent endeavors of both <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> not many of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> of Ireland have declined the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in her greatest Tryals, whose <hi>principles</hi> are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly most consonant to <hi>Truth,</hi> but also most useful and dutiful to the Royal <hi>Cause</hi>: and for that reason were opposed most by the two <hi>extremes.</hi> So that <hi>Old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> in the <hi>Anabaptist dialect,</hi> was the same with <hi>Royalist,</hi> and by them the <hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> were dealt with accordingly. And 2. as the <hi>principles,</hi> so the <hi>practises of the Protestants</hi> vindicate their loyalty. 1. They submitted this Kingdom to his Majesty; not as <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the concurrence of the <hi>General</hi> and <hi>General Officers,</hi> but <hi>without</hi> them, nay <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> them, 2. Though they saw the <hi>difficulty</hi> of that <hi>attempt,</hi> and foresaw the <hi>hazard</hi> from <hi>Anabaptists</hi> (who then in chief commanded the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi>) if they <hi>succeeded not</hi>; and from <hi>Irish Papist</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (whose necessities had <hi>driven</hi> them to <hi>serve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> by his Majesty in Flanders) if they <hi>succeeded</hi>; yet were they <hi>early</hi> (if not the first) and <hi>free</hi> without Articling in the duty of their submissions. And least <hi>P. W.</hi> who says many things that are not <hi>true,</hi> should deny <hi>this,</hi> which is so signally <hi>true,</hi> I will cite the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Testimony of his Sacred Majesty himself, which follows in these words in the 2. page of his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60274:21"/>
Majesties gracious Declaration for the settlement of <hi>Ireland: We acknowledg that our good Subjects of the Kingdom of Ireland have born a very good part in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing this happiness, that they were EARLY in their dutiful Addresses to us, and made the same professions of a resolution to return to their duty and obedience to us, during the time of our being beyond the seas, which they have since so EMINENTLY made good and put in practise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is not onely a <hi>profession of duty,</hi> but a making of it <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>putting it in practise.</hi> Here is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an <hi>early</hi> owning of his Majesties Authority, but an owning it when he was devested from the actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercize of it, and that too (as to <hi>Ireland</hi>) by the <hi>Irish Papists.</hi> And this is also the first fruits of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants having recovered the power of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that with no less <hi>hazard</hi> than <hi>loyalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To make the Discrimination yet <hi>clearer</hi>: The <hi>Irish Papists</hi> at first <hi>murther'd</hi> and <hi>fought</hi> against his Majesties good Subjects, to take from him his Crown. The Protestants of Ireland fought aganst his Enemies to <hi>restore him to it.</hi> The Papists of Ireland were <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly good Subjects,</hi> but to become <hi>more dangerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</hi> But the Protestants of Ireland if seemingly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, were such, but to become more <hi>useful Subjects.</hi> The last action of the Irish Papists, when they had the power, was to <hi>expell</hi> his Majesties Authority, with circumstances as wicked as the very sin: but the first action of the English Protestants, when they were in power, was to <hi>restore</hi> his Majesties Authority,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60274:21"/>
with circumstances almost as dutiful as the Action it self.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Not to hold a candle longer to the <hi>Sun,</hi> I will but instance one other <hi>experiment,</hi> and against an <hi>experiment</hi> there is no <hi>arguing</hi>; and the instance of this experiment is even in the very Case now contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and in which also my L. Duke of Ormond himself was the <hi>Iudg.</hi> In the year 1650. when it came in Question, which were the <hi>worst,</hi> the <hi>Irish Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> or the <hi>seduced Protestants.</hi> He permitted all those worthy Protestants which till then he served under him, to come off to the rest of the Protestants, though then headed by <hi>Iret<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n</hi> himself; esteeming them safer with that <hi>real Regicide so accompanied,</hi> than with those <hi>pretended Antiregicides, so principled.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he esteems those less ill <hi>to</hi> whom he sends his Friends, than <hi>from</hi> whom he sends them. If so wise and so faithful a Servant to his Majesty, as the L. Lieutenant is, had had <hi>any hope</hi> that the Irish Papists would ever have return'd to their Loyalty, doubtless he would never have sent away <hi>from them,</hi> so many <hi>powerful helpers</hi> of it, and <hi>friends</hi> unto it : and if his Grace had not had <hi>more than hopes</hi> that the English Protestants would have return'd to their obedience as soon as they had got the power of doing it, he would never have sent his friends unto them. The <hi>Wisdom</hi> of his Grace's <hi>foresight</hi> has been happily <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified</hi> in the <hi>Result.</hi> For all the Protestants which then came off, were eminently instrumental and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in the duty of accomplishing that blessed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60274:22"/>
I dare as <hi>truly</hi> as <hi>confidently</hi> say, the most of the Protestants of Ireland onely served under the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers, but to bring the Irish Papists to those terms which without the <hi>force</hi> of English <hi>swords</hi> they would never have been brought unto. The <hi>Antient</hi> and <hi>Modern</hi> often breaches of Faith which the Irish Papists were guilty of, made it too evident to many of the Protestants, that nothing could bind them but <hi>steel</hi> and <hi>iron.</hi> The truth of both these <hi>positions</hi> is clearly read in that issue which the Providence of God has effected. However the <hi>once Seduced</hi> Protestants of Ireland are willing to take <hi>shame</hi> to themselves, and give <hi>glory</hi> to God, in confessing their <hi>Guilt</hi> such, (though not by <hi>causing,</hi> yet by <hi>complying</hi> with the late <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> though to a <hi>good end</hi>) that they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledg they ow their lives and estates whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Majesties <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>indulgence</hi>; and will be more joyful to employ <hi>both</hi> in the <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> of his service, than now they are in having received <hi>both</hi> from his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>goodness.</hi> For 'tis fitter to <hi>discharge</hi> obligations, than to <hi>contract</hi> them. The lively sense the once seduced Protestants of Ireland have of their <hi>failings,</hi> and of his Majesties Clemencie, so justly <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> them, that they can take no pleasure to <hi>recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate others,</hi> farther than by shewing the Injustice of P.W's. comparisons; which they are more troubled he gave them a rise to do, than after the rise was given they were troubled to find out what fully has done it. But in regard the Irish Papists in all their discourses, as well as their Papers, pretend to the <hi>defense of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60274:22"/>
Right</hi>; it seems even necessary, by way of answer to the other branch of this proposition, to rub up their memories. 1. That in 1641 the <hi>Irish Papists unprovok'd</hi> (1) <hi>rebelled,</hi> (2) <hi>robbed</hi> the Protestants of more personal Estate, than the <hi>Fee-simple</hi> of all the <hi>forfeited Lands in Ireland</hi> is worth; (3) in a few Months <hi>murthered</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hundred thousand innocents; (4) with a sin next to <hi>Blasphemie,</hi> as <hi>now</hi> they pretend his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties <hi>defense,</hi> so <hi>then</hi> they pretended his <hi>Authority.</hi> The <hi>PRETENDING</hi> whereof having been so horrid a sin, (for it was no less than to have intitled his then Sacred Majesty to all their unparallel'd crimes, nay to have made him the Author of them) I think it a duty to the memory of that Glorious <hi>MARTYR,</hi> to present the Reader in this place with what will clearly evince their malice therein to be as great, as his then Majesties Innocence; and nothing can better illustrate the vastness of <hi>this,</hi> but by proving 'tis a parallel to <hi>that.</hi> I could instance many signal and clear evidences of this <hi>Truth,</hi> besides that memorable one which follows: But since I have in most of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer made use of their own writings, and prints, to make out their guilt: in this very particular I will pursue that method, and onely cite the Preamble of their own Remonstrance, deliver'd by the L. Viscount <hi>Gormanston,</hi> Sir <hi>Lucas Dillon,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Talbot</hi> Baronet, to his Majesties Commissioners at rhe Town of <hi>Trim</hi> in the County of <hi>Meath,</hi> on the 17 of March 1642. In which Remonstrance of Grievances (for so they call it) after they have taken notice that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60274:23"/>
had authorized Commissioners to hear what they should say, or propound, these very words follow, <hi>viz. Which your Majesties gracious and Princely Favor we find to be accompanied with these words, viz. Albeit we do extremely detest the odious Rebellion which the Recusants of Ireland have, without ground or colour, raised against Vs, Our Crown and Dignity.</hi> Words which deserve to be written with a <hi>Beam of the Sun,</hi> as eternal monuments of his <hi>Majesties Iustice,</hi> and their <hi>Guilt</hi>; nor were they spoken in a corner, but spoken under the Great Seal, and even in that Commission which those False-accusers were to see and hear read; and by those expressions they were sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to have pleaded that <hi>Authority</hi> they so falsely <hi>pretended,</hi> had they had the <hi>least shadow</hi> for that black calumny. In these Royal expressions also (if at least the Irish Papists have the Modesty (I bate them the Justice) to acknowledg the King was a fitter Judge of their Crimes, than they themselves were) the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the chief Governors of Ireland, when that horrid Rebellion brake out, are fully vindicated: for the said Irish were so far from being provoked unto it by those, that no less a testimony than the word of that great, just and wise Prince proves, they had no <hi>ground,</hi> nay not so much as a <hi>colour</hi> for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the year 1646, and <hi>after</hi> a peace concluded with them, they attempted, by a <hi>Treachery</hi> not to be parallel'd by any but themselves, to cut off the Lord Lieutenant and Army with him, who marched out of <hi>Dublin</hi> on security and confidence of that <hi>peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:60274:23"/>3. The same year, the <hi>Council and Congregation of the confederate Catholicks of Ireland,</hi> obliged their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Preston</hi> by a solemn Oath, in these very words, <hi>viz. To exercize all acts of Hostility against the L. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of Ormond</hi> by name, <hi>and his party; and to help, advise with counsel, and assist in that service the L. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of Vlster employed in the same expedition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Oath is a fruitful <hi>Theme</hi> to declame upon, but I will limit my observations upon it, onely to these following particulars. 1. Least any should doubt they are his Majesties Subjects; least any of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should repent the sin of not having been such, they swear (that they may raise their crimes above pardon) to exercize <hi>all acts of Hostility against his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> in the person of that noble Lord who had <hi>then,</hi> as <hi>now,</hi> the high honor to represent him; If <hi>killing</hi> be an act of <hi>hostility,</hi> they in this Oath swear to <hi>kill</hi> him; if this be not <hi>actual Regicide,</hi> I am sure 'tis not their fault that it is not. This horrid Oath takes off all disguises, and makes their sin as visible as great. And if such a Crime be capable of accession, it did contract it by the same persons engaging privately, about the same time, (as I have been assur'd by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Testimony) That he would <hi>serve the King,</hi> which he afterwards endeavour'd to excuse onely by saying, <hi>His Army was not Nuntio-proof.</hi> By which it appears indisputably whether the Irish Papists are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the <hi>King,</hi> or to the <hi>Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) Instead of repenting and making amends for the late violated peace in the year 1646, they swear
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60274:24"/>
to <hi>destroy</hi> him, with whom they had made it.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) This Oath reduc'd the taker of it to a sad Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma, either to <hi>Rebellion</hi> or <hi>Perjury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4) This Oath evidences that nothing is so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with the Irish Papists, as to <hi>destroy his Majesties Government</hi>; since the uniting of the <hi>Old Irish</hi> Papists and the <hi>Old English</hi> Papists, which the <hi>Pope</hi> himself could not effect: the dethroning of his Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty has accomplish'd. They that could never agree in <hi>any thing else,</hi> agree in <hi>this,</hi> and 'tis made the very <hi>Bond of their iniquity.</hi> I will say no more on this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but that <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> could be friends, when it was to crucifie <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In the year 1647, from <hi>Kilkenny Ian.</hi> 18. the Popish Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons of the <hi>confederate Catholicks of Ireland</hi> employ Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners to <hi>Rome, France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> to invite a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power into Ireland, particularly to <hi>Rome</hi> their titular Bishop of <hi>Ferns</hi> and <hi>Nicolas Plunket</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> (who was Knighted by the Pope for his good service there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and is now one of the confident Advocates for the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists as <hi>defenders of his Majesties Rights,</hi> and against the Protestants of Ireland as <hi>deserters of the Royal Cause</hi>) these, I say, were authorized to declare, <hi>viz. That they raised arms for the freedom of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion,</hi> which are their own very words in the third Article of those their Instructions.</p>
               <p>In their Remonstrance in the begining of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, whatever they said necessitated some few dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents to take up arms, then they took off the <hi>vail,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60274:24"/>
and positively said, <hi>That they raised arms for the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Catholick Religion.</hi> Certainly if <hi>ever</hi> they may be believed to <hi>speak true,</hi> it is when they speak to the POPE; and if ever any thing may be believed to be the voice of all the Irish Papists, it is when the Popish Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons of the confederate Catholicks speak in one <hi>Assembly.</hi> What is meant by the <hi>Freedom of the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> has been <hi>practically expounded</hi> by the Professors of it in Ireland; not onely <hi>affirmatively,</hi> that those which are of it, should enjoy the publick and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed exercize thereof themselves; but <hi>negatively,</hi> to be an exclusion of the publick, if not <hi>private,</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize of the True Religion. Many instances I could present the Reader of this, but I shall onely set down two: The 1. is <hi>Dean York</hi> a reverend Minister of Gods word, during his residence at <hi>Gallway,</hi> was not allowed to pay the last duties of <hi>Christian burial</hi> to those Protestants which died in that Town; but was <hi>forced</hi> to <hi>bury</hi> them, nay his <hi>own children privately</hi> in his Garden. The 2. is, That my L. Duke of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, though owned by the Irish Papists to be the Kings L. Lieutenant, and consequently representing his Sacred Majesties person, was still denied the use of so much as one <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Chappel,</hi> wherever the said Papists had the power; nay one of the <hi>Generals</hi> of the Irish PAPISTS, <hi>now living,</hi> told my L. Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant at Kilkenny, That if the King in person came into Ireland, he should not be allowed by them <hi>One Church</hi> to celebrate his <hi>Devotions</hi> in: to whom his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60274:25"/>
Grace made a return, proportionate to the disloyalty of that Declaration, and part of that return being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical, and since fulfilled, I shall here insert the words, <hi>viz. I hope to live to soe all of that mind to be without one Church in Ireland to say Mass in.</hi> By these two instances it is evident, That the direct meaning of those words, <hi>The Freedom of the Catholick Religion,</hi> is no other than the total banishing out of this Kingdom the exercize of the Religion established in it, by <hi>Truth it self,</hi> and by the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>wholsom Laws of the Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. In another part of the third Article of the said Instructions, these very words are inserted, <hi>viz. The cofederate Catholicks do intend that you let his Holiness know, their resolution to insist upon such Concessions and Agreements in matters of Religion, and for the security thereof, as his Holiness shall approve of, and be satisfied with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This palpably evinceth, that the Papists of Ireland being Subjects, or Rebels, depends wholly upon the Popes pleasure: For let his Majesty grant them what he will, yet his pretended Holiness's approbation must be the rule by which onely they will be bound. And this is made most evident by the words of the nineth Article in the said Instructions, which follow in these words, <hi>viz. In case his Holiness will not be pleased to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to such Conditions, as might be granted in matters of Religion, then you are to sollicit for considerable aids, whereby to maintain a war, and to ascertain and secure the same &amp;c.</hi> And soon after in the same nineth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, these words follow, <hi>viz. You are to make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60274:25"/>
to his Holiness for his being Protector of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and by special instance to endeavor his acceptance thereof, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Still the Pope is their King</hi>; and that he may be so almost in <hi>name</hi> as well as in <hi>power,</hi> they sollicit him by <hi>special instance</hi> to accept that <hi>Title,</hi> under which he might act that <hi>power</hi>: so that it is not the <hi>Confederate Catholicks</hi> fault, if a <hi>PROTECTOR</hi> were not in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before the <hi>Sectaries</hi> had set up one in England. Nay their Commissioners then sent to France and Spain, were required in case of the <hi>Popes refusal</hi> of being their Protector, to offer it to either of those Kings, nay to any <hi>Popish Prince,</hi> from whom (to use their own words) they might have most considerable aids. In effect, they are willing any one should go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them, but he who onely had the Right to do it. But yet as becomes obedient sons of the Church of Rome, the Pope has the advantage of the preem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
               <p>It appears the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists hang, as their Faith in God, so their Loyalty to their Prince, on the <hi>Popes</hi> sleeve; and certainly it is not probable that those should defend his Majesties Right, over whom (1) a <hi>forreign</hi> Prince, (2) such a forreign Prince as considers <hi>His Majesty</hi> as an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and consequently an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, hath full power; and (3) <hi>That power</hi> on the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est account, even that of <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1648 another Peace was concluded with the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists, but <hi>after that,</hi> they <hi>disowned, disobeyed, opposed, conspired to murther,</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60274:26"/>
and banished his <hi>Majesties Viceroy,</hi> as appears by the former instances.</p>
               <p>In sum, when the <hi>power</hi> of Ireland was in the hands of the <hi>Irish Papists,</hi> they design'd and endeavour'd to <hi>betray</hi> it to <hi>Forreigners</hi>: But when in the hands of the <hi>Protestants</hi> of Ireland, they <hi>absolutely,</hi> and without <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent conditions, submitted</hi> it and themselves to his <hi>Sacred Majesty.</hi>

               <head>As to their fighting against the Regicides,</head>
               <p>I answer, 1. <hi>Vitious extremes</hi> are not onely oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to virtue, but also <hi>one</hi> to the <hi>other; Papists</hi> and <hi>Sectaries</hi> oppose each other, and both the Protestants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> fought against the <hi>Regicides,</hi> yet neither of them in the <hi>day of Tryal,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themselves friends to his Majesties Rights.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis the <hi>Cause,</hi> not the <hi>Suffering</hi> onely, which makes the Martyr; 'tis not the fighting, but the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of the fighting, which proves which is the good Subject, and of <hi>that,</hi> let even P. W. judg by the former <hi>Instances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last Argument pretends to commutative Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and is usher'd in by a comparison and preoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
               <p>The former thrice pressed way of comparison, is yet propounded here again, but with less injustice <hi>here,</hi> than <hi>before</hi>; the comparison before was between Papists and Protestants, here between Papists and Presbyterians, Anabaptists, Quakers, Fifth Monarchy men, Independents.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:60274:26"/>To which I shall onely say, Whatever tenents op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit to <hi>Regal power</hi> may be found among any <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> are, if not <hi>learn'd from,</hi> I am sure <hi>taught by</hi> the Romish Schools. <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Sectaries</hi> like <hi>Sampsons Foxes,</hi> are tyed by their <hi>tails,</hi> though their <hi>heads</hi> be divided; their <hi>way</hi> may seem contrary, but they all tend to the same <hi>end,</hi> the ruine of the <hi>Corn-field.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As P. W. ushers in his Arguments on one side with a comparison: so on the other with a <hi>preoccupation,</hi> relating to the power of those which he calls <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,</hi> and declareth it <hi>to be no greater than his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty is pleased to make it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the truth of this Declaration the Protestants of Ireland freely consent; professing to the world, that though their Army is such, as sufficed <hi>to subdue the Irish Rebels</hi> when <hi>universally confederated</hi> throughout the Kingdom, and supplied by Forreigners with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Arms and Ammunition, and strengthen'd with no less than the <hi>Popes blessing</hi> and <hi>Nuntio</hi>: yet their power consists not in Arms or Armies, Fortifications or Men; but in <hi>loyalty and obedience</hi> to his Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Commission and Authority; and is consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as P. W. says, <hi>no greater than his Majesty is pleased to make it.</hi> And since this is the true State of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,</hi> both <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>interest,</hi> As in truth it is, even their Adversary being their Judg, 'tis likely therefore that P. W. declares they are his <hi>Adversaries,</hi> (for I believe his <hi>Friends</hi> are other guess men) But doubtless those are fittest to be <hi>trusted</hi> with <hi>power,</hi> who are no <hi>stronger by it,</hi> even by their enemies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments,

than <hi>He</hi> which <hi>gives</hi> it, is <hi>willing</hi> to make it; than <hi>those</hi> who never had power, but what they <hi>forc'd</hi> from his Majesty, and who never employ'd <hi>that power</hi> (the whole stream of their own actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Judges) but <hi>against that Sacred Majesty</hi> from whom they <hi>wrested</hi> it.</p>

               <list>

                  <item>2. The Condition of those Articles whereon they were <hi>principally,</hi> if not <hi>onely</hi> founded, hath been often and intirely violated by the Irish Papists.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Contents of those Articles are <hi>unwarrantable</hi> unless in case of <hi>necessity,</hi> because they are contrary to an higher <hi>obligation,</hi> according to the <hi>Rule</hi> both of <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>private</hi> justice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Majesty at his Coronation, binds himself to God, to govern these Kingdoms according to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Laws; and let P. W. himself consider, how agreable it is to Law or publick Justice, that the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60274:27"/>
Treasury, an Army of fifteen thousand Foot, two thousand five hundred Horse, of Irish Papists, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in effect the Legislative power it self, should be in the hands of twelve men to be chosen by Irish Papists; or that there should be no alteration in <hi>England</hi> of what they in <hi>Ireland</hi> should think fit to transmit to his Majesty for the settlement of that Kingdom; or even that the Irish Rebels should be pardoned without the consent of Parliament, when his Majesty in Parliament the seventeenth year of his Reign, <hi>adjudged</hi> such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don before conviction to be <hi>null</hi> and <hi>void</hi>; hereby even when they treated with his Majesty concerning the affairs of this Kingdom, assuming the <hi>Legislative authority of it,</hi> by repealing the Statute made the 10. of <hi>Henry</hi> the VII. (commonly called <hi>Poynings Law</hi>) and the explanatory Law thereof, in 3. and 4. of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though hitherto they <hi>chiefly</hi> pleaded before his Sacred Majesty in Council, but for <hi>so much benefit</hi> of the <hi>Articles</hi> of peace in 1648, as would <hi>restore</hi> them to their forfeited Estates: yet if they had prevailed therein, upon the score of that <hi>plea,</hi> it must in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence have <hi>adjudged</hi> for them the benefit of all the other Articles, as a <hi>right.</hi> For if <hi>any</hi> of those <hi>Articles</hi> are due to them by an obligation of <hi>Iustice, all</hi> are then due to them by the same <hi>obligation</hi>; and since, as appears by his Majesties Gracious Declaration in Council, of the 30 of November 1660. that they have no right to any of their <hi>forfeited estates,</hi> nor any title but what his Majesties mercy and bounty hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60274:28"/>
safed to diverse of them; it thence follows, That his Majesty in Council has adjudg'd, They have <hi>no right</hi> to those Articles. For as an adjudication of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majesty of their title to <hi>any one</hi> of the said <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> had entitled them to <hi>all</hi>: so an adjudication of his Majesty in Council, That they had not a <hi>right</hi> to that <hi>one</hi> they pleaded for, has adjudg'd them to have no right to <hi>any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Was not his late Majesty of glorious memory before those Articles, (1) <hi>preingaged</hi> to the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers for many of the forfeited Lands in Ireland; (2) in the strictest form of ingagement, even by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in <hi>Parliament</hi>; (3) on the account of stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctest justice, even by way of sale; (4) on the best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of sale, the end thereof being to reduce the Irish <hi>Rebels</hi>: therefore might not these Arguments which P. W. urgeth in this instance against the <hi>breach of publick Faith,</hi> be at least more appliable to <hi>this</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of his late Majesty, to his now Majesties <hi>Declaration</hi> at <hi>Breda,</hi> and his gracious Declaration of the 30. of <hi>November</hi> 1660; which were all Acts of <hi>choice, premeditation</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi>: than to those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of 1648, which was an act of <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious force.</hi> The Casuists and School-men will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily resolve P. W. that the <hi>later</hi> and <hi>lesser</hi> obligation, ought to give place to the <hi>elder</hi> and <hi>greater.</hi> But if P. W. object, that if his Majesty were under an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation <hi>preceding</hi> and <hi>opposite</hi> to theirs, why did he enter into an obligation unto them? To that I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, 1. That <hi>then</hi> it was not <hi>Res integra</hi>; for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60274:28"/>
Rebellious Subjects, even some of the <hi>Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers themselves</hi> had superinduc'd a necessity upon his Majesty, which as he could not foresee when he made his first contract: so by all the ties of natural pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, he was bound to take away, when they were brought upon him; and it could not be a breach of Faith in the King to them, who made it (as things then stood) impossible to perform it. 2. Though <hi>necessity</hi> be an <hi>unhappy plea,</hi> yet when 'tis a <hi>true,</hi> it is an <hi>allowable</hi> one. (3). That <hi>very necessity</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd his Majesty to those Articles, had they been <hi>observed</hi> by those with whom they were made, would have invited all <hi>honest Englishmen</hi> to have cheerfully waited, till by the expected fruits and effects of that <hi>Peace,</hi> his Majesty might have been enabled to have satisfied them; nay they would rather have lost their money, than his Majesty should <hi>have broken his Faith</hi> with them, that had <hi>kept</hi> it with him, and would have been so serviceable to him; besides his Majesty might have been so soon <hi>reseated</hi> in his throne, that the debts of the Crown would have been so small, &amp; his Subjects ability and affections so great; that he might and would easily have satisfied the <hi>Adventurers</hi> desires, without forfeited Land in Ireland, even by their own <hi>consent.</hi> But the breach on the Irish Papists side, has occasion'd so <hi>long</hi> and <hi>chargeable</hi> a <hi>War,</hi> that their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, together with the <hi>vast sums</hi> sent out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land into Ireland, and raised in Ireland it self, are scarse able to defray that expence, which their own <hi>viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith</hi> has engag'd the Crown in: so that it is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60274:29"/>
but just, that the <hi>Bear-skin</hi> (as far as it will go) should contribute to pay for the healing of those wounds, which the <hi>Bear</hi> it self had given. His Sacred Majesty in the 3. page of his Declaration, speaking upon these Articles, uses these very words: <hi>viz. When they who wickedly usurped the Authority in this Kingdom, had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected that odious Court, for the taking away the life of Our dear Father; no body can wonder that we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous, though upon DIFFICVLT CONDITIONS, to get such an united power of our own Subjects, as might have been able, with Gods blessing, to have prevented that infamous and horrible Parricide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these clear and Royal expressions the world may see what was the onely incentive to his Majesty, for his granting of that Peace, even no less than the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of the Murther of his blessed Father,</hi> and the bloudy consequences of it: And therefore if <hi>that</hi> were the hopeful effect of those Concessions, had they been observed on the Irish side; may not we (without too much straining) <hi>inferr,</hi> that the breach on their side, <hi>contributed</hi> to, if not <hi>acted</hi> that <hi>unparallel'd Crime.</hi> To <hi>commit</hi> the sin, and not to <hi>prevent</hi> the sin, when men have the <hi>preventative</hi> power of it, are very near <hi>ally'd,</hi> if not the same <hi>Crimes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall also here again observe, that what P. W. calls <hi>Freely putting themselves and their power into my L. Lievtenants hands</hi>; his Sacred Majesty justly marks with these observable expressions, [<hi>upon difficult Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi>;] may I not therefore from thence also well infer, That P. W's. Clients, do nothing so <hi>freely</hi> as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60274:29"/>
when they put <hi>difficult Conditions</hi> on His Majesty.</p>
               <p>Though I have said and prov'd by undeniable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, That the Irish Papists have <hi>violated</hi> and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Articles they extorted in 1648; yet because P. W's. Tenents obliges him to believe <hi>Works of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererrogation,</hi> I will gratifie him in practicing in this particular, one of his own principles, by adding far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what follows, to evince the Irish Papists have <hi>egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously</hi> broken the <hi>said Peace</hi>; the <hi>foundation</hi> of which, is the <hi>Recognition</hi> made by them of his Majesties Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and their Obligation to <hi>obey</hi> and <hi>uphold</hi> it, with their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes,</hi> which is therefore not onely inserted after the Title, as a part of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but premised to all the rest, as the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Principle</hi> of the following <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Securities,</hi> which without it, are like a Castle in the air, that has no foundation, and therefore cannot stand.</p>
               <p>Besides the 18th Article of the said <hi>Peace</hi> expresly excludes from the benefit thereof, such as should <hi>after offend.</hi> The doubt then that remains, turns on these two Hinges,
<list>
                     <item>1. Whether this <hi>Condition</hi> or <hi>Recognition</hi> were <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>By whom it was broken.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The first appears <hi>affirmatively,</hi> beyond contradiction, in the many former instances; for after the conclusion of those Articles, the Irish Papists <hi>despised, disowned, rejected, expelled, banished and excommunicated</hi> the L. <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> and <hi>all adhering to him,</hi> and in him, <hi>his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:60274:30"/>Secondly, It clearly appears, That even those who made these Articles with the Lord Lieutenant, were <hi>guilty</hi> of their <hi>Breach</hi>: For if they were <hi>not able</hi> to keep this Condition inviolable, they transgressed that duty express'd in the Recognition, and were <hi>Abusers</hi> both of His Majesties <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Service.</hi> And if they <hi>were able</hi> to keep this Condition inviolable, they are <hi>guilty</hi> for not accordingly <hi>keeping it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, These Articles were not made with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals <hi>singly</hi> consider'd, but with the then <hi>Ruling Power</hi> of the Roman Catholicks of Ireland, for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the phrase in the Title is, <hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>Articles of Peace, made and concluded with the General Assembly.</hi>] And in the Conclusion, [<hi>Signed by Sir</hi> Richard Blake <hi>Knight, in the Chair of the General Assembly, by Order, Command and unanimous Consent of the said Catholicks in full As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.</hi>] Seeing then their Ruling Power made the said Recognition, and that their Ruling Power publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the Breach thereof to the world, as is evident by their <hi>Declaration of the twelfth of August</hi> 1650. so by <hi>many other insolent violations,</hi> though His Majesties Grace and Mercy hath indulg'd to the particular act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of many Individuals, yet in relation to <hi>those Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> or an account of any <hi>Obligation in Iustice due to them,</hi> they are not to be regarded.</p>
               <p>Yet his sacred Majesties justice to, and tenderness of the said Irish Papists has abundantly appeared, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his having in person still heard them upon the said Articles of Peace, but also in giving them near 2 years time to prove all they pleaded, and so long left the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60274:30"/>
Kingdom unsettled, that they might be fully heard in all their Allegations; nay, even by his giving <hi>Them</hi> a liberty which <hi>never</hi> yet was given to <hi>any,</hi> even a free sight of the Bill of Settlement, which was humbly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to Him by the Lords Justices and Council, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant to <hi>Poynings</hi> Law, and a full liberty to make all the objections they could against it; which yet they have been so far from acknowledging as an effect of his Royal Care and Indulgence, that in all their Answers (which I have diligently perused) I do not find so much as a <hi>bare taking notice</hi> of that <hi>unpresidented Favour.</hi> But possibly since by that Indulgence their guilt has been but the more evidenced, they <hi>untruly</hi> consider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of that mercy to be, what <hi>only</hi> was intended in the extending of it, and therefore were loth to pay his Majesty <hi>thanks</hi> for what has but more discover'd their Crimes. But yet this is but proportionate to the rest of their proceedings: for since they call his sacred Majesties mercy an <hi>injustice,</hi> they may at the same rate decline <hi>paying Acknowledgments</hi> for his condescentions to them.</p>
               <p>Having thus proved that the <hi>Peace was broken by the Irish Papists after it was made,</hi> I shall now say something to prove that <hi>it was DESIGNEDLY broken BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE IT WAS MADE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If by a previous <hi>Ingagement</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> the Irish Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists confirmed their first confederacie not to be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Peace which then they seemingly pursued. If they combin'd to make themselves <hi>IVDGES</hi> of his Majesties Actions, and to <hi>appeal to themselves</hi> upon
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60274:31"/>
every Occurrence that they should be inclinable to misinterpret; notwithstanding their Protestations of obedience to his Majesties Authority, then I conceive the whole peace thereby is on their part made <hi>void</hi> and <hi>null.</hi> But that they did so, is <hi>clearly evident,</hi> and that by an <hi>OATH solemnly taken</hi> (not by <hi>private</hi> men, or a factious party, but) by all the <hi>Prelates, Noblemen,</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that were the <hi>Grand Committee,</hi> upon concluding the said <hi>Peace,</hi> That in case of non-perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Articles thereof, (that is to say, If all the particulars therein were not carried on according to their liking) they were to continue the <hi>Association</hi> and <hi>Vnion</hi> of <hi>Confederate Catholicks,</hi> and to do <hi>ALL Acts preservative thereunto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this place it seems to me requisite to let the Reader know what that <hi>Vnion and Association of the Confederate Catholicks</hi> was, which they swear to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi>; which I shall instane in somce particulars, out of their own Originals now remaining on Record.</p>
               <p>In the first Roll they swear in these very words, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>In this their first <hi>Confederacie Oath,</hi> they swear <hi>flat</hi> and <hi>known contradictions</hi>: for they swear to <hi>bear true Faith and Allegiance to the King,</hi> and with the same breath they swear they <hi>will obey and ratifie all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Decrees made and to be made by their supreme Council,</hi> who had then actually cast off the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and set up a Government in opposition to his Majesties. It had sure been at least enough to swear to obey and ratifie all Orders and Decrees they had made, without increasing that guilt by the high acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of swearing to obey and ratifie all to be made by the Supreme Council. Herein they show, what the POPE is to them in <hi>Spirituals,</hi> their <hi>Supreme Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> is in <hi>Temporals,</hi> whom they obey with <hi>a blinde</hi> and <hi>implicite Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They swear also <hi>to maintain the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom,</hi> and in the same breath they swear <hi>to maintain the free exercise of the Roman Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which is expresly against Law; as it is, that any should govern the Kingdom, but by his Majesties Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; which they <hi>assumed</hi> and <hi>usurped</hi> in all the <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi> of it: nay not onely the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those Laws they swear to maintain; but even the <hi>taking</hi> or <hi>imposing</hi> of <hi>any Oath</hi> which by Law is not warranted, is a violation of the Laws: But they are so far from <hi>owning</hi> these their <hi>Crimes,</hi> that they swear
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60274:32"/>
                  <hi>they will not seek or receive directly or indirectly any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or protection for any thing done or to be done, touch-this General Cause,</hi> &amp;c. They can be content to seek and receive a Pardon from the POPE for sins to come, but they <hi>swear</hi> they neither will seek or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>indirectly</hi> a <hi>Pardon</hi> for, nay not so much as a <hi>Protection</hi> from his Majesty, for sins <hi>past,</hi> without the consent of their Supreme Council. This is a fine <hi>bearing Faith and Allegiance to the King,</hi> this is a good <hi>upholding and maintaining the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom.</hi> They swear too, that <hi>these Acts of highest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, they will to the hazard of their Lives, and Estates assist, prosecute, and maintain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they proceed further, for they swear <hi>not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of, or submit to</hi> ANY PEACE <hi>made or to be made without the consent and approbation of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly of the said Catholicks:</hi> ANY PEACE, that is, let the <hi>Conditions</hi> be never so <hi>good,</hi> let the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> that grants them be <hi>the King Himself,</hi> they will not accept of it, they will not submit unto it, without, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the King would so far forget those signal <hi>Crimes</hi> which made them <hi>need</hi> his <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Protection,</hi> and would not so much as name them, but make a <hi>Peace</hi> with them, as if they had never done <hi>any offence,</hi> yet they swear, that not <hi>one of them</hi> shall accept of, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to such a Peace, but as is before expressed; nay, to show how perfect a ROMISH <hi>Confederacie</hi> it is, if any Individual should be struck with the horrour of his Crimes, he cannot fly to the Kings <hi>Mercy</hi> for <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> or <hi>Protection,</hi> without Perjury: And to inveagle
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60274:33"/>
such as had not <hi>then</hi> been polluted with those sins, they swear to protect all such as shall enter into their guilt; and thereby in consequence threaten to <hi>ruine</hi> such as shall not: This is admirable bearing true Faith and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to the King, and maintaining the Laws of the Kingdom!</p>
               <p>But this is not all, for they further swear in these words, <hi>viz. For the preservation and strengthening of the Vnion of the Kingdom upon any peace to be made or concluded with the said confederate Catholicks as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, They will to the uttermost of their Power, insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and maintain the ensuing Propositions, until a peace as aforesaid be made, and the matters to be agreed upon in the Articles of peace be established and secured by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first Proposition to which this Oath relates, and to which it is annexed, is expressed in these words, <hi>viz. That the Roman Catholicks both Clergy and Laity in their several capacities have the free and publick exercise of the Roman Catholick Religion and Function throughout the Kingdom, in as full lustre and splendor as it was in the Reign of King</hi> Henry <hi>the Seventh, or other Catholick King his Predecessours, Kings of</hi> England <hi>and Lords of</hi> Ireland, <hi>or in</hi> England.</p>
               <p>That is to say, That none should be admitted to live in <hi>Ireland</hi> but Papists: for <hi>none</hi> or <hi>very few</hi> but such; were in the Reign of those Kings in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second Proposition mentioned, follows in these words, viz. <hi>That the secular Clergy of</hi> Ireland, <hi>viz. Primates, Archbishops, Ordinaries, Deans, Deans and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60274:33"/>
Chapters, Archdeacons, Prebendaries, and all other Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries, Parsons, Vicars, and all persons of the secular Clergy, and their respective successours, shall have and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all, and all manner of Iurisdictions, Priviledges and Immunities in as full and ample manner as the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks secular Clergy had or enjoyed the same within this Realm, at any time during the Reign of the late King</hi> Henry <hi>the Seventh, sometime King of</hi> England, <hi>and Lord of</hi> Ireland, <hi>any Law, Declaration of Law, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, Power, or Authority whatever, to the contrary not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is to say, Their <hi>Wills</hi> must be the <hi>Law</hi>; and since they think fit to set up POPERY in Ireland, and to banish the true Religion out of it, it is but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite they should take the maintenance from the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> and give it to the <hi>Titular Clergy.</hi> And least we should doubt this to be the true meaning of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Proposal, they clearly explain it in the fourth, which follows in these words, viz. <hi>That the Primates, Archbishops, Bishops, Ordinaries, Deans, Deans and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Archdeacons, Chancelours, Treasurers, Chaunters, Provosts, Wardens of Collegiate Churches, Prebendaries and other Dignitaries, Parsons, Vicars, and other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of the Roman Catholick secular Clergy, and their respective successors, shall have, hold enjoy all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Church-Livings, in as large and ample manner, as the</hi> LATE PROTESTANT CLERGY <hi>respectively enjoyed the same, on the first day of</hi> October <hi>in the year of our Lord</hi> 1641. <hi>together with all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, emoluments, perquisites, liberties, and the rights of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60274:34"/>
their respective Sees, and Churches belonging; as well in places now in possession of the Confederate Catholicks, as also in all other places that shall be recovered by the said Confederate Catholicks from the adverse Party, within the Kingdom,</hi> SAVING <hi>to the said Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Laity their Rights, according to the Laws of the Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is to say, Our Clergy shall have <hi>All,</hi> therefore yours can have <hi>nothing</hi>; this is a perfect Fifth-Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy Principle, for here Dominion is onely founded in pretended Grace, none being to have the benefit of the Laws of the Land, but the Papists. Nay, his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majesty, because a PROTESTANT, is <hi>as such,</hi> denied <hi>any one</hi> of those Rights, which the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of the Irish Rebels, because a PAPIST, is to enjoy, as such; and lest their <hi>words</hi> for it should not be taken, they confirm it with an OATH. The <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Orthodox Clergy of Ireland</hi> may see in this, what <hi>goodly Provision</hi> had been made for them, and their respective <hi>Successours,</hi> if this <hi>pious Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Confederacy</hi> had succeeded.</p>
               <p>But least this their first Oath of Confederacie might be thought a thing they were <hi>surprized</hi> into, in the first <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>fury</hi> of the Rebellion; and least the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it should forget what the Imposers of it would have them believe they were bound unto by it; some time after, <hi>premeditately,</hi> and <hi>in cool blood,</hi> they caus'd it a second time to be taken <hi>in terminis,</hi> and subscribed with a preamble to it, the close whereof, runs in these Words, viz. <hi>And for that it is requisite that there should
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60274:34"/>
be an unanimous consent and real union between all the Catholicks of this Realm, to maintain the premises and strengthen them against their adversaries, it is thought fit by them, that they, and whosoever shall adhere unto their party, as a Confederate, should for their better assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their adhering fidelity and constancy to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cause, take the ensuing Oath</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz. <hi>I A. B.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the begining of the said Preamble, they give the priority and precedency of place to the <hi>Defence of their own Estates and Liberties,</hi> to that of the defence of his Majesties Regal Power, Prerogatives, Honour, State, and Rights; That is to say, They will mind <hi>themselves</hi> before the <hi>King,</hi> which they fully explain in the third Oath of their Union and Confederacie, which after their rejection of the Peace concluded with them by his Majesties Authority, they entered into, took and subscribed, and which follows in these words, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I do swear and protest that I will adhere to the present Vnion of the Confederate Roman Catholicks that</hi> REJE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTED THE PEACE <hi>lately agreed and proclaimed at Dublin; and do nothing by Word or Deed, Writing, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or otherwise, to the prejudice of that Vnion, and will to the uttermost of my power, advance and further the good and preservation of it, and of his Majesties Rights, and the priviledges of free born Subjects to the Natives of this Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two former Oaths seem to them to be onely the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60274:35"/>
THEORY of Rebellion, and they were loth to <hi>stop there,</hi> therefore they proceed in this third Oath, to the PRACTISE of it. In the first and second Oath, they swear <hi>they will obey and ratifie all the Orders and Decrees made, and to be made by the Supreme Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Confederate Catholicks</hi>; and in this third Oath, they very abundantly observe what they swore in the two precedent ones; but although in both those they swore as positively, I am sure much more justly <hi>(though not justifiably) du rig their Lives to bear true Faith and Allegiance to the King,</hi> and though that just part of the Oath hath the priority of place, in both Oaths, yet the priority of obedience, when it came in competition which should be most binding, viz. either those parts which related to their <hi>obedience to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> or those which related to their <hi>obedience to their General Assembly,</hi> they <hi>practically interpret</hi> it <hi>for,</hi> and <hi>adjudge</hi> it <hi>to</hi> the latter.</p>
               <p>In their two first Oaths, they swear <hi>they will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of, or submit unto any Peace made or to be made with the said confederate Catholicks, without the consent and approbation of their General Assembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But either this <hi>Peace</hi> which they swear to <hi>reject,</hi> was made with the <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>approbation</hi> of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assembly, or <hi>without</hi> their <hi>consent</hi> or <hi>approbation:</hi> If the <hi>latter,</hi> how can the Generality of the Irish Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists plead for the benefit of what their Governing Power was against; If the <hi>former,</hi> then against their two preceding Oaths, they reject that Peace which by their General Assembly's consent and approbation had
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60274:35"/>
been concluded, and which (at least by a strong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication) they were sworn to observe. I know of no Oath of theirs which bound them to more then not to accept of peace from his Majesty without the <hi>consent and approbation of their General Assembly,</hi> till this third was taken and subscribed. When they are not guilty enough by <hi>old Oaths,</hi> they will make themselves guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough by entering into <hi>new Oaths.</hi> Doubtless the guilt of two solemn Oaths, not to make peace with their King, without the approbation and consent of their own fellow Subjects, even of their own setting up, and that too, as one of the products of a bloody Rebellion, was guilt enough; but in their third Oath, they proceed farther, and reject that peace which even <hi>themselves</hi> had <hi>sollicited,</hi> and which was highly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for them, onely because the HEADS of the <hi>Catholick Confederacie</hi> had then hopes of getting <hi>more</hi> from the King (whose condition then began to decline) by <hi>Rebellion,</hi> then by <hi>Peace.</hi> Nay, that which their <hi>two former Oaths</hi> did <hi>not oblige them unto,</hi> viz. <hi>To reject a Peace made with his Majesty when</hi> CONSENTED TO, <hi>and</hi> APPROVED BY <hi>their General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, They</hi> SWEAR TO OBSERVE; and that which their two former Oaths obliged them unto, viz. <hi>During their lives to bear true Faith and Allegiance to the King, they</hi> WILL NOT OBSERVE, though the rate of that crime amounts to no less then to a <hi>double,</hi> if not a <hi>treble Perjury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must here acquaint the Reader, That this third Oath of <hi>Vnion</hi> and <hi>Confederacie,</hi> whereby they reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60274:36"/>
the Peace, is, as the two former Oaths, without a date in its Original now on Record; possibly it was their intention thereby to insinuate to the people, that the Ingagement they entered into, was a duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on them from the <hi>first,</hi> and was to have no <hi>end.</hi> But if P. W. should say that this Oath had onely refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the rejected Peace in <hi>Anno</hi> 1646. I will onely answer, The same <hi>Inferences</hi> are of the same force in reference to the rejected Peace in <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. and therefore if they be not rightly applied as to the <hi>time,</hi> yet they be as to the <hi>thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly no written wickedness can ascend higher then in that same Oath, in which they swear to reject, and actually do reject his Majesties Authority, when cloathed with peace, even a peace of their own seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and highly advantagious to them, they also swear <hi>to preserve his Majesties Rights.</hi> I can finde no consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stencie in the said Oath, unless they mean it to be <hi>his Majesties Right,</hi> to be governed and used according to the pleasure <hi>of the Roman Catholick Vnion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy</hi>; nor can I tell what they mean <hi>by preserving the Priviledges of free-born Subjects to the Natives of this Kingdom,</hi> unless thereby they mean, that those <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> are <hi>parramount</hi> to his Majesties Authority, and they the onely Judges and Preservers of them.</p>
               <p>But because the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> endeavour to extenuate the sins of entring into their first and second Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracie-Oath, by pleading that their ingagements in them were but temporary, and were not to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, but as they should be <hi>established and secured by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60274:36"/>
I think it necessary least by that specious pretence the Reader might be deluded, to set down here how they designed that Parliament should be constituted: which I shall do out of the Original of their Instructions remaining in my hands.</p>
               <p>The Title of those Instructions is, viz. <hi>Instructions for the Lord Viscount Mountgarret, Lord President of our Council, &amp;c. And the rest of the Commissioners imployed by the General Assembly of his Majesties most faithful and dutiful Subjects, the Confederate Catholicks of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Kingdom of Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>unto the Lord Marquess of Ormond, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The words of the 22. Article of these Instructions, are these, viz. <hi>You are to be Suitors to his Majesty to have a Parliament helden before the Lord Marquess of Ormond, or a</hi> CATHOLICK, <hi>or a</hi> NATIVE <hi>well-affected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doubt if these Commissioners had not been imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately imployed to the then Lord Marquess of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> (now Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi>) they would scarcely have named him to be the person before whom the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Parliament should have been holden; for since even while they made a direct address to his Lordship, they had the presumption to add, viz. <hi>Or a Catholick, or a Native well-affected,</hi> if his Grace were not to have seen what they desired, they would not have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Him.</hi> And the truth of this appears clearly in the Paper intituled, <hi>The sence of the Congregation of the Clergy upon the Instructions presented to them, to be given the Agents to be now employed to France. Dated the</hi> 21 <hi>of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60274:37"/>
December</hi> 1647. wherein to use their own words, they say, viz. <hi>We offer the ensuing Articles, which we desire may be drawn up into Instructions with the rest, to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the said Agents, with Order to insist on them, and in no sort to recede from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first of those Instructions are in these words, viz. <hi>First, that an Instruction be given the said Agents for getting the Lord Deputy, or other chief Governour or Governours of this Kingdom to be</hi> A ROMAN CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOLICK.</p>
               <p>In this the Reader may evidently find, though when the Irish Papists make Addresses to the Lord of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> they are so discreet as to name Him for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son before whom the Parliament shall be holden, yet when they may write what he is not to see, they abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely leave Him out, and desire that the Parliament may be holden before <hi>a chief Governour that is a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick,</hi> with this addition, viz. AND IN NO SORT TO RECEDE FROM THIS INSTRUCTION.</p>
               <p>The second Particular which the said Congregation of the Clergy desire may be added to the Instructions to be given to their Agents, then designed to be sent to the Queen and Prince, then in France, and <hi>which they are to</hi> INSIST UPON, <hi>and</hi> IN NO SORT <hi>to recede from,</hi> is express'd in these very words, viz. 2<hi>d. Instruction. That the particular Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or Concessions to be obtained for Religion, may be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished together with the Temporal Articles; and that until both be published together,</hi> THE PEACE MAY
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60274:37"/>
NOT OBLIGE NOR BE ACCEPTED BY THE CONFEDERATE ROMAN CATHOLICKS: And that the QUEEN NOR PRINCE come not to this Kingdom till the Peace be published as aforesaid, and accepted by the Nation.</p>
               <p>By this it undoubtedly appears that no peace would be accepted of by the Irish Papists, but such a one as even by the Royal Assent, was to give them the whole Kingdom in <hi>Fact</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> if not in name: Nor was the QUEEN and PRINCE, his now Majesty, so much as to come into <hi>Ireland,</hi> till <hi>Ireland</hi> was in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect given away to the Crown.</p>
               <p>Although this Paper intituled <hi>The sense of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Clergy,</hi> have many Particulars as full of Disloyalty and Rebellion, as those I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, yet I shall set down no more but the seventh Paragraph, which they desire may be past into an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; which follows in these words, viz. <hi>That if a</hi> PROTECTOR <hi>must be chosen for the Nation, it may be his</hi> HOLINESS. <hi>And that the Nation may not by choosing</hi> Spain <hi>or</hi> France <hi>for Protector, be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to make the other of them not chosen their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my abroad, and thereby rend the Kingdom at home into division.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This in my opinion evinceth, that as bad as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist Clergy in <hi>Ireland</hi> were, yet <hi>the Original design of choosing a</hi> PROTECTOR <hi>was the Act of the</hi> LAY PAPISTS, but indeed when a forraign Protector was <hi>resolved</hi> upon, the <hi>Popish Clergy</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60274:38"/>
true Sons of the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> were singly for the Popes having the Protectorship, and fortifie that their desire with a very material and politick conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, if not threatning, viz. That unless it were so, <hi>it might rend the Kingdom into Divisions.</hi> But I desire the Reader woul observe that rending of the Kingdom would not have proceeded from the casting off of his Majesties Authority, but from the PAPAL, FRENCH AND SPANISH FACTIONS, who would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Soveraignty of this Kingdom: But not so much as the least word mentioned that the Kingdom would have been rent by the resistance of any party in his Majesties behalf: Though three forraign Powers would have found Friends to have countenanced their respective designes, yet his Majesties lawful Right could not find any numerous <hi>Assertors of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus done with the Paper intituled <hi>The sense of the Congregation,</hi> I shall now proceed to acquaint the Reader with the residue of those Instructions, which will let him plainly see how they projected that Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament should be constituted which was to establish and secure the Articles of Peace insisted on. One of which I have already particularized, and now shall proceed to the rest.</p>
               <p>The 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Instruction is set down in these words, viz. <hi>You are to be Suitors to his Majesty, that all Indictments, Out-Lawries, Attainders, and other Acts, made, published, or done, in the Courts of Dublin, or elsewhere in this Kingdom, or the Kingdom of England, in prejudice of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60274:38"/>
said Catholicks, or any of them, since the seventh day of August</hi> 1641. <hi>shall be before he sitting of the Parliament here, taken off the file, and vacated; and so declared by his Majesties publick Proclamation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a good preparation for composing a fit Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for the ends of the <hi>Confederate Catholicks.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did <hi>any thing for the King,</hi> they press the King would by a Proclamation vacat the legal proceedings of the Court of Justice. They desire to be put in a capacity to act <hi>new crimes,</hi> by a forgiveness of the <hi>old.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Instruction runs in these words, viz. <hi>You are to be humble Suitors to his Majesty, That such as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready employed or appoynted, or that shall now be appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to execute the Office of Sheriff by our party, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Counties of the Kingdom shall stand: and the said Offices to be conferred upon them by Letters Patents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though the Sheriffs of <hi>Ireland</hi> are pricked by the chief Governour or Governours of this Kingdom, yet they will themselves name those Sheriffs, that thereby they might be in a condition to be sure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Knights of the Shires for their intended Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament should be Roman Catholick Confederacie-Men.</p>
               <p>The close of the 26 Instruction is in these words, <hi>You are to procure that no new Corporations shall send Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses to Parliament, without the allowance of Parliament first had.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Instruction runs in these words, viz. <hi>You are desire that such Corporations as anciently sent Burgesses to the Parliament, be now admitted, notwithstanding that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60274:39"/>
by the power of some late Governours, they were of later days debar'd of this priviledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By these three Instructions the Reader may see how well they would have constituted the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for the Catholick Confederacie; first, Sheriffs who are to be Judges of the Elections of the Knights of the Shires they would nominate, and have his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty commissionate by Letters Patents. Secondly, some old Burroughs who had scarce an Inhabitant in them, and who therefore for several preceding Parliaments had no Writs sent unto them to make Elections, they desire now may send Burgesses to their intended Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: And Burroughs who are by the Kings Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to send Burgesses to Parliament, and who are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merously planted with Protestants, were to send none to serve for them in Parliament.</p>
               <p>Thus far the Confederates had well provided for themselves in the constitution of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, now I shall let the Reader see that their care was no less in the constitution of the House of Lords: For the 23 Instruction is in these words, viz. <hi>That no Lord not estated in this Kingdom, or estated in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and not resident here, shall have vote in the said Parliament of this Realm, by PROXY or OTHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WISE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King is the Fountain of Honour; but here the Confederate Catholicks will stop the Stream of it; as they think sit; voting by Proxy, which is the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Right of the Peers, they will not admit; and those Peers who by the Rebellion of the Confederates
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60274:39"/>
were expelled out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> must be denied their Rights, even when a peace is concluded; Nay possibly those Peers might not be considered as estated Lords, whose Estates the said Confederates had possest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of; so that by the Acts of the Rebellion they were to lose their Lands, and by the Desires of the Rebels to lose their Votes: And perhaps if Protestant Peers which the Rebellion had forc'd into <hi>England</hi> would have returned into <hi>Ireland</hi> to vote in this intended Parliament, they might (had this Instruction took place) been denied to vote in Person, as well as by Proxy, on account that they were not estated persons by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son their Lands were then in the possession of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, who had taken good care <hi>that the Peace should not oblige, nor be accepted by the confederate Catholicks, till all the Articles of it were established &amp; secured by Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Confederates rest not here, but to make all things surer, the 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Instruction is set down in these words, viz. <hi>That such as shall be recommended by the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Council of the Confederate Catholicks, shall be by his Majesty called by Writ to sit in the Vpper House.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Instruction before mentioned, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to hinder the constitution of the House of Peers to be as by Law and Custom it ought to be; and in this 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Instruction they attempt to constitute it as it ought not to be. In the foregoing Instruction they endeavor to stop the <hi>true Fountain of Honour,</hi> and in this Instruction they would make themselves to <hi>be the Fountain of Honour.</hi> Nor does this Instruction run with the introductive words of the former, viz. <hi>You are
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60274:40"/>
to be Suitors, or humble Suitors to his Majesty,</hi> but posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively set down, as if what they demanded were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Right,</hi> then a <hi>Favour</hi>; neither do they limit their recommendation of such as are to be called to sit in the Upper House, to such onely as were his Majesties <hi>Subjects,</hi> or <hi>his Rebels,</hi> but indefinitely, <hi>viz. all that shall be recommended by the Supreme Council of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Catholicks</hi>; so that the forming of the House of Peers, the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>inseparable Right and Prerogative of the Crown,</hi> they not onely desire to <hi>WREST</hi> from the <hi>King,</hi> but also they desire to <hi>VEST IT IN THEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELVES</hi>: Nor do they stop there, but by this Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (had it been granted) they would have had the power to have constituted the House of Lords OF FORRAIGNERS, and doubtless amongst those, his HOLINESS's NUNTIO, then amongst them, <hi>would scarcely have been forgotten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far the Catholick Confederacie had well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the composition of the House of Commons and the House of Peers, as far as concern'd the <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lords</hi>; Now I shall let the Reader see that their care was no less in providing that the House of Peers should be as well constituted for the <hi>Spiritual Lords,</hi> which they manifest in their 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Instruction, which follows in these very words, viz. <hi>You are to be Suitors to his Majesty, that the Writs of summons be issued to the ARCHBISHOPS AND BISHOPS WITH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IN OVR QVARTERS,</hi> and they to have <hi>PLACE AND VOTE in Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a <hi>Request INDEED,</hi> here is not onely a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60274:40"/>
taking away of the Right of the Protestant Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops and Bishops, but a giving of it to the Papists: Nay, would not this have been (if granted) an owning that the POPE by his Consecration had the Right to send Peers into the House of Lords, if not to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them. But since they were sworn by their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy <hi>to have the free and publick exercise of the Roman Catholick Religion and Function throughout this Kingdom in its full lustre and splendor, as it was in the Reign of King</hi> Henry <hi>the seventh, or any other Catholick King his Predecessor, Kings of</hi> England <hi>and Lords of</hi> Ireland, 'tis no wonder they take the surest <hi>Ways</hi> to reach that <hi>End.</hi> But yet the wisdom of the <hi>Kings of England,</hi> and their experience of the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> has been such, that had all these <hi>Instructions</hi> been granted to them, yet they could not have reach'd their Design, which the said <hi>Papists</hi> well knew, and therefore to <hi>throw down ALL Impediments,</hi> in their 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Instruction, which follows in these very words, they further desire, viz. <hi>You are to be Suitors to his Majesty, That upon the first sitting of the next Parliament, That an Act may be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for the suspension of</hi> POYNINGS HIS ACT, <hi>intituled, An Act that no Parliament shall be holden in this Land, until the Acts be certified into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and all other Acts inlarging or explaining the same. And that it be afterwards left to the consideration of the Parliament, whether the same shall be ALL TOGETHER REPEALED or continued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these Instructions the Confederates show a <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Care</hi> of the <hi>Roman Catholick Cause</hi>: They were
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60274:41"/>
not contented to attempt <hi>by force</hi> and <hi>open Rebellion</hi> to <hi>wrest</hi> this <hi>Kingdom</hi> from the <hi>Crown of England,</hi> but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving failed thereof in that way, they endeavour to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it in this: first they will have a PAPIST <hi>chief Governour,</hi> and that (to use their own words) the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi> must not onely INSIST UPON, but must IN NO SORT RECEDE FROM; Then they must have a Parliament, and that not onely to be constituted <hi>against the Kings undoubted preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the known</hi> and <hi>ancient Laws of the Land, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Rights of both Houses,</hi> but also must be <hi>compos'd</hi> according to the <hi>desires</hi> and <hi>inventions of the Irish Papists</hi>: and because by <hi>Poynings</hi>'s Act no <hi>Bill</hi> or <hi>Bills</hi> could be transmitted into <hi>England</hi> till first they had past the chief <hi>Governour or Governours and privy Council of this Kingdom,</hi> and then were certified to <hi>his Majesty and privy Council in England, by the said chief Governor or Governors, and privy Council</hi> to be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>expedient</hi> for this Kingdom, and then were not to pass in Parliament here, but as <hi>approved of by his Majesty and Council in England, and remitted hither under the Great Seal of England</hi>; whereby the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was wisely secured that nothing should be enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here to the prejudice of it: The said Irish Papists desire that in their said next Parliament <hi>Poynings</hi>'s Act might be suspended, and all other Acts enlarging and explaining the same; and then that <hi>it may be left to the consideration of the Parliament,</hi> SO CONSTITUTED, whether the same shall be ALTOGETHER RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEALED, or continued; that is to say, That the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60274:41"/>
LAMB be put into the Claws of the WOLF, and then leave it to the <hi>consideration of the Wolf</hi> whether or no he would <hi>devour him.</hi> If it should be said, That the fore-mentioned Instructions were onely the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates desires to his Majesty; I onely desire to know whether they made those desires with an intention to have them <hi>denyed</hi> or <hi>granted:</hi> If the first it was <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,</hi> if the last it was <hi>rebellious.</hi> But by all this it undeniably appears, <hi>If the providence of God, and His Sacred Majesties Wisdom and Care had not disappointed the boundless designes of the said Irish Papists,</hi> not onely <hi>the Protestant Religion and the Professors of it in Ireland</hi> had been LOST, but also this Kingdom had been LOST <hi>to the Crown of England,</hi> for the said Irish Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists were to have held what they then rebelliously possest till their Articles of Peace had been establish'd and secured by Parliament, and if they could have had a Parliament <hi>such as they designed,</hi> all the Kingdom would in effect have been theirs by <hi>Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; so that either way they had secured themselves as much as their CONFEDERATED WISDOMS could project.</p>
               <p>But since the most essential parts of the Articles of Peace were to be finally obliging but as they were to be confirm'd by Act of Parliament in the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which should be assembled after the perfecting the said Articles; let P. W. remember this present Parliament is the first that has been call'd together in <hi>Ireland</hi> since the conclusion of the Peace, and let him see in the GREAT BILL OF SETTLEMENT how far
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60274:42"/>
the Parliament thinks fit to put their <hi>sanction</hi> to those <hi>Articles.</hi> If P. W. should say, <hi>This is not such a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as his Countrymen intended at and before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of those Articles</hi>; I shall joyn with him in his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, and shall onely add, That GOD AND HIS SACRED MAJESTY <hi>be praised, it is not such a Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must desire the Readers excuse for these <hi>digression<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> which I thought necessary, that he might the better know, <hi>even out of the Originals of the Papers of the Irish Papists,</hi> what kinde of Parliament that was, by which they had designed to <hi>establish and secure the Articles of their Peace,</hi> as also what <hi>that Association and Vnion of the Confederate Roman Catholicks</hi> is, which their Grand Committee <hi>swore</hi> to <hi>continue,</hi> and <hi>to return unto</hi> upon the concluding of the Peace in 1648. in case <hi>they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves judged the Articles thereof at any time unobserved unto them.</hi> I wish the said <hi>Irish Papists</hi> think not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves TO THIS DAY <hi>bound by it</hi>; nay; I wish they do not think it INDISSOLVEABLE.</p>
               <p>This horrid Oath of the Grand Committee before-mentioned, is <hi>now</hi> so <hi>undeniable,</hi> (though it was <hi>then</hi> manag'd in the <hi>dark,</hi> and carried on with all possible <hi>secreeie</hi>) that it was by all their <hi>Titular Bishops</hi> in their published <hi>Excommunications against the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, interpreted</hi> and <hi>insisted on,</hi> as a most <hi>CONSCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENTIOVS engagement to invite all their Nation to a disobedience of his Majesties Authority</hi>; whereby they

have not onely argued themselves guilty of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>unworthiness</hi> and <hi>treachery,</hi> men could possibly be faulty in; they have not onely <hi>forfeited</hi> all that Grace and Favour which could be intended them by that Peace, and <hi>invalidated all the Articles of it</hi>; but they have likewise continu'd to themselves the guilt of their <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Confederacie</hi> to this present DAY, and lie <hi>obnoxious</hi> to the <hi>utmost penalty</hi> of the Law for the same, unless his Majesties Mercy be greater then their Crimes; and consequently P.

               <p>First P. W. tells us <hi>that the hearts of the Irish Papists would by such proceedings be estranged from his Majesty</hi>: The <hi>sense</hi> whereof is, that the <hi>Irish</hi> will follow the King for nought but the LOAVES; nay, it had been happy for <hi>Ireland</hi> if the very <hi>Loaves</hi> themselves would have prevented their <hi>hearts from being estranged</hi>; but 'tis <hi>morally</hi> impossible while such a <hi>National</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gional distinction continues:</hi> The experience of the last <hi>Rebellion,</hi> if no other proof thereof had been, evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the <hi>estrangedness</hi> of the Irish Papists to be such, that the <hi>Interest in them</hi> of the <hi>greatest Nobleman in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> when <hi>for the Crown,</hi> is not so <hi>considerable,</hi> as a <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60274:43"/>
priests against it.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>estrangedness</hi> P. W. mentions must still be expected, but with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, That the BEAST if <hi>pamper'd,</hi> will <hi>Kick,</hi> if kept <hi>low,</hi> OBEY.</p>
               <p>Secondly, P. W. fore-tells <hi>that the Iudicious Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants will on such proceedings be perpeturlly jealous, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding any Declaration from Breda, or Acts from Westminster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though P. W. may be a true <hi>Seer</hi> of the estranged hearts of the <hi>Irish papists,</hi> yet I dare charge him to be a <hi>false Prophet</hi> concerning <hi>judicious protestants</hi>; for though they duly value his Majesties <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Acts of Grace,</hi> as signal <hi>Expresses</hi> of his Goodness; yet their confidence rests on the <hi>inward principle in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Brest,</hi> whereto without such <hi>Expresses,</hi> or <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling, or capitulating for such</hi> (as the <hi>Irish papists</hi> did) they <hi>freely</hi> submitted, and are <hi>more confirm'd</hi> by their <hi>late experience</hi> to continue in that <hi>duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if in P. W's judgement the ungrounded appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of any violation or breach of promise may <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange</hi> the hearts of the <hi>Irish papists</hi> from his Majesty, whom they are bound in conscience to <hi>love, honour</hi> and <hi>obey,</hi> notwithstanding <hi>miscarriages in Government</hi>; and if the like apprehensions may cause jealousies in <hi>judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous protestants</hi> notwithstanding <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> let it not seem <hi>strange</hi> or <hi>hard</hi> (at least to P. W. and his Countrymen) if a continued Series of <hi>Covenant-Breaches, Rapines, Murthers, Massacres, Crueltys, Perfidies, Treasons</hi> and <hi>Rebellions</hi> exercised by the <hi>Irish papists</hi> against the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>protestant Religion,</hi> raise
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60274:43"/>
                  <hi>jealousies</hi> in the hearts of all judicious Protestants. Or if his Majesty be pleas'd on these <hi>accompts</hi> in his great <hi>Iustice, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodnsss</hi> to <hi>restrain</hi> them from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ruining others first, and then themselves.</p>
               <p>The Crown hath often lost by Credulity what it hath got by Valour; it hath lost by pretence of Peace what it had gain'd in open War: The Kings interest in <hi>France</hi> was thus lost, the GOD of peace prevent the like in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The consequence threatned in respect of God, are dreadful judgements, such as P. W. confesseth <hi>to have bin wonderfully inflicted on the Irish Nation for their breach of the peace in</hi> 1646. <hi>and such as were inflicted on Sauls house for his breach with the Gibeonites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I see the best <hi>Wits</hi> have not always the best <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> else P. W. would have remembred the breach made by his Nation in 1641. and since 1648. as well as in 1646. for <hi>those</hi> doubtless were as criminal as <hi>this:</hi> but possibly he thinks it was more <hi>sin for his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to <hi>violate</hi> what they oblig'd themselves to as a FREE STATE, then what they were oblig'd to do as SUBJECTS; and therefore thinks their sins in 1646. were greater then in 1641.</p>
               <p>But if all were pardoned by the peace made in 1648. why does he remember the Judgements for the breaches in 1646? if he thinks all were not, why does he not remember the breaches made in 1641. and at least attribute some of those Judgements to that breach?</p>
               <p>But I had almost forgot what perhaps P. W. may
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60274:44"/>
plead in answer to my Objection, and that is no less then the POPE's BULL of indulgence and pardon published in Latin in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and thus carefully (for so much of it as follows) translated into English.</p>

W. should say that it <hi>is</hi> an answer to my Question, then I desire the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byass'd Reader to consider whose Subjects the <hi>Irish pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> are: For His late Majesty of Glorious Memory under His Great Seal declares in these very words, viz. <hi>We do extremely detest the ODIOVS REBELLION which the Recusants of Ireland have without Ground or Colour raised against Vs, Our Crown and Dignity:</hi> But the Pope by his Bull calls that Rebellion of the <hi>Irish</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:60274:45"/>
Papists, <hi>an imitation of their godly and worthy Ancestors,</hi> with this farther addition, That the said <hi>Irish Papist</hi> GALLANTLY <hi>do what in them lieth</hi> TO EXTIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PATE AND TOTALLY ROOT OUT THE PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TESTANTS, who he is pleas'd to call <hi>Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> Nay, his Holiness proceeds farther, for being willing to cherish them in their Rebellion, he dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to them the <hi>gift of spiritual Graces,</hi> of which he says <hi>he is under GOD the onely Disposer on earth,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>grants them a full &amp; plenary indulgence and absolute remission for all their sins, trespasses, transgressions, crimes and delinquences, how hainous and atrocious soever they be.</hi> If the <hi>Pope</hi>'s power over the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> be so <hi>great,</hi> I shall not wonder their obedience to the <hi>King</hi> is so <hi>little:</hi> neither shall I admire that <hi>Rebellions</hi> have been so frequent in Ireland for the <hi>time past,</hi> nor doubt they will be as frequent for the <hi>time to come,</hi> if the <hi>strength</hi> of the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> proportions their <hi>inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> &amp; if the said Papists consider fighting against the Kings <hi>Authority</hi> is <hi>Merit,</hi> and dying in that <hi>Quarrel</hi> is <hi>MARTYRDOM.</hi> Their propensity to the sin of <hi>Rebellion</hi> needed not those two double incentives to it, viz. If they succeed, HEAVEN and IRELAND is theirs; if they succeed not, HEAVEN is theirs: His Sacred Majesty will have but little <hi>hold of men</hi> who are acted by such <hi>Principles,</hi> and by such <hi>beliefs.</hi> I <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> also it may observ'd, this <hi>BVLL</hi> was sent them in <hi>May</hi> 1643. at which time the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> were in the height of their Rebellion; for they then had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cessation</hi> or <hi>Peace</hi> to plead, which might intitle
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60274:46"/>
them so much as to the <hi>Name of Subjects.</hi> It may be also this <hi>pardon of the Pope</hi>'s made them the more cheerfully swear <hi>neither to seek or receive directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly a pardon from a King.</hi> I hope the Reader will also observe that the designe of the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> by their Rebellion, what ever they pretended for it, was no less then TO EXTIRPATE AND TOTALLY ROOT OUT THE PROTESTANTS, and this atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the POPE himself, which he calls a GAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LANT ACT, and an <hi>imitation</hi> of their GODLY ANCESTORS, which proves that <hi>General</hi> if not <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Massacrings</hi> has not been onely the attempted sin of the <hi>Irish papists</hi> of this <hi>Age,</hi> but had descended to them by <hi>inherritance,</hi> and some wish it may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to their <hi>Posterities.</hi> 'Tis likewise worthy the Readers observation, Though his Sacred Majesty might warrantably have done unto those <hi>Irish papists</hi> what they would have done to the <hi>protestants,</hi> and though persons of such <hi>bloody principles and designes</hi> as the POPE owns the said <hi>Irish papists</hi> to be, and incourages them to persevere in, with assurance of <hi>pardon here,</hi> and <hi>Heaven hereafter,</hi> are not very likely to be <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Subjects</hi> to the King, or <hi>good Neighbours</hi> to their fellow Subjects; yet not <hi>one of them</hi> suffers meerly for his Religion, and <hi>many of them,</hi> though <hi>guilty,</hi> are <hi>pardon'd</hi> and <hi>restor'd.</hi> This practically and clearly shows the difference between the <hi>true mother</hi> and the <hi>false mother,</hi> as also how much more consonant to CHRIST's Doctrine and Practise the HEAD OF THE PROTESTANT CHURCH does <hi>act,</hi> then the HEAD
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60274:46"/>
OF THE POPISH CHURCH does <hi>act</hi>; and MAN can in nothing be so well like unto GOD, as in <hi>being merciful as GOD is merciful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for all P. W's fencing, I am confident were his Country-men as <hi>fully pardoned</hi> for their breaches of the Articles made in 1648. as by that peace P.W. says (whatever he thinks) they are pardon'd for their brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the year 1646. he would as well attribute his Countrymens sufferings to the breaches of 1648. as to any <hi>preceding.</hi> But I see it is easier for his Majesty to forgive TWO Rebellions, then for P. W. acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ONE, which he is so far from doing, that upon a supposititious covenant-breach on the Kings side, he thereby insinuates a charge against the <hi>most faithfully indulgent of Princes.</hi> But the <hi>protestants</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> dare APPEAL CHEERFULLY even to the Tribunal of GOD HIMSELF, that the <hi>Iudgement</hi> may <hi>fall</hi> where the <hi>breach is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And since P. W. acknowledges <hi>that all the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgements fallen upon the Irish Nation is for the breach of the Articles of</hi> 1646. and that I have fully <hi>proved</hi> in many <hi>signal instances,</hi> the Articles ni 1648. were <hi>no less broken by them,</hi> let all men consider how <hi>visible</hi> the breach was which he CONFESSETH, when the breach in 1648. is so <hi>visible,</hi> which he DENYETH: And since all the past judgements on his Countrymen, <hi>he owneth,</hi> were onely inflicted <hi>for the breach in</hi> 1646. let <hi>him</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> if they please, ascribe the punishments to come in the Bill of Settlement, to their breaches in 1641. and to their breach of the Articles in 1648. for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60274:47"/>
doubtless <hi>these</hi> deserve some judgements as well as <hi>that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I fully own <hi>Faith</hi> should be observed where-ever it is given, as long as the conditions for which it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are observed: And I as heartily confess that a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Faith calls down the severest of Gods punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for all promises made before the righteous Judge of heaven and earth, when broken, are not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken singly to those <hi>to whom,</hi> but even also <hi>to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom</hi> they are made; and God will not be mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I wish those which now think such <hi>judgements</hi> on such <hi>breaches</hi> just and inevitable, had in 1641. in 1646. in 1648. and many times since, so well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the truth of that position, as not to have run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those sins, which must, as an inevitable consequence of them, draw down <hi>such punishments.</hi> But since what is past cannot be recall'd, I will pray they may avoid in the <hi>future,</hi> what for the <hi>time past</hi> they might have <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</hi> But because P.W. has instanc'd the case of <hi>Saul</hi>'s children and the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> I will endeavour to show how far <hi>it is</hi> parallel to that case to which he unjustly applies it, and how far <hi>it is not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First how far it is Parallel.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Ioshua</hi> knew not the <hi>persons of those</hi> with whom he made that league; neither did the King know the <hi>hearts of those</hi> with whom he made that peace.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Those were neighbours, nay liv'd amongst the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> to whom <hi>Ioshua</hi> promised peace, though they said <hi>they were of a far Country</hi>; the Irish <hi>were neighbours,</hi> at least <hi>locally</hi>; nay they liv'd long amongst us, though at
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60274:47"/>
last they would not let us live among them; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>they were from a very far Country, even from Rome it self.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Those <hi>deluded Ioshua</hi> into that league, and said <hi>they were his servants,</hi> when they were his <hi>Enemies</hi>; the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> did also delude the King into that peace, and said <hi>they were Subjects,</hi> when indeed they were <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</hi> Thus far the Parallel holds.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now I will show in <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>how much</hi> it differs.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Gibeonites deluded <hi>Ioshua</hi> into a peace; but the Irish Papists (to use His Sacred Majesties own words) <hi>forced, compelled, necessitated</hi> him into Cessati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Peaces.</item>
                  <item>2. The Gibeonites were <hi>Strangers,</hi> but the Irish Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists were (at least ought to have been) <hi>Subjects.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The Gibeonites <hi>never broke those Conditions</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, though by those <hi>conditions</hi> they were made in effect <hi>Slaves</hi>; but the Irish Papists broke, yea often, if not always theirs, though after an unparallell'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion they were in effect made <hi>Lords of all Ireland,</hi> even the bloody <hi>Stage</hi> upon which they had acted their <hi>guilt.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Saul</hi>'s children were not executed for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his having made the Gibeonites <hi>hewers of wood, and drawers of water,</hi> (the utmost that the Protestants desire even to the <hi>worst principled</hi> of the Irish Papists) but for killing the Gibeonites after they were peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Slaves: So that those judgements P. W. seems to threathen his Majesty with, if they have not the Articles
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60274:48"/>
of 1648. made good, he and his Countrymen have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reason to fear; <hi>for his Majesty kept them, and they have broken them.</hi> Since the <hi>breach of Faith</hi> is so foul a <hi>Sin,</hi> and deserves such heavy <hi>Punishments,</hi> even by P. W's own confession, and since it is fully proved <hi>those</hi> for whom he pleads, have not onely once, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yea always broken their Agreements; let them with patience bear what they have drawn upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and let him henceforth imploy his <hi>Pen</hi> and his <hi>Press</hi> in inviting his Countrymen rather to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Majesties <hi>mercy,</hi> that <hi>no more</hi> are punish'd, then that <hi>some</hi> are, and that so little too, <hi>comparatively</hi> to their <hi>crimes.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>I will from P. W's Parallel take a rise for the insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of two particulars: The first is, If any of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of P. W's Clients lose their Lands, though actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they were not guilty of their Fathers Rebellions, let him remember, even in the case which he instances, that the <hi>seven</hi> sons of <hi>Saul</hi> were <hi>hanged up unto the Lord in Gibeah of Saul,</hi> though they had not actually <hi>slain</hi> those Gibeonites for which they <hi>themselves were punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Let him also remember that till <hi>Iustice</hi> was done, the <hi>famine lasted</hi>; and after it was done, the <hi>famine ceased.</hi> Those lost theirs lives for their fathers sin; but these (if any) lose but their fathers forfeited Lands for their Fathers crimes. The second is, Though even the <hi>Spirit of God it self</hi> witnesseth, <hi>That Saul sought to slay the Gibeonites in his zeal to the children of Israel and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>; yet <hi>that it self</hi> could not <hi>silence</hi> or <hi>suspend</hi> the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God. And therefore let P. W. know, That
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60274:48"/>
though in the third Article of their Instructions to the titular Bishop of <hi>Fernes,</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicolas Plunket,</hi> (their Commissioners to <hi>Rome</hi>) they own to the Pope that in their zeal they <hi>rais'd Arms for the freedom of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion,</hi> yet no zeal in Religion can apologize for, or will hinder the effects of Gods Justice on his Countrymen for their unparallell'd <hi>murthers,</hi> and their often <hi>breaches against Nature, and against Stipulation: To do evil that good may come of it,</hi> may be the <hi>Doctrine of Rome,</hi> but is not the <hi>Doctrine of Christ</hi>; and by the <hi>Fruit</hi> the <hi>Tree</hi> is best known.</p>
