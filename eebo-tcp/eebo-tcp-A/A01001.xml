            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the same: Besides both Princes (yea our owne learned and most iudicious King) Philosophers, Poets, Chronologers, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers, and many worthy Writers, haue concurred and concluded in this; that diuers impious and facinorous mischiefes haue beene effectuated through the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Diuell, by permission of God, so that the actors of the same haue carried away the opinion of the world, to doe that which they did by Witchcraft, or at least to be esteemed Witches, for bringing such and such things to passe: For howsoeuer the learned haue charactred delinquents in this kinde by titles of sundry sortes, and most significant attributes; as <hi>Pythonissae</hi> dealing with artificiall Charmes; <hi>Magi</hi> anciently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted so, for extraordinary wisedome and knowledge in the secrets of simples and hearbes; <hi>Chaldei,</hi> famous for Astronomy and Astrology; <hi>Necromancers</hi> for practising to raise dead bodies, and by them to foretell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents of the earth; <hi>Geomantici,</hi> for conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with Spirits, and vsing Inchantations;

               <hi>Genethliaci,</hi> for presuming on the calculating of Natiuities, or if you will, assuming the credit of Figure-casting; <hi>Ventriloqui,</hi> for speaking with hollow voyces as if they were possessed with Diuells; <hi>Venefici,</hi> for dealing with Poyson, and either killing or curing that way: For you must vnderstand howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Professors aforesaid practise mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mischiefe, yet many times they Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend cures and preseruation; with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, carrying the shew of great learning and admired knowledge; yet haue they all but one familier tearme with vs in English called Witches. As for the conceit of wise-men or wise woemen, they are all meerely coseners and deceiuers; so that if they make you beleeue that by their meanes you shall heare of things lost or stolne, it is either done by Confederacy, or put off by protraction to deceiue you of your money.</p>
            <p>Only (as I said before) there bee certaine men and women growne in yeares, and ouer-growne with Melancholly and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme, who out of a malicious dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Therefore by way of Caution I aduise thee (gentle Reader) whosoeuer thou art, to take heede how thou doest either despise the power of God in his Creatures, or vilipend the subtilty and fury of the Diuell, as Gods instrument of vengeance, considering that truth in despight of gaine sayers will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, according to that principle: <hi>Magna est veritas &amp; preualebit.</hi>

hee fastened as it were vnto himselfe the loue and good opinion of the Countrey wherein he walked the more cheerefully and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, because his honourable Countesse mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched arme in arme with him in the same race; so that Beauer Castle was a continuall Pallace of entertainment, and a daily recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle for all sorts both rich and poore, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such auncient people as neighboured the same; amongst whom one <hi>Ioane Flower,</hi> with her Daughters <hi>Margaret</hi> and <hi>Phillp</hi> were not onely relieued at the first from thence, but quickly entertained as Chair-women, and <hi>Margaret</hi> admitted as a continuall dweller in the Castle, looking both to the poultrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and the wash-house within dores: In which life they continued with equall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency, till something was discouered to the noble Lady, which concerned the misdemeanour of these women.

houshold; vntill the Countesse misconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of her daughter <hi>Margaret,</hi> and discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring some vndecencies both in her life and neglect of her businesse, discharged her from lying any more in the Castle, yet gaue her 40. <hi rend="sup">s.</hi> a bolster, &amp; a mattresse of wooll: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding her to go home, vntil the slacknesse of her repayring to the Castle, as shee was wont, did turne her loue and liking toward this honourable Earle and his family into hate and rancor: wherevpon despighted to bee so neglected, and exprobrated by her neighbours for her Daughters casting out of dores, and other conceiued displeasures, she grew past all shame and Woman-hood, and many times cursed them all that were the cause of this discontentment, and made her so loathsome to her former familiar friends, and beneficiall acquaintance.</p>
               <p>When the Diuell perceiued the inficious disposition of this wretch, and that she and her Daughters might easily bee made instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to enlarge his Kingdome, and bee as it were the executioners of his vengeance;

not caring whether it lighted vpon inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents or no, he came more neerer vnto them, and in plaine tearmes to come quickly to the purpose, offered them his seruice, and that in such a manner, as they might easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what they pleased: For hee would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you in such prety formes of dog, cat, or Rat, that they should neither be terrified, nor any body else suspicious of the matter. Vpon this they agree, and (as it should seeme) giue away their soules for the seruice of such spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as he had promised them; which filthy conditions were ratified with abhominable kisses, and an odious sacrifice of blood, not leauing out certaine charmes and coniurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with which the Diuell deceiued them, as though nothing could bee done without ceremony, and a solemnity of orderly rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. By this time doth Sathan triumph, and goeth away satisfied to haue caught such fish in the net of his illusions: By this time are these women Diuels incarnate, and grow proud againe in their cunning and artificiall power, to doe what mischiefe they listed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By

               <p>At last, as mallice increased in these damnable Women; so his family felt the smart of their reuenge and inficious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. For his eldest Sonne <hi>Henry</hi> Lord

                  <hi>Rosse</hi> sickened very strangely, and after a while died: his next named <hi>Francis</hi> Lord <hi>Rosse</hi> accordingly, was seuerely tormented by them, and most barbarously and inhumane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tortured by a strange sicknesse; not long after the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> was set vpon by their dangerous and diuellish practises, and many times in great danger of life, through extreame maladies and vnusuall fits, nay (as it should seeme, and they afterwards confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) both the Earle and his Countesse were brought into their snares as they imagined, and indeed determined to keepe them from hauing any more children. Oh vnheard of wickednesse and mischieuous damnation? Notwithstanding all this did the noble Earle attend his Maiesty, both at New-market be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christmas, and at Christmas at White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall; bearing the losse of his Children most nobly, and little suspecting that they had miscarried by Witch-craft, or such like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions of the Diuell, vntill it pleased God to discouer the villanous practises of these Woemen, and to command the Diuell

from executing any further vengeance on innocents, but leaue them to their shames, and the handes of Iustice, that they might not onely be confounded for their villanous practises, but remaine as a notorious example to all ages of his iudgement and fury.

               <p>SHee saith, that one <hi>Ioan Willimot</hi> of <hi>Goadby</hi> came about sixe yeares since to her in the Wowlds, and perswaded this Examinate to forsake God, and betake her to the diuel, and she would giue her two spirits, to which shee gaue her consent, and thereupon the said <hi>Ioan Willimot</hi> called two spirits, one in the likenesse of a Kitlin, and the other of a Moldiwarp: the first the said <hi>Willimot</hi> called <hi>pusse,</hi> the other <hi>hiffe, hiffe,</hi> and they presently came to her, &amp; she departing left them with this Examinate, and they leapt on her shoulder, and the kitlin suckt vnder her right eare on her neck, &amp; the Moldiwarp on the left side in the like place.
<pb facs="tcp:2511:19"/>
After they had suckt her, shee sent the Kitlin to a Baker of that Towne, whose name shee remembers not, who had called her Witch &amp; stricken her; and bad her said spirit goe and bewitch him to death: the Moldiwarpe shee then bad go to <hi>Anne Dawse</hi> of the same towne and bewitch her to death, because she had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this examinate witch, whore, jade, &amp;c. and within one fortnight after they both dyed.</p>
               <p>And further this Examinate saith, that she sent both her spirits to <hi>Stonesby,</hi> to one <hi>Willison</hi> a husbandman, &amp; <hi>Robert Williman</hi> a husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans sonne, and bad the Kitlin goe to <hi>Willison</hi> and bewitch him to death, and the Moldy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warp to the other, and bewitch him to death, which they did; and within tenne dayes they dyed. These foure were bewitched while this Examinate dwelt at <hi>Waltham</hi> aforesaid.</p>
               <p>About three yeares since, this Examinate remoued thence to <hi>Stathorne,</hi> where she now dwelt: vpon a difference betweene the said <hi>Willimot</hi> and the wife of <hi>Iohn Patchet</hi> of the said <hi>Stathorne</hi> Yeoman, shee the said <hi>Willimot</hi> called her this Examinate to goe and touch
<pb facs="tcp:2511:20"/>
the said <hi>Iohn Patchets</hi> Wife and her Childe, which shee did, touching the said <hi>Iohn Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets</hi> wife in her bed, and the childe in the Grace-wifes armes, and then sent her said spirits to bewitch them to death, which they did, and so the woman lay languishing by the space of a moneth and more, for then shee dyed; the childe dyed the next day after she touched it.</p>
               <p>And shee further saith, that the said <hi>Ioane Willimot</hi> had a spirit sucking on her, vnder the left flanke, in the likenesse of a little white Dogge, which this Examinate saith, that she saw the same sucking in Barley-haruest last, being then at the house of the said <hi>Ioan Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for her selfe, this Examinate further saith, that shee gaue her soule to the Diuell to haue these spirits at her command; for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation whereof, she suffered them to suck her alwayes as aforesaid about the change and full of the Moone.</p>

               <p>She further saith, that finding a gloue about two or three yeares since of <hi>Francis</hi> Lord <hi>Rosse,</hi> on a dung-hill, she deliuered it to her mother, who put it into hot water, and after tooke it out and rubd it on <hi>Rutterkin</hi> the Cat, and bad him goe vpwards, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her mother buried it in the yard, and said a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe light on him, but he will mend againe.</p>
               <p>Shee further saith, that her Mother and shee, and her Sister agreed together to bewitch the Earle and his Lady, that they might haue no more children: and being demanded the cause of this their mallice and ill will; shee saith, that about foure yeares since

After this, her Mother complained to the Earle against one <hi>Peake,</hi> who had offered her some wrong, wherein she conceiued that the Earle tooke not her part, as shee expected, which dislike with the rest, exasperated her displeasure against him, and so she watched an opportunity to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged: wherevpon she tooke wooll out of the said mattresse, and a paire of gloues, which were giuen her by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Vauasor,</hi> and put them into warme water, mingling them with some blood, and stirring it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, then she tooke the wooll and gloues out of the water, and rubd them on the belly of <hi>Rutterkin</hi> her Cat, saying the Lord and the Lady should haue more Children, but it would be long first.</p>

               <p>THese Examinations and some others were taken and charily preserued for the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of sufficient euidences against them, and when the Iudges of Assise came downe to Lincolne about the first weeke of <hi>March,</hi> being S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Henry Hobert,</hi> Lord chiefe Iustice of the Common Pleas, and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ed: Bromley</hi> one of the Barons of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, they were presented vnto them, who not only wondred at the wickednesse of these persons, but were amazed at their practises and horrible contracts with the Diuel to damne their own soules: And although the Right Honorable Earle had suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient griefe for the losse of his Children; yet no
<pb facs="tcp:2511:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doubt it was the greater to consider the manner, and how it pleased God to inflict on him such a fashion of visitation: Besides, as it amazed the hearers to vnderstand the particulars, and the circumstances of this diuellish contract, so was it as wonderfull to see their desperate impenitency, and horrible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, according to the rest of that sort, exclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming against the Diuell for deluding them, and now breaking promise with them, when they stood in most need of his helpe.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all these aggrauations, such was the vnparalleld magnanimity, wisedome, and patience of this generous Noble-man, that hee vrged nothing against them more then their owne confessions, and so quietly left them to iudiciall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, desiring of God mercy for their soules, and of men charity to censure them in their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but God is not mocked, and so gaue them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to iudgement, nor man so reformed, but for the Earles sake, they cursed them to that place which they themselues long before had bargained for.</p>
               <p>What now remaines (gentle Reader) but for thee to make vse of so wonderfull a Story, and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an accident, out of which, to draw to a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, thou maist collect these particulars. First, that God is the supreame commander of all things, and permitteth wonderfull actions in the World, for the tryall of the godly, the punishment of the wicked, and his owne glory: of which man shall neuer attaine to know the reason or occasion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the Diuell is the meere seruant and
<pb facs="tcp:2511:24"/>
agent of God, to prosecute whatsoeuer hee shall command rather then giue leaue vnto; limiting him yet thus farre in his owne nature, that he can go no further then the bounds within which hee is hedged. Thirdly, that this God hath punishments, <hi>ad correctionem,</hi> that is to say, chasticements of the godly, <hi>&amp; ad rui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>m, Videlicet,</hi> Iudgements against the wicked, wherein yet man must disclaime any knowledge, and forsake preiudicate opinions. For the very iust shall be tried like gold, and no man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from castigation whom God doth loue. Fourthly, that this Diuell, though he bee Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, yet worketh altogether by deceit: for as hee was a lyer from the beginning; so let no man trust him, because he aymeth at the confusion of all Mankinde. Fiftly, that the wicked, (howeuer they may thriue and prosper for a time) yet in the end are sure to be payed home, either with punishment in this life or in the life to come, or both, as a finall reward of monstrous impiety. Sixtly, that Man in his frailty must not presume of prosperity; but prepare a kinde of stooping vnder the hand of God, when it pleaseth him to strike or punish vs. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly, that there is no murmuring nor repining against God, but quietly to tolerate his inflictings, whensoeuer they chance, of which this worthy Earle is a memorable example to all men and Ages. Eightly, that the punishments of the wicked are so many warnings to all irregular sinners to amend their liues, and auoid the iudgement to come, by penitency and newnesse of life. Ninthly, that
<pb facs="tcp:2511:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
though man could bee content to passe ouer blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies and offences against the Statutes of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet God will ouertake them in their own walks, and pull them backe by the sleeue into a slaughter-house, as here you know the euidences against these people tooke life and power from their owne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions. Tenthly, and last of all, that priuate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion cannot preuaile against publique censures: for here you see the learned and religious Iudges cryed out with our Sauiour, <hi>Ex ore tuo.</hi> Therefore though it were so, that neither Witch nor Diuell could doe these things, yet <hi>Let not a Witch liue,</hi> saith God, and <hi>Let them dye</hi> (saith the Law of England) <hi>that haue conuersation with spirits, and presume to blaspheme the name of God with spels and incantation.</hi> O then you sonnes of men, take warning by these examples, and eyther diuert your steps from the broad way of destruction, and inrecouerable gulph of damnation, or with <hi>Iosuahs</hi> counsell to <hi>Achan,</hi> blesse God for the discouery of wickednesse, and take thy death pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, as the preuention of thy future iudgement, and sauing innocents from punishment, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise may be suspected without a cause.</p>
