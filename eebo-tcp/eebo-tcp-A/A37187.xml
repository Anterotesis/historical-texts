            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>To the Reader.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> May receive diſadvantage by this Addreſs deſign'd for excuſes; for it will too haſtily put you in mind that errors are not far off when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes are at hand; this refers to our Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: and ſome may be willing to be led to find the blemiſhes of it; but would be left to their own conduct to diſcover the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if there be any. Yet I may fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn you that the defects which I intend to excuſe are chiefly ſuch, as you cannot reform but only with your Purſe; that is, by building us a larger Room; a deſign which we began and ſhall not be left for you to finiſh, becauſe we have obſerv'd that many who are liberal of their underſtanding when they would iſſue it out towards diſcovery of imperfections, have not alwayes Money to expend in things neceſſary towards the making up of perfection.</p>
                  <p>It has been often wiſht that our Scenes (we having oblig'd our ſelves to the variety of Five changes, according to the Ancient Dramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick diſtinctions made for time) had not been
<pb facs="tcp:39473:3"/>
confin'd to eleven foot in height, and about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen in depth, including the places of paſſage reſerv'd for the Muſick. This is ſo narrow an allowance for the Fleet of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, his Army, the Iſland of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and the varieties attending the Siege of the City; that I fear you will think, we invite you to ſuch a contracted Trifle as that of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> carv'd upon a Nut.</p>
                  <p>As theſe Limits have hinder'd the ſplendor of our Scene, ſo we are like to give no great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the quantity of our Argument, which is in ſtory very copious; but ſhrinks to a ſmall narration here, becauſe we could not convey it by more then ſeven Perſons; being conſtrain'd to prevent the length of <hi>Recitative</hi> Muſick, as well as to conſerve, without incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, the narrowneſs of the place. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you cannot expect the chief Ornaments belonging to a Hiſtory Drammatically digeſted into Turns and Counter-turns, to double Walks, and interweavings of deſign.</p>
                  <p>This is expreſt to forbid your exceſs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; but we muſt take care not to deterr you from the hope of ſome ſatisfaction; for that
<pb facs="tcp:39473:3"/>
were, not only to hang out no Buſh, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to ſhut up our Doors. Therefore, as you have heard what kind of excellencies you ſhould not expect: So I will in brief (I hope without vanity) give you encouragement, by telling you, there are ſome things at leaſt excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable which you may reſolve to meet.</p>
                  <p>We conceive, it will not be unacceptable to you if we recompence the narrowneſs of the Room, by containing in it ſo much as could be conveniently accompliſht by Art and Induſtry: which wil not be doubted in the Scenes by thoſe who can judg that kind of Illuſtration &amp; know the excellency of Mr. <hi>John Web,</hi> who deſign'd and order'd it. The Muſick was compos'd, and both the Vocal and Inſtrumental is exercis'd by the moſt tranſcendent of <hi>England</hi> in that Art, &amp; perhaps not unequal to the beſt maſters abroad; but being <hi>Recitative,</hi> and therefore unpractis'd here; though of great reputation amongſt other Nations, the very attempt of it is an obligation to our own. The Story repreſented (which will not require much apology becauſe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects but little praiſe) is Heroical, and not withſtanding the continual hurry and buſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations
<pb facs="tcp:39473:4"/>
of a hot Siege, is (I hope) intelligibly convey'd to advance the Characters of Vertue in the ſhapes of Valour and conjugal Love. And though the main Argument hath but a ſingle Walk, yet perhaps the movings of it will not ſeem unpleaſant. You may inquire, being a Reader, why in an heroick Argument my num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are ſo often diverſify'd and fall into ſhort fractions; conſidering that a continuation of the uſual length of <hi>Engliſh</hi> verſe would appear more Heroical in reading. But when you are an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor you will finde that in this, I rather deſerve approbation then need excuſe; for frequent alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of meaſure (which cannot be ſo unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to him that reads as troubleſome to him that writes) are neceſſary to <hi>Recitative</hi> Muſick for variation of <hi>Ayres.</hi> If what I have ſaid, be taken for excuſes, I have my intent; becauſe excuſes are not always ſigns of Error, but are often modeſt explanations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of things that might otherwiſe be miſtaken. But I have ſaid ſo much to vindicate my ſelf from having occaſion to be excus'd for the <hi>Poem,</hi> that it brings me at laſt to ask pardon for the length of the <hi>Epiſtle.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough Poems have loſt much of their Antient value, yet I will preſume to make this a Preſent to your Lordſhip; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe Poems (if they have any thing precious in them) do, like Jewels, attract a greater eſteem when they come into the poſſeſſion of great Perſons, than when they are in ordinary hands.</p>
                  <p>The excuſe which men have had for dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Books, has been to protect them from the malice of Readers: but a defence of of this nature was fitter for your forces when you were early known to Learned men (and had no other occaſion for your abilities, but to vindicate Authors) than at this Seaſon
<pb facs="tcp:39473:27"/>
when you are of extraordinary uſe to the whole Nation.</p>
                  <p>Yet when I conſider how many &amp; how vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent they are who perſecute Dramatick Poetry, I will then rather call this a <hi>Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> than a <hi>Preſent;</hi> as not intending by it to paſs any kind of obligation, but to receive a great benefit; ſince I cannot be ſafe unleſs I am ſhelter'd behind your Lordſhip.</p>
                  <p>Your name is ſo eminent in the Juſtice which yon convey through all the different Members of this great Empire, that my <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> ſeem to enjoy a better Harbour in the Pacifique <hi>Thames,</hi> than they had on the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean;</hi> and I have brought <hi>Solyman</hi> to be arraign'd at your Tribunal, where you are the Cenſor of his civility &amp; magnificence.</p>
                  <p>Dramatick Poetry meets with the ſame perſecution now, from ſuch who eſteem themſelves the moſt refin'd and civil, as it ever did from the Barbarous. And yet whilſt thoſe vertuous Enemies deny <hi>heroique Plays</hi> to the Gentry, they entertain the People with a Seditious <hi>Farce</hi> of their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Gravity. But I hope you will not be unwilling to receive (in this Poetical
<pb facs="tcp:39473:27"/>
dreſs) neither the Beſieg'd nor the Beſiegers, ſince they come without their vices: for as others have purg'd the Stage from corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Art of the Drama, ſo I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to cleanſe it from the corruption of manners; nor have I wanted care to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Greatneſs and Vertue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and familiar.</p>
                  <p>In old <hi>Rome</hi> the Magiſtrates did not only protect but exhibit Plaies; and, not long ſince, the two wiſe <hi>Cardinals</hi> did kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the great Images repreſented in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy by <hi>Monſieur Corneille.</hi> My Lord, it proceeds from the ſame mind not to be pleas'd with Princes on the Stage, and not to affect them in the Throne; for thoſe are ever moſt inclin'd to break the Mirrour who are unwilling to ſee the Images of ſuch as have juſt authority over their guilt.</p>
                  <p>In this Poem I have reviv'd the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that fatal deſolation which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Chriſtian Princes when they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd the ambition of ſuch as defended the diverſity of Religions (begot by the factions of Learning) in <hi>Germany;</hi> whilſt thoſe who would never admit Learning into their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb facs="tcp:39473:28"/>
(leſt it ſhould meddle with Religion and intangle it with Controverſy) did make <hi>Rhodes</hi> defenceleſs; which was the only fortify'd Academy in Chriſtendome where Divinity and Arms were equally profeſs'd.
