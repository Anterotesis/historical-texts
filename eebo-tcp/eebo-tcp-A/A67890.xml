            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Three ROYAL CEDARS.</head>
            <p>DIvine Providence having been pleased to return the Subject to his due Allegiance, and to give encouragement to those who have constantly continued Loyal, that they may at length once more enjoy happiness, and every man sit under his own Vine, and under his own Figtree, which the God of Heaven be praised, we have now greater hopes of then ever; Moderation and Impartiality are the chiefest Virtues of a Loyal pen; 'tis such a task I chiefly aim at, no less then the difficult Travells of our most high and renowned King, with his exiled Nobles, <hi>Charles</hi> the second, Heir a parent to the Crown of Great Brittain, and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Crowned King of <hi>Scots,</hi> touching whom I intend to treat. He was born on the 29 of <hi>May,</hi> 1630. to the great joy of the King, Queen, and indeed the whole Kingdom; for never yet had <hi>England</hi> a Prince born of so Noble an extract, and Grand Alliance, his Father by Lineal right and descent, King of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> his Mother Daughter to that thrice Illustrious Prince <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and worthily sirnamed the Great, and <hi>Isabella</hi> Infanta of <hi>Spain.</hi> By his Grand mothers side was he near ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Kings of <hi>Denmark,</hi> by the Marriage of his Ant, the Noble Princess <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to the Elector Palatine of <hi>Rhine,</hi> and King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and afterwards, by the marriage of his Royal Sister the Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> Thus was he allied to most of the most potent Princes in <hi>Christendom.</hi> And happy might this Nation have been under his Government, if we may believe the vogue
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119937:2"/>
of that wisest of men <hi>Solomon,</hi> who pronounces that Kingdom blessed whose Prince is the Son of Nobles.</p>
            <p>But to return to his Majesty in <hi>Flanders</hi>; of whose itenary life we have already given you a particular account; it will not be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to say somewhat of his sedentary and reti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed living, that by his oeconomy we may judge of his Monarchy, and of the government of those few subjects in his Family, of that of his three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>His Majesty hath spent most of his time, wherein he hath been out of his Dominions, in <hi>Flanders</hi> under the protection of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique King of <hi>Spaine</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nor had he ever any where else so setled a Court and habitation as here, where his chief attendants are the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hide,</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> and many others, Nobles and Gentlemen, whose Loyalty to his sacred Majesty and his Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath made exiles to their Country; a particular number of which he makes use of for his Councell, doing nothing without serious and mature advice; and yet being of so sagacious a judgement that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he sayes is seldome contradicted by the most ju<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icious of his Councellors, not out of fear or flattery, but out of a real assent to, and concurrence with his judgement.</p>
            <p>And indeed those great opportunities which he hath had, by his so long being abroad, of diving into the great Councels of Forr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in Princes and States, must necessarily make him a person of a very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous understanding, endow him with all those qualities which may deservedly attain the name of Great, and render him as well an able Statist, as a King; he having during his expulsion travelled through, and lived in the Countries of three the most potent Princes in Christendom, <hi>viz.</hi> the Emperour's of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France</hi>; and so to the Germain resolution added the Spaniards prudence, and the Frenchmans expedition.</p>
            <p>To these extraordinary helps which never Prince in Christendom can boast of, we may yet adde, those more then ordinary gifts wherewith nature hath been pleased to endow him, which being so extreamly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, we can hardly now discern; but that it may be known what they were, take the character of an Honourable Lord upon his death bed, who speaking of him when about fifteen or sixteen yeers of age, hath these words: <hi>Truly I never saw greater hopes of vertue in any young person then in him: Great judgement, great understanding, strong apprehension, much of honour in his inclinations.</hi> So that both nature and industry have seemed to use their utmost endeavours to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119937:3"/>
make him a perfect Prince, his very affliction turning in this benefit, and making him in knowledge and sufferings (the Refiner of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) unparralel'd. Some forreign Princes as well envying, as pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his expulsion.</p>
            <p>This perfect knowledge of his he hath indeed had but small occasion to practice, except a little in <hi>Scotland:</hi> where, I think, he demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated himself a person so prudent and careful in his affairs, that it is beyond my pens expression.</p>
            <p>His Subjects good was his onely care: nor did he ever act any thing but what might tend more to theirs then his own interest; still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting whether it might benefit them, not himself.</p>
            <p>His Letter to Col. <hi>Mackworth</hi> Governour of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently demonstrates his affection to his very enemies; he would win, not conquer the hearts of those who though they have broke their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to him, yet he would esteem still his Subjects.</p>
            <p>He would not conquer with blood, lest he should be thought a Tyrant. He endeavoues by fair means to attain the love of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that what ever his very enemies think of him) he may approve himself to be a just Prince.</p>
            <p>And did fortune give him power, yet would he rather attempt blandishents then force. He knows that whilst he kills a Subject he weakens his Kingdom. Rebels themselves may be found usefull, and though justice cannot, yet his Majesties clemency will admit their pardon; but if they resist to the utmost, their blood is on their own heads. <hi>What man is not willing to destroy him who he knows would his murderer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus is his justice and his clemency mixt together; he would not kill, where he might with safety save. Not does his unspott<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency raise fancies or fears in him. As he is guilty of nothing, so ther's nothing he fears. Whilst he endeavours to be true to his Subjects, those endeavours force a belief in him that his Subjects will be true to him.</p>
            <p>His very nature enclines him to a compassion. He pities those that will not pitty themselves; and whilst they are conspiring his destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his prayers procure their safety. Nor can the utmost of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries provoke him to a retalliation. He hath learned not onely of God, but of the King his Father, to forgive his enemies.</p>
            <p>Nor is it his desire to obtain his Kingdoms that makes him willing to forgive his enemies, but his desire to forgive his enemies that makes him willing to obtain his Kingdoms: he counts the possession of his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119937:3"/>
Royalties but as a transitory dignity, the pardon of his enemies a Divine and lasting one.</p>
            <p>Neither is his pitty less then his justice, they are both in the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative degree, he hates wickedness, not because the wo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld should see him glory (that would make him an <hi>Hypocrite</hi>) but because God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors it; 'tis Love not Fear makes him Religious, he Fears God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because he loves him.</p>
            <p>He hates not the Vicious, hut abhominates their Vices, his hatred extends not to persons, but to things; He dislikes not the swearer, 'tis his Oaths he abhors he hates not the Drunkard but his Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>Yet does his mercy extend beyond their sins, as he is a King so he is a God, he is gracious to pardon, as well as just to punish; nor can a submission or reformation but overtake his remission.</p>
            <p>His constant service of God excites others to live by his example, he sleeps not without invoking the blessing of the Almighty, nor do his eyes open without a returned thanks, He knows 'tis God alone which can restore and protect him; nor can the wickedness of man prevail against Him.</p>
            <p>Nor does his publick devotion shew him less zealous then his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, the one demonstrates him full of Zeal, the other void of Hpocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; he would have others holy as well as himself; he knows that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerns him, being a King, above all private Men, <hi>Non nobis solis nati sumus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Private persons are not alone born for themselves, muchless Kings, the publique concern is their duty: 'tis not enough for the Master of the house that he be godly, whilst his Family is wicked. There must be Precept as well as Example: and if need be, correction as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p>This makes his Majestie deservedly famons; he counts it as great a fault to suffer a sin in another whilst he hath power to correct it as to commit it himself. He knows that what crimes soever a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate suffers willingly to be committed, he brings upon his own head.</p>
            <p>He is therefore above all things careful not to farther vice, lest he should be accounted vicious: he detests that in another which did he commit, he knows he might justly detest himself for: and endeavours by Example to reform that in others which he knows were it in him would seem odious.</p>
            <p>He abhors vice, as well because it is so, as because God abhors it.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119937:4"/>
His nature inclines him to vertue, and as he cannot admit it contrary in himself, so he cannot endure it in another.</p>
            <p>His constancy in Religion is no less conspicuous then his piety. His discerning judgement knows what is truth, and that truth is followed by his setled will; Yet he hates not the Popish Religion, but their Idolatry: he abhors not them, but their false worship. He loves all that know <hi>Christ</hi> at all, but wishes that they might know him more.</p>
            <p>His stedfastness in Religion proceeds not from self interest; he sticks not so much to the true Protestants, because he knows the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish to be addicted to that Religion; because he thinks it for his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; because he imagines that it would prove very difficill to obtain his Crown and leave it. Bvt, because he knows it to be true.</p>
            <p>He knows the Prince is born for the people, as well as the people for the Prince. He knows their interests to be interwoven. He knows that without them he cannot stand; yet will he sooner loose them relinquish ve<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y.</p>
            <p>He is the perfect pattern of Piety but more of Patience, his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions have not made him repine, he knowes God to be just: he believes that as God restored <hi>Job</hi> twofold, so will he likewise restore unto him his Kingdoms. Yet he thinks it just in God to suffer them to be detained from him.</p>
            <p>He laments more his Subjects slavery then his own Exile, he grieves that they have been so long blind, yet rejoyces for their sakes that they have now a Glimmering; he constantly prays for the restoring of their sight, not so much because they should restore his, as their own Rights and Priviledges.</p>
            <p>He is inwardly troubled and perplexed at the many Schisms, Sects, and Heresies that are raysed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he is sorry that their rise is from some mens envy towards him; he pitties, and his pitty produces his prayers for them. He is willing that though they will not obey him, yet that they may serve God.</p>
            <p>He was never heard to curse his enemies, many times to pray for them, and desi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e God to forgive even his Fathers Murtherers; his good will surpasses their cruelty: And whilst they are conspiring his destruction, he is p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aying for their salvation.</p>
            <p>He is a perfect enemy to all debauchedness, he is sorry those who pretend themselves his friends in <hi>England</hi> are so great a scandal to him: He wishes that they would so carry themselves, that he might adventure to own them as his friends; for he understands not the good will of those who drink his health for the liquors sake, nor wishes for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119937:4"/>
their help, who over their Sack only swear they will fight for him.</p>
            <p>He is no greater a hater of vice then a cherisher of vertuous actions, he loves them in his very enemies and oft he grives when he finds occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to think that many of them will rise up in Judgment against his most pretended friends.</p>
            <p>He is most exactly just in all his Commands, and faithful in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all his promises. Take the Character given him by the dying Marquess of <hi>Montrose. For his Ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esty now living</hi> (saith he) <hi>Never People I believe may be more happy in a King, his Commands to me were most just, in nothing that he promiseth will he fail: He deals justly with all men,</hi> &amp;c. So punctual is he, that when a word is once gone out of his Mouth, he will rather suffer by it then break it.</p>
            <p>To conclude, he is the pattern of Patience and Piety, the most righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and justest of Kings. The most knowing and experienced of Princes. The holiest and the best of Men, The severest punisher of vice. The strictest rewarder of Virtue. The constantest perseverer in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the truest lover of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>This a short Character of his illustrious Majesty, which I fear those that know him will rather think to come short of then reach his due praise, so sweetly vertuous is he in all his carriages, so affable in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, so void of passion and anger, that he was never yet heard or seen in Chollor, the utmost extent of any passion that ever was discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in him, being towards one of his Menial servants, who justifying himself in what he had done amiss, his Majesty with some motion told him, that he was an insolent fellow.</p>
            <p>Yet this is that Prince whose vertues we have given leave to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Nations to admire, whilst we our selves have <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ested as well igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his deserts, as destitute of our own Liberty, whilst either infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated or blinded by those who have Tyrannically usurped governments over us, we have been contented to sit still and see him expul<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed and exiled from his due Rights and Royalties, and our selves from our Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Priviledges.</p>
            <p>Nor hath God alone been mercifull to us in endowing his sacred Majesty with such Heroick virtues, but he hath given us a stock of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Princes, who seem to emulate Virtue in one another, and grow up like Royall Oaks, to maintain the honour and glory of this Nation, but are yet and have a long time been the disgrace of it, all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Europe</hi> laughing at the <hi>English</hi> folly, who slight that happiness which they might enjoy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:119937:5"/>As for the illustrious Duke of <hi>York</hi> his Fame is spread so far over the World, that my self have heard the very <hi>Turks</hi> commend and applaude his Vallour which was so esteemed of among the <hi>French,</hi> that before he arrived at twenty one years of Age he was by that King thought worthy the command of Liev. General of his Army's, which he managed with such care and prudence that seldom any affair he took in hand, produced not its desired success; and since, his being in requital of his services, complemented out of that Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> though he hath not had such eminent commands conferr'd on him by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet have they alwayes thought him worth the Highest imployment and respect.</p>
            <p>As for the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> he is esteemed by most to be fitter for a Counsellour then a Souldier. His carriage is grave and somewhat severe; of a Sagace Genious and understanding, and very much pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into State Affairs, which have made most judge him fitter for a Council board.</p>
            <p>These three Princes, are like three Diamonds or Pearls, which we have ignorantly cast away, and not come to know the worth of them till we come to want them, Their vertues having made them resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent throughout all the world, and rendred them, if we justly consider it, the only means whereby we can attain to happiness; for what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be more blessed then that which hath for her Prince a just King to Govern, a Valiant Duke to Defend, and a Wise Counsellour to Advise.</p>
