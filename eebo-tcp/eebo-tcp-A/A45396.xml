            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S ſoon as I had made my laſt diſpatch to you, it pleaſed God to faſten me to my bed for ſome dayes, by the returne of a fit, which hath been my frequent exerciſe; from whence being now after five dayes remov'd to my chaire, I have ſome liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55220:13"/>
your queſtion; and think it beſt with my pen in my hand to offer to you (in the ſame order which you have us'd) my thoughts of every period.</p>
                  <p>And firſt for the <hi>termes</hi> of the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> they want ſomewhat of <hi>Expreſneſs</hi>: For ſuppoſing, as you doe, that the <hi>Wicked riſe,</hi> and are judged, and adding from hence that their ſentence ſhall be that they ſhall <hi>utterly be deſtroyed,</hi> yet it is uncertain, <hi>whether that ſentence ſhall be immediately executed, or after ſome ſpace; or if immediately, whether by a ſwift or lingering deſtruction.</hi> For he that ſhould affirm the wicked to be at the laſt judgement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a fire, which ſhould tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for many hundred or thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, and at laſt conſume and annihilate them, would affirme the affirmative of this queſtion: and ſo he, that advanc'd from 1000<hi rend="sup">ds</hi> to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55220:13"/>
millions of years and ages of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, concluded (at any the longeſt laſt) with abolition. And then the arguings that are after uſ'd from Gods <hi>Juſtice &amp;c</hi>: would be of little force, if no more but this were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to be gained by them. For it were ſure as much Juſtice to puniſh <hi>eternally,</hi> as to puniſh <hi>milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of years, and then annihilate, when the ſuppoſed ground of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is the lightneſs, or ſhortneſs of the Acts ſo puniſhed, which would in the Eye of Law, and Equity, bear as little, i. e. no proportion with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Millions of Ages, as with dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abſolutely infinite. I ſhall therefore take it for granted by him that propoſeth the queſtion, that he means deſtruction immediately following the doomſ-day ſentence, and that no lingering but ſwift de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Next then <hi>p.</hi> i. for <hi>Origens</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55220:14"/>
granting it right ſtated (as I think it is) I demand for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is mention'd? Is it not for this, becauſe <hi>Origens</hi> Doctrine was deem'd an <hi>Hereſy</hi> in the Church, and that of ſome ill and dangerous conſequence to be believed? If ſo, then it muſt be conſidered, whether they that deem'd <hi>Origens</hi> Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, can appear to have been more favourable to this, (which will not be found) or whether the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this be not as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as of <hi>Origens,</hi> i e. whether the belief of no future puniſhment to the wickedſt Hypocrites in the world, ſave only of ſwift annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will not be as forcible a meanes of ſecuring wicked men that have no taſt or ſpirituall joyes) in the admitting of any gainfull evill, as the belief that after a long ſpace of horrible torments proportionably encreas'd to their number of Sins,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55220:14"/>
and the aggravations thereof, they ſhall one day, no body knowes when, when the Divells have been puniſh'd enough for their higheſt rebellions and continued hating and oppoſing of God, be delivered out of their flames, and made partakers of viſion of God, and ſociety of Saints and Angels, which they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hated, and never deſire to ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or be in their company, and have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd all thoſe torments, rather then they would entertain or admit Communion (or deſire and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices) with them. Tis poſſible it may be ſaid, that the reaſon of the difference is becauſe <hi>Origens</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was contrary to <hi>Scripture,</hi> and that this other is not. To this I ſhall make no further reply, then in the words of <hi>Vincentius Lirin: Imo planè nemo unquam Magiſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum fuit, qui pluribus divinae legis uteretur exemplis.</hi> His only fault
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55220:15"/>
then muſt bee, that he urged divine Teſtimonies in uncatholick Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations: (And whether that have not place here alſo; I leave it to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to conſider) and ſo ſaith <hi>Lirinenſis</hi> again, <hi>Dum parvipendit antiquam religionis Chriſtianae ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitatem, dum ſe plus cunctis ſape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re praeſumit, dum Eccleſiaſticas tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiones &amp; veterum Magiſteria con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnens quaedam ſcripturarum capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula nova more interpretatur, meruit ut de ſe quoque Eccleſiae Dei dicere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, Si ſurrexit in medio Tui Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>—</p>
                  <p>Thirdly then, to come to your <hi>Teſtimonies from Scripture,</hi> of the N: T: eſpecially, for proof of the <hi>affirmative.</hi> And 1. for the uſe of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: It is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd that theſe words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignify the ſame that in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh <hi>death or dying</hi> doth. But that this ſhould be limited to <hi>utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55220:15"/>
and <hi>annihilation,</hi> is moſt unreaſonable. For, in the uſing of this argument it is foreſeen and granted, that <hi>death</hi> is taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for death in and unto <hi>Sin</hi>: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 'tis ſuggeſted that thoſe are <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall</hi> and metaphoricall Sences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hereupon I infer, that if the words be taken ſometimes myſtically and metaphorically, and yet no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that they are ſo, but becauſe they are us'd in a matter whereto death, as it ſignifies a ſeparation of Soul and Body, is unappliable; then may they by the ſame reaſon be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo elſewhere, and not bound to that one which is thought to be the ſole literal and proper ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If <hi>Death</hi> appear to ſignify in Scripture ſomewhat <hi>beſide</hi> utter <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> then how can the wickeds utter deſtruction be <hi>concluded</hi> from the mentions of their death &amp;c? Againſt this it avails not to ſay,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55220:16"/>
that the one is the proper, but the other only metaphoricall notion of it: for it being granted that the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture uſeth Metaphors in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, why may it not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>as</hi> probably? This is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to the force of that argument. But then <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> I adde, that the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> for utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction i. e. <hi>Annihilation</hi> being only uſefull to the diſputer, it will be hard for him to produce any one place, either in Old or New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (I might adde, or in any other Author) where <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp;c. ſignifies <hi>Annihilation.</hi> It ſignifies indeed the <hi>ſeparation</hi> of <hi>Soul</hi> from <hi>Body</hi> very frequently; but that is not founded on ſuppoſition that in that ſeparation either of the parts, much leſſe both, utterly periſh. Nay the doctrine, for which the propoſer of the queſtions diſputes, ſuppoſes him not to mean death in that notion;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55220:16"/>
for then <hi>Eternall death,</hi> the wickeds portion, muſt be <hi>eternall ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Soul and Body,</hi> which is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of all reunion or reſurrection at the day of Judgment: <hi>which</hi> the Diſputer averts as <hi>hereticall.</hi> Nay 'tis to be obſerv'd that when our <hi>Saviour</hi> came neareſt the expreſſing this matter or annihilation, he chooſeth two other Phraſes, (not this of death, or anything that way inclining) <hi>having never been born, and having a milſtone hanged about the Neck and being caſt into the midſt of the Sea,</hi> which by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect reſemblance ſeemeth meant on purpoſe to ſignifie annihilation: And yet it is alſo obſervable to the main queſtion, that either of theſe ſtates (and ſo annihilation) is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more deſirable, then the Lot which in Gods decree awaites a betrayer of Chriſt, a wicked man, for that one fact. Thus far by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55220:17"/>
way of evacuating all force in that Argument; To this I ſhall adde ſomewhat <hi>Poſitive</hi> toward the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foundation for the evincing the contrary, viz. That <hi>death in ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture uſe., is</hi> (as 'tis granted in the objection) <hi>oppos'd to life.</hi> Life then ordinarily ſignifies that which reſults from the union of Soul and Body: but it alſo ſignifies the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of another union (<hi>Unio Virtutis</hi>) betwixt God and the Soul, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and both. In the former of theſe it ſignifies ſpirituall life, both as that ſignifies living well, whereby the paſſages of ſpiritual vertue betwixt God and us, are kept open and free; and as it ſignifies pardon of ſin, the contrary whereto is expreſſed by ſeparating and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his face, and turning himſelf from us. In the latter (<hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and the Soul and Body, i. e. Perſon of man) it ſignifies
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55220:17"/>
Gods favour and protection, of which under the ſtyle of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, that <hi>in it is life.</hi> And then as all felicity is the certain effect or conſequent of this kind of union, ſo life oft ſignifies felicity, even that of the higheſt Magnitude. And all this not My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically or Metaphorically, that I know of, (or if it did, that excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of no force as hath already been ſhew'd) but as litterally, and with as full propriety as the union of Soul and Body is call'd Life, <hi>God</hi> being (as the School ſaith out of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                     </gap> moſt properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the deſtruction of the being of the ſubject, or annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whereas 'tis affirm'd ſo to ſignifie <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.39. it is certain it doth not. For there as it is once oppos'd to the looſing this preſent life, (as our Saviour foretels the complying <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> ſhould in event do by thoſe very means by which they intended to preſerve them) ſo it is a ſecond time apply'd to godly <hi>Martyrs</hi> who looſe their lives for Chriſts ſake,

of whom it will not be imagined that they are annihilated, when they ſo dye.

And this is farther evident by the ſeveral proofs farther produced as <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.52. where <hi>they that take the Sword</hi> againſt the lawfull Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, <hi>ſhall</hi> i. e. are worthy to <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by the Sword</hi> of the Magiſtrate, which yet I hope can annihilate no man, but <hi>only kill the body, Mat.</hi> x.28. <hi>And</hi> beyond that <hi>have no more that they can do</hi>: ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.20. I hope Jeſus was only crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not annihilated. And ſo in all other places, ſave only that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.18. where upon a falſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption

it would follow that (not the wicked, which alone were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, but) good Chriſtians ſhould utterly looſe all being, at leaſt of the body, or be never rais'd again, ſo that it is far from being by that <hi>Cumulus</hi> of Teſtimonies concluded that the deſtruction or periſhing or the wicked ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies utter deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>If theſe <hi>teſtimonies</hi> may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd (ſome of which belong to Chriſt, ſome more to the godly, and no one to the annihilation of the wicked) the direct <hi>contrary</hi> will be <hi>concluded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the places that are produced to prove this to be the expectation or the <hi>Devils,</hi> prove it not. Not <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.24. for there <hi>to deſtroy them</hi>] is to retrench their great power over the men of the World, to deſtroy their <hi>Dominion,</hi> to caſt them out of the bodies

The other of <hi>Luke</hi> 4.34 is to the ſame purpoſe, and ſo concludes no more, then that concluded. And indeed it cannot be with any ſhew of reaſon imagined, that the <hi>divels</hi> ſhould know ſo little of their own <hi>doom,</hi> as to thinke it poſſible they ſhould at <hi>Chriſt's</hi> coming be <hi>anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated.</hi> Nay if they had, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition being ſo far from the leaſt degree of happineſſe, they could have no reaſon to deprecate it, or beg Chriſt to <hi>let them alone,</hi> and diſclaim having <hi>any thing to do with him.</hi> Their annihilation (if that had been the ſignification of deſtroying them) the ſpeedier it were, it were certainly the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable; eſpecially when it would alſo have ſecur'd them from the fear of a yet worſe condition, which we know was decreed them, and of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55220:22"/>
which they cannot be doubted to have receiv'd preſages, by being finally ſentenc'd to it. If this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be conſider'd, it will certainly warrant my affirmation, that 'twas not annihilation that the divels with ſuch horrour expected from Chriſt, but, as appeares by comparing with <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.29. amandation to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

probability is there, that either thoſe walls that were burnt to aſhes were <hi>annihilated,</hi> or els that all that people were then annihilated ſo as to be uncapable of being rais'd, and judged at the day of doom? Or if they were, wherein did their puniſhment appear to be greater then the portion of any other more moderate wicked man, which in the diſputers ſence ſhall be ſo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally annihilated; and ſure reap no advantage by the ſtate that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects him in the intervall? <hi>Laſtly,</hi> will his advantage be, that as <hi>death</hi> by being caſt into the <hi>lake</hi> is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be <hi>utterly deſtroyed,</hi> ſo <hi>whoever elſe</hi> is caſt into the lake, ſhall be utterly <hi>annihilated?</hi> That I ſuppoſe the ſpecially deſign'd advantage: but as it was ſaid, it will prove none, becauſe <hi>death</hi> being a <hi>privative</hi> thing, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of that neceſſarily infers

not only a poſitive <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> but conſequent to it an <hi>undying State,</hi> and that is contrary to the diſputers pretentions. And then though thoſe privations be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by being caſt into the lake, yet it no way followes, that men by being caſt in thither, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed alſo. The concluding thus were, as if, putting off the prophetical expreſſion, one ſhould ſay in plain words, After the death of <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity, and their continuing in the ſtate of <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> ſome thouſands of years, they ſhall be rais'd againe, and their Souls eternally <hi>united</hi> to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, and of thoſe ſo rais'd, many ſhould be caſt into as eternal flames, (the former of theſe is parallel to the caſting of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Hades</hi> into the <hi>lake</hi>; the latter of the perſons into the ſame lake) <hi>Ergo</hi> as there ſhall be no more <hi>ſeparation</hi> of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55220:30"/>
Souls from Bodies, ſo there ſhall be no more <hi>puniſhing</hi> of wicked men, whereas indeed the very contrary followes: The deſtroying of death is the commencing of this endleſs miſerable life, therefore proov'd to be endleſſe becauſe death is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and ſo life comes univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally; and ſo to continue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally inſtead of it: for elſe death and <hi>Hades</hi> (or that which is more then death, annnihilation) ſhould returne to have their being again, which it was decreed they ſhould not, and therefore they are ſaid to be caſt into the lake. 'Tis true indeed, if <hi>Hades</hi> ſignified the place of <hi>Hell</hi> or ſtate of <hi>torments,</hi> then the caſting this into the lake, would be the finiſhing thoſe torments, whether after <hi>Origens</hi> way, or any other, it matters not; but this as hath been ſaid, is not the importance of hades, but the <hi>State</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:55220:30"/>
of death, as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is the <hi>Act</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>To what hath laſt been ſaid, that which followes in the bottome of <hi>p.</hi> 3. will be found no competent anſwer. The firſt <hi>Anſwer</hi> is, that the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of <hi>death</hi> and <hi>Hades</hi> is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken properly in reference to them whoſe <hi>Names</hi> are in the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But firſt, if this were true, then one of my former concluſions muſt needs be granted, that <hi>Hades</hi> ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies not <hi>Hell Torments</hi> (for that being deſtroyed to thoſe that were under it, the Godly were never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe) but the ſtate of the dead <hi>in univerſum.</hi> Yet <hi>ſecondly,</hi> it is not true, for <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>I ſaw the dead, ſmall and great, ſtand before God, and the Books were opened,</hi> the Books of Regiſter of all mens deeds (from which the book of life, following, is different) <hi>and the Dead were judged</hi>— the Dead indefinitely, i. e. ſure all the dead,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55220:31"/>
and yet more deictically by enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of all particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in it: <hi>The ſea gave up its Dead, and Death and Hades deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up the Dead which were in them, and they were judged every Man according to their Workes.</hi> Here 'tis evident that Death and <hi>Hades</hi> are properly ſpoken in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to all that were to be judged according to works, and not only to them whoſe names were written in the Book of Life. And ſo that evacuates the firſt Anſwer. The <hi>ſecond</hi> Anſwer is, that they that are <hi>not written</hi> in that Book, ſhall never ſuffer ſuch a Death as brings to <hi>Hades,</hi> but ſhall fall into a worſe, the <hi>ſecond Death.</hi> But to this I reply, that this diſtinction hath no ground in the text, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wiſe both Death and <hi>Hades</hi> are equally there ſaid to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd to all that were under them,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55220:31"/>
both whoſe names are, and are not written in the book of life. As therefore to the Godly, that Death that leads to <hi>Hades</hi> is deſtroy'd, ſo equally to the Wicked; and then they are both rendred eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; and then the Wickeds being caſt into this lake, is not, cannot be to be deſtroy'd there; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lake of fire, to be tormented there eternally, as is moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>v.</hi> 10. where <hi>the Divell was caſt into this lake, and the beaſt and the falſe Prophet</hi> ſaid to be there already, yet were not annihilated by being caſt thither, but as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>ſhall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</hi> That they fall into a worſe death, I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grant, and think it uſefull to the cauſe I defend: for ſuppoſe a <hi>Wicked Man,</hi> whoſe impiety coſts him dear here, (one of the <hi>Divels</hi> ſaddeſt <hi>Martyrs</hi>) cruciated
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55220:32"/>
with the <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> his Sins have brought on him in an exquiſite manner many years, and at laſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeiz'd on by the hand of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and delivered to a wittily tormenting <hi>Death,</hi> or exerciſed many years with the rack of <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Strangury,</hi> or the like, and at laſt by theſe horrid miſeries his Soul rent from his Body, and he continue in <hi>Hades</hi> many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, and certainly partake of no good in that eſtate, at the utmoſt, but reſt from the labours of his former life. Can it in this caſe be ſaid that the <hi>ſecond Death</hi> is worſe then this, and yet this ſecond Death defin'd by a ſwift <hi>Annihilation?</hi> Certainly it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. Nothing but long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if not <hi>endleſs Torments</hi> can be ſaid worſe then thoſe ſo long <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Torments.</hi> But whereas it is added that the <hi>ſecond Death</hi> is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55220:32"/>
abſolute and <hi>eternall deſtruction,</hi> as the ſcripture elſewhere ſpeaks, I reply, that the ſcripture no where ſpeaks ſo; never uſes <hi>ſecond death</hi> of any ſuch thing as <hi>annihilation,</hi> nor ever ſeems in any other words to ſay of any wicked man, that he ſhall be annihilated. As for <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, but can ſee no Argument producible thence that either of them denotes <hi>annihilation,</hi> being both ſo much more proper to denote <hi>Torments,</hi> and thoſe eternall. For the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> 'tis known that Children were not burnt to Aſhes there, but put into hollow brazen veſſels, and there fryed and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched (a moſt lingering pain,) and therefore call'd <hi>Tophet</hi> from the Timbrels that there us'd to ſound to drown the noiſe of their diſmal cryes. And for the <hi>lake</hi> the Text is expreſſe, they that be <hi>tormented</hi>

(without intermiſſion) <hi>Day and Night</hi> (&amp; without ceſſation) <hi>for ever and ever.</hi> And though the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Hinnom</hi> being on Earth was not a ſtate of of Eternall but <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary</hi> puniſhments; yet that is no prejudice: for being to take a reſemblance from earth and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane puniſhments where nothing was eternall, the moſt that could be was to take the ſharpeſt and moſt <hi>lingering</hi> Torments thereby to expreſſe thoſe which, being moſt ſharp, were <hi>eternall</hi> alſo. Thus much for the Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and phraſes therein, which ſeem favourable to the affirmation, but duly weighed have not ſo prov'd.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Conſideration taken from <hi>God's Attributes</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and eſpecially of <hi>Mercy</hi> p. 4. There ſeem to me to be <hi>three</hi> weak parts in the arguing. <hi>Firſt</hi> that to thoſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55220:33"/>
                     <hi>ſins</hi> which are committed under temptations and <hi>infirmities</hi> of ours, not generally releiv'd by a ſufficiency of auxiliary grace, God's <hi>eternal puniſhments</hi> are ſuppos'd to be affix'd by them, that maintain ſuch puniſhments of eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Certainly they that thus doe, doe amiſs; and by ſo doing give great occaſion to thoſe that believe them to find other meaſures for juſtice in God, then thoſe which he hath preſcrib'd to men: (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in matters of this nature <hi>God</hi> is content to be judg'd by <hi>our Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and meaſures, <hi>Judge I pray you betwixt me and my Vineyard,</hi> and <hi>Are not my wayes equal?</hi>) But they that maintain God's <hi>requirings Mic.</hi> 6. to be proportion'd to his <hi>ſhewings,</hi> and the ſufficiency of the Divine grace, ready for all that will make uſe of it, and therein found the juſtice of puniſhing thoſe that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55220:34"/>
do deſpiſe or neglect thoſe meanes ſo liberally and abundantly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them by God, have given no cauſe for that exception. It is by them (on the contrary) marked out as an act of ſuperabundant mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that God forſakes not upon the firſt refuſals and not making uſe of his grace; he is long-ſuffering, and moſt willing, and moſt ardently la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours <hi>that all ſhould come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> even ſuch as have long reſiſted his Evangelical methods of rich grace. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that weight is laid upon the <hi>Temporalneſs</hi> of the ſins committed in this world, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating I ſuppoſe the <hi>unproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs</hi> of <hi>Temporal</hi> to <hi>Eternal,</hi> and therein founding an objection againſt the Juſtice of thoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This I ſuppoſe is believ'd to have force againſt thoſe that are wont to anſwer it by compenſating the want of weight in the tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55220:34"/>
of the ſin and ſinner, partly by the <hi>eternity of God</hi> againſt whom the ſin is committed, partly by the <hi>preparedneſs</hi> and inclination of the man <hi>to ſin eternally,</hi> in caſe he ſhould live eternally. And I ſhall confeſs that I have alwaies look'd on thoſe as <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, (ſuch as the <hi>Schools</hi> have many) not able fully to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy humane underſtanding, and have therefore been careful in ſeveral writings to offer ſurer grounds of ſatisfaction in this matter; by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weight on the <hi>option,</hi> which is by God given us, of <hi>eternal bliſſe</hi> on one ſide, as the reward of our Evangelical obedience, as on the other of <hi>eternal woe</hi> on our wilful denying, and this finally and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately perſever'd in: which makes it moſt juſt, that they that reſolutely and inexorably make this choice of never ſo much ill to themſelves, ſhould have none but themſelves
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55220:35"/>
to blame for the unhappineſſe of their portion. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> in inflicting puniſhment is compar'd with <hi>man</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> ſuppoſeable in him to ſee any the worſt man thus afflicted. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I conceive God is to be look'd on here only as the <hi>Rector</hi> of the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> whoſe office it is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the work of Judicature without paſſion on either ſide. You may ſee it in a Judge on Earth, which if he be a well-natur'd man never willingly pronounces ſentence, <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let quoties cogitur eſſe ferox</hi>: but yet muſt utterly diſclaim his Office, if he do not <hi>ſecundùm allegata &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bata</hi> pronounce that <hi>ſentence,</hi> which the <hi>Law</hi> preſcribes againſt ſuch or ſuch a fact, and reſiſt all temptations of his compaſſion in ſo doing. Such a ſeverity is that of God's, which the office which belongs to him in the World exacts of him, even
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55220:35"/>
when he ſwears <hi>that he is far from delighting in the death of him that dies,</hi> and moſt paſſionately exhorts <hi>to repent and live,</hi> and imputes it to abſolute <hi>wilfulneſſe,</hi> for which no reaſonable account can be given by any man, that he will thus ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Should he never make ſuch <hi>lawes</hi> to repreſſe Sin by aſſur'd expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>eternal puniſhment,</hi> we might eaſily judg what a World or rather <hi>Wilderneſſe</hi> of ſavage Creatures this Univerſe would be, by what it now is, even after all this ſeverity of menace and interdict. Twas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt <hi>juſt</hi> and moſt <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that he ſhould thus have ordein'd and enacted theſe <hi>ſad lawes</hi>; And therefore in great Juſtice and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and without any reſiſtance from his infinite goodneſſe and mercy, He thus enacted. And having done ſo, ſhould he as oft as any one came to ſuffer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55220:36"/>
to thoſe Lawes, <hi>retract</hi> or <hi>diſpence</hi> with; ſet his Compaſſion to evacuate the proceſſe, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate all the wiſe deſignes of this his Juſtice? Certainly no man would ever expect this of an all-wiſe <hi>lawgiver</hi>; or (after he hath ſet his Seal to this grand <hi>Indenture,</hi> ſo ſolemnly as by his <hi>Son</hi>'s promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating and ſigning it with his <hi>blood</hi>) imagine that his <hi>Compaſsion</hi> ſhould thus <hi>tempore non ſuo</hi> interpoſe, when there are ſo many more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeaſons, wherein he hath effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually demonſtrated himſelf to have as much of that to every the wickedſt man that periſheth, as any the tender'ſt <hi>father,</hi> even <hi>David</hi> ever own'd to the moſt deſperate rebel Son <hi>Abſolon,</hi> that finally refuſeth all returning to mercy, 'till at length he periſheth in the midſt of his Sin to the wounding his Fathers heart.

competent exceptions to that part of the arguing taken from Gods at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes. And therefore to the <hi>additional conſiderations</hi> for the ſtrengthening thereof the reply will be eaſy, that if they are the <hi>greateſt part of the World</hi> that falls under this <hi>ſeverity</hi>: this is but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily conſequent to that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part being ſuch as that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence moſt juſtly and indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly belongs to, and conſequently not ſuch whoſe guilts are truly ſuggeſted to be thus more <hi>venial,</hi> and of an ordinary degree; but only ſuch as proceed from <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>obſtinacy,</hi> groſſe <hi>negligence</hi> or groundleſſe <hi>preſumption.</hi> For for all other ſins of <hi>infirmity, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> and even <hi>wilfull,</hi> timely <hi>retracted</hi> by <hi>repentance,</hi> there is <hi>remedy</hi> prepar'd under the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> Only whereas to the two heads of

In this Section (after the middle of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. p.) it is reſolv'd, that the opinion of <hi>eternal torments,</hi> properly ſo call'd, is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted upon leſs termes then of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55220:41"/>
plain <hi>demonſtration</hi> from Scripture: But what that ſignifies, I cannot gueſs; <hi>God's affirmation</hi> when once reveal'd, as there is no juſt cauſe to doubt the teſtimony to be divine, will bear down all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which any improbability of the matter will ſuggeſt to us. <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> it ſelf thus judgeth, that <hi>God</hi> is to be believed rather then any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>reaſoning.</hi> If therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> (who ſufficiently teſtify'd himſelf to come from God, and to have the ſignature of his Authority on all his affirmations) did teach <hi>eternity of torments</hi> properly ſo call'd, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that doctrine in ſuch plain words, as all that heard him and his Commiſſioners preach, were firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolv'd to ſignifie the real ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſs of thoſe torments, then I ſuppoſe here is as plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, as the weightineſs of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55220:42"/>
matter or the <hi>Objecter's</hi> exceptions can exact. And that thus it is, it may not be amiſs briefly to ſhew in this place. Beſides thoſe teſtimonies which are by the Objecter produc'd (and as they are enervated by him, have and ſhall be vindicated and clear'd to have force in them, and ſo are not to be mention'd here) I inſiſt on theſe <hi>three.</hi> 1. The <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which being yielded to be but a parable, hath yet from Chriſts uſing it theſe grounds of aſſuring our faith, that there is as certainly after this life a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>torments</hi> as of bliſs, and thoſe torments executed by <hi>ſcorching,</hi> but not devouring and conſuming, much leſs <hi>annihilating</hi> flames. He that is in them hath nothing to beg but a preſent <hi>coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his tongue,</hi> and that may not be had, becauſe <hi>Dives</hi> hath had
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55220:42"/>
all his portion of <hi>good things in this life,</hi> and ſo muſt have no more ſuch, though it be but the leaſt <hi>allay</hi> of his pains for one minute, which ſure excludes annihilation, which is the perfect <hi>ſuperſeding</hi> of them. Again, <hi>there is a gulf fixed,</hi> which interſcinds all entercourſe between Heaven and Hell, whereby any aid or relief ſhould come to them. Theſe circumſtances put together muſt conclude, that the fire being not ſuch as of it ſelf conſum'd thoſe that were tormented in it, and <hi>Abraham,</hi> that was now a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſor,</hi> knowing that there was now no place left for the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of releaſe to the ſufferer, and no relief being to be hop'd for from Heaven, from whence only it was poſſible to come, the fire and ſo the continuance in the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be eternal. I foreſee
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55220:43"/>
but one objection to this, viz: that this was <hi>before</hi> the Day of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and then, this <hi>non obſtante,</hi> the fire after the day of Doom may annihilate. To this I anſwer, that the Parable is not bound to refer to the <hi>time</hi> wherein it was <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> Other parables of the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> referr'd to after times, and this here by the ſeeing <hi>Dives</hi> bodily in Hell, and the ſcorching of the tongue and the mention of dipping the finger &amp;c muſt refer to the ſtate of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of ſouls and bodies in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> and that muſt be after the <hi>Reſurrection</hi>; and ſo that ſuperſedes that one objection, and I foreſee no other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I mention Chriſts words of <hi>Judas,</hi> that it were <hi>better for him never to have been born,</hi> and of him that ſhould offend a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55220:43"/>
tender diſciple, and avert him from Chriſt, that it were better <hi>a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone were hanged about his neck, and he caſt into the midſt of the Sea.</hi> Here I ſhall ſuppoſe <hi>annihilation</hi> as fully expreſs'd by theſe two phraſes, as by any it could be, and yet that ſomewhat worſe then that expects wicked men, which muſt needs be founded in eternal <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable being:</hi> for eternal Being, if not miſerable, is much better; and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Being, if not eternal, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately determin'd by a ſwift de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as Chriſt ſuppoſeth, is not certainly and unqueſtionably worſe then never having had a Being.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I reſume again (though I now perceive they are after men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd) the expreſs words of Chriſt <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.10. that the <hi>Beaſt and the falſe Prophets,</hi> i. e. ſome wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>ſhall be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55220:44"/>
in a lake of fire and brimeſtone day and night for ever and ever.</hi> Nothing could have been more expreſſe: And to theſe I adde, that there is no <hi>one</hi> ſeeming <hi>diſſent</hi> of contrary teſtimony producible from the whole <hi>Scripture,</hi> but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable</hi> that bear full <hi>conſent</hi> with theſe, which conſequently have eſtabliſht the faith of this <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi> that it was by the Apoſtles of Chriſt enter'd into that <hi>depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> which they left in every Church where they preach'd, as appears by the laſt words of the Apoſtles Creed, <hi>the life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting</hi>; which as it is expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>annihilation,</hi> which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and determination of life in reſpect of duration or laſting, ſo being ſubjoyn'd to the <hi>reſurrection of the body,</hi> muſt be indefinitely coextended to that, and ſo belong
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55220:44"/>
to all bodies that are rais'd. And that it is thus comprehenſive, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more manifeſtly by the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſian Creed,</hi> which <hi>to the riſing and coming again of all men with their bodies, and giving account for their own works,</hi> which is parallel to the Reſurrection of the body, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns as the Explication of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life this expreſs <hi>Dogma, And they that have done good ſhall go into life everlaſting, and they that have done evil into everlaſting fire.</hi> And this was no doubt the concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſence of the Churches, that had this <hi>depoſitum</hi> of Chriſtian faith, both from the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and the preaching of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and their <hi>Succeſsors,</hi> committed to them. And ſo there remains no cauſe of doubt of the validity or plainneſs of <hi>demonſtration,</hi> as far as any matter of doctrine is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55220:45"/>
of it from the teſtimony of Chriſt and of God. What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of the <hi>incredibility</hi> of this doctrine, making ſome men deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately doubt of the truth of the whole body of Religion, can have no force againſt the truth of it. All Chriſt's <hi>duri ſermones</hi> had that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his teaching them, <hi>they were offended at him</hi>: and the meaning of that is, They forſook the whole Religion.</p>
                  <p>Having gone thus far in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reply to all that have been propoſ'd in favour of the <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative</hi> of the queſtion, I need not accommodate any Anſwer to the remaining (fifth) page of the firſt part. The three <hi>Poſtulata's,</hi> if all granted, (as they may in ſome limited ſence) will gain him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Not the <hi>firſt,</hi> for the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture favours not him,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55220:45"/>
as hath been ſhew'd; death and deſtruction no way ſignify or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude annihilation. Not the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> for there is no one Text clear in phraſe and ſignification yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd for the affirmative, nor any that by any age or orthodox Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath been ſo interpreted. Not the <hi>third,</hi> becauſe in our doctrine, ſet upon its due <hi>baſis,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as of a ſeeming diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeableneſs to piety, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Attributes of God, as hath been ſhew'd alſo. Then for the <hi>ſcandal</hi> of thoſe diſputes about <hi>Predeſtination</hi> &amp;c. which is thought to be allay'd by the opinion of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation,</hi> I anſwer, that they which deny all irreſpective decree of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation</hi> or <hi>Praeterition</hi> againſt <hi>Supralapſarians</hi> and <hi>Sublapſarians,</hi> that affirm <hi>univerſality</hi> of <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> and of the gift of <hi>ſufficient
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55220:46"/>
grace</hi> (all which are maintain'd by Biſhop <hi>Overall,</hi> to whom the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputer profeſſeth to encline, and are known to have been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by concordant votes of all the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church before S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

And if the Doctrine of <hi>Reprobation</hi> &amp;c. have need of this <hi>Antidote,</hi> to avert the ill and dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it, and to reconcile their dictates with piety and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God Almighty, then it is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55220:46"/>
more then time that the favourers of that Doctrine ſhould rather change their <hi>poyſons</hi> for wholſome <hi>dyet,</hi> then like the <hi>Mountebank</hi> on the Stage preſume to ſwallow the poyſon in confidence of this only antidote, which I have not yet heard that he believes to have any force in it. In a word, let us all renounce the <hi>irreſpective decree</hi> of Reprobation, as I profeſſe to do, and there is no more pretence for the denying of eternall torments of the Reprobates upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. As for the puniſhment of <hi>perſonall ſins,</hi> and their circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall abatements, that hath been accounted for already.</p>

                  <p>IN the Second Part the view of the places producible for Eternall Pains, begins with a <hi>prejudice,</hi> viz. that it is no where plainly and directly <hi>denyed</hi> that the Reprobates ſhall be deſtroy'd. But that negative Argument as it is ſimply invalid, ſo it is moſt unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably prefixt to the ſetting down of Teſtimonies for the perpetuity of their Torments: For if one ſuch <hi>Text</hi> be produc'd that ſhall really conclude their torments per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, (as certainly do the words of Chriſt <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.10. of their being tormented Day and Night for ever and ever) it is then moſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55220:48"/>
certainly conſequent that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate</hi> ſhall not be <hi>deſtroy'd</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and what is that but the plain and direct denial of it. And to adde that it is no where ſaid that they ſhall <hi>live</hi> for ever but that <hi>incorruption</hi> ſeems to be the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Elect,</hi> is ſure but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther branch of the ſame <hi>paralogiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> for they that are tormented for ever have ſence and life for ever, but that being a life of miſery eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hath no ſemblance of the priviledge of the Elect, whoſe Crown it is to live and reign, not to live and be puniſht for ever.

ſhall not ſignify <hi>eternal</hi> burning, but <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> deſtruction, to which is added the conſideration of a queſtion, which may be made from <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.29 whither the <hi>Devils</hi> themſelves, for whom eternal fire was <hi>prepar'd,</hi> be yet caſt into it, who are ſaid <hi>Iud.</hi> 6. and 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. to be but <hi>priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and ſo not yet under the <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> of their doom.</p>
                  <p>To all this I anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that if the ſuggeſtion be true, that ſuch is the judgment of <hi>moſt Divines</hi> (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I acknowledg to have been mine

But then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> as I do not conſent this to have
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55220:51"/>
been the judgment of moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, which is ſaid to be; ſo I now upon better conſideration of the Context, ſee no reaſon that could induce me or any to make that, ſo as to reject the more literal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. That <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> and the Cities about them ſignify the <hi>inhabitants</hi> of thoſe Cities, is apparent there by their being affirm'd to have <hi>given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to fornication,</hi> which ſure not the <hi>walls</hi> but the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants did: and then ſure thoſe that <hi>ſuffer'd the vengeance of eternal fire,</hi> and therein <hi>are ſet forth for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> or eſſay, what we Chriſtians following the like ſins are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, are not the Wals but the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants</hi> alſo. By the way, it is not the <hi>praeter tenſe</hi> or ſence, or in the <hi>aoriſt,</hi> (as when of the <hi>Angels</hi> v. 6. it is ſaid <hi>they kept</hi> not but left, and

alſo, never likely to have an end. So no good firm ground is there in this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, which I remember I had long ſince out of <hi>Socinus,</hi> but is not, that I know of, the reſolution of moſt Divines. As for the queſtion whither the <hi>Devils</hi> are yet caſt into eternal Hell, there will be no need of diſcuſſing it here, becauſe if for God's wiſe and juſt ends they are not ſo confin'd thither, as after the judgment, when there is no farther
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55220:52"/>
place for thoſe ends, they ſhall be, yet ſtill the ſoules of the men of <hi>Sodom</hi> may now ſuffer in that fire, and the <hi>Devils</hi> that are ty'd to their dark <hi>priſon</hi> (which appears not to be any other place but that Hell, where the ſpirits of wicked men are) be ready at hand to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them. Having clear'd this place, it followes, that as yet no leaſt probability is produc'd how <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

in other places ſhould ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify any thing elſe but <hi>eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of them that are caſt into it, and the Section that follows at the top of p. 8. hath nothing in it that exacts return, for if the fire of hell be <gap reason="foreign">

then it burns everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and if they that are in it ſuffer the <hi>judgment of eternal fire,</hi> then they muſt be eternal alſo, and that is here affirm'd and <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.10. As for the four <hi>conſiderations</hi> that next

follow to evacuate the belief of eternal torments being ſignify'd by eternal Fire, 'tis certain they have no ſhew of force in them ſeverally; and then joyntly they will have as little. For 1. If the word <hi>Fire</hi> (in that <hi>phraſe</hi>

                     </gap>
do not primarily or perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſignify everlaſting, yet 'tis not once found in the <hi>new Teſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> to ſignify otherwiſe: the place <hi>Jude.</hi> 7. is the only place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55220:53"/>
and that hath bin compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently vindicated. 3. Though Fire be a <hi>deſtructive</hi> thing, yet it is not able to <hi>annihilate</hi> by any its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural force, and beſides it is a <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating</hi> thing, and thus was it in the valley of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> from which the Fire of Hell takes its denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and thus <hi>the beaſt and the falſe prophet are ſaid to be tormented day and night for ever and ever</hi> in it, and then ſure 'tis neither Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion nor Inſtrument of anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilating deſtruction. 4. If ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting <hi>fire</hi> be oppos'd to <hi>life Mat.</hi> 18.8. yet this ingages it not, no nor inclines it to ſignify <hi>utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55220:53"/>
be granted to ſignify everlaſting deſtruction, (as with any propriety it cannot, Fire being the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of deſtruction, not deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it ſelf) yet in that caſe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction would reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably ſignify as <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>For the rendring this <hi>phraſe</hi> more applicable to the deſir'd notion, 'tis thought fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with another like phraſe <gap reason="foreign">

if it be granted that it neceſſarily ſignifies no more then that the Fire ſhall not go out, till the fewel of it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, yet 1. it as fairly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, then it may (when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text requires) very conveniently ſignify more; and that 2ly There will be no ground of doubt, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when 'tis applyed to thoſe who are affirm'd to be tormented <hi>in a Lake of Fire day and night for ever and ever</hi> i. e. to wicked men it ſhall not ſignify this <hi>more, viz.</hi> eternal burning. 3. for the

puniſhment, though that were ſuppoſed to ſignify no more then everlaſting <hi>poena damni,</hi> yet muſt it be founded in <hi>everlaſting being,</hi> for no man can be puniſhed everlaſtingly by deprivation of bliſs that hath not a being at all, to be thus capable of deveſting or deprivation: for <hi>non entis nulla eſt affectio.</hi> But to this it is <hi>repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> that the text ſaith not the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be everlaſtingly puniſhed, but they <hi>ſhall go into a puniſhment,</hi> and that puniſhment ſhall be <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi>; and ſuch is everlaſting death.

if it were into the <hi>furnace of fire, where there is weeping and gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of teeth.

But it is ſufficient in a word to ſay, that none of the proofs come home to the ſtate of <hi>annihilation</hi> whereof only our queſtion is. A <hi>mad man</hi> or <hi>fool</hi> may ſuffer though they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern it not; a <hi>dead</hi> man, who is not annihilated but lives in his better part, may ſuffer in his <hi>memory, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, friends</hi> here; much more while he lives may he without folly deſire to avert ſuch ſufferings, but he that is not, is not capable of any of theſe: and if I were ſure, that <hi>to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> I ſhould be <hi>nothing,</hi> no real conſideration of my ſelf (but either preſent care of <hi>others</hi> good, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

So again <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of poſſible felicity is to any one that hath being a real puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe he is a looſer, though not ſenſible of what he hath loſt; but to him that is <hi>not,</hi> 'tis an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>nullity,</hi> and were a man ſure to be annihilate, the fear of this were unreaſonable, for that time when he ſhould be nothing, and the only thing that renders it reaſonable <hi>now</hi> is becauſe he hath a <hi>being,</hi> and hopes to continue it, or (whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he is ſeduced to <hi>believe</hi> to the contrary) yet ſtill he <hi>deſires</hi> it, and as long as he hath life, may well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and cannot chooſe but wiſh all the accompliſhments and even ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it: and at once fear the loſs of life, and all felicities which either do or may accompany life. But ſtill
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55220:59"/>
this man's being <hi>ſubject</hi> to this <hi>fear,</hi> becauſe capable of the cauſes of it, is no proof of his being puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, who is ſuppoſed <hi>not to be</hi>: he that hath a <hi>being,</hi> and deſires the continuance of it, ſuffers when he looſeth it; but he that hath no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is not to be eſteemed by theſe meaſures, any more then he that hath never yet been, is this day pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by not being created, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived till to morrow. Nor to this is it any way conſequent, as is objected, that the <hi>deſire</hi> of <hi>everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting</hi> life ſhould not be a <hi>reaſonable</hi> deſire. For though it be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>fear</hi> the <hi>privation</hi> of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable deſire, yet this fear is only incident to him that hath a being, and he that hath no being cannot have deſire, how reaſonable ſoever it is for him, that hath a being, to have it.</p>

                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:55220:60"/>The <hi>Sadduces</hi> had a being when they deſir'd <hi>praiſe,</hi> and though they believed no <hi>immortality</hi> of <hi>ſouls,</hi> yet they believed <hi>durability</hi> of <hi>memory,</hi> and memory was a kind of <hi>image</hi> of <hi>life</hi>; and they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of the <hi>body</hi> might take ſome content in the <hi>ſhadow</hi>; but even that a meer ſhadow and phanſy too, which alſo would be at an end, whenſoever their being were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be ſo.

Of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the place in the Prophet <hi>Iſ.</hi> 66.24.

the <hi>Beaſt and the Prophet ſhall be tormented for ever and ever.</hi> And if you ſhall demand, why I ſaid not this thus particularly in the <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> and <hi>Annotations</hi> on the places of the <hi>Revelation</hi>?

                  <p>Now for the <hi>exceptions</hi> to <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.10. I muſt adde ſomewhat. 1. 'tis ſuggeſted that that ſeems not to be ſpoken of the <hi>laſt</hi> final
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55220:69"/>
                     <hi>judgment.</hi> I grant it is not, but of the houre of <hi>death,</hi> whereon I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe wicked mens Soules caſt into the Fire of Hell, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſcued from thence, till Body and Soul together at the day of <hi>doom</hi> being joyned in thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they are ſhut up thither to all eternity. <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted that it ſeems not to be meant of <hi>Hell</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Gehenna,</hi> into which none were ever caſt alive i. e. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt death. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that to be <hi>cast alive into Hell</hi> is a phraſe like to that of <hi>going down quick into</hi> Hell, uſed of them whom the earth ſwallowed up. Wherein 'tis more then poſſible that ſuch notorious ſinners might go, Bodies and Soules together, to Hell, without any previous ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by death; by the ſame <hi>analogy</hi> whereby we believe that <hi>Enoch</hi> and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55220:69"/>
                     <hi>Elias</hi> went up, bodies and ſouls, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven without ſeeing death; and whereby we believe the ſame of thoſe that ſhall be found alive at <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s coming, both wicked and Godly. But then, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> if this be not certain enough to be adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to, then the phraſe will ſignify as <hi>ſuddenly</hi> and <hi>really</hi> to be caſt into thoſe Flames, and there to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, as they could be imagin'd to be, if bodies and ſouls together, they ſhould be caſt <hi>alive</hi> thither; and ſo this is a direct prejudice to the <hi>ſleeping</hi> of their <hi>ſouls,</hi> or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any interval of reſt from their paſſing out of this <hi>life,</hi> and their entring into the torments of <hi>hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the places in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> ſome things are added, to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off from their force. <hi>Firſt,</hi> a <hi>deſperation</hi> of any certain <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> of that book. To which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55220:70"/>
I <hi>anſwer,</hi> that 'tis but a <hi>panick</hi> and popular <hi>fear,</hi> which is the author of that deſperation, and keeping men from the ſtudy of it, makes it neceſſarily unintelligible; whereas <hi>Firſt,</hi> there be many repeted paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Chriſt in it, deſigned on purpoſe to excite men to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> there are evident <hi>characters,</hi> which ſerve as <hi>keyes</hi> to the underſtanding of it, and nothing but the ſeeking and fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depths and myſteries in it, hath made it ſo myſterious: the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning neareſt to literal, and ſuch, as by comparing it with other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, appears to be the one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical ſignification of each paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, will be found to be the trueſt; and they that ſtrein higher, and ſeek farther off, to find what was never intended by the <hi>inſpirer,</hi> or the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuenſis,</hi> are the men that have
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55220:70"/>
made this Prophecy <hi>obſcure,</hi> which would otherwiſe be as perſpicuous as any one of the greater Prophets of the <hi>Old Teſtament. Secondly,</hi> when 'tis ſuggeſted, that the places for <hi>interminable</hi> paines are but <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> and thoſe oppoſed to as many <hi>hundreds,</hi> which are to be alleaged againſt this ſence; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that as few or as many as they are, (it matters not for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, one <hi>affirmation</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s will eſtabliſh a truth) <hi>Firſt,</hi> they accord with many others in writings not obſcure or prophetick. <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is no one (much leſs many hundreds) producible to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſence, as hath hitherto appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by examining all ſuch as were pretended to be oppoſite, but were found very reconcileable with the ſence. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> when the obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the writer is again mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55220:71"/>
that hath been already ſpoken to on the firſt place.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the reaſons which are uſed to ſecure the places for eternal life for to ſignify that, though eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments be not allowed to be properly eternal, I have little to ſay, becauſe I fully acknowledg that importance of the word <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> whether to bliſſe or wo. And I think it hath already appeared, that there are not theſe reaſons of difference between them as now are mentioned. For, <hi>firſt,</hi> as there are no texts in the Goſpel which ſeem to oppoſe the abſolute ſence of eternity in the promiſes, ſo thoſe that were thought to ſeem to oppoſe the abſolute eternity of the threats, having been brought to tryal have been found very light; and, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the doctrine of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments truly ſtated and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55220:71"/>
from the miſtakes by men introduced into the doctrine, hath appeared moſt credible alſo to thoſe that believe the Goſpel; and as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to God's juſtice as he is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Univerſe, and as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his goodneſs, who earne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly averts their dying that will needs dy, as the eternal promiſes are reconcileable to all the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that as there are negatives that irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly confirme the truth of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle concerning eternal life, ſo there are affirmatives and negatives both (each is therefore is not quenched) that as irrefragably eſtabliſh the truth of the doctrine of eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. As for the <hi>Philoſophical</hi> doctrine of the <hi>immortality</hi> of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> I yield it can import no more, then either its not being corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from any outward principles,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55220:72"/>
nor deſtructible from any created power; I yield it (for all that) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructible by God, but have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly anſwered how that place <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. hath nothing to do with his will or purpoſe to <hi>annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> as for <hi>tradition,</hi> as that ſignifies the <hi>ſuffrages</hi> of all the men in the world, <hi>Heathens</hi> of all ſorts, <hi>Jews</hi> of all ſects, <hi>Mahometans, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> heretical as well as orthodox, it matters not though this doctrine be not deduced by ſuch abſolutely univerſal tradition. I yield that many <hi>Heathens</hi> there were that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi> it not, that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed it, that the <hi>Jews</hi> now adaies care for none but <hi>themſelves,</hi> and ſo make no proviſion for <hi>other</hi> men, that there have been <hi>Origeniſt</hi> Hereticks, and ſome ſuch as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> mentions <hi>Enchir: c.</hi> 12<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

ſo much, when it appears by his <hi>bargaine</hi> that he himſelf thus valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and willingly took it at this price, and hath now chang'd his mind on no other conſideration, but becauſe the enjoyment, for which alone he valued it, is paſt, and none but the <hi>payment</hi> behind, which conſider'd by it ſelf, every man acknowledges to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful part; and ſo he did when yet on intuition of the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant he made choice of it.</p>
                     <p>I have thus far enlarg'd to give you a clearer view of the force of the <hi>option</hi> in this matter, then I can diſcerne you to have had of it; and conſequently to ſhew you the inſufficiency of the reaſon on which you reject it, when you ſay, that upon this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> it ſhould ſeem to be concluded, that <hi>eternal life</hi> is owing to Piety <hi>ex juſtitia.</hi> But
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55220:80"/>
to this I reply: 1. That it were no newes from S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                     <hi>Paul,</hi> affirms, that <hi>good works are the effect of true faith,</hi> means either that true faith, where e're it is, is <hi>able</hi> to <hi>produce</hi> good works, though it do not alwaies actually produce them; or elſe, that it <hi>actually</hi> and neceſſarily <hi>produceth</hi> them.

them, and yet never actually produceth them; and ſo the man that is ſuppoſed to be juſtiffied by faith, never be able to <hi>ſhew</hi> his <hi>works,</hi> which St. <hi>James</hi> requires of him, and conſequently his faith be a <hi>dead</hi> faith, i. e. not able to juſtify.

not good works; being ready, if it did produce good works, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it true faith; which how guilty it is of thoſe two faults in diſputing, <hi>circulus</hi> and <hi>petitio prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipii,</hi> I think is manifeſt to any.

                     </gap>ng, I have but one way of arguing left me; <hi>firſt,</hi> to demand his <hi>definition</hi> of true <hi>faith,</hi> and whatſoever defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition he gives, to prove that faith, in that notion of his, is the cauſe of good works, at the moſt, but as a man is the cauſe of a child, a true perfect, univocal cauſe of the effect, when the effect is produced; but yet ſuch a one, as might have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended that action, by which it was produced, and ſo might have been as truly a man without the actual producing of that effect, as he is now, he hath produced it: that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55220:84"/>
is, that <hi>faith</hi> is a <hi>rational</hi> or moral, not <hi>natural</hi> agent, working <hi>freely,</hi> not <hi>neceſſarily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To bring this operation to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, I will ſuppoſe this <hi>definition</hi> of faith to be given me (which by them that affirm good works to be an effect of <hi>faith</hi> is ordinarily given) that it <hi>is a fiducial aſſent to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Chriſt.</hi> Where that I may not miſtake him, I muſt firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whether he conceives theſe <hi>promiſes,</hi> which are the object of his faith, to be <hi>abſolute,</hi> or <hi>conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> If he affirm them abſolute, made to mens <hi>perſons,</hi> or individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Entityes,</hi> without reſpect to their <hi>qualifications</hi> or demeanors, then ſurely that faith, which ſuppoſeth all kind of qualifications of the ſubject ſo <hi>unneceſſary,</hi> will never ſo much as move me to produce <hi>good works,</hi> becauſe I may as well
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55220:84"/>
be ſaved without them, the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being ſuppoſed without condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore he that affirms good works to avail nothing in the buſineſs of attaining to ſalvation, cannot, without contradicting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſay, that his <hi>faith</hi> muſt <hi>neceſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> produce good <hi>works,</hi> if it be a ſaving faith: for ſure all that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity proceeds from a <hi>believing,</hi> that without good <hi>works</hi> there is no <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> to be had; which if it be not believed, that neceſſity ceaſeth. But if he affirm the <hi>promiſes,</hi> which are the object of his faith, to be <hi>conditional,</hi> then I muſt ask, what he takes this condition to be, either <hi>faith</hi> alone, or good <hi>works</hi> alone, or <hi>faith and good works</hi> together: if <hi>faith</hi> alone, then (beſide the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs of that, in making the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> that I ſhall be <hi>ſaved,</hi> the only <hi>ground</hi> of my <hi>believing</hi> I ſhall
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55220:85"/>
be <hi>ſaved</hi>) the former inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence recurrs again, that that <hi>faith</hi> which ſuppoſeth faith only to be a <hi>condition</hi> of the promiſes, will find good works as <hi>unneceſsary,</hi> as that faith which ſuppoſ'd the promiſes to be <hi>abſolute,</hi> and ſo will never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline me to them neither. If he affirm the <hi>condition</hi> of the promiſes to be good <hi>works</hi> alone (I mean by good works all other graces beſides faith, <hi>contrition, amendment</hi> of life, <hi>charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holyneſſe</hi> &amp;c.) then he acknowledgeth, that theſe good works are of themſelves ſimply <hi>requir'd</hi> of a man that is, or will be a believer; and ſo that they are no neceſſary <hi>effect</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> for if they were, it would be enough to require <hi>faith alone,</hi> and they would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly follow without requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.

ſomething that is neceſſarily annext to the poſſeſſion of the <hi>demiſe.</hi> If he affirm <hi>faith and good works</hi> neither ſingle, but both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to be the total adaequate condition of the promiſes, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>faith conſummate by charity,</hi> St. <hi>James, faith made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by works,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> again <gap reason="foreign">

(which certainly is the <hi>truth</hi>) then firſt I muſt admoniſh him, that his <hi>fiducial aſsent,</hi> by which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines faith, muſt not ſignify a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving with <hi>reliance,</hi> that he is one of them that ſhall be partakers of what is promiſed, which they are wont to call ſpecial faith, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>application</hi>; for that muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppoſe them to have <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> the <hi>condition,</hi> and ſo good works in them (yea and faith) muſt be before faith; or elſe it is the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> confidently of a <hi>lye,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

abſolutely <hi>falſe,</hi> that the thing <hi>promiſed</hi> belongs to any that hath not performed the <hi>condition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But his fiducial <hi>aſſent,</hi> if it be a tolerable <hi>definition</hi> of faith, muſt be (anſwerable to the <hi>promiſes</hi>) on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, a believing and <hi>relying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional</hi>; that he ſhall be partaker of what is <hi>promiſed,</hi> that is, a <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> (and depending on it) that <hi>God</hi> will not <hi>fail</hi> him, if he <hi>fail</hi> not <hi>God</hi>; that God will give him <hi>heaven,</hi> if he perform ſincere <hi>obedience,</hi> and rely upon the gift of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not on any merit of his <hi>obedience</hi> for the attaining of it. Now to ſay the truth, this <hi>fiducial aſſent</hi> thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd (and none but this) may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be affirm'd to be a moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motive to me to produce <hi>good works</hi>; but then it is as true, that it is as powerful a motive to me to rely on the gift of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo in that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55220:86"/>
reſpect <hi>faith</hi> may be ſaid to <hi>produce</hi> good <hi>works,</hi> faith may alſo be ſaid to produce that which they call <hi>faith,</hi> i. e. the believing, that if I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and rely, I ſhall be ſaved, is a motive thus to produce actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying; and in this ſence I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg both (if he, with whom I diſpute, will thank me for it.) But then, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> it follows not that that which is a powerful <hi>motive,</hi> is a <hi>cauſe</hi> neceſſarily producing, becauſe that motive is but a <hi>moral motive,</hi> perſwading not enforcing, and man by corruption, or by ſome prevailing temptation may reſiſt that motive, and I think 'twould be no <hi>Paradox</hi> to ſay, that ſome men have made no doubt of the truth of God's conditional promiſes, i. e. have verily perſwaded themſelves, that if they <hi>ſerved God</hi> ſincerely, they ſhall be <hi>ſaved,</hi> and yet quite
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55220:87"/>
                     <hi>neglected</hi> God's <hi>ſervice:</hi> and if it be objected, that they want the <hi>fiduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> though they have the <hi>aſsent,</hi> and that if they had the <hi>affiance,</hi> they would aſſuredly produce <hi>good works</hi>; I anſwer, that by that <hi>affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> they mean either abſolute <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance</hi> that they ſhall be ſaved, (and that, if it be not an error, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth <hi>good works,</hi> if it be, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them not) or elſe a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>affiance</hi>; and then again I affirm of that, that it is no more then what I expreſt by making no manner of <hi>doubt,</hi> but if they <hi>ſerve God</hi> ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſhall be <hi>ſaved</hi>; which though I believe to be a moſt <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motive</hi> to obedience, yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not a <hi>neceſsary</hi> irreſiſtible <hi>cauſe,</hi> (becauſe 'tis only a moral motive) nay nor that that alwaies produceth the effect. <hi>Firſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>fooliſh virgins</hi> had as much

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55220:88"/>
the <hi>Fire</hi> to <hi>burne,</hi> the <hi>Water</hi> to <hi>moyſten</hi> &amp;c. 4. Becauſe there is a difference obſerved in Scripture between a <hi>working</hi> and a <hi>non wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Faith,</hi> and the priviledges are beſtowed only on the firſt, by which it is plain, that it is poſſible for it not to worke. 5. Becauſe <hi>faith is</hi> ſaid to <hi>be made perfect by works</hi> Jam. 2.22. which ſure an agent cannot be ſaid to be by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing an effect, which it cannot but produce; as the act of <hi>Humecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> adds no degree of perfection to the <hi>water.</hi> Nay 'tis a general rule, that the <hi>producing</hi> of what <hi>effect</hi> ſoever adds no perfection to the <hi>cauſe,</hi> ſave only <hi>relative</hi>; as the begetting of <hi>a Sonne</hi> adds only the relation of a <hi>Father,</hi> but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe more then he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; it rather ſuppoſeth him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect before, which is the importance
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55220:88"/>
of the <hi>Logick</hi> axiom, <hi>effectus eſt extra naturam cauſae.</hi> All that can truly and in propriety of ſpeech be ſaid of Faith in this matter, is this; that <hi>Faith</hi> is ſo ſtrong a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> to <hi>obedience,</hi> that if it be drawn as a Weapon to the purpoſe, and uſed as it ſhould, it would in reaſon <hi>out-ballance</hi> all the contrary <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> to diſobedience: &amp; if the <hi>will,</hi> which hath the caſting voice, give its ſuffrage, as in <hi>reaſon</hi> it ought, it ſhall then infallibly produce <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet not <hi>irreſiſtibly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>will</hi> being ſtill a <hi>free faculty</hi> at leaſt to evill, may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the propoſal of motives either <hi>ſuſpend</hi> its Action, or elſe do that which it ſhould not. For ſure it is an error of <hi>Socinus</hi> to affirme <hi>cognitionem rerum pulchra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum aut turpium, quales praeter alias ſunt res honestae &amp; vitioſae; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55220:89"/>
odium, illarum amorem neceſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riò gignere</hi>; and that <hi>Socrate's</hi> ſpeech (<hi>praeſente ſcientia fieri non poſse ut quis incontinens ſit</hi>) was true, with this Caution, <hi>ut quis ſciat res ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtas, eas facienti magnum commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum allaturas</hi> def. diſp. de loco c. 7. ad Rom. &amp; in 1 Joh. 4.8. If by <hi>amor</hi> and <hi>odium</hi> he mean <hi>proſecutio</hi> and <hi>averſatio,</hi> as 'tis plaine he doth by that which followes. For ſure <hi>Medea</hi> was not deceived in her ſelf when ſhe ſaid, <hi>video meliora probo<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan>, deteriora ſequor.</hi> And ſo many, who make no doubt of an <hi>Heaven</hi> to belong to all penitent reformed <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>Chriſts,</hi> and that that <hi>Heaven</hi> conteines <hi>joyes</hi> above all that the World can afford, do yet chooſe the <hi>pleaſures of ſin for the preſent ſeaſon</hi>; like <hi>Ephraim</hi> that is likened to an <hi>heifer that loved to tread out the Corn,</hi> betook her ſelf to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55220:89"/>
that courſe which for the preſent yielded ſome profit (as the Heifer being by the Law then unmuſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, might eat as ſhe troad it out) that had its reward at that minute, that ſhe did the Work. Whence is all this? but from hence, that the carnal pleaſures of ſin for the <hi>preſent</hi> obtaine the conſent of the will againſt all the <hi>future</hi> pleaſures and joyes of Heaven, joyn'd with the ſowerneſſe of preſent obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; which could never be, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the promiſes allwaies either neceſſarily, or infallibly produced good works.</p>
