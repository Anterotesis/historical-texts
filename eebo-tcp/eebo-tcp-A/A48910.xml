            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But e're I proceed, since he has been liberal to evince the intricate and difficult way of your proceeding by an Experiment of his own (<hi>Pag.</hi> 25.) the Ground indeed of his whole Discourse, and (being truely applied) the Square of all mens Understanding; to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60188:3"/>
out of his debt (taking it for granted, how ignorant soever he renders you, you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the degrees of Comparison) I'le tell you a Tale:</p>
            <p>Once upon a time, when I was a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, had got a smack'ring of the <hi>Syntax,</hi> could Sing my Part, put three or four Parts together in Musick, and Play a <hi>Voluntary</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> on the <hi>Organ</hi> (perhaps well enough for the time) I began to admire my own excellency, despise others, and (<hi>Lucifer</hi>-like) thought on nothing but setting up for my self; not doubting, but fame and fortune would attend those so suddenly acquired accomplishments, which they (silly fellows) had been so long groping after to so little purpose. But here my good <hi>Genius</hi> put a stop to my cariere, and (with a <hi>Seest thou a man wise in his own eyes? there is more hope of a Fool than of him</hi>) prevented the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of my folly; that by longer study and experience I might become sensible of the vanity and impudency of it. And truly when I began to write <hi>Man,</hi> and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd in the world, it prov'd so; for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the fair progress I had made, I found I was but at the beginning of my journey: which, the more seriously I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on, the closer it obliged me to proceed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60188:3"/>
cautiously, and not judge of any thing I was not certain I knew.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, you have the priviledge to make what application you please: mine is to keep within compass in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>Be pleas'd then to know, that about three years since, our <hi>Vniversal Essayer</hi> made his address to me for instruction in <hi>Composition</hi>; but I, never having contriv'd any method that way, referr'd him to Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi>'s <hi>Compendium of Practical Musick</hi> for the first Rudiments, and to Mr. <hi>Birabensha</hi> (his now Publisher) for his further advance; assuring him I knew no man fitter for that purpose; it being in a manner his whole business. This advice was civilly and kindly taken, and after a short time put in execution. But e're the Sun had run his Annual Circuit the case was alter'd; such pretty canting Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions came so innocently nibling after Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that I knew not whether they were proposed by way of joke or in earnest, till (I know not how) a Brother broke out, <hi>'Tis another Circulation of the Blood!</hi> and then, O then 'twas I began to suspect that Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summer Moon lasted all the year; though the several favours I had receiv'd from the Family (which I shall always acknowledge)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60188:4"/>
kept me within the bounds of modesty, and fed me with hopes of a farther discovery.</p>
            <p>Which there was no appearance of (not so much as by way of hint, for a <hi>Vniversal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi>) till the last Summer, and that by accident too; for meeting with Mr. <hi>Iohn Carr,</hi> a Seller of Instruments in the <hi>Middle-Temple,</hi> I had the favour of a running view both of it and the <hi>Publishers</hi> Preface, and withall, a request to write somewhat in commendation of it: which how in civility to refuse, or in respect of my own reputation to do (being ignorant of many particulars therein, and not well satisfied in others that I thought I understood) I knew not. However, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity prevailing over good Nature, his desire in innocent Drollery (in hopes to occasion a more serious survey of those many bold and unmanly aspertions in it) I endeavour'd thus to comply with.</p>

It is intricate and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be understood, it afflicts the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and consumeth much time before the knowledge thereof can be attained, because the Cliffs are divers, their transpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition frequent, and the order and places of Notes very mutable, and their deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60188:6"/>
alterable and unfix'd. These things being consider'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Behold the Platform of insignificant Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation! first complain, then propose, next reform if you can: 'tis no matter which way. But who can help it? <hi>What's bred in the bone will ne're out of the flesh:</hi> and you know 'tis hard crossing Proverbs; however I shall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly pass him by, as a Gentleman (I fear) strugling under an obligation beneath either his Birth, Education, or Knowledge, and proceed.</p>
            <p>Be pleas'd then to observe, that the first Chapter is nothing to the purpose of his <hi>Vniversal Character,</hi> but for the most part a bare Discourse of Musicks Advantages over other Recreations, without so much as taking notice of the Divine Use thereof, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the many Commands and Examples recounted in holy Writ to that purpose. I will not be so severe as to judge it a wilful omission: but I'le assure you it looks very odd. The rest of it (after Teazing the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry for some miscarriages in other Recreations) is made up with a serious invitation, and solemn assurance, that as Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick never begger'd any, so it never made any rich; that is to say in plain <hi>English:</hi>
               <q>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60188:6"/>
                  <l>When you've done all, and gape for gains,</l>
                  <l>You reap your <hi>labour</hi> for your <hi>pains.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Encouragement enough doubtless for such as shall make it their business to follow his Tract; and perchance agreeable to some who have been conversant within the narrow cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of his progress. But as to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of that Profession abroad, there is no knowing Traveller, that dares speak truth, but will assure him, they live as splendidly, with as much respect, as large rewards, and as many advantages to enrich themselves (if they please) as any Professors of any Art or Science whatsoever. And at home, were he not very short sighted, he might with ease meet with those who have made fair pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases; and, were they so inclin'd, could still adventure the buying of a good Benefice, without the least assistance of their frugal Parents. But <hi>ex Pede Hercules</hi>; from this praise and contempt, you may guess at your future usage.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>second</hi> and <hi>third Chapter,</hi> to carry on a thorough Reformation, the Axe is laid to the Root, and in a moment, you and all <hi>Musical</hi> Mankind living are made Conjurers and Stults. But who hath not heard of Frier <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Oracle! However, be not daunted for a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60188:7"/>
hasty word, nor doubt of setting the Saddle on the right Horse; <hi>for the proof of the Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is in the Eating,</hi> as the learned <hi>Sanca Panca</hi> has it; and though <hi>comparisons are odious,</hi> as the saying is, yet to compare Notes is not: And therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60188:7"/>This Scale contains or implies the compass of all Voyces and Instruments by Alphabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and Gradual Motion; so that wherever either of the three Cliffs are plac'd, that Character or Cliff takes with it so much of the Scale as is pertinent to the Voyce or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument it is applied to for any single Part.</p>
            <p>His new Scale of G. A. B. C. D. E. F. G. confusedly divides it self at every <hi>Octave Note</hi> or <hi>Tone,</hi> and consequently Tinker-like instead of mending one hole makes two or three, imposing a necessity of more muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and perplexity, where each part en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys its own latitude, than was or could be in the old, and (by not planting the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his second <hi>Octave</hi> inclusive to the first) making that same <hi>Note</hi> or <hi>Tone</hi> to be in several places or distances at the same time; and from this I make my exceptions against his whole Book.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60188:8"/>
if it be not worthy the Author let the world judge.</p>
            <p>From this fixedness (for so he'l have it) ariseth and destruction of his whole design, and indeed, makes it appear that he either understands not, or wilfully mistakes the proper use of the old Scale as to <hi>Vocal Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi>; for in the first Septinary thereof there is implied the three manners of Naming the Notes in Singing, by <hi>sharp, natural,</hi> and <hi>flat,</hi> each taking its rise from the Syllable <hi>Vt, &amp;c.</hi> as in the former Scale is demonstrated, (of which more hereafter.) Now the <hi>Natural</hi> contains the compass of the generality of Mens Voyces, and is thus set down by us:

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But by his new found way thus:

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Or by the addition of two lines more thus:

                  <l>
                     <gap reason="music">

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Or with as many above, if he prick in his B Thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60188:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>So that either it leaves not room to put words under your Notes, or forces you to skip from one of his <hi>Hieroglyphical Characters</hi> to another,
<q>
                  <l>Like to a Bird from Tree to Tree,</l>

            <p>Which how inventingly it shews, and how cunningly it runs into the perplexities before-mentioned, none can be ignorant that have Eyes in their heads.</p>
            <p>The same 'tis in the superiour Part for the Voyce, which generally takes up the same compass, and is regularly set down by us, thus:

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But by his reform'd way, thus:

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Or by the addition of two lines to his Man T, which is far worse.</p>
            <p>And in this he might have convinc'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, had he but taken the pains to have transcrib'd the Tune of <hi>Aurelia</hi> in the <hi>Key</hi> proper for singing it, which ought to be thus planted:

            <p>And if some Teachers of <hi>Vocal Musick</hi> write their single <hi>Ayres</hi> by the <hi>G Cliff,</hi> 'tis rather to assist those who learn by Ear only, <hi>by the Violin,</hi> (that being the proper <hi>Cliff</hi> for that Instrument, and that Instrument more generally known and used than any other, and always in Unison with the Voyce for that Part, if truly tuned and applied,) than in the least to contradict our certain Method of the Scale; which never gives so much as occasion for the chopping and changing of <hi>Cliffs,</hi> or writing in Improper <hi>Keys</hi>; one or both of which he must of necessity do, if he'l stick to his own Principles; the whimsies of his <hi>Lieger Line</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 23.) and <hi>Exotick Notes</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 73.) not at all mending the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whatever he pretends; but rather <hi>(Sir Positive-like)</hi> declares <hi>that</hi> not to be which really is; for do but observe how facile to the Eye (which <hi>pag.</hi> 41 he seems to be a friend to) a <hi>Double Relish</hi> appears our way:

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60188:15"/>By these Examples (which are not propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed so much to signifie the conveniency and necessity of removing the <hi>Cliffs</hi> according to our Scale and Method, as to revive, if possible the excellent and almost lost kind of Musick call'd <hi>Canon</hi>) it appears that all his abusive Rhetorick tends to nothing more, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne what is <hi>self-evident,</hi> and (to make a new <hi>Common-wealth</hi>) set up supposition, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and <hi>if</hi> so, why <hi>then</hi> so, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to reign in its stead; as if there were no certainer way in the World to make a Man clear sighted, but putting out his Eyes.</p>
            <p>And his <hi>Scheme</hi> of our <hi>Cliffs</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 21.) which he would fain render ridiculous and useless, is sufficient to convince any rational Man, that has studied Musick, of the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of retaining them: For by the <hi>C Cliff</hi> is understood (and universally so used) not only a <hi>Tenor,</hi> but a <hi>Contra-tenor,</hi> and a <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>lower Mean</hi>; whereby the Parts of a regular Composition are fix'd in their proper places; which by his way cannot be done, without the transposition of his darling Letters BMT. And the <hi>B Cliffs, flat</hi> and <hi>sharp,</hi> are so essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially necessary, that without them 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to compleat Harmony; which, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (if I guess right) made him give quarter and confine them: but how contradictory to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60188:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his own Hand and Seal <hi>pag.</hi> 32. and the Plate of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> we'l manifest when we come to the Nomination of Notes. So that after all the gay assurances of his plain and easie Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, instead of <hi>after Saturday night comes Sunday morning,</hi> as he tells us <hi>pag.</hi> 73. we are to accept of <hi>after Sunday morning comes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday night</hi>; and in lieu of a <hi>compleat Body,</hi> be contented with a <hi>lame Foot, half a Head,</hi> and <hi>one single Gut.</hi> But enough of this. The following Observations, and comparing both Scales, will assure you the Author is no Changeling, and that his whole piece is of a lump.</p>
            <p>His assuring his Reader (<hi>pag.</hi> 14.) <hi>that you cannot declare a Note to be in a different Octave, because their Names are different in every Octave,</hi> is false; for the Cliffs and Scale distinguishes them by <hi>Capital, single</hi> and <hi>double Italick Letters,</hi> as before is set down.</p>
            <p>His swallowing the old way of Alphabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Numeration, without giving any account why he commences with G and not A, (as the honest Horn-books and Kalenders do,) was no small oversight; for had he done it, it might in some measure have answered the hungry Gapers after his <hi>pretended Invention and Reformation</hi>; but being omitted, they still remain Seekers: And I with them, had
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60188:16"/>
there not been a happy accident of meeting with an Acquaintance and worthy Neighbour of his; who assured me, the sole reason of his proceeding that way, was, because G was the <hi>Dominical Letter</hi> that Year he writ: which, how admirably it demonstrates the Excellency of his Invention, the very Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his dear Cronies as it seems (<hi>pag.</hi> 78.) will confess, and give him thanks for. But in earnest, had I occasion to quarrel with that account, I should have thought it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to have reform'd it, by taking the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet end wise; which, in all probability, would have freed us from those perplexities he says we are involv'd in, and those we are sure he would lead us in.</p>
            <p>His arguing upon supposition, that the <hi>fiction words</hi> of the <hi>Gam-vt</hi> (for so he's pleased to <hi>dip</hi> them <hi>pag.</hi> 15.) were originally design'd to shew the place of <hi>Mi,</hi> is of the same stamp; for they were Syllables pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely chosen as most proper for opening the Mouth and putting forth the Voyce, every Vowel mastering his fellow Consonant, and every Syllable properly signifying a more <hi>Grave</hi> or <hi>Acuter</hi> Sound in relation to their plantation: which, had he been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in <hi>Vocal Musick,</hi> he might sufficiently have experienc'd, or indeed with common
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60188:17"/>
sense; for <hi>either</hi> would have satisfied him, that the Consonant Letters concluding any word, do generally in their pronounciation force the Tongue either against the Teeth, Roof of the Mouth, stop the Mouth, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an unpleasant hesitation: For Example, <hi>stop, mouth, from, which, his, tub, &amp;c.</hi> His asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the former Syllables are now become useless, because <hi>English Musicians</hi> have laid aside <hi>Vt</hi> and <hi>Re,</hi> is like the rest; for if some have, some have not; and in foreign parts they are generally us'd for the same reasons above mentioned. But what's this to the purpose of his <hi>Vniversal Character?</hi> 'tis the <hi>Thing</hi> not the <hi>Name</hi> we contest for; the <hi>Names</hi> being not so much as necessary Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents (as is manifest in all <hi>Instrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi>) but onely convenient Assistances for young Beginners: yet this is the great <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> our little <hi>David</hi> has undertaken to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat!

            <p>I am weary of Citing; let the Reader if he please, for want of better employment, peruse him, and accordingly judge.</p>
            <p>His telling us that a Beginner may learn as well his way, as ours, is as much to the purpose, as if I were to teach one to read, should perswade him A signified <hi>Blockhead</hi>; or a Mother, her Child may sooner learn to go on <hi>all four</hi> than <hi>upright,</hi> because a Puppy
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60188:18"/>
(commonly his first play-fellow) gave him an Example.</p>
            <p>The referring us to the <hi>French Musicians</hi> for placing their G in the lower Line, assures he understands not their Musick; for they use it onely in such Tunes as are made for Dancing; where they never descend below that Cliff, but frequently into that which he would wheedle in, under the appellation of an <hi>higher Octave,</hi> for invention sake. All other Parts they write as we, and the rest of the Musical part of the World. Though to save the labour of going into <hi>France,</hi> I do assure both him and you, that I can produce Compositions of Dr. <hi>Taverner</hi> (who lived in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time) and other his Cotemporaries, with that very individual G, in the very same Line where he would make the World believe he invented it to be.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Viol,</hi> which he seems most Knight Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly to take for a distressed Lady, and to fight her relief; instead of accomplishing it (O Misfortune in so great an Adventure!) he has both pinion'd and fetter'd her; for where the old Tuning gives her the fair li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of all sorts of <hi>Keys</hi> in all kinds of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick for that Instrument, with a far greater advantage to the hand than any other, he confines her to one that can hardly do either,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60188:19"/>
saving such lean stuff as <hi>Fortune my Foe,</hi> or <hi>Iohn come kiss me now</hi>; and them well nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without the removing a String half a Note higher or lower at every Tune; which how ridiculous it is, when compar'd with his plausible pretences, is enough to make an healthy Man sick, and a rational mad. But in that, I blame not him so much as his <hi>Publisher,</hi> who hath been a profess'd <hi>Violist,</hi> and consequently could not be ignorant of the impossibility of it. The Example he sets down, made by Mr. <hi>Chr. Simpson</hi> for Children (for it seems the <hi>Vniversal Character</hi> can reach no farther) contradicts his long pleading for four lines only in a Part, the first Note thereof after his B beginning in a Sixth, and more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms my Example of putting the same Note in two places at one time: For there 'tis proposed as in different Parts, and so might be liable to exception, being he tells us no Part must mind what another does (but keep every <hi>Octave</hi> within the System of four lines;) but here, the same Note, to be plaid on the same String and Fret, is in the same Lesson at least forty times set down in different places. Let him not pretend he is misunderstood, the thing is evident: The first Note after his B is C in the Line, the first Note after his M is the same C in the Space, and so forward;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60188:19"/>
which, what need there was for, heaven knows! I do not. For after he found 'twas impossible to carry on his Plot of <hi>Four Lines</hi> without perpetual afflicting the Mind and Eye, he humbly submits; and gives Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission for the speedy raising three, four, or more Lines (as their might be occasion) for defence of his <hi>Vniversal Character</hi>; but the filthy foul Fiend was in 't: when they came to duty, they were all false disciplin'd. If you'l satisfie your selves, you may; I suppose the Author has not bought all his Books and given them away yet.</p>

But he, for the advancement of his humble T, has left 'm emptier than <hi>Three blew Beans in a blew Bladder,</hi> not so much as allowing them the priviledge of a poor <hi>Welsh Harp</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the playing of Three Parts) without the hopping and skipping of his Servants BMT upon all occasions, as in the Example he has inserted from Mr. <hi>Thetcher,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> only for Children too: For had he presented you with what either of those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments are worthy of, Composed by the incomparable Dr. <hi>Bull,</hi> Mr. <hi>Orlando Gibbons,</hi> heretofore; Mr. <hi>Albertus Bryne,</hi> Mr. <hi>B.

of <hi>London,</hi> lately of our own Country; Senior <hi>Froscobaldi</hi> of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s in <hi>Rome,</hi> Senior <hi>Froberger</hi> of the Christian Emperial Court, Monsieur <hi>Samboneer</hi> of the <hi>French,</hi> or any other Eminent Author; it would have so evidenc'd his confus'd way, that you might without the least breach of Modesty conclude who has been dipt in Pump-water has the advantage of a Rubical Complexion, and a security from blushing, come what will.</p>
            <p>His dear Empress the <hi>Lute,</hi> which his Romantick Brethren (if he speak truth) do so infinitely admire, brings up the Rere of his Examples; but with the like success <hi>(poor dumb thing)</hi> as the rest: For at first dash (as a true friend to Confusion) he sets her at defiance with her sister Instruments, by buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing her in the head, that she is supream; which is as absolute a Tale of a Tub (how elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently soever told) as ever wanted Bottom or Truth; the <hi>Harpsechord</hi> and <hi>Organ</hi> far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding her in Compass and Parts, the <hi>Viol</hi> and <hi>Violin</hi> in lowdning, softning, and continuing a Note or Sound, <hi>Sagbuts</hi> and <hi>Cornets</hi> the same; every Instrument having one or other Excellency proper to it self: The conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of its being portable and useful at the same time is common to most other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>That</hi> true Excellency which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60188:20"/>
hers, is the making of a compleat Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort with the <hi>stop</hi> of one hand onely; which he (notwithstanding all his gay commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) has absolutely robb'd her of in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded Example of <hi>Arrons Iig,</hi> his way of writing being incapable of containing the Parts of a well-composed <hi>Lute-Lesson,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the absurdities before mentioned. And truly, had I had a mind to have abused Mr. <hi>Iohn Rogers</hi> (the eminent'st <hi>Lutenist</hi> that this Nation could ever glory in) I should hardly have thought of any thing fitter for that purpose, than the publishing to the World under his great Name so pitiful and unmasterly a piece. 'Tis not to the purpose to urge, he teaches it his Scholars; for that is only to such as are incapable of better things, which when they arrive at, he advances: As Children are cherisht with Milk, till they have Teeth and strength to eat and digest stronger Meat.</p>
            <p>By what has hitherto been said, appears the groundless, insignificant, and indeed saucy attaques of our Scale by the <hi>Essayer</hi>; whence may be evinc'd the truth of that old Saying, <hi>'Tis the easiest thing in the World to find faults, but the hardest to mend them.</hi> But 'tis no new thing: <hi>Eves</hi> Play-fellow begun, and with as much vigilance carries it on. Yet
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60188:21"/>
we must not be ungrateful; as we have been beholding to the Publisher for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring those who had no <hi>Latine</hi> to the <hi>Greek,</hi> for understanding the <hi>English</hi> of his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated <hi>Alstedius</hi>; so our ingenious Author, who supposes we ken GABCDEFG, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us to't, to assure us that the <hi>Bass</hi> is so call'd, because 'tis the Foundation of Musick. But more especially the tender Feminine Sex, if it be true what a learned Gentleman of the Authors Acquaintance and Profession, when he professed Physick, assured me: <hi>For,</hi> said he, FCG <hi>have but the bare signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of</hi> FCG, <hi>but</hi> BMT <hi>have a double sense, in the first place,</hi> Bass, Mean, <hi>and</hi> Treble; <hi>in the second, the most Essential Balsam of the World,</hi> viz. <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

But whether it be so or not, I shall not urge; 'tis sufficient for me that his standing on another Mans shoulders, signifies no more than the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Usher of the Bears his annual Procession on his dear brother Animal, who at the years end is altogether as wise as at the beginning.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the experience of those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Young-men, (Children, long since His
