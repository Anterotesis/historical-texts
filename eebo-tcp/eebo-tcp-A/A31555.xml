            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To His Grace CHRISTOPHER DUKE OF ALBEMARLE, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it pleaſe your Grace,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WERE I to preſent a Poem equal to your Grace's merit, I ſhould juſtly be guilty of a Crime un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, in addreſſing this, which contains nothing but the unpoliſh'd draughts of an incultivated Muſe, and therefore muſt implore Your Graces pardon for the Preſumption I take to ſend it into the Cenſorious World under your Grace's Patronage; all that I can ſay in it's Defence is, that though it may appear rude and diſorder'd, not ſet forth with ſo Beautiful an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, nor dreſs'd in ſuch gawdy Trappings, as the real and innate worth of the Subject ought to Challenge, yet your Grace will ſoon diſcern the foot-ſteps of a Loyal Endeavour; and indeed nothing ought to Preſume to approach your Grace's hands, but what has ſome Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Loyalty inſtamp'd upon it.</p>
            <p>If Vertue be the only Nobility, certainly there is no greater Vertue than Loyalty, and conſequently no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Nohility; it blaſts the long and tedious Rolls of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digrees, and makes <hi>Antiquity</hi> it ſelf become her adorer.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Nam Genus, &amp; Proavos, &amp; quae non fecimus ipſi Vix ea Noſtra voco—</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101379:3"/>
Yet if Nobility can be deriv'd from Anceſtors, your Grace has a double Claim to it, the unparallell'd Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your renowned Father, (whom the beſt of Kings, our preſent Sovereign, Honour'd with the Appellation of Father) render your Grace Noble, but your Vertue and unſhaken Loyalty render you much more ſo, not only an Heir to his Fortunes and Honours, but to his ſtock of Vertues, which your Grace has ſo far improv'd, that I might truly ſtile you, (and without flattery) one of the ſtrongeſt Props and Pillars both of Church and State. And, my Lord, I have all the reaſon in the world to Confirm it, when I conſider in how lofty and ſublime a <hi>Sphere</hi> his Majeſty has been pleas'd to place you, where your <hi>Grace</hi> ſhines like a Star of our firſt Magnitude, and one of the brighteſt Jewels in his Sacred Crown.</p>
            <p>This <hi>(my Lord)</hi> arms me with the Confidence to lay this my poor, yet Loyal endeavour, at your Grace's Feet, where I doubt not, but it will meet with a Candid En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. Thus once more imploring your Grace's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, wiſhing you length of Days, and a continual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Riches and Honour, I am</p>
