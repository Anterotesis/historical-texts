            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the moſt glorious King <hi>CHARLS,</hi> of <hi>Great Britain:</hi>
ARISE EVANS wiſheth, that Grace, Truth, Peace, and Glory may come to you from God the Father, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Moſt illuſtrious King,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am not fitted to direct a Speech unto ſo great a Majesty, being not vers'd in Courtly Complements, or acquainted with Princely Titles. I hope your Majesty doth not expect ſuch Language from me; nor yet, that you will deſpiſe the ſimpleneſs of the Stile: but ſeriouſly conſider, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the matter of this mean Method. I preſume the more to preſent your Majesty with theſe few Lines after ſorude a manner, (yet ſo well dreſſed as I am moſt able to pen them) becauſe I have heard of your vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Clemency and Humility, towards ſuch as were of ſo low a Rank, as I my ſelf am, even of the pooreſt of men. Therefore I beſeech your Majesty likewiſe to bear
<pb facs="tcp:43467:3"/>
with my boldneſs and preſumption in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth to you; for it will be the glory of your Royal Patience, not to look upon it contemptibly; but rather give ear to it, for that it cometh from the pure affections of a true heart towards you. If I know my own heart, <hi>Jer. 17. 9.</hi> which ſpeaketh unto you, wiſhing you eternal happineſs, both for your Soul and Body, and that your glorious ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor may ſhine in Power, and not in Words onely, which are like vain ſhadows without the ſubstance; as ſome perhaps would have themſelves ſo exalted; yea, too many are apt to flatter Princes with hollow Titles which are as empty ſhells, or nuts without kernels, yet with ſuch vain-glory, earthly Princes, (whoſe mindes are ridiculous afore God and godly men) too too much delight to be applauded. So that it is now, and it was ever ſo with God and good men, That he which humbleth himſelf, and ſlighteth ſuch earthly pomp, (though an honour truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him) is of God and good men counted moſt worthy of Honour, Favour, and Exaltation. And I hope your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty doth, and will obſerve this Rule, and not fix your ſelf upon ſuch rotten branches, (which promiſe much, yet let you ſall)
<pb facs="tcp:43467:3"/>
but upon God the ſure Rock, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of thoſe that love him, and keep his Commandments; ſo ſhall you be ſurely fixed and establiſhed. And not to trouble your Majesty with too long a Prologue, I ſhall now (God willing) ſpeak to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judges 6. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21.</hi> When the Angel of the Lord appeared unto <hi>Gideon,</hi> he ſaluted him thus, <hi>The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.</hi> And when <hi>Gideon</hi> anſwered, <hi>If the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us, that we are delivered into the hand of our enemies? And then the Lord looked upon him, and ſaid, Go in this thy might, and thou ſhalt ſave Iſrael from the hands of his enemies,</hi> (mark it) <hi>have not I ſent thee?</hi> And when <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaid, <hi>Wherewith ſhall I ſave Iſrael? my family is poor in Manaſſeth, and I am the leaſt in my father's houſe; The Lord ſaid, I will be with thee, and thou ſhalt ſmite the enemy as one man.</hi> Moreover, the Angel gave him a ſign, by touching his preſent that was upon the rock, with the end of his cane or walking-ſtaff, until the fire came out of the rock, and conſumed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And ſomething to that purpoſe was
<pb facs="tcp:43467:4"/>
done to your Majesty by this laſt riſing at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> as you may ſee by my book called, <hi>The Iron Rod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after that, <hi>Gideon</hi> ſought to know thr Lord by Sacrifice and Prayer; and the Lord made himſelf known unto him by Signs, and gave him Wiſdom, and proſpered him ſo, that with three hundred choſen men, he overthrew the numerous host of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites.</hi> Here your Majeſty may ſee what it is to ſeek the Lord. And theſe things are as properly ſpoken to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty now, as they were then to <hi>Gideon,</hi> and they will be as effectually performed to you, if with faith you receive them, (as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did,) as they were then to <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon;</hi> or, as if the ſame Angel had ſpoken them unto you: yet the caſe is not the ſame, for <hi>Gideon</hi> uſed his Sword onely; but you are to uſe firſt your Word; and if that will not, your Sword then will prevail.</p>
            <p>I have, as you ſhall finde, in this enſuing little Book, ſet down to you (if happily from your Subjects after a propitiatory manner) ſomething to ingage your Soveraign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, for your own good, and their deſire, and good of all, if your Majeſty pleaſe to comply with it; which Subjects I finde (if
<pb facs="tcp:43467:4"/>
they be real) are willing to proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before you, as ſoon as you ſhall hold forth your golden Scepter of mercy unto them, as <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> did to <hi>Eſther,</hi> Eſther <hi>6. 2, 3.</hi> And I beſeech your Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, (though you may well think me incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, to intercede between you and your People) yet hear the voice of your Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of famous memory, ſaying, <hi>Son,</hi> (for ſo he beginneth) <hi>I have offered Acts of Indempnity, and Oblivion, to ſo great a latitude, as may include all that can but ſuſpect themſelves to be any way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious</hi> or liable <hi>to the Laws, and which might ſeem to exclude all future jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and give ſecurities. I would have you alwayes propenſe to the ſame way: whenever it ſhall be deſired and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let it be granted, not onely as an Act of State-policy and neceſſity, but alſo of Chriſtian charity and choice. All I have now left me, is a power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thoſe that have deprived me of all: and, I thank God, I have a heart to do it; and joy as much in this Grace which God hath given me, as in all my former injoyments; for this is a greater Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's love to me, then any
<pb facs="tcp:43467:5"/>
proſperity can be. Be confident (as I am) that the moſt of all ſides who have done amiſs, have done ſo, not out of malice, but out of miſ-information or miſ-apprehenſion of things; none will be more loyal and faithful to me and you, then thoſe Subjects, who, ſenſible of their errors and our injuries, will feel in their ſouls moſt vehement motives to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and earneſtly deſire to make ſome reparations for their former defects. As your Quality ſets you beyond any duel with any Subject, ſo the nobleneſs of your Minde muſt raiſe you above the meditating of any revenge, or execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your anger upon the many: the more conſcious you ſhall be to your people, the more prone you will be to expect all love and loyalty from them, and to inflict no puniſhment upon them for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer miſcarriages. You will have more inward complacency in pardoning one, then in puniſhing a thouſand. And again,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for thoſe that repent of any defects in their duty toward me, as I freely forgive them in the word of a Chriſtian King, ſo I believe you will finde them truely zealous to repay with
<pb facs="tcp:43467:5"/>
intereſt, that loyalty and love to you, which was due to me, &amp;c.</hi> And, dear So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, many ſuch exhortations to preſs you to offer a free pardon to all, and not to ſeek to be revenged on any, ye have in his Book, and laſt Speech to you.</p>
            <p>Now I ſay, If a Subject had been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and that his ſonſhould forgive all the murtherers, yet the Law hath a power in it to put them to death for their actings in murthering his Father, notwithſtanding his ſon's remittance; becauſe his ſon is not a competent Judge in the cauſe. But in a King (in whom is the life of the Law) it is not ſo; for in any Caſe, and eſpecially his own Caſe, he may forgive what he will, and that muſt ſtand for Law, becauſe he is a compleat Judge, ſo that his word by the Law is made to be above the Law, as we ſee in Caſes of Remittance: for after that many have been caſt to die by the Law, the King's pardon hath ſaved them: and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever denieth this, denieth the King's <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Royal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, I ſay, There is a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Martyring and Murthering: for a Martyr offereth himſelf for the defence of the Truth of God, as our Savicur ſaith,
<pb facs="tcp:43467:6"/>
               <hi>John 10. 17, 18.</hi> He layeth down his life, none properly can be ſaid to take it from him, becauſe he hath power to lay it down, and to take it up again, elſe he is not a Martyr; but the life of him that is murthered, is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently taken from him, that though he would live upon any terms, he may not live, and he cannot help it. And your Royal Father underſtanding this, did not ſay at his death, (nor as you have it in his Speech to you) that he was <hi>murthered;</hi> but ſaid, that he was <hi>martyred.</hi> Therefore he that ſaith he was murthered, doth not onely deny him to be a Martyr, but doth alſo denie both his power and pardon, and belyeth him: for he did never pardon any for wilful murther, yet pardoneth all theſe men, being his own enemies, looking not on them as his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereres; but as they wilfully, yet ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, did ſlay him: and he would have you to pardon them in like manner.</p>
            <p>Your Royal Father following Chriſt Jeſus in it, who (as he was a King, and a pattern to all Kings for the future times) had an eye to his <hi>Perogative Royal,</hi> thus, that he gives order to his Apoſtles, concerning them that had put him to death, that if they did repent, his blood ſhould not be required of them: and
<pb facs="tcp:43467:6"/>
we ſee <hi>Peter</hi> proceeds with them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for after he had ſhewed the Jews how they had ſlain the Lord Jeſus, until they were pricked in their hearts, and made to cry out to the Apoſtles, ſaying, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> Peter doth not ſay, Tou muſt die for it; but ſaith, <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, for the remiſſion of ſins; and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Act. <hi>2. 37, 38.</hi> yet by the Jews Laws ſuch offenders were to die without mercy, <hi>Levit. 24. 17, 18.</hi> and if it had been the will of Chriſt, <hi>Peter</hi> had power enough to put them to death, as we ſee <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> were ſlain by the word of his mouth, <hi>Acts 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</hi> but herein is Chriſt's pardon or <hi>Perogative Royal</hi> ſeen.</p>
            <p>Moſt Royal Soveraign, That Text, <hi>2 Chron. 25. 3.</hi> which many urge in this Caſe, is no preſident for you to follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt, Becauſe <hi>Joaſh</hi> was murthered, <hi>2 King. 12. 20.</hi> Secondly, Becauſe we read not, that King <hi>Joaſh</hi> gave any ſuch charge to his ſon, as your Royal Father gave you, to ſhew that he forgives all his enemies, and would have
<pb facs="tcp:43467:7"/>
you to forgive them freely, if they repent and come to agreement with you. Thirdly, We read not of the repentance of them that ſlew King <hi>Joaſh;</hi> therefore it was but juſt for his ſon <hi>Amaziah,</hi> to put them to death.</p>
            <p>And it behoves your Majeſty, if there be any defects in your Father's Speech, to rectifie it by the word of Chriſt, and let not any wreſt it to a wrong ſence, contrary to his minde; for I am ſure he meant to imitate his Saviour, notwithſtanding he might fail in expreſſing his minde, through the frailty of fleſh and blood, following the cuſtomes of former Kings, whoſe conditions did not reach unto him, yet I know none that came neerer to Chriſt in word and deed, then he did. Therefore do you follow the beſt, as he did, and take <hi>Peter</hi>'s doings, <hi>Acts 2. 37, 38.</hi> for your preſident, and ſo you will honour your Father: for if you do not offer mercy to all freely without exceptions, and receivs all that will accept of your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, preferring and ſecuring them for the time to come, you wrong your ſelf, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey and diſhonour your Royal Father more then any ever yet did, by taking from him that power to forgive all; which power, (as he ſaith) all his enemies could not take from

            <p>God did appoint three ſeveral Voices to be heard of men, and obeyed upon pain of his diſpleaſure. The firſt Voice was that of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> to the children of Iſrael; and becauſe they did not obey it, all that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration fell in the wilderneſs, <hi>Heb. 3. 16, 17, 18, 19.</hi> The ſecond Voice was that of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to the Jews; and becauſe they did not obey it, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed, and the Jews, which lieth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate to this day, <hi>Heb. 4. 1, 2, 3.</hi> The third Voice is this Voice, even the Voice of your Royal Father to your Majeſty; and for not obeying it, you and your people have ſuffered hitherto; and this Voice is ſignified, <hi>Heb. 4. 7.</hi> and therefore I beſeech your Majeſty, obey it now.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Peter</hi> took the firſt ſpouſe of Chriſt (after his reſurrection) out of thoſe that had put him to death; ſo I ſee no way left for you to obtain your three Kingdomes, but by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Royal Self, to his Highneſs the Lord Protector and his Counſel; and to prevent all jealouſies, make one of his Daughters partaker of your Royal Crown; for you ſee
<pb facs="tcp:43467:8"/>
the people dare not riſe againſt him for you: this is evident by the laſt appearance for you, in moſt places of the heart of <hi>England,</hi> which if the generality of the people that are well-affected to you, had come in to them that roſe, the work had ſoon been done: and if you bring in a forraign Nation, it is like all will riſe, yea, many of your Friends will riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; for the terror of <hi>CROMWEL</hi> and his Army, is upon the people here and abroad alſo, becauſe they ſee him prevail, and that every work deviſed againſt him comes to nought: but if your Majesty ſlight this motion, it is propable in a ſhort time that his Highneſs may obtain theſe three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and have them put upon him for his own inheritance, and then the best Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> will think himſelf happy to have his Daughter to Wife.</p>
            <p>For my own part, there is none can do for you more then I have done; for I have maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Cauſe in the highest manner before your reputed greateſt enemies; and have propounded this way of union between your Majeſty &amp; his Highneſs to them; and it was well reſented by all, inſomuch that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs himſelf came to ſpeak with me, and uſed me very favourably; and I ſet them a time,
<pb facs="tcp:43467:8"/>
that the union ſhould be afore <hi>Midſummer:</hi> I pray God it be not too long afore theſe writings come to your Royal Hands.</p>
            <p>But ſome of them ſaid, They feared your Majeſty would not conſent to ſo good a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all ſides, and the Kingdoms happineſs. And once as I was propounding theſe things, the Ladies and Daughters of his Highneſs being preſent, I was demanded whether I had any commiſſion from your Majeſty to do ſuch things. I told them, No; but ſaid, I had Viſions, and a commiſſion from God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſuch things, and that I believed your Majeſty would allow of what I did, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſo reaſonable an agreement; which if you do, that high dignity which God by me ſaid ſhould be yours, ſhall undoubtedly reſt upon you: but however, it is neceſſary for your Majeſty to offer freely (from your heart) to all a general pardon and remiſſion; and if that be refuſed, God that knoweth the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and ſecrets of your heart, will raiſe you Friends unexpected, ſo that you ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail: and it muſt be ſo, becauſe juſtice is but the hand-maid of mercy, and ſhe may not go before her miſtreſs; but if her miſtreſs be affronted, ſhe immediately followeth to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge her, and then the miſtreſs rejoyceth at it, <hi>James 2. 13.</hi>

There is a party that are bloody men, of no Religion, who would have you come in by the Sword; not for any good they wiſh you, but thinking thereby to encreaſe their ſins; for now they look upon themſelves as in bondage: firſt, becauſe their means is taken from them, ſo that they cannot commit ſuch ſins as they would do, if they had plenty of money. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe they are reſtrained from their courſes of ſins by theſe men now in power, more then they were formerly; and kept out of power, being looked upon as abominable creatures, which have not the fear of God in them, and they care not much who is on the Throne, ſo that ſin and open profaneſs may be in eſteem and favour again, and they to have their means and power again, to be its favourites. Againſt ſuch a ſort of men many took up arms, &amp; againſt ſuch the Army now ſtands: and ſuch bloody irreligious men will never conſent to have you pardon all them now in power, and come to ſuch an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as aboveſaid: for if you do agree, their hope is fruſtated, ſo that then ſin ſhall domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer no more in this Kingdome.

I know there is many eyes looking upon your Royal Fathers laſt Speech to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, expecting dayly when will your general pardon come out to all according to it, which ſpecially is expected by theſe to whom it chiefly belongs, who alſo have power to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh you in your Fathers Throne; and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men may think hard of your deſerring to obey the Chriſtian command of ſo good a Father, which might prove ſo much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to his glory, and your own glory and proſperity here, and hereafter in Heaven. Be not perſwaded by any, contrary to your Father's laſt Speech unto you; for you have none ſo wiſe, nor none ſo faithful to you as he was; and therefore truſt not to their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom nor their fidelity in this thing: and if you have them about your Majeſty, that hindreth to ſend a general pardon, put them away from your preſence.</p>
            <p>It is the wiſdom of a Master to turn away all his Servants if they are grown evil ones, leſt they conſume his eſtate; and take other Servants, and to be ſure to keep them in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter order. The Court of <hi>England</hi> (as most Courts are) was grown very corrupt, when Vice was more in eſteem then Virtue, and he that wilfully brake God's Commandments
<pb facs="tcp:43467:10"/>
had in honour, while he that ſtrove to keep them was deſpiſed; ſo that men took ſin for a pleaſure, deceit for wiſdom, and folly for foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; and as the richeſt meat or beſt fruit, is moſt jubject to putrifaction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be well ſeaſoned and preſerved, elſe it will turn to noyſome worms; ſo it is in the King's Court by reaſon of the fatneſs that attends it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that except there be a ſtraight rule of ſobriety, and the love and fear of God be fixed in the Courtiers hearts, that they may endeavour to walke in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God without reproof, they ſhall ſurely become unſavory in the noſtrils of God, and he will raiſe of the vulgar ſort of men, them, that ſhall caſt the Courtiers out, and trample upon them as upon dirt; for, who will take water from a corrupt fountain? The Court is the eye of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and, <hi>If the eye be evil, the whole body will be full of darkneſs,</hi> Mat 6. <hi>22, 23.</hi> and if the darkneſs be ſo great, what can follow it but confuſion and destruction? We are not ſtrangers to theſe things, for that we have ſeen theſe conſequences too much verified in our dayes; and yet there is many among us, ſtands to vindicate themſelves, and will not believe their own eyes, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb facs="tcp:43467:10"/>
the juſt judgements of God upon them for their ſins.</p>
            <p>But I beſeech your Royal Majesty to lay theſe things to heart, and to acknowledge by confeſſing it before the Lord, that a great many of ſins were harbored in the Court, under your Grand-Father, and your Father alſo: and there were four capital Cauſes which broke out into judgements.</p>
            <p>The firſt was in the Caſe of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Overbury,</hi> when <hi>Eſſex's</hi> Lady was too much favoured: for though there might be just cauſe for her to put away <hi>Eſſex,</hi> yet ſhe ſhould have ſuffered as an adultereſs, when ſhe married <hi>Carre,</hi> Mark <hi>10. 12.</hi> ſo that we ſee, that for that injuſtice and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the word of Chriſt, <hi>Eſſex</hi> having this grudge ſtill in his minde, at last is made the chief Instrument to destroy your Father's Court, when no man elſe could do it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond grand Cauſe, was that tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to proſane the Sabbath, which ſo ſtirred up the wrath of God againſt the King, that he cauſed all his people to abhor him for it.</p>
            <p>The third was, the refuſing to take the Anabaptiſt-Petition in <hi>1633.</hi> into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for though they were then but ſmall,
<pb facs="tcp:43467:11"/>
yet they had ſuch a Truth on their ſide, that they became to be the moſt violent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent inſtruments, that ſtood up in the war againſt the King.</p>
            <p>The fourth was a young man that ſuffered in <hi>1634.</hi> for poyſoning his Maſter, for ſo it was proved either by a falſe witneſs or a true one, yet the young man conſtantly denied it to the death, and great application was made to ſave his life, inſomuch that the Caſe came before your Royal Father, who as I heard examined it, and was ſo ſatisfied in the matter, that he would not pardon it: and no ſmall heart-burning fire aroſe from that, even inſomuch that the Kingdom is turned upſide down by it; and therefore let men now take heed how they judge ſuch hard Caſes between blood and blood, leſt they ſlay the innocent. This I believe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty then might have done in ſuch a Caſe, that ſeeing the young man's Friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended ſo much upon his innocency, that if they would free the King by taking the blood upon themſelves laid to his charge, in caſe the Witneſs was true, and that God ſhould require it, he to grant their requeſt; for ſo much liberty to the King (in ſuch a Caſe) is intimated, <hi>2 Sam. 3. 28, 29.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:43467:11"/>
where <hi>David</hi> clears himſelf by putting the blood of <hi>Abner</hi> upon <hi>Joab,</hi> and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to avenge it for his time. I do not ſay, Your Royal Father ſinned in this thing; (for it was done by witneſs) but that it gave occaſion againſt him, <hi>Judg. 10. 4.</hi> and againſt his people, with whom God was angry; ſo that as he would not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this ſin, God would not pardon the other ſins.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is not prudence for a King to be violent againſt any one ſin, and yet ſuffer many ſins to go unpuniſhed: for, <hi>A King that ſitteth in the throne of judgement, ſcattereth away all evil with his eyes:</hi> A King, <hi>who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin,</hi> Prov. <hi>20. 8, 9.</hi> It is one thing for a man to ſin as he is a man, and it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing for the ſame perſon to ſin as he is a King: <hi>David</hi> as he was a King, was perfect ſave onely in the matter of <hi>Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, 1 Kings 15. 3, 4, 5.</hi> but as he was a man, he had other ſins, <hi>Pſalm 40. 12. 1 Chron. 21. 7, 8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I conclude this, I believe your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Father, for his own particular, to be a perfect man; and had he been ſo ſevere to
<pb facs="tcp:43467:12"/>
puniſh Sabbath-breakers, Whore-mongers, Swearers, Drunkards, and ſuch-like ſinners, as he was to puniſh Murtherers, he had been a perfect King alſo. Yet I hope, what he wanted, will be made up in your Royal Perſon, that you may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in every degree; for ſuch things was too hard a buſineſs (as times then went) for your Royal Father in his life-time to do; becauſe the great ones were too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to ſuch ſins: but God by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence brought them down, and puniſhed their ſins by manifeſting his wonderful wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in making that great ſin of Murther (ſo hated by your Royal Father) to fight againſt all the other ſins, and to conquer and ſubdue them, that your Royal Father by his martyrdom, through Jeſus Chriſt, might conquer, murther, and ſo bring all under Chriſt Jeſus and himſelf. For a Murtherer hath no power over a Martyr, (and a rebellious War is a Murtherer) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he be a Murtherer to him, for that he is ſubdued before him, becauſe he ſtayeth and conquereth the Murtherer by his death: as if he ſhould ſay to him (for ſo the Scripture holds it forth, <hi>Hoſea 13. 14.)</hi> O Murtherer, by my death I will
<pb facs="tcp:43467:12"/>
be thy death: and the Martyr alſo by his death gets eternal life, <hi>John 12. 25.</hi> his mortality is ſwallowed up of life, <hi>2 Cor. 5. 4.</hi> beſides, <hi>Murther</hi> throughout the Scripture is called <hi>Death,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>1 Cor. 15. 26, 54. The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is Death.</hi> And again, ſpeaking of this time, ſaith he, <hi>Then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is written, Death is ſwallowed up in victory.</hi> And again, <hi>Heb. 2. 14. That through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> and the devil was <hi>a murtherer from the beginning,</hi> John <hi>8. 44.</hi> Again, <hi>No murtherer hath eternal life abiding in him, 1</hi> John <hi>3. 15.</hi> All which places and many more ſhew, That, Death, Devil, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and Murtherer, is one and the ſame: and none can deſtroy this Dragon and his Followers, but Jeſus Chriſt with his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, <hi>Rev. 12. 11.</hi> by giving him as much blood as he can deſire, and as much mercy as he can receive, that he might ceaſe from his wickedneſs, and be reconciled unto God again, that God may be all in all, and that the mortal enmity that is among men and brethren (through war and diviſion)
<pb facs="tcp:43467:13"/>
might be ſwallowed up with love and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</p>
            <p>And in appearance as yet to me, there is none more capable under God then your Royal Self, to make your Self and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in theſe Kingdomes happie; and there is no way for your Majesty to do it, but by obeying your Royal Father's Voice, as aboveſaid: and though that be moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary for fleſh and blood to do, yet you muſt humble your Royal Self more then that, by ſending your free general pardon to all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſeeking, but my ſeeking of it? for according to that which goeth for Law with us, it is not ſafe for any, and ſpecially they in power, to ſeek to you: but what I ſay, (who have alwayes hazarded my life for my conſcience ſake) may prove as authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, as if all had ſent to your Majesty. And therefore, I beſeech your Majesty make trial of it, if not to them, yet may it pleaſe your Majesty to ſend it; and though I be unworthy to be your Royal <hi>MESSENGER,</hi> and if you think fit to honour me with ſuch a Favor, I make no question through <hi>GOD</hi>'s aſſistance, but to give you a good account of it; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the danger of moving ſuch a
<pb facs="tcp:43467:13"/>
thing; ſo that I believe it is not ſafe at firſt for any of your Nobles to come upon ſuch a <hi>MESSAGE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for any grudge to revenge, or rancor in heart against them that put your Royal <hi>FATHER</hi> to death, have no ſuch thoughts, but purely love them; for I never heard that any of the ſeed of the Martyrs, hated them that had put their Fathers to death; but rather gloried, in that their Fathers ſo gloriouſly died. And who were the Instruments to bring them to that glory, but thoſe that put them to ſo hard a Trial?</p>
            <p>And after the Grace of Repentance is given them, who will honour the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs more, then they who have perſecuted them unto the death? witneſs Saint <hi>PAUL</hi> who did all this, inſomuch that Saint <hi>PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER,</hi> at laſt calls him, <hi>Our beloved bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther PAUL, 2</hi> Pet. <hi>3. 15.</hi> Wherefore (nowithstanding they have ſo violently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted your Royal <hi>FATHER</hi> to the death) moſt glorious Soveraign, (upon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) receive your Subjects in love and mercy, as your <hi>FATHER</hi> hath commanded you, who went beyond any one Martyr, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

I ſhall God willing now ſpeak a word of reproof unto you of the KING's party, and chiefly to you who have not hitherto changed your habit of ſin and cauſe of your miſery, yet you would have the Kingdom come with all haſte; and ſome of you are ſo violent, that nothing will ſatisfie you but blood, and treading down of ſuch parties; and eſpecially upon ſuch and ſuch men as you fancy to be guilty, you would have no mercy ſhewed.

And truly the King had great reaſon to wiſh ſuch a wiſh, when he had conſidered the carriage of both Armies; for as the King's Army were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally given to ſwearing, drunkenneſs, whoredom, with other ſuch vain ſinful luſts, which, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a courſe of life, no ſmall means will ſerve turn; ſo that, to maintain ſuch luſts they wronged the Countries where they came, (which Countries obſerving the different dealing of both Armies, and that the KING's Army made them, who afore were really for the King, to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate ſuch doings) ſo that they all did joyne with the PARLIAMENT's Party againſt the KING; which thing proved both his and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ruine, and indeed the ruine of all his Party. Beſides, ſuch men were the worſt men for Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as could be imagined; for when they ſhould be watching and alwayes in readineſs, one party was with their whores; another, drunk; a third, gaming, a fourth, plundering; a fifth, ſwearing and fighting one with another: (which things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to an Army, who ſhould ſanctifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſpecially at ſuch times, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 9.) but when they were got together, though they would fight moſt gallantly at a ſingle duel, or at an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, yet ſuch men are never good in the field, ſpecially when they come to encounter with a people, (whom they think do ſeek the Lord, and fear him, and live civilly) then the fear of <hi>God</hi>'s wrath and of death, commonly makes them run away, or elſe their ambitious Commanders ſtrive for honour till time be paſt, when indeed they ſhould go on by lot, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3. and if they chance to do an exploit, they too ſoon fall a plundering, that ſeldom, but at the laſt they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43467:16"/>
come to loſe all again. Theſe things the late KING underſtood, and experience did witneſs it to him.</p>
            <p>But the PARLIAMENT-Souldiers were men of another temper; and though of divers Opinions, yet they went out of zeal, in rage and fury to fight againſt thoſe incivilities of the KING's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: for truely, had the KING's Army been temperate, conſidering what they went about, and adorning their Religion, (ſpecially at ſuch a time) with a holy life, they had not loſt the day, neither had ſo many as did go out, been ſo eager to fight againſt them.</p>
            <p>And when the KING's Army above-ſaid were fulfilling their luſts, the PARLIAMENT's Army, ſome were praying; others, meditating; a third, reading the Scripture; the fourth, exerciſing their Armes; the fifth, conſulting and taking care how to provide for the Army, that they ſhould not wrong the Country: and all watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opportunities, being alwayes in readineſs. And there is much more difference, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all in both Armies, as they differed in all points; ſo that it was impoſſible for the KING to prevail, though I confeſs the KING had as gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant men (but not many) as ever <hi>England</hi> bred, who have done gallantly here ſometimes, and ſpecially beyond Sea.</p>
            <p>And the PARLIAMENT's Army knowing, that they fought againſt ſuch profane ſinners (that made no conſcience of their wayes) had comfort, and they were aſſiſted with courage, that they ſeldome turned their backs upon the Enemies; becauſe they feared the Lord, though it was ſometimes irkeſome to them, to go againſt the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43467:17"/>
Lord's anointed, ſpecially to them that did truly underſtand; but others that went on falſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, fought ſtoutly, (as we ſay) without ſear or wit, being not able to ſee the event thereof.</p>
            <p>Now the prudence of our late KING was ſuch, ſeeing theſe gallant Spirits, that though he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed his life to ſatisfie them that fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, yet ſuch was his clemency, that he loved them, and wiſheth to have them ſtand for him, counting them excuſable for what they did againſt him, and worthy of mercy, none exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that all according to their degrees and merits, ſhould injoy their ſhare (in peace and happineſs) as much as any men in his Kingdoms: which minde of the late KING, is clearly ſeen in the words above cited.</p>
            <p>And truely, let me tell you, That the KING and all the Nobles in <hi>England,</hi> could not have done ſo much right to the Commonwealth or Crown of <hi>England</hi> as his Highneſs the Lord PROTECTOR did, and after times will further manifeſt it. And again, I ſay, if we conſider, you ſhall finde, that he is true to the Crown (whatſoever men ſay to the contrary:) for when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his Highneſs, took upon him the Title of PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TECTOR, if ſuch righteous thoughts had not been then in his Heart, he might have as eaſily then been a KING as a PROTECTOR; and he did refuſe it, to maniſeſt, that he acknowledgeth the KING, and that he would be but a PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TECTOR until the KING came to an Agreement with his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>For according to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> a PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TECTOR is no more then a perſon that ſtandeth for a KING, and ruleth for a time, that is, till
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43467:17"/>
the KING come to age, or otherwayes, till he be capable of ruling; which, now our KING being at a difference with his Subjects (though he be of Age and Diſcretion ſuſficient to rule) yet the difference and diſtance between Him and his Subjects makes him uncapable. And I believe you will finde, if you examine former preſidents of this nature, that though the KING doth not rule himſelf in perſon while there is a PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TECTOR, yet alwayes the time of his raign is recknoned; ſo that the King beginneth his raign from that time, as his PROTECTOR, which is his Deputy, takes the rule upon him: and therefore I hope you that think I have miſſed, in ſaying, That KING <hi>CHARLES</hi> ſhould come to raign in 53. when you ſee the time of this PROTECTOR reckoned to KING <hi>CHARLES'</hi> raign, then you will ſay, I ſaid right.</p>
            <p>If there be any antipathy (as I believe there is) between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>CHARLES,</hi> he muſt raign in <hi>Hebron</hi> for a time, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. that is, <hi>without the conſent of all his people, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from them:</hi> for <hi>Hebron</hi> in the Britiſh Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſignifies, That <hi>he raigns KING though the Kingdom be not given to him:</hi> for <hi>Heb</hi> in Engliſh is <hi>not,</hi> and <hi>ron</hi> in Engliſh is <hi>given;</hi> ſo that <hi>Hebron</hi> by interpretation is <hi>not given:</hi> any Welch-man can tell you, that <hi>Hebron</hi> in Engliſh is <hi>not given;</hi> and if not, I will put it into a phraſe that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, <hi>Ron iddo dyrnas,</hi> that is, <hi>A Kingdom will be given him; I mau nw etto heb i roi hi,</hi> that is, <hi>they gave it not yet.</hi> Therefore I ſay <hi>CHARLS</hi> raigns in <hi>Hebron;</hi> and doubt not, but after the ſimilitude of <hi>David,</hi> he ſhall raign in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> that is, <hi>by the conſent of all God's people.</hi>

            <p>

And to ſtop their mouths that do aſperſe me, as a falſe Prophet, concerning 1653. put the caſe I took <hi>CHARLES</hi> for <hi>OLIVER;</hi> for he came in in 53. it is no more thenwhat <hi>Samuel</hi> did in the like caſe, when he took <hi>Eliab</hi> for <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 6, 13. therefore a true Prophet may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſuch a miſtake: yet as above, to clear my ſelf of ſuch a miſtake, I hope you will ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that <hi>CHARLES</hi> then came to the Throne, though in the perſon of <hi>OLIVER</hi> his Deputy by my account.</p>
            <p>But you will object, David <hi>and</hi> Eliab <hi>was of the ſame family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>CHARLES</hi> and <hi>OLIVER</hi> alſo be of the ſame family; if Haraulds reports be true: for <hi>Oliver</hi> by the one ſide comes of the ancient Britiſh Kings; and by the other ſide comes of the <hi>Stewarts:</hi> and that is the true Line of the late King <hi>Charles,</hi> by which he enjoyed the Crown of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though ſome ſay, It was a preſumption in me to declare ſo much concerning 53. yet I do not fear, but God will maintain me in what I ſaid, againſt all thoſe that aſperſe me, and will overthrow the aſperſion that is caſt upon me of them that underſtand not, by a judicious party which doth both underſtand and will plead my Cauſe.</p>
            <p>It is true, I have ſet down ſomthing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my anointing, from 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 3, 11, 12. which by no means can ſinke into the brains of ſome learned men that cavil againſt it.</p>

               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I directed it not to you, but to his Highneſs the Lord PROTECTOR, who I know delighteth in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43467:18"/>
ſuch things, for that he is able to comprehend them. Therefore you might have paſſed by it with ſilence, rather then condemn that which you underſtand not; for ſacred myſteries are not to be underſtood by your Grammer-Rules, without faith, neither is that a rule for a Prophet to underſtand the myſteries of God's Kingdom, for if Faith be wanting, he cannot ſee nor ſay nothing to that: and our Saviour Chriſt gives thanks to God the Father, becauſe it is ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; and tells you plainly, That ſuch things are hid from the wiſe and prudent, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 11. and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells ye, That our rule of Faith that we go by, ſhall deſtroy all ſuch learning as oppoſeth it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 19, 20, 25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. for Prophets have a holy unction from him that is holy, and an anointing that is of God alone, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2. 20, 27. It is not fit to caſt ſuch holy things before fierce unfaithful men of common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which by our Saviour Chriſt's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count (though they be learned) are as dogs or ſwine, that know not ſuch things, nor the worth of them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6. but I thought better of you before whom I have ſhewed my pearl, elſe I had not done it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you cannot ſpeak well of him that ſpeaks well of you, and ſeeks your welfare, how will you come to ſpeak well of him that ſpeaks evil of you? and if you cannot do good for good, how will you come to do good for evil? <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 20, 21. I have not ſpoken evil of your learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and why ſhould you deſpiſe mine? you
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43467:19"/>
know it is ſaid, <hi>Quench not the ſpirit. Deſpiſe not prophecying,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 19, 20. And it is ſaid, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware lest any man ſpoil you through Philoſophy and vain deceit,</hi> Col. 2. 8. you ſquare the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; underſtand them by ſuch rules of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the Prophets have another rule to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue them right, which rule your Philoſophers never knew. Thereſore Prophets need not come to you for help to unfold the myſteries of the holy Scripture, but rather ye ought to magnifie Gods wiſdom, and deny your own carnal wiſdom, when you ſee a thing opened by a mean man, and made clear, which all your prudent men could not do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 19, 27, 28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>I do admire at the haughtineſs and loftineſs of ſome peoples Spirits, who would not onely ſeem to be mightily for King <hi>Charles;</hi> but alſo are as violent againſt the Protector: I am ſure they are none of the Kings Friends; he hath too many ſuch proud arrogant ones on his ſide, (which are zealous for his honour) that undid his Father, and will never do him good, except they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand themſelves better then hitherto they have done.</p>
            <p>I pray, is it an impoſſible thing to be, and an unreaſonable thing to believe, that King <hi>Charles,</hi> and the Protector ſhould agree, and that the way to do it, ſhould be by a match between the King and one of the Protector's Daughters? they being vertuous Ladies, both beautiful and perſonable, brought up in as good education and parts as <hi>Europe</hi> can afford, being not inferiour (if conſidered in all parts) to any Ladies in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, nor leſs worthy of a Princely bed,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43467:19"/>
then the beſt of them: except ye judge them that are moſt wanton, and are puffed up with their vain beauty or painting, which have the leaſt of the fear of God in them, to be moſt worthy of ſuch enjoyments.</p>
            <p>And truely for deſcent of Blood, I believe, if it were well examined, we ſhould finde, that his Highneſs comes of as good a Royal Stock, as any Prince came of, (though for a long time it hath been under a Cloud, and not ſo eſteemed) even the very ſame as King <hi>Charles</hi> is, of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Britiſh Kings, and not much, if any thing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to him in that Line. And the hope of the <hi>Britains</hi> hath been, ever ſince they were brought under the <hi>Saxons,</hi> that one ſhould be exalted ſttangely out of that Stock to do great things: and we have many Sayings, and Proverbs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, or rather Propheſie, to that purpoſe, which I believe are now verified in his Highneſs: one is thus, <hi>Husbus i deng is y d<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n obbo radd i mau i wriddin:</hi> that is in Engliſh; <hi>The man in his time will manifeſt of what root or degree he is deſcended.</hi> But his Highneſs doth not glory in fleſh and blood, as the prodigals do of their blood and gentility, though he ſheweth it in actions, to pull down ſuch high ſpirits that are mor fore Vice then Virtue; and he doth it with more tonderneſs, then they would do to him, if they had him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which ſheweth he is of a right Princely vein; for a Clown and a Coward is cruel, and will have no mercy on his enemies, if once he gets them in his power.</p>
            <p>But however, ſuppoſe his Highneſs were not of ſo great a Blood; if that <hi>Charles Stewards</hi> houſe ſhould deſcend as it did hitherto, and <hi>Oliver</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:43467:20"/>
               <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s houſe aſcend as it doth, within a few Generations to come, it would not be counted then a bad match, for the beſt of the <hi>Stewarts</hi> to match with the chief <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Daughter.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay, Why ſhould you be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the King's welfare, as I heard ſome ſay, That they would rather ſee the King loſe all and periſh, then ſo to undervalue himſelf, as to be married with <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Daughter. Truely, I doubt ſuch proud Spirits muſt down: and the King's beſt way, is not to hear them: for if the late King were now alive, to ſee theſe things now as they are brought about, he would counſel his Son to marry his Highneſ's Daughter, and ſo to make peace. And if the late King's words be rightly conſidered, his wiſhes to have the Army for him ſaith no leſs: for what more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable way is it for the King to gain the Army to him, then to joyne in affinity with the Captain-General thereof? I think this is the ſence of the Speech of his Majeſty's Father, as true as if he was now living to declare it: for he was a wiſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing Man, that ſaw this Army was invincible. And I cannot finde in all the late King's Book, where he doth give way for his Son, this King, to avenge his blood; but rather, that he forgive all, and exhorteth him to forgive all that are willing to come to an agreement with him: and truely it is not onely perfect Chriſtianity, but it is alſo his greateſt Policy to do ſo.</p>
            <p>Yet many ſay, That if the King ſhould match with his Highneſs's Daughter, he would be in ſcorn among all the Princes in Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>Alaſs! he is more in ſcorn among them now as he is: for what do the Princes do, for to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43467:20"/>
reſtore him? If they ſend him a little mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for a time, they are ſoon weary of him; and account of him but as a poor man that craveth Alms. We know how the Papiſts ſcorn and ſlight their poor brethren, if they be contrary to them in their Religion, and do nothing for them, but rather do what they can againſt them, even to the taking away of their lives: And it is God's mercy to King <hi>Charles</hi> and that Family, that he hath eſcaped among them all this while with his life, being he is one that they fear, if he be ſet up, may come to ruine their Religion.</p>
            <p>Therefore if once the KING's Majeſty were joyned with his Highneſs the Lord Protector, what need had the King to care for any Prince in the World? I believe they would all trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at his preſence; for God hath provided him an army, that if once he were in the head of it, all the World could not parallel nor ſhew ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe his Army doth conſiſt of civil, wiſe, politick men, that have zealouſly devoted themſelves to fight Chriſt's battels, and to bring down his Rebellious enemies under his Iron Rod, for to keep Gods Commandments: and they ſhall proſper.</p>
            <p>Yet let me not flatter our gallant Engliſh Souldiers, leſt I ſhould deceive them; for I read <hi>Joel</hi> 2. of a terrible Army, called, A Northern Army: which I believe is deſigned for this place, and ſhall do great things: but if we turn to God and the King, as you ſee <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14, 20. then God will remove this Sea Northern Army from us. I had alſo Viſions of ſuch things. And <hi>Grobnerus</hi>'s Propheſie agreeth to it, which ſpeaketh thus: <hi>Then ſhall appear one</hi> Charles <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:43467:21"/>
               <hi>of</hi> Charles, <hi>with a mighty fleet on the coaſt of his Fathers Dominion, and with the aid of the Danes, Swedes, Hollander, and French ſhall ſubdue his adverſaries, and ſhall govern the people moſt happily, and ſhall reign long and far, and ſhall be greater then</hi> Charles <hi>the Great.</hi> Beſides, there is in a Book of Sir <hi>Franc is Bacon,</hi> a Propheſie to the ſame purpoſe: thus, as followeth,</p>
            <q>
               <l>There ſhall be ſeen upon a day,</l>
               <l>Between the Borrough and the Bay,</l>
               <l>The black Fleet of Norway;</l>
               <l>And when that Fleet is come and gone,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>England</hi> build houſes of lime and ſtone,</l>
               <l>For after wars you never ſhalt have none.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And Mr. <hi>Goſtolawes</hi> Viſions, as you have it in his Book, doth witneſs the ſame. But I look upon there, as a threatning from God, to bring the Army to agree with the King in reaſon, and honouring him, and not to ſtand it out with him, ſo as to look upon him altogether inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, becauſe he hath not men and money; for God is able, on a ſudden, to raiſe him both, though it is hard to get ſuch as our Engliſh Army conſiſts of; and I hope they will not loſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of bringing in the King, they conſiſting of the pureſt ſort of men.</p>
            <p>But indeed, in all other places where they raiſe Armies, they raiſe them of the moſt vile and uncivil men that are among them, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they did take the Thieves from the Goals for Souldiers, and preſs the moſt vile and wicked ſort in all Countries, ſuch as had no fear of God in them. Therefore as the Proverb ſaith, <hi>Put</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:43467:21"/>
               <hi>a Sword in a mad-man's hand, and ſee what will be the fruit of it;</hi> and if you like it, do it again; I am ſure the late King found a bitter fruit from it the laſt time: but this Army are of a clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſort of men; for they that had moſt of the fear of God in them, were the Foundation of this Army. A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump, be it good or bad, <hi>Matth</hi> 13. 33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6, 7. And therefore ten thouſand of them that pray to God when they fight, and ſtudy God's word continually, ſhall bear forty thouſand of ſuch as fear not God, (but contrarily, curſe &amp; ſwear) be they never ſo deſperate and ſtrong men: yet let none preſume upon his holineſs as the Pope did, who thought to make the World flie before him, and was choaked by a flye that flew in at his mouth.</p>
            <p>The King can never have a better opportunity then he had the laſt time he came from <hi>Scotland;</hi> for had not the blinde and the lame been with him, who were hated of <hi>David's</hi> ſoul, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 6, 8. the King had been on his Throne at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> within eight dayes after he had entred <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for if his Counſel of War had had eyes to have ſeen their way, and legs to come valiantly forward, when God gave them ſuch an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the work had been done; and it had been wiſdom and valour in them not to ſleep upon it, but to march night and day until they came to <hi>London;</hi> and if they had taken all the horſes in their way to bring them ſpeedily up, the King then might have ſuddenly recompenſed the owners of ſuch horſes: and the way was open, no power being between them and <hi>London</hi> able to hinder them; for the Parliament themſelves were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43467:22"/>
at the ſudden news of the Kings coming into <hi>England</hi> with ſuch a great power; and they being ſo unprovided, were ready to receive him without a ſtroke, had his Army been ſwift enough to come in time to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But had the Lord Protector with ſo many of his men been (in their ſtead) with the King upon ſuch a deſign, having ſo fair an opportunity, the Lord Protector and his men had ſoon been Maſters of <hi>London,</hi> and had ſet the King on his Throne.</p>
            <p>Therefore let not King <hi>Charles</hi> think, that ſuch men as brought his Father (though unwittingly) to the block, and himſelf into ſuch hazard at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and themſelves to a great deſtruction, that ever they ſhould do him good in the field. It is true, the men wiſh well to the King: and who can be more truer to him then they are? but alaſs! they have deceived both him and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hitherto; for they are not fit Souldiers, ſpecially to go againſt theſe men that are in the Army now in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe they are blinde and lame in all their proceedings.</p>
            <p>We may not think that <hi>David</hi>'s ſoul did hate a blinde and lame man, that wanted the uſe of his natural eyes and feet; No, God forbid he ſhould hate ſuch poor creatures as could not help themſelves: but thoſe blinde and lame that <hi>David</hi> hated, were fooliſh negligent Souldiers, that were not ſo wiſe as to ſee their time, and ſwift enough to take their advantage, when God gave them the opportunity. And ſo I hope the King will be of <hi>David</hi>'s minde; for ſuch Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do but deceive, deſtroy and waſte themſelves and thoſe that imploy them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:43467:22"/>
Therefore the <hi>Jebuſites</hi> ſaid in ſcorn to <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Except thou take away the blinde and the lame, thou ſhall not come in hither; Thinking Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid cannot come in hither.</hi> (As our long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment juſtly ſcorned the King's men, knowing they were both blinde and lame in all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes.) But <hi>David</hi> returns the <hi>Jeſubites</hi> mockery upon themſelves, ſaying, they were the blinde and the lame, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 7, 8. and <hi>Joab</hi> made them know, when he ſinote them, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had no ſuch men, as they thought they were, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I ſay, the King will do well if he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and joine himſelf to this Army now on foot, for I believe it will be a hard task for him to get an Army that ſhall beat them out: for the late Kings blood, the providence of God hath clearly ſhewed where it lieth, if men had but eyes to ſee it.</p>
            <p>I pray obſerve, the Presbyterian Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (for I believe the Independent conſented not to it) ſet forth a Declaration to invite the King, ſaying, That if the King would leave his evil Councel and come in to them, they would make him a glorious King. And the KING reſting upon their promiſe, hoping to finde them faithful, went without his Councel to the chief ſtrength of the Presbyters, even the Scots Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>Then the Engliſh Presbyters, forſooth, ſeemed to be angry, that he came not to them: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them they then ſet out a pamphlet, a buſing that Scripture, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 41, 42, 43. and taking it for a cloak to diſlemble with the good &amp; inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent King, wherein, forſooth, the Engliſh Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43467:23"/>
took upon them to be <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Scotch Presbyters took upon them to be <hi>Judah,</hi> making as though, according to the Text, they ſtrove who ſhould be moſt forward in their love to bring home the King. (Shall not ſuch Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites be puniſhed!) But in their bringing of him home, the one proved to be more like <hi>Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21, 7, 8, 9, 10. then <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and the other more like <hi>Judas, Matth.</hi> 26. 14, 15, 16, 47, 48, 49. then <hi>Juda:</hi> for ſo they brought him to his long home, and delivered him to <hi>Pilate.</hi> And as the <hi>Pilate</hi> of our time, had not the honeſty to waſh his hands from his blood; ſo the other had not the honeſty to take his blood upon them, as by right it is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 24, 25. and hath been required to the purpoſe of the Scotch Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. Therefore ſure their Engliſh Brethren ſhall not eſcape, though they be the cunningeſt Hypocrites on the earth; the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees were but Fools in compariſon to them, for hypocriſic.</p>
            <p>Yet God forbid that I ſhould ſay, All that go under the name of Presbyterians are ſo guilty of the Kings blood, though they all be ſufficient Hypocrites in other Caſes; but certain it is, that a party of them contrived the way to bring the King to his end; how many they were in number, God onely knoweth, and it is too a hard a thing for man to finde them out, becauſe all are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured perſons, that are to witneſs it: all honeſt men were excluded from that ſecret, ſo that they can witneſs nothing.</p>
            <p>Therefore I would not have the King to puniſh any of them for his Fathers blood; but refer it to God: for the evil name and ſhame they got by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43467:23"/>
it, and the guilt that lieth upon their conſcience, with the voice of his blood that followeth them witherſoever they go, is a greater puniſhment to them, then all the torture the King can deviſe to put them to: for if he puniſh them, then it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigates and leſſeneth the aforeſaid puniſhment. And truely he cannot puniſh the guilty, but he muſt alſo deſtroy the innocent; for they were ſo link'd together in the work, that if the Caſe of the King's blood come to be tried, I believe the moſt guilty will eſcape beſt; for they will ſay and ſwear, and hire others to ſwear any thing, and uſe all means to caſt it upon the innocent. Therefore, I ſay, let the King forgive all or none; truely, I am ſure by a Viſion that I had, he muſt forgive all or none: and if he forgive none, I know not how he will ever come to enjoy his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>We have a continual noiſe of Plots among us; I am perſwaded moſt men are more inclinable to that bloody way, then to the way of peace: yet theſe Plotters are ſo fooliſh in the managing of their Plots, that their deſigns are diſcovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are laid. The Presbyterians were not ſo in their Plots againſt the Church and the late King; as not long ſince I heard a Sectary ſay, That he knew of that Plot thirty eight yeers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone; but ſaid, <hi>we had no drunkards nor tell-tales among us;</hi> they covered their Plots with religious pretences; they were ſo circumſpect, that they would not be ſeen in Taverns and Ale-houſes, left they ſhould be ſuſpected: and they held it unlawful to fight againſt the King or for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but when at laſt they got ſtrength, they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43467:24"/>
fought againſt both, until they brought their Plot to effect; yet you know how ſoon they loſt that pre-eminence, which ſo long with many Prayers was in getting. God gave them their requeſt; but ſent leanneſs into their ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 15. that they are not the better, but now much in a worſe condition, then when they began to plot.</p>
            <p>Therefore let all the Plotters take the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians for an example, and ſee what fruit they had for their long plottings and contrivings to ſhed blood; and what they are like to have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, is to be lamented by them.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry to ſee men given to bloody Plots: I am perſwaded many care not what mony they ſpend to bring in the King that way, yet I believe they are none of them that be in favour with him; but ſuch as think to gain his favour thereby, are moſt ambitious and forward in theſe Plots. Let them take heed, they run a great hazard to little purpoſe: for I am ſure one man with his Prayer and Pen, he having but one hundred pound to ſet him forward, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 19. ſhall do more good to bring in the King in peace, then a thouſand Plotters ſhould do to bring him in after their manner, though they had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound a peece to ſet them forward.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I have neglected my outward calling, and done what I could, ſpending my time, and what I could get, in writing and print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the King, theſe three yeers: and now, being brought low every way, my beſt Friends forſaking me, my outward calling failing; for I was hindered in it, becauſe I gave my ſelf to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43467:24"/>
write, and am yet hindered and loſe my time with people that come to me dayly to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Words: but my Wife and Children will not be ſatisfied without bread, and I muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them, or deny the Chriſtian Faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. Therefore expect not much more from me, except God ſend me means, which yet I know not of.</p>
            <p>It is true, Divers Perſons of Quality paid me royally for my former Books, elſe I had not been able to ſubſift. And many came to keep me in talk, (not conſidering my time) but thought I had my Books for nothing, for they would have them at ſo ſmall a rate; and not onely ſo, but many poor people had them for nothing, though when my number was gone, and I wanted Books, I had paid dear to the Book-ſeller for them. Therefore what I got from the one, I ſpent upon the other. Loath I was, to offend any by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them my company, which many times came a great way to ſee me: being alſo willing, that the poor honeſt - hearted ſhould ſhould have freely what I had, as well as others which paid me well.</p>
            <p>Yet had any done to me, as that moſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Earl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> did to <hi>Matthew coker,</hi> they might have been offended, who, for a leſs ſervice then I have done for the King's Party, when he was in diſtreſs, the ſaid Earl did ſend him a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound. But alaſs! all that I had from them for Books theſe three yeers, did not amount to half a hundred pound; yet God be praiſed I live, (though poorly) and men do expect great matters from me, though by no means will they be obedient to God's word, upon which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43467:25"/>
of happineſs is grounded; which Word, in all my books I have alwayes ſet before them, ſhewing, that except they would believe, repent, and amend their lives, God would not perform to them what I had ſaid. And therefore they ought not to blame me becauſe the King came not in, bnt rather to blame themſelves, for that they did not turn wholly to God; which if they had done ſo, God in mercy to them had brought in the King, and would have ſetled all things in Church and State afore now.</p>
            <p>I have not eaten the bread of idleneſs all this time; my labour is beyond expreſſion, for I have taken more pains theſe three yeers, then a dayly threſher, whoſe morſel is ſweet unto him, and his reſt pleaſant: but this ſort of labour takes a man from all outward comforts; for ſuch a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in his ſore labour; ſo that <hi>Chriſt, Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Eliah</hi> eat nothing in forty dayes, as you ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 28. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 12. Therefore though natural men know it not, the labour is great, and of ſo much value, that if men ſhould give all they have to ſuch a labourer, it would not balance his deſert. I ſpeak not this for my ſelf, becauſe I look not for any reward from you, for I believe God will reward me: but having experience in the work, I know the time doth not afford to the faithful labourer encouragement, and that reward which he merits; elſe the work that I began had been more foreward then now it is. Wherefore ye ought to conſider them.</p>
            <p>Many are offended with me, becauſe I ſet a time for the King's coming into <hi>England:</hi> I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what they loſt by it: if ſome being covetous
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43467:25"/>
to get; have laid wagers upon it, who adviſed them to do it? I never read of but one wager laid in all the Scripture, <hi>Judges</hi> 14. 12, 13, 17. but <hi>Sampſon</hi> that laid the wager loſt it through his own folly, in telling his minde; as the now-Plotters were ſpoiled, becauſe they could not keep their own ſecrets; and they that won the wager got nothing by it, for <hi>Sampſon</hi> made them pay dear for it, <hi>Judg.</hi> 14. 19. <hi>Judg.</hi> 15. And was it not meet, that theſe men now ſhould loſe, to teach them, that they ſhould not wantonly dally with ſecret things in thoſe preſumptuous profane ways and gambols? they ſhould have been wiſer before they laid any thing upon it. And take notice, that when I firſt ſet down the time for the King's coming in, in the yeer 1653. I told them plainly for any to underſtand it, that if they did not leave their profaneneſs, the King would not come in according to my ſaying, and that God would alter the appointed time (of the King's coming in) as he did in the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> alter it forty yeers, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 34. as you have it in the Poſtſcript of my Book, called, <hi>The Ecche.</hi> And all the prophecies of God are conditional; for when God ſends a Prophet to pronounce deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to a people, and ſets a time for it, if upon it they repent and amend their evil wayes, they ſhall not be deſtroyed at that time. And when God ſends a Prophet to bring good tidings of deliverance to a people that are in captivity for their ſins, and ſets a time for their deliverance, if that people upon it do not repent and amend their evil wayes, they ſhall not be delivered at that time, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 7, 8, 9, 10, yet though God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the decree for a longer time, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 11.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43467:26"/>
that which the Lords Prophet hath ſpoken, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of mercy or juſtice, it ſhall ſurely come to paſs, as we ſee in the caſe of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> it was deſtroyed according to the ſaying of <hi>Jonas,</hi> though not in the time God at firſt alotted for it, <hi>Tobit</hi> 14. 4, 8, 15. and <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> though not at the firſt time that God had alotted for them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. 2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 23. <hi>Joſhua</hi> 21. 43, 44, 45.</p>
            <p>And you of the King's Party, I ſay, pray, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, take notice of the manner of God's ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his promiſes to his people, when they will not leave their ſins: <hi>Jeremiah</hi> prophefied that the Jews ſhould be delivered out of their captivity in <hi>Babylon</hi> after ſeventy yeers was expired: and his word was fulfilled in part; for in the firſt yeer of <hi>Cyrus</hi> there was a Decree made for their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 1. and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it they came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and laid the Foundation of the Temple, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 10, 11. but they had many great ſins among them, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 15, 16, 17, 18. as we alſo have: Therfore you ſhall finde that they were notperfectly delivered until the ſecond yeer of <hi>Darius, Ezra</hi> 4. 23, 24. for the adverſaries of <hi>Judah</hi> and of <hi>Benjamin</hi> wrote againſt them to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſuerus</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and got Commiſſions to ſuppreſs them by force of Arms, 1 <hi>Eſdras</hi> 2. 30. <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. and alſo you ſhall finde, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 31, 32. <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 37. that theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries that then hindred the freedom of the Jews, were ſuch people as hinder you now, for they were abſolute Independants, of divers Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43467:26"/>
and all feared the Lord (as now theſe fear the Lord) but they ſerved their ſeveral Gods, 2 <hi>King,</hi> 17. 29, 30, 31, 32. And as the men of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> made <hi>Succoth-Benoth</hi> their God; and the men of <hi>Cuth,</hi> made <hi>Nergal</hi> their God; and the men of <hi>Hamath, Aſhima,</hi> their God; and the <hi>Avites,</hi> made <hi>Nibhaz</hi> and <hi>Tartake</hi> their God; and the <hi>Sepharvites</hi> burnt their their children to <hi>Adram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> and <hi>Anammelech</hi> the Gods of <hi>Sepharvaim,</hi> and they made themſelves Prieſts of the loweſt of the people: ſo in like manner our Sectaries have their ſeveral Demi-Gods; as the Prsbyters have <hi>Fairfax, Knox, Waller, Love, Calamy,</hi> with many other; the Independents, <hi>Harriſon, Feak, Vavaſor Powel, Rogers, Simpſon;</hi> the Levelers, <hi>Lilburn;</hi> and the like: yea, there is not any Sect, but fanſie to themſelves Gods or Leaders, and make to themſelves Prieſts of the lower ſort, which have neither Religion, Reaſon, Eloquence, Learning, or any other Ingenuity in them at all, but a proud ignorant ſort of zeal, being in all things like the adverſaries of <hi>Judah;</hi> for as it is ſaid of them, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 33. they feared the Lord, but yet it is ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. that they feared not the Lord, becauſe they worſhipped him not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law that God had preſcribed for <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> whom he named <hi>Iſrael:</hi> ſo now the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, Independents, Levelers, or Browniſts, may be ſaid to fear the Lord, and yet not truely, becauſe they do not worſhip him according to the law that God hath preſcribed for us, as in the Communion-Book, vulgarly called, The Book of Common-Prayer. And to ſhew you a myſtery of hope, the Jews were hindred for the time of three Kings, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 5, 6, 7. of which three, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:43467:27"/>
reigned thirty two yeers, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 6. Yet the Holy Spirit ſpeaking of the ſame matter, tells us, that they were hindred but two yeers, 1 <hi>Eſdr.</hi> 5. 37. ſurely this Propheſie is for us; for they were hindred for a longer time. And this ſheweth you, That ſince the Foundation was laid in 1653. you ſhall be perfectly delivered afore 1655. be expired, and King <hi>Charles</hi> will be on the Throne by then; provided, That you unfaignedly turn to the Lord, by faſting, praying, and reforming your wayes, according to Gods Commandments, and ſpecially in not profaning, but keeping holy and ſanctifying the Sabbath day, for therein lieth the promiſe of glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13, 14. here and for ever, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.</p>
            <p>Now you will ask me, <hi>How was the Foundation laid, and wherein had the King's party any freedom in</hi> 1653. <hi>or in what manner doth it reſemble</hi> Cyrus<hi> his decree for the Jews?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I anſwer, That in 1653. by all accounts the Foundation was laid; for whereas before the power was in the State, Parliament, or People, or where we knew not; now it is in one ſingle perſon again: ſo that the Foundation of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy (which was deſtroyed) is laid again in the Protector I hope for King <hi>Charles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In 1653. the Ingagement was ſo taken off, that the King's party that took it not, now have the benefit of the Law, from the which benefit by the Ingagement they were utterly excluded; ſo that if one that had taken the Ingagement had robbed and killed one that had not taken it, it had not been a Crime in thoſe times; for we have right to nothing but by she Law. Thus you ſee what God hath done
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43467:27"/>
for you, to fulfil my Propoeſies in 1653. you muſt not deſpiſe the day of ſmall things, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
            <p>There came unto me a Gentleman, a great Hiſtorian, about two yeers agone, who did affirm that <hi>Cromwel</hi> was <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and that he would reſtore both our Liberty, Church and King to us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. This Gentleman was a Weſt Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had Commanded in the late King's Army, and had ſuffered much: I could wiſh all the King's Party were of his temper and minde.</p>
            <p>Truely I believe, That <hi>Cromwel</hi> is not onely <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but will alſo prove <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> that did not onely lay the Foundation, but will alſo finiſh the work of God, and bring forth the head-ſtone thereof with ſhoutings, (I mean King <hi>Charles)</hi> crying, Grace, grace unto him, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. And not onely ſo, but that <hi>Cromwel</hi> will be <hi>Darius,</hi> that ſhall curſe and bring a curſe upon all, whether they be Kings, or whatſoever they be, that hinder the work of God in eſtabliſhing the King again, and the true worſhip of God, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Therefore be not like the Jews, that ſaid, <hi>Can there come any good thing out of Nazareth?</hi> John 1. 46. for you ſee Jeſus the moſt bleſſed came from thence, <hi>John</hi> 19. 19. Wherefore let not the Independent think, but that much good may come to them from the King <hi>Charles Steward;</hi> and let not the Kings Party think, but that great good may come to them from <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> now Protector, who will reſtore the King, and hath done as you ſee ſomething already in order to it, and more I could ſhew you. Therefore I ſay to you again, of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43467:28"/>
ſaid, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 9, 10. to the Jews of <hi>Zerubbabel, He hath laid the foundation of the work,</hi> for the King's reſtoration, <hi>he ſhall alſo finiſh it; do not deſpiſe the day of ſmall things,</hi> that is, do not deſpiſe what he did in 1653. when he turned the State into a Monarchy, and freed you from the Ingagement; that is ſomthing, though it be but ſmall in your eyes. Oh that you had abated in your ſins ſo much, as that doth add to your deliverance. You know the people of God faſted and prayed oft when they were in diſtreſs, and that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly privately, but alſo publikely. And you ſee the Independents and Sectaries do ſo, though they be not yet the people of God: and why do not you ſo ſeek the Lord, that he may be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to you? I am aſhamed of you: what can I ſay to God or Man for you, when you neglect theſe things?</p>
            <p>Once, not long ſince, as I was at Mr. <hi>Peters</hi>'s Chamber on a Sabbath-day in the evening after Sermon, he was diſputing Caſes of Conſcience: when all was done, and the people gone, except ſome few Gentlemen that ſtaid to talk with him; He asked me, <hi>How I liked ſuch meetings.</hi> I ſaid, <hi>I liked it well, if it had been done in and for the Church of God.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>If you do not count us the Church, why do not the Cavaliers uſe ſuch holy meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings among themſelves? we ſhould be glad to ſee them do ſo.</hi> Said I, <hi>The reaſon is, becauſe you will not ſuffer them to do it, for fear they ſhould plot againſt you, as you formerly plotted in ſuch meetings againſt them.</hi> Said he, <hi>we never hindred them to meet in this manner.</hi> I anſwered, <hi>That you did to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for not long ſince at a houſe in</hi> Coven-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>there was a company of devout Cavaliers met to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43467:28"/>
ſerve the Lord; and you ſent a company of Souldiers upon them for no other cauſe, which took many of them priſoners to St.</hi> Jamſes. Then Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring it, had not a word more to ſay to that.</p>
            <p>But he might have anſwered, That was in the long Parliaments time; the Lord Protector ſince he came in power did allow of no ſuch thing, for now you have the Church-door open, you need not go into houſes; you may faſt, you may pray, you may preach, provided it be for peace: and I am ſure his Highneſs will rejoyce to ſee it; yet if you faſt for ſtrife and debate, as the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians did, all for blood, giving thanks when they kill'd many, and faſt to the end that they might kill &amp; oppreſs the more (as the Prophet ſets them out in their colours, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) if you cauſe your voice to be heard on high, and faſt as they did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then God and man will not allow your deeds; but if you faſt innocently, being without malice, and pray the Almighty God to ſend Truth and Peace to all Nations, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 19. and ſpecially to give a good underſtanding between the King and Protector and their Councels, that they may make peace, and confidently believe one the other, and keep faith and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence toward God and with one another for the time to come; then will God grant your deſire, and no man can hurt you for ſo doing. And the main cauſe why you are not delivered, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have not a good opinion of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> the man under God that is appointed to effect it by reſtoring your King and Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>If you look upon me as one ſent of God, you ſhould hearken to me, and obey my voice, (and

            <p>Conſider, Beloved, God did let none of my words fall hitherto, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 19. but all that I declared is come to paſs, as I ſhewed above: and if you had ſought the Lord, and forſaken your ſins, as I did exhort you to do in all my Books, the King had been on his Throne afore now; for men muſt look upon God's Commandments, and keep them, if they look to have his promiſes of mercy fulfilled to them, for his mercy is to them that love him and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their captivity ſate down and wept, and threw away their Harps, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. 1, 2. ſo ſhould you leave your pleaſure, and mourn for your ſins by faſting and praying in private, and publikely aſſociate your ſelves together to ſeek the Lord, that he may be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to you.</p>
            <p>And above all things, keep the Sabbath-day: he that keepeth the Sabbath-day of the Lord holy and wholly, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 58. 13, 14. he ſhall never do amiſs; for the Lord Jeſus will bleſs him, proſper him, and make him honourable, ſo that he ſhall ride upon the high places of the earth, and the ſeed of God ſhall be in him, to preſerve and protect him all the weeks of his life, from Sabbath to Sabbath, until at laſt he come to glory in Heaven with Chriſt at the right hand of God; for if you will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to keep holy the Sabbath-day, God will not ſuffer you to forget any of his Commandments;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43467:29"/>
but your delight will be in them, to keep them and do his will: but if you forget to keep the Sabbath holy (by praying, reading, hearing, ſpeaking God's words, meditating in it, doing deeds of charity, for bearing all works or words touching worldly affairs) then God will not bleſs you, and you ſhall fall from one miſery to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and never have reſt to your ſouls.</p>
            <p>The Lord will reign, and execute judgement for the Sabbath, therefore he is called the Lord of the Sabbath, and judgement will come upon the world, chiefly for their not ſanctifying the Sabbath: and if you take notice of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, A Pſalm or Song for the Sabbath-day) which <hi>Pſalm</hi> continueth until you come to <hi>Pſalm</hi> 98. ſo that <hi>Pſalm</hi> 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97. is but one <hi>Pſalm</hi> by the Author's account; for you have no title until you come to <hi>Pſalm</hi> 98. I ſay, if you take notice of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97. you ſhall finde how God will come to judgement and to reign, and of his triumphing over his enemies, which enemies are ſimilated by a flood of waters, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Pfal</hi> 96. 10, 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 1. and the contention muſt needs be about the Sabbath, (for this <hi>Pſalm</hi> is for the Sabbath-day) and hath begun with us already.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> deſtroyed his Throne, by making a Law to profane the Sabbath: truely, there was no need of ſuch a Law to give liberty for outward ſports on the Sabbath-day: the people were too forward in profaning it; ſo, that if he had made a ſevere Law to reſtrain them, yet would they have taken too much liberty to break the Sabbath: and I wonder, that the King and his Counſel were ſo blinde as to countenance the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43467:30"/>
Sabbath-breakers, ſince the Prophet ſheweth it clear, that the promiſe to Rule, is founded upon the exact keeping holy of the Sabbath-day of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13, 14. ſo that he that keepeth the Sabbath, ſhall ride upon the high places of the earth; and what is meant by riding upon the high places of the earth, but to have the rule and power over it, and govern it? <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 12, 13. <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 9, 10. compared with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13, 14. will ſhew it.</p>
            <p>And when the masking-bouſe in 1638. was erected at White-Hall, purpoſely to profane the Sabbath; then ſin went in the Court with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen face, though in a mask; yet ſo without a mask, that he which had but half an eye might eaſily have ſeen it, and ſay, God will not ſuffer this Court to ſtand long.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever adviſed the late King to ſet up that houſe, he was his greateſt enemy. He that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieth a King or Prince, need no other way to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow him, then to perſwade him to profane the Sabbath: neither can a man ſhew his love to his King by any means more, then by adviſing him to keep holy the Sabbath-day of the Lord Jeſus. And believe it, God will ſpeedily have a quarrel with the Kings and Princes of the earth, for breaking his Sabbath.</p>
            <p>The long Parliament got much footing againſt the late King upon that ſcore, for reforming what he ſuffered to be deformed; by reſtaining the profanation of the Sabbath; they went up, and he went down: but when they likewiſe began to take the liberty to profane it; ſo that when no Boat on the Thames durſt ſtir on the Sabbath,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43467:30"/>
the Lord <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>'s Boat may; and when other men muſt go afoot on the Sabbath, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-man ſends his ticket for a Coach, and will have it; then God brings them down al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
            <p>I do not ſpeak this of the Parliament-men without ground; for being in 1650. at a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-man's houſe in White-hall, who pretended to be one of the moſt religious of them, there was ſome Friends of his there, that were to come home to <hi>London.</hi> Said his Wife, <hi>When my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band comes in, we will have a Coach for you to go home. How!</hi> ſaid the Man, <hi>we cannot have a Coach to day. Yes,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>a Parliament-man may ſend his Ticket, and have a Coach at any time; none dare deny him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Sabbath a while after, I was at a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in White-hall, and in the middle of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, I was forced to go to the ſtairs; when I came there, I beheld a Boat coming up from the bridge. <hi>What,</hi> ſaid I to one that ſtood there, <hi>do the Boats go abroad again on the Sabbath-day? No,</hi> ſaid he. <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>what is yonder?</hi> Said he, <hi>That is my Lord</hi> Bradſhaw's <hi>Boat coming from</hi> Greenwich. <hi>What,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>then he takes upon him to be Lord of the Sabbath? Yes,</hi> ſaid the man, <hi>he may do what he pleaſe now.</hi> But conſider how ſoon God rooted the Parliament out, for ſuch preſumption: and now the Boats and Coaches go abroad on the Sabbath again without any moleſtation: judge you what will be the iſſue of it.</p>
            <p>Therefore let none preſume to break the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, be he never ſo high; I dare ſay, God will bring him low enough that doth it, pick what
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43467:31"/>
you can for that out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 6, 10, 11. And the Prophet tells the King and people of <hi>Judah,</hi> that though their ſin was written with a pen of Iron, and with the point of a Diamond, and doth ſay, that they ſhould go into captivity, yet a little after that, he tells them alſo, That if now they would turn, and keep holy the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, they and their city ſhould remain for ever, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>Therefore you ſee, that the keeping holy of the Sabbath, will turn away the greateſt wrath of God from a people, if it be generally and commanded by their King and Governours, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it will not avail; for in King <hi>Charles</hi> his time by ſome the Sabbath was kept more exact then ever, (and ſpecially more then it is now, when Families are broken into ſeveral Opinions, that there is hardly three in a great Family of one judgement) and all might have ſo kept it, for any thing that he declared againſt it; but he did not declare for it ſoon enough, and therefore wrath came from the Lord upon his people.</p>
            <p>A man in King <hi>Charles</hi> his time, could not paſs along the ſtreets, morning, evening, or at night on the Sabbath, but he ſhould hear them in moſt houſes reading, repeating of Sermons, ſinging Pſalms, and praying, yea, and every day they had prayers in their Families both evening and morning; and now ſuch things are out of uſe.</p>
            <p>Alſo, how beautiful a thing was it to ſee them go to Church, in thoſe dayes! the Maſter went before, the Miſtreſs, Children and Servants fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing with one conſent; ſurely then they were in the way of God, if I can judge: but now the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43467:31"/>
Maſter goeth one way, the Miſtreſs another, the Children and Servants another; every one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſeveral wayes; and when they come home, Mum is beſt; for they can neither pray together nor ſpeak any thing of God; if they do, there is a hot houſe preſently with their damning and confounding one another: God is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſuch confuſion, but of peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 33. and how can there be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Government, or a keeping of the Sabbath in Families, when the Church is without Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? for if the Foundation or Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be deſtroyed, what can the righteous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Families do? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. 3. they cannot ſay with <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24. 15. We and our Families will ſerve the Lord; for there is a power above them, that will nor ſuffer them to bear a compleat rule in their own houſes, <hi>Eſther</hi> 1. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>The granting Liberty of Conſcience was the overthrow of the late King; for had he been ſevere to make all men keep holy the Sabbath, he had not fallen; and his tolerating men to uſe, on that day, their own Conſcience and wills as they liſted, was his failing, ſo that he and his loſt all by it: and now there is no way left to pacifie God's wrath, but by faſting and prayer to ſeek the Lord in publick and private, and ſpecially to keep holy the Sabbath-day.</p>
            <p>And to tell you which day is that day, Biſhop <hi>Bayley</hi> in the Practiſe of Piety doth witneſs from Scripture and Reaſon, that it is the day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Sunday; and he gives you many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of judgements on Towns and Perſons
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43467:32"/>
that had profaned it. And truely, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet (for ſo I may call him) foreſeeing this judgement, with an intention to prevent it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his Book to King <hi>Charles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But a laſs! that is nothing to what we can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the vindicating our Sabbath, the Lord's day; for we have ſeen ſince, Kings and Kingdoms routed, Parliaments and States deſtroyed, and all for profaning that day.</p>
            <p>Therefore now God hath reſolved that Jews queſtion, ſo that it is without doubt, our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and none but it, is the Sabbath which God doth own.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if you look to be ſaved of God, ſtrive and have a care to keep it holy, and wait patiently upon the Lord: we ſhall reap, if we faint not, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
            <p>I know many good Proteſtant is now in <hi>Job</hi>'s condition, having his Family deſtroyed, his Houſe and Goods plundered, and perhaps his Body ſmitten with ſore Diſeaſes; beſides, his Friends being Independent, Anabaptiſt, or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian (as <hi>Job</hi>'s three Friends) come to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, accuſe and condemn him falſly; but <hi>Job</hi> for al this appeals to God for his integrity; and ſaying through Faith, that though his fleſh ſhould be deſtroyed, and his body conſumed, yet that he did believe (as many now in the ſame manner do believe, that they ſhall ſee King <hi>Charles</hi> on his Throne) and was aſſured that he ſhould ſee his Redeemer in that very ſame body, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>And you ſee God doth at laſt ſhew himſelf to <hi>Job:</hi> and as his three friends were forced to have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43467:32"/>
him pray for them, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. ſo theſe that now condemn you as evil doers, will be glad to lie at your feet, and have you pray for them to God, and alſo petition to the King for them. But obſerve this, verſ. 10. that after <hi>Job</hi> had prayed for his Friends, then (and not afore) God turned away his captivity, and gave him twice as much as he had loſt.</p>
            <p>From hence learn thus much: You that have ſuffered moſt, are to pray earneſtly to God for them that moſt wronged you; then ſhall you be accepted of God for your ſelves and them. Again, you muſt likewiſe make their peace with the King; for you onely are accepted &amp; fitted under God, and none but you can do that; and doing thus, your captivity immediately upon it ſhall be ended, and you ſhall have twice as much as you had before, both of honour and riches.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak thus much in particular to you that were great ones; if you do as aboveſaid, you will be far greater then ever you were. And do this with all ſpeed; it will take but a little time, if you be willing to do it: but however, do not deſpair, wait patiently upon God until he frames your minde to do it, for it is far from you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to what I ſay in theſe things.</p>

            <p>The firſt comes like <hi>Faux</hi> with his dark Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn (to plot and blow up all) in which he tells us of a rebellious perpetual Parliament that ſhould continue for ever; comparing it to the River of <hi>Thames.</hi>

            <p>And about three yeers agone (when the King was in <hi>France)</hi> as I was ſaying, That <hi>the King would come in;</hi> an ignorant Welſh-man hearing me, anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Not yet a while. Why?</hi> ſaid I. Said he, <hi>The King muſt firſt go to</hi> Collen,

               <hi>and be ſaluted of the three Kings there, who ſhall ſay thus unto him, Art thou come? thou art welcome, Brother.</hi> Said I, <hi>How do you know this?</hi> Said he, <hi>I heard it from ſome that had skill in</hi> Merlin; <hi>and</hi> Merlin <hi>doth not ſpeak doubtfully to them that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him.</hi> Therefore, how that welcome was to be performed, whether by the Princes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating of the King there, or by ſome Viſion he was to have there, or whether he is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized there, I leave that to a further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation.</p>
            <p>Some think that <hi>Merlin</hi> meant, that the King ſhould die and be buried at <hi>Collen</hi> with thoſe three Kings, and that his Brother, Duke <hi>James,</hi> ſhould reign and be that great King <hi>Merlin</hi> mentioneth; yet <hi>Merlin</hi> ſaith nothing of the King's death; but ſaith he ſhall be buried there, and that is to be underſtood, that he ſhall be buried in Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. and then be raiſed into glory; for the Spirit of God that moved upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and created the Light, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2, 3. which Spirit was upon thoſe three Kings that lie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there, who came to our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 1, 2. is to reſt upon our KING when he is rebaptized: then ſhall he proſper victoriouſly, and his wiſdom ſhall be glorious in ſetling the affairs of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>I heard another ſay, who was acquainted with an old man that had skill in <hi>Merlin,</hi> &amp; had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told him many things which he found come to paſs; The old Man ſaid, That <hi>he underſtood the time of things coming to paſs by the golden number, which by</hi> Merlin<hi>'s Rule conſiſted of twenty eight yeers.</hi> And ſaid to him further, That <hi>the Book of</hi> Merlin <hi>would be out of date and of no uſe within</hi>

Then the Parliament ſend for him, impriſoned him, and would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him as a Witch or Conjurer: and ever ſince <hi>Lily</hi> could foretel nothing: but as a blinde man, which throweth ſtones faſt about him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance may kill an unhappy Crow; ſo he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much for and againſt the Power, ſomething of his words muſt needs come to paſs: and for his Book called, <hi>Monarchy or no Monarchy,</hi> who knows not that? every one can tell that <hi>England</hi> muſt be either a Kingdom or no Kingdom? that is no news: and all that he doth in that Book, is but ſpitting his venome againſt the Truth, by perverting, confounding and wreſting ſome anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

For my part, I hate not theſe men; but I hate the evil Spirit that is in them; and loving them, I diſcover their wickedneſs, if ſo be by it they come to repent and amend: for a flock of Geeſe teacheth better doctrine then ſuch men do. And if you obſerve their goings, their chief going before, the reſt following with their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al chattering without diviſion, you ſhall finde that in all their wayes there is better order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Geeſe, then <hi>Withers, Lily</hi> and <hi>Walker</hi> would have to be among men in the World. Therefore God is pleaſed to judge ſuch rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men by thoſe Creatures which we count moſt fooliſh; as we commonly ſay of one that is ſilly, <hi>He hath no more wit then a Gooſe,</hi> ſpeaking as if a Gooſe had no wit; but one Gooſe hath more wit then them three.</p>

And now I muſt tell you, That through the darkneſs which came upon the Church ſome hundred yeers agoe, by reaſon when the corrupted Clergy (who were without conſcience or honeſty) got the power and records of antiquity into their own hands, they deſtroyed Records, which ſhewed the ancient Apoſtolical Cuſtome of the Church, that they might put
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43467:36"/>
upon us ſuch a ſeeming Divine Law as pleaſed them, and made moſt for their lazy ends and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; and through the malice and ſubtilty of the Serpent, wrought much miſchief by the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Popiſh Clergy for the deſtruction of mankinde: yet unawares to them, God hath reſerved ſo much of the Records, as clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth their practice in the Fundamental Point of our Religion, even Baptiſm; about which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, begotten by the lazineſs of the Clergy, many thouſands loſt their lives, and themſelves will come to ruine.</p>
               <p>I finde, that though Infants were baptized in old times by their ſureties undertaking for them, or chriſtened, which is a more proper word for them, as I ſhall make it appear by St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> own confeſſion, yet I finde, that that which now we call confirmation or biſhoping, by the ancients was called, <hi>The Baptiſm:</hi> but our late Prelates being Lordly minded (though they unjuſtly raiſed their hire above their Predeceſſors, yet) thought it too much labour and abaſement, for ſuch as they were, to baptize their flock again in Water, being content to let that ſtand for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which they received in their Infancy, and onely to lay their hands upon them, uſing a few words over them, and ſo let them go, making as though they could create a new Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its Element, which properly is Water, which is, as if they ſhould invite men unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Table, and then uſe the ſame Words, as if they gave them Bread and Wine, but give them nothing; or juſt as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 13, 14. If one ſee a man naked, and deſtitute of daily food, and ſay unto him, Depart in peace, be thou warmed and filled, yet he gives him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43467:36"/>
clothing nor meat; and, what is the poor man the better for his good words? ſo your biſhoping in like manner was unprofitable, and the people finding it ſo, did not eſteem it, nor did they care whether they had it or not: for without Water, it was but a ſtarving of their ſouls. And if the Biſhops being ancient, durſt not for fear of danger go down into the water, they might have commanded others to baptize the people, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 48. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> fore-ſeeing the darkneſs that came upon the Church, ſends us to ſeek the good old way, and bids us walk in it, ſaying, Then we ſhould finde reſt to our ſouls, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 16. And when the Church had loſt the way of Chriſts worſhip, ſhe enquir'd of him, how ſhe ſhould come to his Saints reſt: he anſwereth her ſaying, If ſhe knew not the way to finde out their reſt, ſhe muſt follow their foot-ſteps, and ſo come to finde out their reſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 7, 8. and this method is taker. from ſhepherds, which in time of ſnow finde out their ſheep by following their foot-ſteps. Therefore, I ſay, we muſt ſearch the Scripture; &amp; withal, becauſe we cannot agree in the underſtanding the Scripture, for to help our underſtanding, we muſt take notice how the Church did walk in thoſe ages after the Apoſtles time, when it came to its higheſt perfection; &amp; by ſo doing we ſhall rightly underſtand the meaning of the Scripture, which is the Apoſtolical rule of worſhip. And I finde, that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> miſtruſting the knavery of the Clergy that ſhould follow, in his diſcourſe, by God's providence did hide ſome things in ſecret; which ſecret being now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, may ſhew us what they then did, in what is moſt conſiderable and greateſt in queſtion now among us: for ſo you ſhall finde it in the matter of Baptiſm, if you obſerve Saint <hi>Augustine, Confeſſion</hi> 1 <hi>lib. chap.</hi> 11. ſaith he, (ſpeaking of his Chriſtening) <hi>I was then ſigned with the ſign of his croſs, and ſeaſoned with his ſalt ſo ſoon as I came out of my mothers womb.</hi> Whence it is clear, this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43467:37"/>
was his Infant-Baptiſm; for you ſhall finde in the ſame Chapter, that being come to ſome diſcretion, and falling ſick, how earneſt he was to have Chriſt's Baptiſm: and ſpeaking of <hi>Pontitianus, Confeſſion</hi> 8 <hi>lib. chap.</hi> 6. ſaith he, <hi>He was both a Chriſtian, and baptized too.</hi> Hence you may draw this concluſion, that then they were called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, from their Chriſtening in their Infancy, but not baptized Chriſtians, until they were manifeſt Believers, and that they were baptized by their own conſent; and their Baptiſm was in thoſe times deferred until men came to ſobriety, and that the heat of youthful luſt and ſin was almoſt overcome, and commonly until they were married, otherwayes, though they were never ſo learned, except they believed, and were tempered, or were in dying, they were not admitted to have it, as you may ſee, if you will read and obſerve Saint <hi>Auguſtine's Confeſſions,</hi> and the Rubrick that goeth before the Baptiſm in the book of Common prayer, you ſhall finde that they ſay, that in the old time the people were baptized at <hi>Eaſter</hi> or <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> and at no time in the yeer beſides: and if we compare this with Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> this muſt needs be their rebaptizing, for Infants were not kept ſo long without it, as you ſee by St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> and ſee he was rebaptized at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and I am ſure he was then about 30 yeers of age, for he had a ſon was then 15. <hi>Confeſ.</hi> 9 <hi>lib. chap.</hi> 6. Here it is clear that the ancient Church though they baptized or chriſtned their Infants by their ſureties, yet after they came to be men, then they were baptized upon their own ſcore. And now let us ſee whether their then practice was agreeable to the Scripture delivered to us by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>I have delivered ſeven Arguments grounded upon the Goſpel, for the defence of Infant-baptiſm, which are ſo invincible, that I believe all the Ana baptiſts are not able in ſo few words to anſwer them; which Arguments you ſhall finde in my book called, <hi>The Eccho to the Voice from</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:43467:37"/>
                  <hi>Heaven:</hi> beſides, it is evident, that the promiſe is aſwel to their children, as to the believing parents, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. and therefore the Apoſtles upon the confeſſion of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or head of a family, baptized all perſons both great and ſmall in the houſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 33, 47, 48. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 14, 15, 30, 31, 32, 33. according to the ſaying of our Saviour to <hi>Zacheus, Luke</hi> 19. 9. <hi>Salvation is come to this houſe,</hi> that is, to all in this houſe both great and ſmall, Infants being not excepted, nor exempted; for our Saviour counts them the pureſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. Now to prove that Infants were baptized by their ſureties or upon their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſome Authors do ground it upon the command of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 3. and the example, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 57, 58, 59. Theſe types indeed being well conſidered, are very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, and a ſufficient warrant for it: and the Apoſtles command bindes us to do it, ſaying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1. <hi>We that are ſtrong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak.</hi> And again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Bear ye one anothers burthens, and ſo fulfil the law of Chriſt.</hi> Infants are moſt weak, and we ought in charity to help them, in what concerns their ſouls, as we do in what concerns their bodies.</p>
               <p>All by nature are born children of wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1, 3. that Infants are not onely dead in ſins and treſpaſſes; but are alſo ſo dead, that they know not wherefore they are plunged in water-baptiſm, they know not what their waſhing ſignifieth: though indeed they have Faith in Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18 6. and a dependency upon the ſupream power, that brought them forth into the world, far above that of the young Ravens which cry to God for their ſuſtenance, <hi>Job</hi> 38. 41. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 9. yet Infants are not capable of entring into atonement with God through Chriſt in baptiſm; and if without it they depart this life, they cannot be ſaved, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Jahn</hi> 3. 5. Therefore in charity we ought to help them, and be ſureties for them until they come to age.</p>
               <p>Now Infants being dead in regard of original ſin, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43467:38"/>
in regard of ſpeech and underſtanding what Baptiſm is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 20. in the Apoſtles time there were ſome that did anſwer for them, and perform that part in Baptiſm for them, which they themſelves being unable could not do, and this is clear by the Apoſtles words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 29. <hi>Elſe what ſhall they do that are baptized for the dead? if the dead riſe not at all, why are they then baptized for the dead?</hi> that is, if Infants do not awake to live righteouſly, that God may be all in all, their ſureties muſt anſwer for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28, 34. and by theſe <hi>dead ones</hi> here, is meant, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants;</hi> for to what purpoſe ſhall any be baptized for them that are corporally dead? as if that would raiſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> is right in this point; for in the book of Common-prayer the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not put to the Infant, but to the ſuretie, ſaying, <hi>wilt thou be baptized in this Faith?</hi> &amp; the ſurtie anſwereth, <hi>That is my deſire:</hi> ſo that accordingly the ſurtie is more properly ſaid to be baptized then the Infant, though all is for the Infant's ſake: and the Infant if he by his waſhing perform the external part in Baptiſm, that is all, and that is but the ouſide of it, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
               <p>For Re-baptizing alſo you ſhall finde, that it was put in practiſe in the Apoſtles time, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. for them Diſciples being found ignorant were baptized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and if you compare <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 47, 48. with <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 5. you finde, they were baptized with water; and to clear it further, ſaith he, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>He ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration and renewing of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Hence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that here he ſpake of Re-baptizing, mark the words <hi>regeneration</hi> and <hi>renewing,</hi> it ſignifieth to make an old thing new again: and as the renewing of a covenant cannot be done to him that never was in covenant, nor can you renew your friendſhip with him that never was you friend; ſo the renewing of baptiſm here intimated, cannot be ſaid to be done to them that never were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43467:38"/>
and it muſt needs argue from this place, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. that in ſome meaſure when they were Infants they had baptiſm, and that now being defiled by the ſins of their youths, they were rebaptized, waſhed, and had the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit renewed on them again: and as <hi>David</hi> after he went in to <hi>Uriah</hi>'s wife, and by ſin defiled his holy Spirit, he deſired God to waſh him, and <hi>to renew a right ſpirit within him,</hi> Pſa. 51. 2, 7, 10, 11. yet <hi>David</hi> then had the holy Spirit, though in a weak meaſure, becauſe of his ſin; therefore he deſireth God not to take his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from him, but to waſh him, and renew the holy ſpirit he had, by giving him a greater meaſure of the ſame ſpirit: ſo in like manner, them now that are rebaptized, ſhould not deſpiſe the holy ſpirit which they received in their Infant-baptiſm; but with <hi>David</hi> deſire God to renew that holy Spirit within them, by giving them a greater meaſure of the ſame ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Again, from theſe Texts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. we muſt needs underſtand the rebaptizing, for how can In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants be ſaid to come to baptiſm <hi>with full aſſurance of faith, having their hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and their bodies waſhed with pure water?</hi> whereas Infants underſtand not what conſcience is: and how can they have the anſwer of a good conſcience toward God by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, ſeeing they are not able to know theſe things? ſurely this baptiſm meant here, is not to Infants, but it belongs to them that are of ripe age to receive it. And therefore from hence it is evident, that thoſe who are to be ſaved (notwithſtanding their baptiſm in their infancy) ought to be baptized again. As for them that died in the former times of ignorance, which God winked at, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 30. doubtleſs God was merciful to them; but now it will be required if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe rebaptizing, for Infant-baptiſm is but as that of <hi>John,</hi> which is appointed to prepare a people for the Lord: and truely the holy Ghoſt is in ſome meaſure in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43467:39"/>
                  <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſm, for our Saviour had the holy Ghoſt deſcended on him at his baptiſm, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 16. but the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all, is in Chriſt's baptiſm, who had not the ſpirit by meaſure, <hi>John</hi> 3. 34. And St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> underſtood it thus: for ſpeaking to God, as if in his infancy he had had <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſm, and confeſſing when he was ſick what then he had done, ſaith, <hi>confeſ. lib. 1. ch. 11. Thou ſaweſt, O my God! (for thou wert my Keeper) with what earneſtneſs of minde, and with what faith, I importuned the piety, both of my own mother, and thy church the mother of us all, for the baptiſm of thy chriſt my Lord God.</hi> Mark, <hi>the baptiſm of thy chriſt.</hi> And obſerve, for here he makes a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, which he had received when he was an infant, and the baptiſm of Chriſt which now being ſick he would have had: for he thought it not meet to term that Baptiſm which infants receive.</p>
               <p>It was a wonderful providence that brought me to maintain this point by any thing out of S. <hi>Aug.</hi> and it was thus: When I was about to write this, two learned men (the one a Miniſter, the other a great ſtudent) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at my houſe together; and I perceiving they would be my great antagoniſts in it: to hear what they would ſay, I broke my minde unto them: they began to oppoſe me in it with might &amp; main. I held it forth againſt them both: ſo that at laſt the ſtudent ſaid, <hi>Now I call to mind, I think S.</hi> Aug. <hi>ſpeaks of ſuch a thing.</hi> And he having the book in his pocket, drew it out; and it ſilenced them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much: yet they would give me no encouragement, nor would they tell me plainly what S. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaid in it. Upon this, I went into <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard, to ſee if I could finde S. <hi>Aug.</hi> and hear him ſpeak, by means of ſome La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Scholar: but being there, I found him to ſpeak Engliſh, and I brought him home, with an intent that before he and I part, to be better acquainted with him. Thus Gods providence helps forward his own work, that men may ſee that the practice of the ancient Church
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43467:39"/>
was agreeable to the New Teſtament, and that by their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice we may the better underſtand the Scripture, ſpecially in the myſterious great Controverſie about Baptiſm (the foundation of Chriſtianity) to end and reconcile the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Chriſtendom in that point of Rebaptizing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Anabaptiſm;</hi> which opinion, being weighed in the balance of the Sanctuary, hath as much truth in it, yea more then the contrary: yet the Ana baptiſts follow not the footſteps of the Ancients in Chriſtning their infants, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the holy Spirit in their infants baptiſm to be of value; but ſeeking another ſpirit in baptiſm, and not the renewing of that holy Spirit which they had in their infants baptiſm, (for their puniſhment, and to bring them home) God ſends them an evil ſpirit, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 14. that puffeth and vexeth them, and ſets them one againſt another; ſo that there is no peace among them: and though they do mighty things for a time, prevailing, yet at laſt they come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe they deny and pitifully reproach the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Gods Spirit upon them in their infancy.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, becauſe the Church of <hi>Engl.</hi> at the firſt appearing of the Anab. did not admit Rebaptizing, (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods way) &amp; take thoſe people into the Church, (they confeſſing the Church, and their infants baptiſm) as the moſt eminent part of it; the difference grew greater, and they became a ſcourge; ſo that all Hereſies broke out in the Church, upon its refuſing &amp; condemning ſuch a truth, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Scripture and Fathers; which truth is the means appointed to bring men into communion with God: for none ought to come to the Lords table, before they themſelves (being at yeers of diſcretion) do confeſs their ſins, repent, and be baptized, upon their own ſcore. And good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for we ſee, if a man himſelf be bound to pay a debt he oweth, he will take ſpecial care to pay it, leſt his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſt him into priſon; but if ſureties be bound for it, the principal careth not, but lets them ſuffer: this is common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. So infants in baptiſm are not bound, but their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43467:40"/>
ſureties; and as they are bound to or promiſe nothing, ſo they are as careleſs to perform any thing promiſed for them or in their name: for pray where is any doth <hi>forſake the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of the wicked world, and all the ſinful luſts of the fleſh;</hi> that doth believe <hi>all the Articles of the Chriſtian faith;</hi> that doth <hi>keep Gods holy will and commandments all the days of their lives?</hi> Here are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty things promiſed, who performeth them? Take heed; <hi>God will not be mocked,</hi> Gal. 6. 7, 8. Now if Miniſters had preſt men to renew their Covenant with God, and cauſed them with their own mouthes to promiſe ſuch obedience as above ſaid, and rebaptized them upon that account, ſhewing ſuch as would not come in (upon ſuch terms) their damnable condition, and that their infant-baptiſm was but a figure to ſave them, if they had died in the time of their ignorance; ſurely men would not have been ſo careleſs in keeping Gods Word as now they are.</p>
               <p>Therefore I give this as a Rule of truth to the Church for time to come; which Rule is grounded, as aboveſaid, on Scripture, the beſt Fathers practice, Reaſon, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the book of Common-Prayer, as you have it afore Baptiſm in the Rubrick.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>I ſay,</hi> that Infants ought to be by their ſureties baptized in water, as we formerly did in the church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That they ſhould be catechized and educated in the faith, and by all means perſwaded to leave their ſins.</item>
                  <item>3. That they being come to the age of diſcretion, ſhould repent and confeſs their ſins, and ſhew their reſolution to amend their lives, before they come to renew their baptiſm.</item>
                  <item>4. That they be re-baptized in water, and then the Biſhops to lay their hands upon them: and all this to be done to them, afore they be admitted to come to the Lords Table.</item>
                  <item>5. That thoſe Heathens or Jews that are perſwaded to the faith, converted and baptized, they being of full age, refraining from ſin, and ſtedfaſt in the faith, need not be rebaptized: but if they have young children, or ſervants that are ſubject to youthful vanities, notwithſtanding they be baptized with their maſters or fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ought to be rebaptized as aboveſaid.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:43467:40"/>
6. That whoſoever after re-baptizing oppoſeth the faith, or breaketh the commands of God, be excommunicated, and not received in again, until he repent, and be willing to ſuffer a ſhameful penance. If he will not come in, but goeth about to ſeduce the people of Chriſt, then ſhall the King put him to death ſpeedily, that others may fear the Lord and King.</item>
                  <item>7. That the King and all keep holy the Sabbath, not onely by forbearing ſervile work, but by praying, reading, bearing, ſpeaking Gods word, meditating on it, and deeds of charity.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And let me tell you in the name of God, that Gods Covenant in baptiſm, is that <hi>perpetual covenant that ſhall not be forgotten,</hi> Jer. 50. 5. It is the <hi>quarrel of</hi> that <hi>Covenant</hi> which God did and will <hi>avenge,</hi> Lev. 26. 23. not the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous fooliſh Scots Covenant, as the Presbyterians would have men believe: no, it was that <hi>covenant with death and hell,</hi> Iſa. 28. 15. God never owned that wicked Covenant, but will puniſh all that had a hand in it; the King &amp; all others that took it, be <hi>Anathema Maranatha:</hi> the late King, and that rightly, did abominate it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will clear this King &amp; all that took it, but to repent and be rebaptized, as aboveſaid: for that was the arm of the <hi>abomination of deſolation,</hi> Mat. 24. 15. and it threw down the pillars of Chriſts Church, and our Biſhops: it was the work of the Presb. <hi>Copperſmith; the Lord reward him according to his works,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 14. God ſend us to love and to enjoy truth and peace in all our genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Amen.</p>

            <p>ANd now if the King and the reſt of the royal party will ſubmit unto God, according to the foregoing lines (by his providence) directed to them, and humble themſelves before him, conſtantly calling upon him as they finde occaſion; not onely in forms of prayers, in which many times they come ſhort of asking what they need; but alſo calling upon him by the dictates of God's Spirit in them; for as they know
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43467:41"/>
how to ask a man what they need, ſo the Apoſtle would have them make known then requeſts unto God, <hi>Phil. 4. 6.</hi> and not plead ignorance, as if they had not the Spirit of prayer; for if they know what they need, they know how to ask it of God, as well as they know how to ask any thing they want of men, and eaſier; for God is not as man, that will be courted with fine phraſes afore he gives any thing, but plain ſimple terms are acceptable with God, and as available as the higheſt eloquence. And as a Father delighting to hear his little child ſpeak and ask him ſomthing from the dictates of his own wit, to encourage the child for to ſpeak to him, will give him ſooner what he asketh, then he will give to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his children that can ſpeak better; ſo God doth delight to hear his little ones ſpeak to him from their own breaſt, and will anſwer their prayers, when eloquent Orators prayers are denied. And let me tell you, that I believe God doth not bleſs any thing that men poſſeſs, ſo much as he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that thing (if it be a lawful thing) which they ask him in prayer, and return him thanks for it; for though a man be born to the higheſt preferment in the world, and look not upon it as the immediate giſt of God unto him, not glorying in his birth-right, but in the Lord that gave it, he ſhall finde that God will deprive him of that he gloried in, by making one born in a barn, and caſt into the briers, to enjoy his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. I ſay, if the King and his party will obſerve theſe things, and practiſe them, then I am ſure God will ſuddenly reſtore him and his party, and they ſhall finde, it is not in vain for men to ſeek the Lord; but if they will not obſerve theſe things and put them in practiſe, I wiſh them well, let them go on in their own wayes, and ſee the fruit thereof, for I know the meek (and not the furious and proud) ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the earth, <hi>Mat. 5. 5.</hi> and the humble ſhall be exalted, <hi>Luk. 14. 11.</hi> for, <hi>Before deſtruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility,</hi> Prov. <hi>18. 12. Humble your ſelves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time, 1</hi> Pet. <hi>5. 6.</hi>
