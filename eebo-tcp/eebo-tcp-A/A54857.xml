         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Premonition to the Reader.</head>
            <p>HAVING been many times importun'd, since the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> both to permit a <hi>new Impression</hi> of my <hi>Sinner Impleaded,</hi> and to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my <hi>Stationer</hi> with some <hi>Inlargement,</hi> I could not think of a fitter Subject, in relation to the <hi>Method</hi> I first proposed to my self, than that of which I am writing this brief Account.</p>
            <p>My <hi>method</hi> was avowedly That of the <hi>Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in the Parable; who does not only think fit to <hi>cleanse</hi> the <note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>fallow ground</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> before he <hi>sowes</hi> it, but <hi>sowes</hi> it throughly when it is <hi>clean</hi> too. And so accordingly having indeavour'd, in my <hi>first</hi> Practical Essay, (and in hope of God's Blessing on it) to <hi>weed</hi> out of mine own, and out of other mens Natures, <hi>the Love of Sin;</hi> I was to labour in my <hi>second,</hi> (and by the same Blessing of God, on which alone we depend for any Proportionable success,) to <hi>Stock</hi> the very same <hi>ground</hi> with the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> It being certainly not enough, (however absolutely needful,) <note n="‖" place="margin">Jer. 10. 12.</note> 
               <hi>not to sow among Thorns,</hi> or meerly <hi>to break up the fallow ground;</hi> but (as the same Prophet words it,) we must <hi>sowe in Righteousness,</hi> to <hi>reap in Mercy.</hi> And,
<pb facs="tcp:56118:3"/>
to be <hi>Positively glorified,</hi> we must not think it of force sufficient, that we be <hi>negatively good.</hi> 'Tis vain and fruitless that we endeavour, to <hi>eradicate</hi> out of our <hi>hearts</hi> the <hi>love</hi> of our <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Sensualities,</hi> unless it be that our <hi>Love of Christ</hi> may therein take both the <hi>deeper</hi> and <hi>faster Root.</hi> And because the <hi>Love of Christ</hi> does seem as rarely <hi>understood,</hi> as 'tis often <hi>talk't of,</hi> we must be taught <hi>wherein</hi> it <hi>lyes,</hi> and the several <hi>wayes</hi> of its <hi>Attainment.</hi> To the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>First,</hi> and to the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Second,</hi> I have directed both the First and Second Part of my <hi>Inlargement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As they are now put together, I know not at present what more to add, besides my humble and hearty Prayers unto <hi>the Lord of the Vineyard</hi> in which we labour,<note place="margin">Matt. 9. 37. Luke 10. 2. 1 Cor. 3. 9.</note> (and whose <hi>Harvest</hi> we are in one sense, as well as his <hi>Husbandry</hi> in the second, and his <hi>Labourers</hi> in a <hi>third,</hi>) that whilst we are <hi>Plowing</hi> what we have <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> and are <hi>Planting</hi> what we have <hi>Plow'd,</hi> and are <hi>Watering</hi> what we have <hi>Planted,</hi> He who is said<note place="margin">Jer. 10. 12. 1 Cor. 3. 6, &amp; 7.</note> to <hi>rain Righteousness</hi> will bless our Labours with <hi>Increase.</hi>

which is not <hi>weighty,</hi> and <hi>emphatical;</hi> and hardly an <hi>Emphasis</hi> on a word, which affords not <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Meditation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us put our <hi>first Emphasis</hi> upon the Particle<note place="margin">I.</note> [<hi>If</hi>] a conjunction conditional. For 'tis not <hi>Peremptorily</hi> said, my <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>you</hi> hath been so <hi>great,</hi> and my <hi>Favours</hi> to you so <hi>many,</hi> as that <hi>ye cannot choose</hi> but love me, or ye <hi>must</hi> love me of <hi>necessity;</hi> but the Proposal is <hi>ex hypothesi.</hi> Our Saviour does not say <hi>Because,</hi> but <hi>If</hi> ye love me; thereby making it a question, whether we <hi>love</hi> him or love him <hi>not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this deserves to be the Subject of no small <hi>Trouble</hi> or <hi>Humiliation,</hi> whilst we pretend to be the <hi>Followers</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> of Christ, that we should be of such <hi>barbarous</hi> and <hi>inhuman</hi> dispositions, as to be <hi>able</hi> to be <hi>cold</hi> in our affection towards <hi>Him,</hi> who is <hi>inflamed</hi> towards <hi>us</hi> in <hi>His</hi> affection.</p>
               <p>A <hi>second Emphasis</hi> is to be put on the Pronoun<note place="margin">II.</note>

               </p>
               <p>That the greatest expression of our Lords love to <hi>us,</hi> is his taking it as a <hi>kindness,</hi> that we be kind unto <hi>Our selves;</hi> that we will love him at least so well, as to do our selves <hi>good;</hi> that we will <hi>not once meddle</hi> with that which <hi>hurts</hi> us; but let <hi>miserie alone;</hi> and apply our selves wholly to do those things, wherein our <hi>only true happiness</hi> must needs <hi>Consist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us put a <hi>third Emphasis</hi> upon the <hi>keeping of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">III.</note> 
                  <hi>his Commandments,</hi> as that relates in this place to the supposed <hi>Love</hi> we bear him. And let this our <hi>third Emphasis</hi> be <hi>subdivided</hi> into <hi>three.</hi> For it will easily afford us a <hi>threefold Importance</hi> of the words, and thence will follow a <hi>threefold Inference.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, the words may be <hi>thus</hi> pronounced. If<note place="margin">1.</note> ye <hi>love</hi> me, if ye have any the least <hi>affection,</hi> or <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> for me, do so much as <hi>observe</hi> what I have <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi> you to <hi>Perform.</hi> And this is as if the words were spoken in the <hi>Optative mood.</hi> O that ye were <hi>wise!</hi> that ye <hi>knew those things which do belong unto your Peace!</hi> that ye would but <hi>so</hi> love me, as to <hi>keep my Commandments!</hi> from which <hi>Acception</hi> of the words the <hi>Inference</hi> certainly must be this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56118:8"/>That the best <hi>Instance</hi> and <hi>Expression</hi> of <hi>our</hi> Love to <hi>Christ,</hi> is to <hi>do</hi> those things which he <hi>Injoyns</hi> us.</p>
               <p>Or else the words may be accented <hi>thus,</hi> (as<note place="margin">2.</note> if <hi>indicatively</hi> spoken, and by way of <hi>Asseveration,</hi>) If ye love me in <hi>good earnest,</hi> not in <hi>word,</hi> but in <hi>Reality,</hi> If ye affect me from the <hi>Heart,</hi> and not from the <hi>Teeth-outwards,</hi> ye will be <hi>sure</hi> to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I Command you. Your obedience <hi>then</hi> will be <hi>infallible;</hi> I shall not <hi>miss</hi> of its <hi>Emanations.</hi> And hence ariseth this other Inference,</p>
               <p>That <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> in a <hi>Christian</hi> are two <hi>inseparable</hi> Companions; every whit as <hi>inseparable,</hi> as <hi>Hippoclides</hi> and <hi>Polystratus;</hi> or as the <hi>Parent</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the <hi>Child;</hi> the <hi>Cause,</hi> and the <hi>effect;</hi> or whatsoever else they are which are <hi>Relata secundum esse,</hi> whereof the <hi>one</hi> does of necessity infer the <hi>other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or the words may be read, and expounded<note place="margin">3.</note> 
                  <hi>thus,</hi> (as being in the <hi>Imperative mood;</hi>) If ye love me, <hi>be sure</hi> ye keep my Commandments; make it <hi>evident</hi> that ye love me; give me the <hi>Proof</hi> of your Affection, by <hi>doing</hi> that which I <hi>require.</hi> No other <hi>Love</hi> will I <hi>accept,</hi> than what does prove its own Truth by the constant <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of my <hi>Commandments.</hi> From which <hi>Acception</hi> of the words the <hi>Inference</hi> cannot but be <hi>This,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That our <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Precepts</hi> of Jesus Christ, is the <hi>only warrantable Touchstone,</hi> whereby to <hi>try</hi> and <hi>examin</hi> the love we bear unto his <hi>Person.</hi>

Where the servant that said, he <hi>would not go, but went,</hi> is more justified than the other, who said <hi>he would,</hi> but <hi>went not.</hi> Our Saviour's <hi>flatterers</hi> then are they, who make <hi>Profession</hi> of their Love; who give him very <hi>good words;</hi> who in their <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Predications</hi> breath out nothing less than <hi>kindness,</hi> and <hi>Admiration;</hi> but not proceeding any farther, than the bare <hi>wording,</hi> and <hi>professing,</hi> and <hi>breathing out</hi> of their Affection, they cannot challenge a better <hi>character<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

than that <hi>they love him from the teeth outwards,</hi> and this because their <hi>Expressions</hi> are meerly <hi>verbal.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Friends</hi> of Christ are they, who add the <hi>Proof</hi> of Love to the due Profession; study to <hi>live</hi> by his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> and in <hi>obedience</hi> to his <hi>Commands;</hi> espowse a <hi>Fellowship</hi> with his <hi>Death,</hi> and a <hi>conformity</hi> to his <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> are rather for <hi>Christ,</hi> though at the <hi>Barr,</hi> than for a <hi>Pilate,</hi> though on the <hi>Bench;</hi> very much rather for the <hi>oppressed,</hi> than for the <hi>persecuting</hi> side.

we shall incessantly cast about, which way to <hi>please</hi> him; and frame the <hi>course</hi> of our <hi>Lives</hi> to what we think <hi>He loves best.</hi> We shall <hi>strive</hi> and <hi>contend</hi> after the <hi>knowledge</hi> of his Will, with <hi>this</hi> intent only, that we may <hi>do</hi> it.

               <p>I do not doubt but 'twill be easily agreed by <hi>all,</hi> that men are apt to be <hi>mistaken</hi> in the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of their <hi>Affections,</hi> and that by consequence it concerns them to make a Tryal, whether their <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> are <hi>right,</hi> or <hi>wrong.</hi> All the difficulty will be, how to agree upon the <hi>Touch-stone</hi> by which the <hi>Tryal</hi> is to be made.

                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.</note> that we may <hi>obtain.

It must be shew'd in a <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious</hi> and <hi>working</hi> Love, a Love exhibited to <hi>Christ,</hi> by being employ'd upon his <hi>Members.</hi> The Love of Christ, if it is <hi>true,</hi> will be <hi>shew'd</hi> in this, that instead of being <hi>idle,</hi> or <hi>empty-handed,</hi> it hath its <hi>work</hi> and its <hi>labour,</hi> is ever <hi>diligent,</hi> and <hi>industrious</hi> in the <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Commands.</hi> Lastly, the <hi>promises</hi> are not <hi>inherited</hi> through <hi>Faith alone,</hi> (which S. <hi>Iames</hi> calls a <hi>dead,</hi> and a <hi>worthless</hi> Faith,) but through <hi>Faith</hi> mixt with <hi>patience,</hi> which is not a <hi>barren,</hi> but a <hi>fruitful,</hi> not an <hi>idle,</hi> but <hi>working</hi> Faith.

               <p>It were easie for me to <hi>argue</hi> from a very great number of such like <hi>Topicks,</hi> of which the old and new Testament afford much plenty.

                  </hi> It concerns us therefore extreamly to make a strict examination, whether we find within our selves such a <hi>sincere love</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as does not only shew it self in our <hi>mouths,</hi> and <hi>fancies,</hi> but especially in our <hi>Hearts</hi> and our <hi>Conversations.</hi> Such a love as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with it a ready <hi>obedience</hi> to his <hi>Commands,</hi> and does by consequence amount unto the <hi>whole Duty of Man.</hi> It being so natural for a <hi>Lover,</hi> to seek the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,</hi> or <hi>pleasure,</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> of his <hi>Beloved,</hi> by doing that which he <hi>desires,</hi> that <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>love, disobedience</hi> and <hi>hatred,</hi> are <hi>promiscuously</hi> used in holy Scripture.

               </p>
               <p>In which words of our Saviour, there are two things <hi>suppos'd,</hi> and a third is <hi>Taught.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First of all it is <hi>suppos'd,</hi> that All to whom the words are spoken, either <hi>are,</hi> or <hi>ought</hi> to be Christs Disciples. And that not only in <hi>profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> but in <hi>singleness</hi> of <hi>heart;</hi> not only <hi>verbally,</hi> and by <hi>name,</hi> but very <hi>really</hi> such. This is easily collected from three words in the Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Ye are my Disciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is secondly <hi>suppos'd,</hi> that such as are <hi>really</hi> Christs Disciples, (not in hypocrisy, but in deed,) ought to endeavour to make <hi>it known to all THE WORLD,</hi> that they are <hi>such.</hi> Their <hi>light must shine before men,</hi> by their <hi>Procope</hi> and <hi>Growth</hi> in the <hi>SCHOOL</hi> of Christ. This is apparent from two words more, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>All men shall know it.</hi> And were it not so in good earnest, the Master would never have directed them (as here he does) to the infallible means of it's attainment. For</p>
               <p>We are thirdly to observe the important <hi>Lesson</hi> which here is <hi>Taught,</hi> (and which is <hi>now</hi> of all
<pb facs="tcp:56118:76"/>
Lessons the most worth learning, especially if we reflect on the Times we live in,) by what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>way of proof,</hi> we may make men to <hi>know</hi> we are Christs Disciples. This is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>last</hi> words of the Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they shall know it <hi>even by this,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>If ye bear love to one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From these three parts there are as many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, into which the whole Text is very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally resolv'd.</p>
               <p>That all who are <hi>Auditors</hi> of Christ, or all to<note place="margin">1.</note> whom he is <hi>reveal'd,</hi> do stand oblig'd by that means, to be <hi>really his Disciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That their Discipleship, if it be <hi>real,</hi> will be<note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>eminent also,</hi> and <hi>exemplary,</hi> so far forth as to be <hi>known,</hi> and taken notice of by <hi>All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the surest <hi>Testimony</hi> and <hi>Proof</hi> of sincere<note place="margin">3.</note> Discipleship under Christ, and the principal <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> or <hi>effect</hi> wherein its eminence doth consist, and that which by Christ is here pronounced as an <hi>unerrable mark</hi> or <hi>Criterion</hi> of it, is this Divine Qualification of <hi>mutual Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this alone must be the Subject upon which I am to fasten the following part of my Design; because it seems to comprehend (I say not only the <hi>prime,</hi> but) <hi>whole</hi> Importance of the Text; as we may judge by comparing the <hi>proposition,</hi> with the <hi>fourfold Emphasis</hi> which may be put upon the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56118:76"/>For first our Saviour does not say, Men shall <hi>guess</hi> or <hi>conjecture</hi> that ye are mine, but <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, they shall <hi>know</hi> it. Nor secondly does he say, Your Discipleship shall be known as a special <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi> to very <hi>few,</hi> but as the Sun in his <hi>Meridian;</hi>

Thou shalt love thy God with all thy Heart, And thy Neighbour as thy self.</hi> On these two <hi>Hinges</hi> the very <hi>Door</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>turn.</hi> For on these two Precepts <hi>hang all the Law and the Prophets,</hi> (Matt. 22. 40.)

the <hi>Love</hi> which we bear to <hi>God.</hi> Observe the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, by which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> argues both backwards and forwards. <hi>By this we know we love the Children of God, when we love God, and keep his Commandments,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 2.

In the Negative thus; <hi>He that loveth not his Brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?</hi> 1 John 4. 10. <hi>He that shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up his Bowels of Compassion from his brother, how dwelleth the Love of God in him?</hi> 1 John 3. 17. Again he argues it in the Affirmative. <hi>We know that we have passed from death unto life, if we love the brethren,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 1, 4. <hi>Hereby we know we are of the Truth, and have Confidence towards God, if we keep his Commandments: And this is his Commandment, that we love one another</hi> (v. 19. to v. 23.)</p>

Hence we see it is evident, There is not a clearer Demonstration of our <hi>loving God</hi> with all our <hi>hearts,</hi> than the loving our <hi>Neighbour</hi> as <hi>our selves.</hi> From whence it follows, that every <hi>sin</hi> must needs ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue some <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi> For if against the first Table, it is through a <hi>want</hi> of some <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> And if against the second, it must needs be for <hi>want</hi> of some <hi>love</hi> to <hi>Men.</hi> Again, it follows on the contrary, that where <hi>Love</hi> is perfect and entire, no Commandment can be broken. For, <hi>loving God with all our hearts,</hi> we shall keep the <hi>first</hi> Table; and <hi>loving our Neighbour as our selves,</hi> we shall not fail to keep the <hi>second.</hi>
